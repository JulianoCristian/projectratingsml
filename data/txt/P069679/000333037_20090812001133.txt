F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The goal of the Private and Public Sector Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) is: (a) to
provide the required technical assistance (TA) to implement the policy measures which
will be supported by the Private Sector Adjustment Loan II (PSAL II); and (b) to lay the
ground for the reforms that will be implemented under the proposed Programmatic
Adjustment Loan (PAL), formerly the Institutional and Governance Reform Structural
Adjustment Loan. The PPIBL is a follow-on operation that will continue to provide the
needed TA that began under the first Private Sector Institution Building Loan (PIBL) of
which its entire amount is almost fully committed. The PPIBL is a natural continuation of
the PIBL. The PPIBL will provide a small amount of funding to complete few remaining
private sector actions while targeting the majority of the project resources to energy and
public sector reforms. In this sense, it aims to achieve the following objectives: (i) a
competitive financial sector predicated on the restructuring and privatization of state-
owned banks, development of securities markets, and improvements in legal, regulatory
and institutional support structures; (ii) enhancement of the private sector's role in the
economy through the privatization of state-owned assets; (iii) a more efficient and
service-oriented energy sector based on needed restructuring and privatization of key
industries, introduction of a sound regulatory framework, reduction in arrears, and
clarification of new tariff schemes to achieve cost recovery; (iv) a competitive private
sector based on the creation of an environment conducive to private sector growth and
development; (v) a more responsive, transparent and accountable public sector; and (vi)
adoption of critical measures to provide social protection during the adjustment period
and to establish effective poverty reduction mechanisms.

  I.    Project Development Objectives used in this ICR
  The ICR evaluates the Project against: (i) whether the Project provided or not the
required technical assistance (TA) to achieve the high level policy objectives contained in
the PDO; and (ii) the extent to which the assistance provided contributed (a) to
implementing the policy measures supported by the PSAL2 and (b) to laying the ground
for the reforms implemented under the PAL (whether they contributed to specific PAL
benchmarks or to deepening and/or broadening the Government reform program in the
policy areas included in the PDO, but not necessarily reflected by specific PAL
benchmarks).

  The ICR does not evaluate the Project against the high-level policy objectives (i)-(vi)
included in the PDO (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3) as the Project cannot be alone accountable
for the achievement of the outcomes envisioned by the PSAL 2 and PAL operations.
However, the ICR provides an assessment on these policy reforms in Section 3.2 and
Annex 2 for reference based on the evaluations made in the ICRs for PSAL2 and PALs
and other more recent work undertaken by the Bank in the relevant policy areas.
However, the ICR does not assess the provision of assistance in policy area (vi) because
the PAD nor the loan agreement did not envision any funding for it under the PPIBL.

  II.   Changes during the implementation and their impact on the Project
  The need for TA at the time of appraisal seemed almost limitless and the PPIBL had a
broad mandate to contribute to a wide-range of high-level reform outcomes. The Project
was initiated at a time of high commitment to reform, mainly led by the objective to
facilitate the accession of Romania to the EU. However three developments affected the
PPIBL and caused it to take a different track: (i) the PAL series preparation and
implementation was delayed; (ii) other sources of funding, mostly grants, were made
available to support the same PDO; and (iii) once the accession of Romania to the EU
was assured, the PAL series was dropped and appetite for reforms decreased.

  The combined effect of these developments had three major impacts on the Project
implementation:
  (i)   The activities under Parts (components) A (Financial Sector Restructuring), B
(Privatization Support for Enterprises), C (Privatization Support for Energy Sector) and D
(Business Environment) (except for minor activities under A and D) were undertaken by
alternative sources of funding, including the PIBL, Dutch Grants (TF050477 and
TF054658) and EU resources.
  (ii) While upon the approval of the PAL the implementation of activities under Part E
(Institutional Governance Reform) started with a delay and progressed slowly, the
Ministry of Public Finance (MOPF) was engaging to reforming the public expenditure
management both by including budget formulations reforms, but also budget execution
strengthening measures. Among these, cash management became a first priority and all
available loan funds (first the PIBL, then the PPIBL) were directed for this priority. Even
though the PAD envisioned financing of goods at about 30% of the Loan, the emphasis of
the PPIBL shifted from a TA operation supporting policy reforms towards a more likely
investment operation as the MOPF expanded the Treasury modernization beyond what
was envisioned in the PAD and about half of the PPIBL financing was directed to goods
(that however included system development besides software and hardware). In 2005 the
demand for funds from different ministries did eventually exceed the available funds, but
nevertheless the Treasury modernization prevailed as the main activity under Part due to
the commitment of the MOPF.
  (iii) Once the accession of Romania to the EU was assured, the PAL series was
dropped, reform fatigue set in and the Project outcomes were affected negatively as the
TA outputs were not used to the extent possible. Some PPIBL funds were put to
alternative (good) uses, such as the provision of background studies and TA for other
projects (tax administration reform, environment.

  III. Evaluation approach in the ICR
  The ICR evaluates the results of the Project activities irrespective of the source of
financing. The Project refers to the original activities of the PPIBL, as defined in the
PAD, and the new activities added through loan amendments. In addition to the PPIBL,
these activities were financed by the earlier TA loan or the PIBL, the Dutch TF050477
linked to the PPIBL, the Dutch TF054659 linked to the PAL, as well as the EU (and
some other sources) (Sections 1.7 and 2). As a result of the above approach, the ICR also
evaluates the activities under Parts A, B, C and D funded by the PIBL and the activities
funded for Part E under the Dutch Grants. Separate completion reports have been



                                             iv

prepared on the PIBL and the Dutch Grants. The approach to assess results - not only
based on what was financed by the PPIBL, but based on the original objectives and
targets - was chosen based on the ICR guidelines of the OPCS since neither the PDO nor
the targets of the Romania PPIBL have been formally revised to reflect the de-facto
significant changes in the PDO, design and project financing.

  IV. The Result Framework
  During the last year of supervision, the indicators in the result framework were
retrofitted: (i) to reflect changes made during the implementation that were not
formalized through formal restructuring; and (ii) to more comprehensively represent the
original PDO (including the high level policy objectives included in the PDO) and
activities described in the PAD. The retrofitting helped to address problems contained in
the original result framework.

  Since the ICR does not evaluate the Project against the high-level policy objectives
included in the PDO (see paragraph I), the related PDO indicators defined in the last ISR
are provided in Annex 10 for reference. The below PDO indicators were designed,
instead, to help in assessing the PDO against which the Project was evaluated.

  Guide to the Results Framework
  The definitions in the PDO indicator table have the following meaning:
  (i)   Parts A-F refer to the different components, as follows:
  Part A: Financial Sector Restructuring and Privatization Support
  Part B: Privatization Support for State-Owned Enterprises
  Part C: Privatization Support for the Energy Sector
  Part D: Support for an Improved Business Environment
  Part E: Institutional and Governance Reform
  Part F: Project Management Unit
  (ii) Formally Revised Target Values are NA because the changes made during the
implementation were not formalized through appropriate restructuring.
  (iii) Original Target Values, as defined in the below result framework, were not
provided in the PAD nor in the loan amendments. They were developed for the purpose
of providing more information about whether the TA was provided or not and about the
extent. They refer to the total number of PSAL2 conditions/PAL benchmarks under the
objective area where the Project provided actually TA.
  (iv) Actual Value refers to the number of TA outputs that contributed to (a)
implementing the policy measures supported by the PSAL2 and/or (b) and (b) to laying
the ground for the reforms implemented under the PAL and PAL (whether they
contributed to specific PAL benchmarks or to deepening and/or broadening the
Government reform program in the policy areas included in the PDO, but not necessarily
reflected by specific PAL benchmarks). Section 3.2 provides more information.

  The definitions in the Intermediate Outcome indicator table have the following
meaning:
  (i)   Part in the definition of Indicators refers to components and various sub-
components. See Section 3.2 and Annex 2.



                                             v

  (ii) Original Target Values summarize the activities and outputs included in the PAD
or loan amendments.
  (iii) The references in parentheses in the Actual Value Achieved column refer to the
funding source. Annex 2 provides more information.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not formally revised. The key indicators were refined (see Section 2.3)
during the last supervision missions through an aide memoire.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design1

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country background. A few years before the appraisal of the Private and Public
Institution Building Loan (PPIBL), the Romanian economy had begun growing again,
reaching a real GDP growth rate of 5.3% in 2001. However, the way in which it was
being financed led to growing macroeconomic imbalances, including a rising current
account deficit. In 2000 the Government of Romania (GOR) defined a bold economic
reform strategy to sustain the economic recovery and keep the country on a sustainable
growth path. The strategy was consistent with Romania's quest to accelerate its
integration to the European Union (EU).

Banking sector privatization and financial sector development. The GOR had been
implementing an ambitious banking sector privatization and restructuring program since
1999 to end the public sector banking so as to eliminate it as a source of financing of
loss-making state owned enterprises (SOEs) and to build a more competitive financial
sector. The GOR planned to complete the privatization of the two remaining state
commercial banks ­ the BCR and the CEC - (about 42% of the banking sector assets);
strengthen the legal and regulatory framework; enhance banking sector infrastructure (i.e.
payment systems, accounting and auditing framework); improve the functioning of the
Government securities market; develop the capital markets for debt and equity
instruments under proper supervision; and develop the Insurance Supervision
Commission.

Enterprise sector divestiture. Likewise, since 1999, the GOR had privatized or
liquidated a range of SOEs and closed down non-viable and environmentally damaging
mines. These reforms aimed at cutting arrears of SOEs to utilities, other commercial
creditors, and the budget; reducing high fiscal and quasi fiscal costs of supporting loss-
makers; improving efficiency of large industrial enterprises; and increasing the level of
new direct investment and new owners, thus stabilizing the economy and providing a
more fair environment for private sector growth. Yet there were still about 600 SOEs in
early 2001 to be privatized in the manufacturing sector from the more than 7500 SOEs
back in 1992. The private sector share of GDP was 69.1 % in 2002. The GOR's intended
to complete divestiture of the state portfolio in the manufacturing sector and to move
towards second wave of privatizations/restructurings in the utility sectors (energy,
mining, transport).

Utilities sector reform. Utility companies had long suffered from low tariffs and poor
payment discipline, resulting in the build-up of arrears and cross subsidies to inefficient
state owned enterprises. The GOR intended to reduce the quasi-fiscal activities of energy
utilities by carrying out a major reform of the electricity, oil and gas sectors that would
introduce a modern legal, regulatory and institutional framework to: (i) encourage
competition, efficiency, reliable service, fair pricing, and proper regulatory oversight; and



1The length of the ICR is justified by the number of financing sources, complexity of the design and the policy objectives included in
the PDO that call for discussion of the policy reforms.



                                                                  1

(ii) to enhance the independence and strengthen the institutional capacity of the
regulatory agencies.

Business environment. The Romanian business environment was characterized2 by
macroeconomic instability, uncertainty about regulatory policies, high tax rates and
administration, high cost and difficult access to financing, corruption, contract violations,
and anti-competitive practices. As result, Romania did not compare well among the
Central and Eastern European countries either in the private sector output as % of GDP
(2nd lowest) and average foreign direct investment as % of GDP (2nd lowest). The GOR
planned further reforms to: remove barriers that impeded business development,
including for e-business; rationalize fiscal inspection; streamline the building permit
process; enforce corporate governance; advance tax reforms, including by the adoption of
e-taxation; and ensure wider use of the international accounting standards and more
efficient bankruptcy procedures.

Institutional and governance reform. The GOR was acutely aware of having to launch
reforms of the institutional, regulatory and governance framework to improve efficiency
and effectiveness of allocation of public funds and delivery of public services. Frequent
changes in legislation and weak institutional capacity had led to poor delivery of services
and an acute impact on the business environment and private sector development; the
public sector was perceived and experienced to be inefficient and poorly accountable at
the central and local levels; and the large quasi-fiscal deficits implied that public
resources were allocated in a non-programmed, discretionary manner during the budget
year. In addition to continuing structural reforms, the GOR therefore laid the basis for a
programmatic approach in 2000 to address these issues.

Rationale for Bank assistance. The PPIBL was a follow-on technical assistance (TA)
project designed to: (a) allow the completion of the activities remaining after the Private
Sector Institution Building Loan (PIBL; FY99) to support the Second Private Sector
Adjustment Loan (PSAL2; FY02); and (b) to support mainly energy and public sector
reforms under the planned Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL; FY05). The loan was
considered justified based on: (a) the positive experience in twinning an adjustment loan
(PSAL) and a TA loan (PIBL) that allowed timely availability of funds and appropriate
terms of reference, consistently designed to achieve the objectives of the policy reforms
agenda3; and (b) the Bank's extensive experience in complex reforms and strategic use of
TA. These operations reflected the GOR's priorities and constituted the key elements in
the FY02-04 CAS. The operations were linked to the GOR's continued progress in areas
where the IMF's 2001 standby agreement had highlighted the needs for reform and were
coordinated with the EU accession program.

3 The success of twinning the two projects attracted unanticipated donor funds - the Dutch TF050477 was approved in May 2002 and
linked to the PPIBL to support it. The second Dutch Grant TF054659 was approved in January 2005 to support the PAL.



                                                                   2

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (from Project
Appraisal Document)4
The goal of the Private and Public Sector Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) is: (a) to
provide the required technical assistance (TA) to implement the policy measures
which will be supported by the Private Sector Adjustment Loan II (PSAL II); and
(b) to lay the ground for the reforms that will be implemented under the proposed
Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL), formerly the Institutional and Governance
Reform Structural Adjustment Loan. The PPIBL is a follow-on operation that will
continue to provide the needed TA that began under the first Private Sector Institution
Building Loan (PIBL) of which its entire amount is almost fully committed. The PPIBL
is a natural continuation of the PIBL. The PPIBL will provide a small amount of funding
to complete few remaining private sector actions while targeting the majority of the
project resources to energy and public sector reforms. In this sense, it aims to achieve the
following objectives: (i) a competitive financial sector predicated on the restructuring and
privatization of state-owned banks, development of securities markets, and improvements
in legal, regulatory and institutional support structures; (ii) enhancement of the private
sector's role in the economy through the privatization of state-owned assets; (iii) a more
efficient and service-oriented energy sector based on needed restructuring and
privatization of key industries, introduction of a sound regulatory framework, reduction
in arrears, and clarification of new tariff schemes to achieve cost recovery; (iv) a
competitive private sector based on the creation of an environment conducive to private
sector growth and development; (v) a more responsive, transparent and accountable
public sector; and (vi) adoption of critical measures to provide social protection during
the adjustment period and to establish effective poverty reduction mechanisms.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not formally revised. The key indicators were refined (see Section 2.3)
during the last supervision missions through an aide memoire.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary target group included the Romanian economy as a whole, the private sector
and citizens more generally. Benefits of structural reforms in the enterprise and financial
sectors were enhanced prospects for growth and sustainability of macroeconomic
stabilization. Benefits of institutional and governance reforms were a more predictable
legal environment, more enforceable legal rights, streamlined administrative procedures
and a more transparent, accountable and responsive public administration.

  There are inconsistencies in the PDO between the PAD and the Loan Agreement. There are also inconsistencies in the key
indicators within the PAD. See Section 2.




                                                               3

Annexes 11, 12 and 13 contain information on the original secondary target groups and
additional secondary target groups in the public sector that were included through the
2004 and 2006 loan amendments (see Section 1.6).

1.5 Original Components
The Project consisted of the following six Parts (components) (see Annexes 11 and 12):

       Part A: Financial Sector Restructuring and Privatization Support
       Part B: Privatization Support for State-Owned Enterprises
       Part C: Privatization Support for the Energy Sector
       Part D: Support for an Improved Business Environment
       Part E:. Institutional and Governance Reform
       Part F: Project Management Unit (PMU)

1.6 Revised Components
The components were not revised, but some new activities were added under Parts D and
F and new sub-components were added under Part E. Two loan amendments were
approved by the Bank management (one in 2004 and 2006 each) to revise the original
components so as to reflect in them mainly the advancing and the deepening of the
programmed public sector reform (see Annex 13). The 2004 amendment expanded
support to: (a) the agreed PAL reform program that included a number of new activities
introduced since the initial design dating back 2002; (b) a new PAL PMU established in
the Prime-Minister's Chancellery in 2004 to monitor the preparation and implementation
of the PAL reform progress (its set-up in the Prime Minister's Chancellery was seen as an
insurance against political and implementation risks); and (c) some small new activities
under Part D. The 2006 amendment provided support to prepare two projects planned in
the FY06-09 CAS to deepen the public administration reform initiated under the PAL and
necessary for the EU accession process; one for the National Agency for Fiscal
Administration and the other for the Ministry of Environment. After the cancellation of
the PAL, there were no additions to the procurement plan.

These amendments were approved as minor changes by the Bank management.
Retrospectively, a restructuring would have been appropriate to formalize the significant
changes in the PDO, project design, as well as expenditure category and component costs,
They resulted from financing practically four of the six components under parallel
financing due to their overlapping objectives with those of the PPIBL (see Section 1.7).

1.7 Other significant changes
Changes in financing the components and activities and in their costs, as defined in
the PAD and in the subsequent loan amendments. The financing of the components
and activities defined in the PAD (referred to as "the Project") changed significantly
during the implementation. The changes that took place during the implementation were
not formalized appropriately through restructuring of the PPIBL. They resulted in about
$15 million of parallel foreign financing, including $10 million from the PIBL, $3
million from the Dutch Grant TF050477, $2.3 million from the Dutch Grant TF054659,




                                             4

and about $4 million of counterpart funding5 for the Project activities (see Annex 1)
(excluding the EU). See Section 2.2 for explanation of the factors that led to this.
In addition, the component costs, as far as financed by the PPIBL, changed significantly
between the appraisal and the completion (see Annex 1). The significant changes that
took place during the implementation were partially reflected in the reallocations of loan
proceeds between disbursement categories approved by the Bank management (see
below), but they were not formalized appropriately through restructuring of the PPIBL.
Thus, Part E accounted for 89% of the costs financed by the PPIBL (and the counterpart
funds) at completion compared to 55% of the baseline costs at appraisal. The cash
management sub-component (E.1.i.a) accounted for 57% of the Part E total costs (there
were no appraisal estimates available). Part F accounted for about 8% of the PPIBL
baseline costs (of which 61% for the PPIBL PMU, including audits, and 39% for the PAL
PMU) compared to the estimated 1% at appraisal (that represented the costs of the PPIBL
PMU for one year since the PIBL financed the rest)6. In addition to Parts E and F, the
PPIBL financed minor amounts under Part A (2% compared to the estimated 20%) and
Part D (0.6% compared to the estimated 9%). The PPIBL did not finance any activities
under Parts B and C. At completion $60,000 of the PPIBL was cancelled.

Changes in disbursements by expenditure categories under the PPIBL. The Bank
management approved a reallocation of loan proceeds in 2004 and 2008 from Consulting
Services and Civil Works to Goods and Incremental Operating Costs in response to the
request of the Borrower (see Annex 1)7. The reallocations were approved as minor
changes (instead of formalizing them appropriately by restructuring the PPIBL). They led
to significant changes in disbursements by expenditure category at completion.
Disbursements under the Incremental Operating Costs Category accounted for 699% and
Goods for 188% of the appraisal estimates. The nature of the PPIBL changed de facto
from a TAL to an investment loan due to the actual share of about 50% of infrastructure
investments of the PPIBL proceeds compared to 26% at appraisal.

The increase in disbursements under Goods was mainly in response to the MOPF's
request for supporting a move to a modern Treasury which was a priority of the MOPF8
as a critical tool to improve public expenditure management. The PPIBL PAD envisioned
primarily support to establish a connection between the Treasury and the interbank
payment system, using the Transfond, so as to improve cash management. The additional
investments that were made during the Project implementation were guided by the
MOPF's IT strategy from 2003 that was based on a number of recommendations from
numerous reviews and recommendations made by the donor community to realize the full
advantages afforded by implementation of a Treasury system9. One key input was the
PAL team's 2003 appraisal of the Romania's Treasury IT system and recommendations



5The amount of counterpart funding may include some counterpart funding for the PPIBL.
6Later the 2004 amendment provided for the financing of the PPIBL PMU for another three years in addition to providing for
financing of the costs of the PAL PMU.
7The amendments were cleared by the Bank's legal, loan and procurement or financial management departments.
8Aide-Memoire dated April 4, 2003
9 Romania: Public Sector Financial Management, 1998; Romania: Building Institutions for Public Expenditure Management:
Reforms, Efficiency and Equity, 2002; Romania: Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2003). By 2003 the EU was
launching a multi-million dollar TA project for Treasury modernization, including support for designing the MOPF's IT strategy.



                                                                5

with the initial cost estimates of $14 million (without taxes) for further modernizing the
Treasury system (see Section 2.2). This appraisal (and the subsequent 2003 Country
Financial Accountability Assessment, CFAA) proposed to upgrade the existing IT&C
infrastructure and the systems to improve Treasury operations (which in turn improved
cash management) instead of implementing an integrated package software. The reason
for this strategy was that the Romanian Treasury already had several functional
applications in place to support their functional processes and a very costly ministerial
project would have been needed to replace these with an integrated package. The Bank
IT/Treasury specialists recommended that the Treasury start by establishing a connection
to the Transfond, the interbank payment system, and a debt management system as a
short term measure to achieve some quick wins. As a longer term strategy, the Bank
specialists proposed that the Treasury develop an integrated public financial management
system, including a centralized and real-time public accounting ledger, public contracts
central database, integrated budgetary credit management workflow, central data
warehouse, and public finance portal. These recommendations were incorporated into the
MOPF's IT strategy from 2003 and over time were supported under the PIBL and PPIBL
based on the MOFP's requests. The strategy aimed at improving the shortcomings in the
budget execution, and fell under the overall objectives of the PPIBL of improving public
expenditure management, reducing arrears and improving the quality and delivery of
public services.

Changes in the implementation schedule of the PPIBL. Implementation of the PPIBL
started with a 2-year delay as a result of: (a) delays in preparing the PAL due to delays in
completing the PSAL2 that led to delayed effectiveness of the PPIBL; (b) the GOR's
request and the Bank's agreement to disburse other ongoing loans and grants to finance
the PPIBL activities before or instead of the PPIBL (see above and Annex 14); and (c)
delays in implementing some overlapping activities under the PIBL which the PPIBL was
designed to continue (Treasury modernization). After the implementation had started, the
Bank management approved extension of the closing date three times for three and a half
years in total for the following reasons: (a) on December 20, 2004, an extension was
granted for two years until June 30, 2007 to allow implementation of the activities that
had been identified with a delay under Part E to support the PAL; (b) on August 21, 2006,
an extension was granted for one year until June 30, 2008 to enable the Borrower to
utilize all the funds under the Loan for new activities that had been identified earlier to
support the PAL under Part E10; and (c) on February 25, 2008, an extension was granted
for six months until December 31, 2008 to enable implementation of the last contracts
that were undergoing long procurement process under Part E.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of the background analysis. Significant background analysis was done in
the context of the adjustment loans that the PPIBL was designed to support. The sound,



10The extension notification indicated this was an exception to the closing date policy since then the closing dates were not extended
to complete new actions proposed to be added after a project mid-term review.



                                                                   6

extensive and high quality analysis11 identified the key sub-sectoral issues and
institutional constraints and helped develop programmatic reforms. However, not equal
analysis was done for identifying the specific TA activities and their expected
contribution toward achieving the policy reform objectives (see below). The lessons
about the importance of good PMU arrangements mitigated the risks from inadequate
capacity of the beneficiaries through efficient administration of the large and complex TA
by the PPIBL PMU. The lessons about the best practice privatizations led to provision of
investment banks advisory services and introduced greater transparency to the process.
Finally, the lessons from addressing the financial and private sector and public sector
reforms together helped address the interlinked issues in these sectors.

The rationale for twinning a policy reform loan with a TA loan, when expertise for
reform implementation was needed, had been tested with successful outcomes in
Romania (i.e. PSAL-PIBL). However, despite the recognized weak reform
implementation capacity of the GOR, there was no clear rationale for incorporating Parts
A-D under the PPIBL since, at the time of the approval of the PPIBL, the PIBL had
unused funds for similar activities and the Dutch Government granted funds for some
similar activities, as well (albeit unexpectedly)12. New TA for Part E was justified
because the public sector reform agenda was expected to grow substantially under the
PAL. The effectiveness delay of the PPIBL and the overlapping designs of the PIBL and
the grants and the GOR's preference to use first them delayed the start of disbursements
under the PPIBL but did not affect the outcomes that were overall substantially achieved
under all Parts with the help of the parallel financing.

Assessment of the project design. The PDO was inconsistent within the PAD and
between the PAD and the Loan Agreement; and the PDO in the PAD included low and
high level PDOs and gave the impression that the PPIBL is accountable for the high level
PDOs ("More specifically, it aims to achieve to the following objectives: (i)...(vi)"). The
PPIBL cannot however be held accountable for the high level PDOs that, as such, were
clear and important for the country and the Bank, and their ambitious agenda was
justified based on the previous experience in implementing structural reforms. In
particular, it is not clear why the high level PDO (vi) (social protection) was discussed in
the PAD and included in the PDO in the PAD since no activities were planned for it
under the PPIBL. The lower level PDO ("TA to implement the PSAL2 policy measures
and to lay the ground for PAL reforms") indicated different levels of accountability but
was realistic.

All original components of the PPIBL were reasonably linked to the lower level TA
objectives except for two: (i) Part C included some activities already financed by the
PIBL; and (ii) Part D included a number of different activities that were unrelated to each



11See the PSAL2 and PAL ICRs (a QAG review conducted in 2005 gave a best practice rating for the Quality at Entry of the PAL1).
Other analyses were done in addition to those listed in the PAL1 ICR, such as the Public Sector Financial Management Review (1998),
Implementation of the Comprehensive Development Framework Principles in a Transition Economy, Fiscal Transparency ROSC
(2002), Romania Public Finance Project Assessment (2002) to identify the strategic elements and implementation plan of the MOPF
IT&C strategy, Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2003), Restructuring for EU Integration ­ the Policy Agenda (2004).
12Interestingly, in 2001 the PIBL was fully committed, but as the privatization commitments were funded by the GOR, the PIBL
accumulated unused resources by 2002.

other and not directly linked to the policy programs. In the end, Part C was financed by
parallel financing and outcomes were not affected, while Part D results were only modest,
since spreading resources between so many different purposes contributed to reducing the
development effectiveness. As the component design followed the complexity of the
policy programs, it led to high complexity that was a factor in delaying implementation
of the Project despite the efficient PMU arrangements. Other factors included the high
number of agencies involved in the implementation of the reform programs (and the
ambitious high level PDOs), their limited institutional capacity and readiness to embark
in the reform program and, in particular, their limited or even absent experience with the
Bank's projects coupled with the need for coordinated intergovernmental efforts. Finally,
it was unrealistic to expect that the original 3-year implementation period would be
sufficient for a complex TA loan that supported ambitious reforms.

Adequacy of Government commitment. The GOR was fully committed to the
ambitious program of structural and institutional reforms supported by the Project
because they were anchored in the EU accession, a priority of the GOR. The
commitments to the EU related to adoption of the acquis to "close" the negotiating
chapters, but also to the overall need to achieve the status of a functioning market
economy, a precondition for the accession. The GOR's commitment was demonstrated
by the successful implementation of the PSAL1/PIBL program, eventual completion of
the Board actions of the PSAL2 with a timetable for subsequent actions under the PAL
program and establishment of a high-level PMU within the Chancellery of the Prime
Minister in 2005.

Assessment of risks. The estimated risks were relevant, but some of them could have
been higher or they could have included more risks. Due to the PPIBL's linkage to the
ambitious policy reforms, the risk rating of the GOR's commitment could have been
higher despite the demonstrated commitment at appraisal. The risks could also have
included poor market conditions that affected the privatization activities and led to
changes in the funding of the PPIBL's activities (see Section 1.7), as well as the weak
institutional capacity of the new beneficiaries under Part E for implementing and
absorbing the TA that affected the implementation pace. Most importantly, the mitigation
measures did not have alternative measures to help strengthen the results of the TA
interventions in the possible absence of the leverage provided by a policy loan. This risk
materialized and reduced some outcomes under Part E (see Section 2.2).

No Quality at Entry assessments was carried out on the PPIBL. A Country Lending
Assessment from 2004 gave an overall unsatisfactory rating to the PPIBL. The specific
ratings were: moderately unsatisfactory rating for strategic relevance (especially for
appropriateness of scope in the context of the CAS framework, clarity of the PDO
definition and its consistency with the result framework, relevance to Romania's
strategies and adequacy of country and sector knowledge underpinning the project);
unsatisfactory ratings for design (especially for use of lessons, implementation readiness
at approval, adequacy of capacity assessments of project beneficiaries and
appropriateness of monitoring project implementation and reviewing progress with the
Borrower), implementation (especially for quality of Bank identification, assessment and



                                               8

resolution of problems, quality of Bank actions and follow-up, performance and progress
monitoring, and realism and quality of project's performance reporting and risk rating)
and Bank inputs and process (especially for quality of engagement of the project with
strategic country clients and key counterparts); and satisfactory rating for participation
and partnerships.

Some criticism is valid (i.e. the M&E issues; adequacy of capacity assessments;
weakness in the Bank supervision; relevance for a new TA loan). Based on the
information at completion on the results achieved, some other criticism is not valid any
more. Namely, the QAG assessed the project when the PPIBL was not active and other
funds were used to finance its activities, while the ICR has the opportunity to take a
holistic view on the results. Thus, all components, as described in the PAD, achieved
their objectives on the average substantially irrespective of the source of funding. In
addition, the Bank increased efforts to remedy the earlier slow progress and lack of
proactivity towards the end of the Project.

2.2 Implementation

Factors generally subject to government control

Availability of parallel financing. Availability of parallel financing affected negatively
the implementation of the PPIBL but it did not affect its outcomes that were achieved on
the average substantially under the parallel financing. There were several reasons for
availability of the parallel financing (see Annex 14). First, the Dutch Government offered
the first grant (TF050477) to support the policy reforms unexpectedly in early 2002 under
a tight deadline. Due to this, the GOR and the Bank agreed that some of the activities
appraised under the PPIBL be financed under the grant (and that the PPIBL finance
activities to be identified under the PAL). The GOR also preferred to disburse grant funds
first as they were "cheaper" and they had a more limited implementation period. The
grant was later amended to support public sector activities and extended until May 2006
in response to the GOR's request; this affected Parts A, D and E. Second, the GOR
requested and the Bank agreed that the PIBL be drawn down first for similar activities,
given their similar design, prior to utilization of the PPIBL and that PIBL be extended
January 200513; this affected Parts A, B, C and D. Third, the Dutch Government awarded
the second grant (TF054659) in early 2005 to assist the PAL program (together with the
PPIBL) and extended it until December 2007; this affected Part E. Fourth, the EU
accession process attracted massive amount of capital inflows to Romania as foreign
investment and privatization receipts and strengthened the growth so that the PPIBL
financing lost its attraction and Project financing changed significantly. Often
beneficiaries requested funds from several sources, including the PPIBL, and as the
requested EU grant funds were approved in due time, the PPIBL financing was cancelled.




13The PIBL was originally expected to close in June 2002, but it was extended until January 2005. It was fully committed yet in 2001
but as some of the privatization commitments made under the PIBL were cancelled due to the GOR's decision to use its own funds for
financing them, the PIBL had unused resources available in 2002 for similar activities as the PPIBL (the PPIBL was designed to
complete the activities launched under the PIBL to support the PSAL2).



                                                                 9

These factors affected the implementation of the PPIBL negatively and positively: (i)
Parts A-D were financed by the parallel financiers except for minor amounts under Parts
A and D; (ii) therefore disbursements under the PPIBL did not start until late 2004; and
(iii) the availability of unused funds under the PPIBL allowed to widen and deepen the
TA under Part E (i.e. cash management, tax administration, environment; see Sections
1.6 and 1.7).

The subsequent availability of unused funds under the PPIBL led to substantial results, in
particular, under the "cash management" (the Treasury modernization) sub-component.
The difference in the actual costs ($25 million of foreign financing) and the estimate ($14
million without taxes) is explained by the fact that the actual work done under the Project
went beyond what was defined in the PAD. The items financed by the Project were
broadly in line with the items in the estimate provided by the Bank's PAL team (except
that the contracts data base was not implemented), but the intervention in the area of the
clearing system went beyond establishing the connection to the interbank clearing
system, as envisaged in the PAD, to modernize this system and the other interventions
resulted in a more extensive renovation/ upgrade of the IT infrastructure ( i.e.
replacement of servers, work stations etc.) than envisaged in the Bank's PAL team's cost
estimates (see Section 1.7). Ultimately, these changes resulted in substantial
improvements in speed, volume, controls and forecasts in Treasury operations and
communication (see Section 3.2. and Annex 2).

Government's commitment to policy reforms during pre and post-EU-accession14.
The EU accession context affected the implementation and outcomes of the Project, as
defined in the PAD, both negatively and positively. On one hand, prior to accession, the
Project (initially financed mainly by parallel financiers) performed well in its support of
the reform agenda - first under the PSAL2 and, then after an initial delay, under the PAL
that was anchored in the EU accession (a priority of the GOR). In addition to the reasons
explained above, the initial delay in starting disbursements under the PPIBL resulted
from the longer than anticipated preparation of the PAL1 that had started in 2002 and
slowed down in 2003 but was overcome as the new 2004 Government reconfirmed the
EU accession as its priority and adopted the PAL program as its own. Consequently, Part
E under the PPIBL was expanded in scope to support the agreed PAL agenda and
disbursements started (albeit with a delay, in 2005 and increasingly in 2006). On the
other hand, as prospects for the EU accession firmed and after it had happened, the
GOR's determination to advance reforms waned. The Bank suspended further work
under the PAL in January 2007, following the lack of response from the GOR to the
Bank's invitation to negotiate the PAL 2 in mid-2006. Subsequently, in the pre-accession
context, the results of the Project interventions under Part E were undermined because the
GOR was not motivated to implement the policy recommendations prepared under the
Project and the Project had no leverage in the absence of the PAL. This factor affected,
for example, the outcomes under the overall public expenditure management reform, civil
services reform, judicial reform and education financing reform under Part E.



14Romania started accession negotiations in February 2000; it signed the Accession Treaty in April 2005 with the joining date stated
as January 1, 2007; and in September 2006 the EU recommended confirming joining, as scheduled.



                                                                10

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control

Management effectiveness. Good performance of both the PAL PMU and PPIBL PMU
helped implement the ambitious and complex policy and TA program satisfactorily and
mitigate the lack of capacity in the beneficiary agencies and thus affected the
implementation positively. The existence of the PAL PMU also strengthened the strategic
relevance of the TA as it decided the TA interventions together with the PAL team15.

Implementation delays (loan extensions)

The PAD envisioned an unrealistic implementation period (3 years). It did not consider:
(i) the risk of delays in preparing a complex policy program; (ii) the risk of low
procurement and project management capacity of the beneficiaries; and (iii) the emerging
agenda in modernizing the Treasury system. Thus, in addition to all the above factors, the
PPIBL implementation delays resulted from the decision to finance the MOPF's IT
strategy that aimed at building an integrated public financial management system based
on the input from the donors, including the Bank (see Section 1.7). The PAD envisioned
investments in a short-term measure (connection to the interbank payment system) while
the Project eventually began to support the longer term project for building an integrated
public financial management system, as per the recommendations of the PAL and the
CFAA. The loan extensions that were made to catch up with the implementation delays
helped fully utilize the PPIBL for the new PAL related activities under Part E and
increase the results, in particular, under the Treasury modernization sub-component.

The project was not considered to be at risk at any time (see Section 5.1.b).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. In light of the current standards on M&E, the original M&E design was
very weak. Besides the age of the project, this was perhaps due to the dependent and
supportive role of a TA loan (see also 2.1). The PDOs and indicators were inconsistent
within the PAD and between the PAD and the Loan Agreement. Some PDO indicators
(i.e. "key milestones" as mentioned in the PAD for Part E) were not later defined; and
others were not measured (i.e. "sound functioning of institutional support structures for
market based growth"). The component level indicators were mostly outputs ­ which was
appropriate in case of important outputs (i.e. "a privatization strategy") ­ or lacked
targets to indicate changes in the immediate project beneficiaries ("strengthen x's
capacity"). The result framework was not improved during the life of the project except
for the last supervision missions during which discussions focused on how to retrofit the
result framework to provide a fair basis for evaluation. New and refined indicators
provided a framework for evaluation, but they did not, as such, could not suggest any
means to evaluate the changes in the absence of targets ("provide TA to support x").




15After the PAL PMU was closed, the relevance did not necessarily reduce because the Project was
thereafter mainly implementing previously agreed interventions.


                                                  11

M&E implementation. The PPIBL PMU monitored the project implementation and
maintained and monitored very detailed tables on procurement of contracts and use of all
loan and grant funds. While the PPIBL PMU collected data on the actual delivery of TA
and the Bank supervision team reported on its completion, the PAL team and the PAL
PMU focused on monitoring the outcomes and the progress of the policy reform, using
additionally the quarterly report on the PAL indicators produced by the PAL PMU until
late 2006.

M&E utilization. The PPIBL PMU and the Bank supervision teams used the
procurement and disbursement data to monitor the implementation progress and to
discuss resource allocation. This data was reported in the Bank's supervision reports. The
PPIBL supervision reports did not monitor the results of the TA interventions until during
the last year of supervision, as described above.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Financial management. The Borrower maintained a highly satisfactory financial
management system. It respected the relevant IBRD loan and Dutch grants financial
covenants by submitting to the Bank quarterly financial monitoring reports and annual
audit reports in a timely manner and in a format and content acceptable to the Bank.
Audit opinions were all unqualified and no internal control issues were mentioned.
Counterpart financing received from the GOR was highly satisfactory.

Procurement. The PMU procurement function was carried out satisfactorily and in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines and the legal agreements.

Waivers. The Bank management approved an exception to the closing date policy in
August 2006 and agreed to the use of Project cost savings for new activities to be added
to the Project based on the enhanced value to the Project (OP/BP 13.30 and 13.25).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
In March 2009 Romania agreed on a multilateral financial support package with the IMF,
the Bank and the EU to address the effects of the global economic and financial crisis and
promote the reform agenda of the GOR. This reform agenda will practically resume the
reforms supported by the PAL but halted with the EU accession in 2007 (see Section 4).
In addition, some Bank projects continue to provide TA to the PPIBL beneficiaries to
support Romania's integration with the EU. These include the Knowledge Economy
Project (FY06), Judicial Reform Project (FY06), Health Sector Reform Project (FY05),
Integrated Nutrient Pollution Project (FY08) and Hazard Mitigation and Emergency
Preparedness Project (FY04).

3. Assessment of Outcomes16

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The PPIBL's objectives, design and implementation are substantially consistent with
Romania's current development priorities and the Bank's country strategies (CAS FY06-
09). First, the core public sector reforms supported by the Project were in line with the
GOR's aim to access the EU that was the anchor of the PAL. The sub-components added
in 2006 also aimed ultimately at improving the public expenditure management reforms
although they did not support specific PAL conditions. The objectives remained
appropriate after Romania joined the EU even though the GOR's motivation for reforms
waned. They have become again priorities for the GOR due to the global financial crisis
(see Section 2.5). Second, the privatization and restructuring objectives were substantially
relevant and were mostly achieved in accordance with the GOR's strategies early in the
Project life (except in the energy sector).

The complex design and a large number of beneficiary agencies followed the model of
the ambitious and complex PAL agenda that the Project supported. In this regard, they
were relevant but they led to implementation delays (see Section 2.2). The Bank and the
GOR responded appropriately to the shortcomings in the capacity by establishing and
maintaining the PAL PMU under the PPIBL financing in 2005-2006 although more
attention could have been paid to strengthen the implementation capacity of the
beneficiary agencies. In addition, while Part C and D supported the GOR's reform
programs in respective areas, they were not linked to the PSAL2/PAL programs to the
same extent or directly, respectively as the other components.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The objectives were achieved to a substantially extent (see Table 1) against the PDOs
explained in the Datasheet. The rating is calculated based on: (i) the component weights
that were determined based on the original project cost allocations and the intentions of
the PAD to focus on energy and public sector reforms; (ii) the weighted ratings of the
components; and (iii) the total rounded rating. The following text describes the Project
outcomes for evaluation purposes and the status of policy reforms for information.

16It is important to read this section together with Annex 2 that describes the results of the TA activities and their outcome in terms of
how they implemented or contributed to the benchmarks of the policy programs or supported the GOR's reform programs.



                                                                   13

Part A: Financial Sector Restructuring and Privatization

Part A achieved the objective of providing the required TA and implementing PSAL2-
supported policy measures, PDO (a), and laying the ground for reforms supported by the
PAL, PDO (b), to a substantial extent (see the Datasheet and Annex 2). Funding was
provided by the EU, PIBL, Dutch TF050477, PPIBL and the beneficiaries. The Project
contributed to strengthening the capacity in the CEC and regulatory agencies effectively
and can take some of the credit in that the CEC has improved its indicators; the CNVM
has improved its compliance with the IOSCO standards; and the ISC has improved its
capacity in specific fields, as demonstrated below. The success of the policy reforms ­
that the CEC was not privatized; that capital markets are not as developed as in the
neighboring countries; and that enforcement needs strengthening ­ are affected by factors
outside the control of the Project.

1. The Savings Bank (the CEC). The required TA was provided (under the PIBL and the
Dutch TF059477) to restructure the CEC and offer it for sale, but the sale of the CEC was
not completed as the GOR did not accept the bid price. Thus, the PSAL2/PAL policy
objective ­ that the GOR exits from the banking sector ­ was not fully achieved. The
ownership structure of the banking sector has changed significantly between 2002 and
2008 as a result of the policy reforms. About 5% of the total banking sector assets,
representing the CEC, compared to about in 2002 remains in the State's ownership. The
CEC has undergone additional restructurings and management changes, resulting in
improved operational efficiency, profitability and ability to diversify its activities to
become less dependent on interest revenues (see Table 2). The banking sector overall has
made similar progress, although starting from a better position. Going forward, the
multilateral financial support package for the crisis will support financial sector reforms
to enhance the resilience and functioning of the sector (see Section 4).

2. The National Securities Commission (CNVM) and the Bucharest Stock Exchange
(BSE) (see also Parts E.1.i.d and E.12). The Project (namely the Dutch TF050477 and
the PPIBL) and, most importantly, the EU provided TA to strengthen the legal, regulatory
and supervisory framework for the capital markets and the CNVM's capacity. Thus, the
legal and regulatory framework for capital markets/investment funds has been aligned

with the EU acquis and the regulatory regime has been largely updated to international
standards17 in line with the PAL objectives. This work was funded by the CNVM and the
EU and helped meet the related PAL1-2 benchmarks. The Project contributed to helping
the CNVM develop the secondary legislation for supporting the development of new
financial instruments (part of the secondary legislation for the regulated secondary
market for mortgage backed securities - a PAL2 benchmark for mortgage markets) and
the enabling environment for the development of corporate and municipal bonds market
(the framework for setting up and supervising credit rating agencies). As a result of all
the capacity building efforts (of which the EU provided a major amount), the CNVM's
supervisory capacity and enforcement activities have improved against the IOSCO
standards, with an increase in the full compliance of the Principles and resolution of
previously non-compliant Principles. These results helped meet the related capacity
building benchmarks in the PAL. The PAL policy objective of developing a
comprehensive legal, regulatory and supervisory framework was achieved at the time of
the cancellation of the PAL2.

The BSE has recently diversified its financial instruments, with the introduction of
derivatives and government bonds trading. Government bonds have been listed on the
BSE since August 2008 and this was expected to boost market liquidity in the long term;
in practice, there is little trading, the main market being an OTC market supervised by the
NBR.18

Despite these efforts, the capital markets have remained less developed than in
neighboring countries and the markets for various financial instruments are on the
average underdeveloped (including the secondary market for mortgage bonds and
mortgage backed securities, as well as the corporate and municipal bonds market that the
Project supported).19

3. The Insurance Supervision Commission (ISC) (see also E.1.i.d). The Project
contributed to strengthening the ISC's capacity to supervise the market for motor vehicle
third party liabilities and provided recommendations used to align the relevant national
laws in line with the EU acquis to strengthen ISC's supervisory capacity in this area (thus
helping meet the PAL1 benchmark). Thus, the ISC has increased the percentage of
carriers of the motor vehicle insurance from 60% in 2003 to 90% in 2007 and expedited

18The World Bank Capital Markets Technical Note, January 2009.
19While the capital markets framework and CNVM's capacity have improved, market capitalization and liquidity have remained
behind other Central and Eastern European countries despite significant growth until 2007 (from 8.8 billion in 2004 to 24.6 billion
in 2007 on the Bucharest Stock Exchange) before dropping drastically in 2008 to 14.1 billion due to the financial crisis. Liquidity has
decreased with annual turnover rising from 593 billion in 2004 to 4 billion in 2007 before falling back to 1.7 billion in 2008. The
Romanian market lacks institutional investors due to an underdeveloped private pension funds, investment funds, and insurance
market. The markets for various financial instruments are on the average underdeveloped. The Romanian bond market is still in an
embryonic phase, although there has been an increase in the issuance of corporate and municipal bonds in recent years. The secondary
market for bonds lacks liquidity. The corporate bond market that started trading on the BSE in 2001 has grown (from 60 million in
2005 to 184 million in 2008) but is underdeveloped, with six bonds outstanding in 2008. The secondary market for corporate bonds
is illiquid. The municipal bonds markets that started trading on the BSE in 2001 has expanded in recent years, with higher values
(from USD11.2 million in 2004 to USD 51 million in 2007 and to USD 105.6 million as of end-October 2008) and longer maturities
(from 3.3 years in 2004 to 19 years in 2007 and 18.6 years at end-October 2008). The secondary market for municipal bonds is illiquid,
although turnover has increased in recent years. Source: The World Bank Capital Markets Technical Note, January 2009.

the time required to process claims. The Project also contributed to modifying and
implementing some accounting regulations for the insurance sector in line with the EU
acquis and to designing the IFRS implementation strategy, both in accordance with the
Country Action Plan for 2004-2009 that aimed at enhancing the quality of the financial
reporting in Romania and the implementation capacity. The PAL policy objective of
developing the insurance market was achieved at the time of the cancellation of the PAL2.

Overall, the accounting regulations have been aligned with the EU Insurance Accounts
Directive and the Fourth and Seventh Company Law Directives, as well as with the
Transparency Directive, the IAS Regulation, and the Bank and Insurance Accounts
Directives. However, while the regulations are largely in place, enforcement of the
regulations remains weak20.

Part B: Privatization Support for State-Owned Enterprises

Part B achieved the objective of providing the required TA and implementing PSAL2-
supported policy measures, PDO (a), to a high extent (see the Datasheet and Annex 2).
Funding was provided by the PIBL and the GOR. The required TA for restructuring and
privatizing pools of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) was provided to meet the key
conditions in the PSAL2. Based on all the TA, the GOR successfully completed the
privatization, workouts, restructuring, and liquidation of SOEs under the PSAL2 carried
forward from the PSAL1. The PAL policy objective for privatizing the state
manufacturing was achieved by end-2007 (except for some residual shares) (although the
Project did not support privatization of SOEs during the PAL). The private sector's share
of the GDP has increased from 69.1% in 2002 to 70% in 2008 (remaining slightly under
the PAL target of 75% by end-2008).

Part C: Privatization Support for the Energy Sector

Part C achieved the objective of providing the required TA and implementing PSAL2-
supported policy measures, PDO (a), and laying the ground for reforms supported by the
PAL, PDO (b) ,to a high extent (see the Datasheet and Annex 2). Funding was provided
by the Dutch TF050477, PIBL, the World Bank Electricity Market Project (FY03), GOR
and, most importantly, the EU. While the first two sources financed the required
assessments of electricity and gas sectors envisioned under the PSAL2, the Electricity
Market Project and additional EU funding continued and deepened the energy sector
reform, as framed under the PAL2 and 3 (beyond the Project activities). Thus, the Project
contributed to the development of the electricity sector strategy (a PSAL2 condition) that
became part of the 2003 Road Map for the energy sector; to aligning the legal and
regulatory framework for private competition in the energy sector; as well as to
strengthening the National Regulatory Authority in Natural Gas Sector in Romania (the
ANRGN) and the National Regulatory for Electricity (ANRE), later merged as the
Romanian Energy Regulatory Authority (ANRE) in 2007. The PAL objective of
establishing a modern electric power and natural gas sectors consistent with EU market

liberalization principles was largely achieved at the time of the cancellation of the PAL2
and has now been fully achieved. Romania has been recognized as a regional market
leader in South East Europe.

Restructuring and privatization in the power and gas sectors. Significant progress was
made in the restructuring and privatization of the energy sector since its unbundling of
the sector in 2000 into three generation companies (Termoelectrica, Hidroelectrica and
Nuclearelectrica), the transmission operator (Transelectrica), and the distribution
company Electrica (holding eight electricity regional distribution companies). Five of the
electricity distribution companies were privatized under the PSAL2/PAL2 and three are
still held by Electrica. The electricity market operator (OPCOM Power Exchange) was
launched in 2005 and has developed quickly into the most successful exchange in Eastern
Europe. Along similar lines, Romania has restructured and privatized its gas sector, after
unbundling it into the gas exploration and exploitation company (Romgaz), the gas
transmission company (Transgaz) and two gas distribution companies (Distrigaz Nord
and Distrigaz Sud). While the two gas distribution companies were privatized under
PSAL 2, Romgaz remained in public ownership, although it was planned to be privatized
under PAL3. In the oil sector, the Petrom was privatized under the PSAL2.

Romania updated the 2003 Road Map for energy strategy in 2007 (a PAL2 benchmark)
and approved the resulting "Romania Energy Strategy for the Years 2007-2020" in
September 2007. This strategy reconfirmed Romania's commitment to: (a) improving the
competitiveness of electricity and gas markets; (b) supporting the development of the
Energy Community and internal energy market of the EU, and more broadly; (c)
proactively participating in the development and implementation of the new energy
policy for the EU. The updated energy strategy from 2007 proposed the continuation of
the privatization program, as well as continued development of Hidroelectrica (some of
its units planned for sale under the PAL3) and rehabilitation of Turceni and Rovinari,
resulted from Termoelectrica restructuring (planned for sale under the PAL3). Following
the reversals in some reform areas made by the previous Government in 2008, the new
Government cancelled the plans on establishment of a power holding company in January
2009, but whether it will resume the privatization program is not clear yet.

Sound regulatory framework promoting competition within the gas and power sectors
(including prices/tariffs). A transparent and predictable commercial and regulatory
framework consistent with the EU market liberalization principles has been put in place.
Thus, the electricity sector was liberalized in July 2007, and the gas sector was fully
liberalized by July 2007. The ANRE has adjusted electricity and gas prices in accordance
with its regulatory framework. Through a series of tariff adjustments by the ANRE (and
the ANRGN) and major improvements in bill collection by the distribution companies
(from about 65% at the turn of the century to about 100% by 2005 in both electricity and
gas, ahead of privatization), the power and gas sector reached cost-recovery level by the
end of 2004. The ANRE's tariff-setting objectives for power and gas have been in line
with international best practice (full transparency, public consultations, incentive-based
regulatory regime with efficiency incentives in investments and operations). However, its
recent electricity and gas distribution tariff orders have not fully reflected these objectives,
and the electricity tariff order has deviated from the earlier agreed methodology.

Restoration of the ANRE's standing would help increase private capital participation in
the power sector.

Reduction in arrears. As a result of the restructuring and privatization of the energy
sector, the inter-enterprise arrears (delays of payment more than 3 months) in the energy
sector have decreased from 2.5% of GDP in 2002 to almost zero of GDP as of end-2007;
however, due to the financial crisis, the amount of arrears is expected to have increased.

Part D: Support for an Improved Business Environment

Part D alone achieved the objective of providing the required TA and implementing
PSAL2-supported policy measures, PDO (a), and laying the ground for reforms
supported by the PAL, PDO (b), to a negligible extent (see the Datasheet and Annex 2).
Financing was provided by the PPIBL, the Dutch TF050477, the PIBL and the GOR.
While several targeted TA activities were not carried out, the Project mostly contributed
to identifying and designing e-business activities that are now being implemented under
the Knowledge Economy Project (KEP; FY06) and are providing access to information
and business opportunities. These activities did not directly support the PAL although
they supported the business environment component in the Government's strategy for
convergence with the EU.

Besides Part D, some of the Part E activities (described under the next component and not
accounted for here) however also contributed to improving the business environment in
specific areas and helped meet specific PAL benchmarks or supported the policy
objectives broadly with satisfactory results. Thus, they contributed to: improved
transparency in the functioning of firms by alignment of the financial reporting and
auditing in the private sector with the EU acquis; improved efficiency of the court
system; and improved commercial legislation to strengthen corporate governance.

Overall, the business environment has improved, but there are areas requiring
strengthening and so, on the average, Romania ranks the 47th of the 181 economies in
2009 in terms of "ease of doing business". Romania has improved in terms of easiness to
register a company (6 procedures and 10 days in 2009; 6 and 29, respectively, in 2004).
Romania also ranks fairly well in enforcing contracts (31st, while 35th in 2008) although
the number of procedures (31) and days (512) is still high (32 and 537, respectively in
2004). On the other hand, the main impediments to doing business in Romania are related
to paying taxes (146th in 2009 while 137th in 2004 or 113 payments and a 48% tax rate in
2009, while 108 payments and 57.2% rate in 2006), employing workers (143th while
149th in 2008); registering property (114th while 111th in 2008), dealing with construction
permits (88th while 89th in 2008) and closing a business (85th while 84th in 2008 or 3.3
years in 2009 compared to 4.6 years in 2004).21

Part E. Institutional and Governance Reform

Part E achieved the objective of providing the required TA and laying the ground for
reforms supported by the PAL, PDO (b), to a substantial extent (see the Datasheet and
Annex 2). The required TA was provided to implement or contribute to specific PAL1
benchmarks and the planned PAL2 benchmarks at mid-2006 (except for completing the
privatization of the CEC and one electricity generator company). In addition, half of the
remaining TA outputs supported the underlying GOR's reform programs in specific areas.
Funding was provided by the PPIBL (where it was the largest component), the Dutch
Grants TF050477 and TF054659, the GOR and the EU.

More specifically, the Project contributed to: (i) improving the efficiency of selected
Project beneficiaries through modernizing infrastructure (the Treasury system; debt
management software; IT and communication software for the Court of Accounts and its
42 territorial offices; network capacity for the Ministry of Justice and the Superior
Council of Magistracy for the statistical system of the court system); (ii) adapting the
legal and regulatory framework in line with acquis or international standards by
proposing/ providing input to the legal and/or regulatory framework (the strategic
planning system; financial reporting in the corporate sector; the 2006 decentralization
reform package; the amended Company Law; proposals on improved Civil Code (under
discussion); the urgent areas in the environment sector; the 2005 Labor Code (improved
but still problematic); the 2006 Health reform package); (iii) building the foundation for
deepening the reforms in some policy areas under the World Bank or other donor funded
projects (i.e. judicial reform; revenue administration reform; selected areas in the
environment sector); and (v) strengthening the capacity of selected Project beneficiaries
by providing training to staff. In addition, the Project contributed in a number of other
policy areas where assessments were done and recommendations were made but where
they did not have limited impact on policy reforms (i.e. education financing; civil service
pay reform; action plan for dealing with corruption in the health sector, some
recommendations on the health sector reform package; the medium term expenditure
framework and implementation of the judicial reform).


With regards to the outcomes of the policy reforms, the PAL1 ICR assessed that, at the
time of the cancellation of the PAL, the PAL policy objectives were achieved to a
varying extent or could be evaluated only after the completion of all the three phases of
the PAL based on the ICR of the PAL1, as follows: health sector reforms ­ largely
achieved; public expenditure management (cash management, budget formulation,
foreign financing coordination, Government accounting, internal audit, decentralization,
revenue administration, the Court of Accounts), labor market and education financing
reforms ­ partially achieved; civil service, judicial and policy formulation reforms ­
achievements could not be evaluated as they were to be completed after all the three PAL
phases. However, more recently, the reforms have backtracked particularly in the public
expenditure programs (education financing; civil service pay reform; action plan for
dealing with corruption in the health sector, some recommendations on the health sector
reform package; the medium term expenditure framework and implementation of the
judicial reform) after EU accession and due to the fatigue of the reform.

1. (i) Public Expenditure Management

Romania has gone a long way towards improving the public expenditure management
with the goal of bringing it on a sustainable path and aligning it to the development
priorities of the country. The public expenditure management reforms supported by the
PAL with the Project's assistance focused on a series of challenging dimensions (see
below). As a result, the fiscal compliance has been considerably enhanced, and both
revenue collection and public spending have increased substantially. Despite the progress,
institutional, policy, process and capacity weaknesses continue to hamper aggregate fiscal
discipline, the effectiveness of public resources allocation, and the alignment of resources
with strategic priorities. They stem mainly from weaknesses in budget management, the
absence of the medium term expenditure framework and program-based budgeting rules,
lack of a unitary pay and employment system in the public sector, weak monitoring and
evaluation arrangements, and inadequate accountability. These vulnerabilities have
become more apparent during the recent crises. In this respect, the GOR and the Bank
started the preparation of a crises response program that will focus on improvements in
these areas (see Section 4).22

(a) Cash management within the Treasury system (Treasury modernization)

The Project helped modernize the operations of the Treasury system and improve their
efficiency by remedying most of the weaknesses highlighted by the Bank and other
donors (see Annex 2). The modernized Treasury contributed and will contribute
substantially to improving accountability, transparency and responsiveness of the
Treasury operations. It helped Romania achieve the targets set for the conformance of its
payment systems with the EU and international standards. It should be noted that the
policy (legal and institutional) reforms that Romania carried out prior to these
interventions constitute a major component in the overall reforms of modernizing the
State Treasury because the implementation of the reforms is normally most difficult in
terms of the political economy considerations involved.

The elements of the new system - improved cash management, payment and receipts
management and bank reconciliation - have been developed and implemented gradually
since 2005 and will be completed this year (the improved budget management application
will be in use starting with April/May 2009). The commitment management function
remains to be implemented. When the Government implements this system, it is expected
that it will further improve accountability, transparency, and responsiveness of the public
expenditure management.




22Partially based on Romania: the World Bank Policy Briefs for the Government of Romania, January 22, 2009.



                                                               20

The interventions financed by the Project and their benefits are described below:

1. Modernized clearing and settlement inter banking system and connected with the
State Treasury

The Treasury implemented a secure and efficient method of transferring data between the
Treasury systems and the banking network, fully compliant with the international
banking standards (SWIFT) and European requirements for the EU accession. As a result
of computerizing and automating cash flows, the efficiency of executing operations
related to public debt and management of liquidity has significantly increased, with
visible results in:

 Reducing the time between the point when the payment request is made and the point
    when the funds become available in the beneficiary's account (practically in real
    time);
 Improving the management of liquidity and liquidity risks at the State Treasury level;
 Eliminating paper support, as well as streamlining and rationalizing circuits for
    payment instruments since these are processed by STP (Straight Through Processing);
 Managing government debt; and
 Managing financial assistance grants received by Romania, as an EU Member State
    (see Annex 15 for more details on improvements in efficiency).

In fact, according to the State Treasury, the payment solution implemented by the MOPF
can be replicated in other European state Treasuries, thus assuring interoperability at
government agencies and business communities in the European Member States. Going
forward, the State Treasury is planning to anchor its further development to international
banking standards as registered by SWIFT, as well as on international and European
regulations. It plans to evolve the payment system in compliance with the TARGET 2
and the SEPA, scaling it up to provide the possibility to support the defined clearing and
settlement mechanisms, and to align its business environment to the European
environment. The State Treasury has also in mind expanding the operations profile,
running in the direct manner the operations related to the management of the European
funds and public debt (and thus involving multi-currency transactions).

2. Updated IT and telecommunications infra structure at the MOPF and at regional
Treasury offices; improved connectivity between the MOFP and Treasury to the line
ministries and spending units; and established central data warehouse comprising
historical data for 7-10 years to enable time series analysis

These interventions enabled:

 The setting up of the centralized public accounting ledger. This enabled the Treasury
    to prepare accurate and consolidated government wide fiscal reports in an on-line
    real-time basis. These fiscal reports could be obtained on demand instead of waiting
    for several weeks after the end of a particular period. This gave the Treasury real time
    knowledge of balances in its accounts and it therefore was better placed to make



                                             21

    timely decisions regarding their use. This in turn enabled better cash management in
    the Treasury and better assessment of Government borrowing needs.
 Better flow of information between the MOFP/Treasury and the Line ministries and
    spending units. This in turn enabled the spending units to determine the status of
    budget appropriations, releases, budget transfers and additional in year budgetary
    allocations, if any, in an online real time basis.
 The access to the data warehouse gave the MOPF and other interested users access to
    data and capability to perform time series and other analyses that require data
    spanning several years on budget execution data.

3. Improved web-based communication between regional, local offices and the
Treasury HQ, and between the line ministries and Treasury offices and functional
internet portal for the MOPF clients

The successful implementation of these technologies enabled Treasury offices and
Treasury clients, including spending units and providers of goods and services, and
government employees online real time access to the Treasury central databases and data
warehouse. This enabled:

     Spending units to forward and track payment requests to the Treasury, determine
        their budget availability position and produce required reports.
     Public institutions to determine the status of their payment requests, the available
        balance in their accounts and produce detailed reports on expenditures incurred
        and receipts.
     Providers of goods and services to track the status of their invoices.
     Government employees could similarly track the status of payments due to them.
     Treasury and other authorized officials to access the data warehouse and perform
        required analyses.

(b) Budget formulation. The Project contributed to key reform measures and proposals to
the legislation/procedures passed in 2006-2008 to establish the integrated strategic
planning system with the objective of linking budgets to policies/ strategies and
improving the policy content (see Part E.8); to preparing and monitoring the Strategic
Development Plan (SDP) that guided the public expenditure management reform under
the PAL and addressed program budgeting, accruals accounting, internal audit and
external audit of financial statements and performance, as well as Treasury cash
management; to building the in-house macroeconomic forecasting capacity in the MOPF
through building a macro model that is now used in preparing macro and revenue
projections, as part of the budget formulation process, updated quarterly with the new
sets of data and run on a regular basis; and to providing a forum for discussing policies to
support the real income convergence. The Project-funded TA supported the public
expenditure management and policy formulation pillars of the PAL or its specific
benchmarks.

The guidelines for the preparation of the budget (the budget framework letter) have
improved significantly, following the assistance of the advisor. Expenditure ceilings for


                                              22

the current budget year are given in the framework letter. Unfortunately, the numerous
budget rectifications within the year make those ceilings largely redundant. Under the
coordination of the Directorate for Macroeconomic Analysis and Financial Policies in the
MOPF the new GOR is however considering the building of a medium term budgetary
framework a top priority and expects to advance this strategy under the coordination of
the Directorate.

(c) Foreign financing coordination. The legal and institutional framework and the
capacity for foreign financing coordination have been significantly improved since 2002
to improve the public debt management. The Project contributed to improving the
infrastructure of the MOPF and the NBR and institutional capacity for debt and risk
management with the upgraded UNCTAC DMFAS software operational since 2006 and
the Bloomberg financial services available since 2005. Under the new debt agency ­ the
General Treasury and Public Debt Directorate ­ set up in 2007, the MOPF has continued
improving the IT infrastructure and expects to replace the DMFAS by June 2009 by a
new computerized IT system (FTI-STAR). The improved legal framework for public debt
management, revised on the basis of the recommendations of the World Bank, the IMF
and others, has addressed the issues raised at appraisal and will help control public debt
and its cost.

(d) Government accounting; and financial reporting (in the corporate sector)23. With
regards to the public sector side for government accounting, the Project contributed to
designing and monitoring the Strategic Development Plan (the SDP) ­ a PAL benchmark
­ during the PAL (see E.1.i.b). The accrual accounting has been introduced starting with
January 1, 2006 for all the public institutions, but despite certain progress, this is
happening in practice to a limited extent, mostly when it comes to reporting budget
execution results.

With regards to the financial reporting for the corporate sector24, the Project contributed
to aligning the statutory framework to the acquis communautaire as it relates to financial
reporting, to improving institutional capacity of professional bodies, and other
stakeholders, including by training 50 high level professional in the International
Financing Reporting Standards (IFRS), and to enhancing professional education and
training. In many cases, recommendations were incorporated into the Country Strategy
and Action Plan (CAP) updates to enhance corporate financial reporting in Romania25.

Romania has transposed the acquis communautaire into its accounting laws and
regulations; a new Audit Law on statutory audit introduces the new requirements of the
amended Eighth Company Law Directive.26 Some aspects of this law are already


23Most of the TA activities were practically related to improving the financial reporting in the corporate sector.
24The sectoral information is from the World Bank Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes for Accounting and Auditing
(ROSC) (2008).
25The Bank produced the first Accounting and Auditing Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes in May 2003. Based
on the input from the Bank, the GOR approved the draft of the Country Strategy and Country Action Plan in November 2004 to
enhance t h e q u a l i t y of financial reporting in Romania.
26On November 7, 2008, Parliament enacted the law 278/7, the amended Audit Law, approving the Emergency Government
Ordinance 90/2008 on statutory audit, dated June 24, 2008, and published on June 30, 2008 in Romania's Official Gazette, Part I,
481/2008.



                                                                 23

included in the financial reporting framework, such as professional education and
licensing requirements, the public registry and the quality assurance system, but further
strengthening will be needed for them to fully comply with the high quality requirements
of the amended Eighth Company Law Directive. The Public Oversight System described
in the new Audit Law is comprehensive but its practical implementation will be
challenging.

Accounting rules are aligned with the Fourth and Seventh Company Law Directives, as
well as with the Transparency Directive, the IAS Regulation (EU Regulation 1606/2002),
and the Bank and Insurance Accounts Directives. Since 2007, listed companies have been
required to use International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU to
prepare their consolidated financial statements. Financial statements are available at the
trade registry, albeit not electronically.

However, Romanian Accounting Standards for the enterprise sector should be made
comprehensive and complemented by authoritative guidance. Although Romania has
implemented the relevant accounting directives, the absence of many elements of the
necessary supporting infrastructure, combined with Romania's rule-based accounting
traditions, present challenges in ensuring that the principles contained in European Union
legislation are applied in a manner that leads to high quality financial reporting.

(e) Internal audit. The Project contributed to improving internal audit skills in the public
sector and to increasing the number of the CIA internal auditors in Romania to support
the overall PAL objective of governance and public financial management reform. Since
early 2000 the capacity for internal audit has been strengthened with considerable
amounts of TA mainly from the EU with the result that there are 120 internal auditors
with the CIA certification of which at least 5 internal auditors are from the public sector
(the Project funded training for 3 auditors from the public sector who transferred
knowledge to others; overall the Project trained 42 internal auditors).

(f) Decentralization. The Project contributed to the legal and institutional framework for
the intergovernmental fiscal relations and local governance finance and fiscal
decentralization reform package enacted in 2006, in support of a PAL2 benchmark. Some
of the recommendations (i.e. decentralization formula) were reversed in 2008 but
reinstated in the 2009 budget by the new GOR. The reform package contained a list of
critical reform measures and a number of amendments to address many key issues in
intergovernmental fiscal relations and local governance finance (including an
intergovernmental transfer formula for equalization grants). These measures have
improved predictability of intergovernmental relations and local governance finance.
Despite these critical reforms, effective decentralization and improvement of
intergovernmental fiscal relations are incomplete27.

 1. (ii) The National Agency for Fiscal Administration (NAFA). The Project contributed to
 identifying and prioritizing the NAFA's developmental needs during the first years of its

                                                             24

 operations; it enabled extensive direct transfer of knowledge from international experts
 to the NAFA specialists; and provided the vision and direction according to which the
 NAFA further developed its first strategy in 2007 for 2007-2011. The Project-funded TA
 resulted in a series of recommendations for the development of the organization and of
 the working processes within the NAFA. The key result is considered the NAFA's
 improved ability to serve taxpayers based on the IT strategy developed with the Bank-
 funded TA's assistance and the subsequent transfer of the IT functions from MOPF to
 the NAFA in October 2007. Other recommendations helped design strategies for internal
 reorganization and improved business operations that have been subsequently
 implemented with considerable amounts of the EU assistance and continuous twinning
 partnerships with European tax administration that the Bank-funded TA complemented28.
 In addition, the Project resulted in a draft of a revised legal framework to harmonize the
 tax base for collecting payroll taxes and social contributions and to create a simplified
 and integrated declaration and payment environment; however, the implementation of
 the entire legal framework and the single tax return was postponed until January 2010 by
 the previous Government (some provisions were approved).

With major assistance from the EU and foreign partners and Bank-funded TA and the
NAFA's efforts, Romania has made progress in the revenue administration reform by
enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of revenue collection and promoting integrity
and transparency of the tax administration. Thus, revenues collected from taxes have
increased from 28.76% of GDP in 2007 to 29.14% in 200829 (affected by many factors).
The administrative burden to tax payers has been reduced, and effectiveness of the
functioning of the tax administration has improved (see Annex 2).

2. The Court of Accounts30. The Project contributed to improving the efficiency of the
work of financial controllers, judges and prosecutors in the headquarters and the 42
territorial offices of the Court of Accounts and to enabling electronic communication
between them. These activities supported the implementation of the Strategic
Development Plan for the Public Financial Management Reform for 2005-2007.

3. The Ministry of Communication and IT. See Part D.

4. The Ministry of Administration and Interior. The Project contributed to collecting
valuable data on the private and public sector remuneration for comparable positions and
preparing a reform strategy and draft legislation for a unitary pay system in the civil
service in late 2005-early 2006, in support of the PAL1 benchmark and preparation for its
implementation during the PAL3. The law for establishing a unitary pay system was not
however approved and the strategy was not implemented. This has led to an increased
share of the personnel costs in the budget; inequity in compensation and excessive
demands by unions; unrealistic wage demands that can exceed the budget resources (the
recent law mandating a 50% pay increase for the education sector is the latest example);

and distortions in the labor market31. The GOR is however now resuming steps on civil
service reforms, including public pay, under the financial package of the multilateral
donors (see Section 4).

5. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ), Superior Council of Magistracy (SCM) and Courts.
The Project contributed to helping implement the legislation adopted in 2004-2005 and
the judicial reform strategy for 2003/5-2007; to building capacity and IT infrastructure in
the MOJ and the SCM for carrying out their functions; to designing the Judicial Reform
Project (JRP; FY05); to drafting revised legislation on trading companies in the field of
corporate governance that constituted the amended Company Law in compliance with
EU and OECD corporate governance standards effective as of December 1, 2006; and to
drafting a reformed Civil Code that has been under debate since 2008. The Project
supported or helped meet a number of the PAL benchmarks in the judiciary and business
environment areas.

More specifically, with regards to the judiciary, the Project activities contributed to the
PAL policy objective of improved framework for enhancing efficiency and the
accountability of the judiciary. The JRP is benefiting from the data analysis of judicial
performance and options for court rationalization that the Project financed and is building
upon it in a new consultancy assignment for optimizing the court system administration
and performance to, among other things, reduce the duration of judicial proceedings and
the backlogs. This assignment under the JRP will support the SCM's efforts launched in
early 2007 to reorganize the courts and to establish an optimal volume of work for
individual judges and courts. The Project offered also valuable models for training;
evaluating the professional activities of judges and prosecutors based on performance
standards; and for the Law School Admission reasoning tests. In addition, the Project
contributed to helping strengthen the economic and financial management in the court
system that was introduced in the 2004-2005 legislation and provided input to regulations
clarifying the role of the courts in the budget formulation and execution. Finally, the
Project contributed to the continued automation of the judiciary and development of
judiciary statistics (based not only on quantitative analysis but also on quality indicators
of magistrates' activity).

While the judiciary met the EU accession conditions, implementation continues albeit
slowly, as demonstrated by, for example, still the lengthy proceedings of court cases.
Doing Business indicators for "enforcing contracts" have only slightly improved in 2004-
2009: the number of procedures has declined from 32 to31, time from 537 to 512 days,
and cost (% of debt) is the same (see Part D).

8. The General Secretariat of the Government (GSG) and Prime Minister Chancellery.
The Project contributed to the GSG's achievements in designing and creating a
comprehensive framework and a set of tools for policy analysis, coordination and
monitoring in line with the PAL benchmarks; to building capacity in the GSG and line
ministries for implementing them32; and to providing a design for an integrated IT system
for managing and tracking the policy formulation process (see also Part E.1.i.b). In
designing this framework and tools an essential role was played by the international
assistance funded by the EU (in particular, a twinning project with a foreign State
Chancellery) and the Bank. Most of the proposals of all the international advisors were
included in the legislation/procedures passed by the GSG in 2006-2008.

As a result of the GSG's efforts, the GSG PPU has made progress in improving both the
process and substance of policy formulation work, at both line ministry level and in
decision-making rules at the centre. A legal framework, standards and procedures for
policy formulation/strategic planning and program oriented budget process have been
created and introduced. In addition, the GSG PPU helped establish PPUs in all line
ministries since 2005 to facilitate improvement in the quality of policies/strategies in line
ministries. The GSG played an important coordination role in strengthening their capacity
through different training sessions and regular meetings and brought the PPUs together as
a knowledge sharing network. The PPUs require further capacity building in
strengthening their position and relation with budget departments in respective line
ministries but they have provided a new and important policy-making network across the
government.

Consequently, the 2009 budget resulted from the first policy and program oriented budget
cycle. Based on the GSG's methodologies designed with the international assistance
(including the Project), (a) each line ministry prepared a sector strategy by May 2007; (b)
each line ministry prepared the budgetary part of the strategic plan, including the
indicator system for monitoring the programs/projects in the 2009 budget by June 2008;
and (c) 30% of the line ministries' policy submission met the GSG's standards in 2007
with some ministries, such as the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Internal
Affairs, submitting better policies than others (for example, effective strategic planning
by the Ministry of Environment has led to above average results in absorbing EU funds
and meeting the EU acquis33).

Despite this progress, the policy formulation/strategic planning and budget formulation
process are not integrated into one process (see Part E.1.i.b). The GSG's success in
enforcing the above instruments and framework was limited due to the lack of strong
political support and the absence of a medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) and
weaknesses in budget management. After accession and especially after the recent
Government changes, the GSG's and ministries' capacity has also deteriorated.




32The PM Chancellery benefited from the TA provided to the GSG indirectly. No consultants were hired for the PM Chancellery.

9. The Ministry of Labor (MOL). The Project contributed to the improvements to the
Labor Code for the labor markets enacted in 2005 to increase the flexibility of the
Romanian labor markets so that it would facilitate enhancing the competitiveness of the
Romanian economy in Europe, stimulating growth and job creation and reducing
structural unemployment. The Labor Code is improved but is still problematic. The labor
market flexibility has continued to improve, but some rigidities persist, as evidenced by
the Doing Business Report (see Part D). In addition to increased flexibility, substantial
improvements in education, training and other reforms are also needed to support labor
flexibility.

10. The Ministry of Education, Research and Young People (MOERYP). The Project
contributed to designing the strategy and secondary legislation for implementing the
education decentralization and per capita financing scheme that were introduced in the
amended Education Law in 2004. However, the recommendations resulting from the TA
were not fully incorporated into the adapted regulations, and the desired policy objectives
were not achieved. The per capita financing formula in pre-university education was not
implemented in line with the PAL policy objectives. The secondary legislation remained
unsupportive of effective decentralization and new financing formula; the updated
education strategy was not implemented; and the pilot (on paper) did not result in a
national roll-out.

Over the past ten years, Romania has produced and received a great deal of TA for
education finance, budgeting and management. Much of this work has been of high
quality yet little of it has been implemented. While a great deal of attention has been paid
to budget procedures, expenditure norms, educational decentralization, and formula
funding, there have been strong forces at work to preserve historical budgeting patterns
and the historical process of budget negotiations between the central MOERYP and
MOPF. The primary prerequisite for an improved system is the application of a per
student funding formula that would increase transparency of funding flows and provide
better incentives to education managers to optimize resource use.34

More recently, in response to the financial crisis, the new GOR will resume reforms in
the education sector to improve fiscal management, promote a more efficient, improved
quality of and equitable access to delivery of services. The two reform measures would
be the introduction of standard costs/per capita financing and a student loan scheme (the
Project funded TA made recommendations on the implementation to support the PAL
policy objectives). These would generate fiscal savings that would enable greater access
to and more horizontal equity in education services.

11. The Ministry of Health (MOH). The Project contributed to (i) strengthening the
Health Sector Reform Package enacted in 2006 in a form acceptable to the Bank, in line
with the PAL objectives, (ii) study results on the overall health sector financing on all
levels of health care to enhance the framework and implementation of the decentralized
health insurance system; (iii) enabling the national roll-out of the new hospital finance

system in 2006 (diagnosis related groups35); and to (iv) to establishing the magnitude of
corruption in the health sector.

The 2006 Health Sector Reform Package was a major step forward to improve
accountability and governance in the health sector and integrated various provisions in a
single Act (it provided for deeper reforms than what was envisioned at the stage of the
PAL1 negotiation in 2004). However, there is still a gap between the legislation and its
actual reinforcement. The case based financing of the hospitals which was rolled out
progressively to all acute care hospitals by the MOH in 2006 - based on the methodology
developed with the Project support - is contributing to more efficient provision of
services in hospitals (i.e. shorter stays) (although it has some deficiencies).

Reforms in the health sector have been substantial (in decentralizing of both the financing
and the delivery of health services in different degrees) and are continuing, but many
challenges remain36. Romania's unfinished health reform agenda includes the needs for:
(i) mobilizing additional resources for health; (ii) improving efficiency and equity of
health financing and health service provision; and (iii) strengthening core public health
functions.37

More recently, the new Minister of Health acknowledged the existence of specific studies
delivered under the Project related to health sector financing and corruption in the sector
and publicly expressed the intention to consider their recommendations. Moreover the
Bank's support was asked to update the hospital rationalization strategy. In addition, the
new development policy loan financed by the Bank will address the unfinished agenda by
focusing on mobilizing resources and improving efficiency and equity of service
provision through the adoption of a drugs pricing and prescribing policy, introduction of
co-payments with targeted support to vulnerable population trough a voucher scheme, the
definition of a more realistic package of health services, the introduction of private
insurance, and the adoption of an updated hospital rationalization strategy (see Section 4).

12. The Ministry of Transportation, Construction and Tourism (MOTCT). In accordance
with the TORs, the consultants funded by the Project delivered a number of studies on
key themes to support the mortgage market development under the PAL (housing policy
strategy, mortgage insurance schemes and partial credit facility for mortgage ­ backed
securities). No information was available on the results. For development of the mortgage
markets, see Part A. In addition, an on-site advisor built capacity in the Economics and
Budget Directorate in the MOTCT in 2006 as part of the wider TA to support the budget
process reform (see Part E.1.i.b).




35The DRG means that the hospital get funds according with the type of patients treated and not based on hospital structure (staff,
equipment etc.), process (number of hospitalization days) or other determinants. This type of financing system provides a transparent
and equitable allocation of funds to the hospitals, encourages the efficient use of resources at the hospital level, and works towards
improving the quality of the services provided to the patients.

13. The Ministry of Environment and Water Management (MOEWM). The Project
contributed to helping implement the budget process reform in the MOEWM as part of
the wider TA under the PAL (see Part E.1.i.b), as well as to helping meet the
prerequisites for using the EU funds in the most urgent areas in the environment
protection area (in terms of where there was a financing gap), including: (i) protection of
the water and soil against nutrient pollution, (ii) contaminated areas and (iii) nature
protection (see Annex 2). The TA was expected to be followed by a new project to
support the MOEWM in its efforts to fulfill the EU commitments assumed in the
environment protection area. In the end, the project that was approved - the Integrated
Nutrient Pollution Project (FY08) - focused on the first priority area where the EU did
not provide funding, while the GOR deferred preparation of a project for the other two
priority areas and is now benefiting from the EU funds to meet the needs.

3.3 Efficiency

The PPIBL achieved the above results with substantial efficiency despite the extension of
the implementation period. The closing date extensions resulted in full disbursement of
the Loan to widen (in the case of the NAFA and environment) and deepen (in the case of
Treasury modernization) the Project's contribution to the public sector reform. The
Project helped in the implementation of policy reforms under two operations and in the
capacity building of institutions (i.e. MOPF, NAFA, GSG, MOJ, SCM) to develop and
implement policy reforms on a sustainable basis.

Despite these efficiency gains, a question arises whether more pro-activity should have
been taken to postpone approval of the PPIBL as funds became unexpectedly available
under the PIBL and the Dutch Grant TF050477 around the time of the approval of the
PPIBL. As said in the Country Lending Assessment, "the justifying argument could be
that the actual costs of putting in place resources that were not used were much less than
the potential costs of not having the resources available had they been needed".

The use of unused resources for increasing the scale of assistance to the Treasury
modernization, the largest component under the PPIBL, is expected to bring substantial
results to the Government in terms of improved efficiency of public resources allocation.
The Bank interventions for the Treasury system financed by the PIBL and the PPIBL
amounted to about $25 million (of which PPIBL loan about $11 million). The amount
required for such a Treasury upgrade, as that carried out under the PIBL/ PPIBL, depends
on the size of the Treasury network (the number of offices to be upgraded), the volume of
transactions that the Treasury processes, etc., and could vary widely from country to
country. These amounts are broadly in line with other Treasury modernization initiatives
undertaken by the Bank for similar size Treasuries (i.e. Ukraine and Kazakhstan).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The rating is based on: (i) the substantial consistency of the objectives with Romania's
current development priorities and the Bank's country strategies (CAS FY06-09); (ii)
substantial achievement of the objectives against: (i) whether the Project provided or not
the required TA to achieve the high level policy objectives contained in the PDO; and (ii)


                                              30

the extent to which the assistance provided contributed (a) to implementing the policy
measures supported by the PSAL2 and (b) to laying the ground for the reforms
implemented under the PAL and PAL (whether they contributed to specific PAL
benchmarks or to deepening and/or broadening the Government reform program in the
policy areas included in the PDO, but not necessarily reflected by specific PAL
benchmarks); and (iii) substantially efficient use of resources to achieve the results.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk rating is based on the following factors: (a) the GOR's commitment to resume
public and financial sector reforms - some of which were stalled with the EU accession -
as part of the multilateral financial support package provided by the IMF, the Bank and
the EU (the GOR will be able to re-utilize many of the TA outputs financed by the
Project); (b) privatization transactions supported by the Project at large are mostly
irreversible; and (c) reversals of the reforms in the energy sector would need to be agreed
and consistent with the competition rules in the EU.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory
The rating reflects: (a) the relevance of the PPIBL activities largely to the key
development priorities in the country and in the sector based on the extensive and good
quality analytical work prepared under the PSAL2/pre-PAL; (b) efficient PMU
arrangements; (c) use of lessons from combining structural operations with TA loans; and
(d) use of lessons learnt in the privatization transactions (even though carried out under
the financing of the PIBL and the GOR) and in the design of the broad (albeit after the
amendment even more complex and ambitious) public sector component.

The major shortcomings are related to issues in the areas of strategic relevance, M&E
arrangements, implementation aspects and risk assessment, including: (a) the rationale for
Bank assistance through a new TA loan when at the time of its approval the existing TA


                                              31

loan had available funds for the same activities (except for Part E) and the Dutch Grant
became available for the same activities ­ reasons that led to existence of a project that
was not disbursed until in a couple of years; (b) the M&E design (unclear PDO and
accountability of the Project for the PDO, weak quality of indicators and lack institutional
development targets beyond a mere list of outputs and independent of the adjustment
loans), as well as inconsistencies in the PDOs, indicators and component descriptions in
the PAD and in the Loan Agreement; (c) the underestimation about the required
implementation period of the Project and complex design; (d) the inadequacy of capacity
assessments of beneficiaries; and (e) the absence of mitigation measures to replace the
leverage provided by the PAL in case it be cancelled (as it was).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
The rating reflects: (a) regular supervision missions, most of the times combined with the
PAL supervision missions with recommendations reflecting the understandings reached
by the PSAL/PAL missions and the GOR for implementing the policy reform agenda; (b)
supervision done for all "pooled" funds in a coordinated manner (the PIBL, two Dutch
Grants and the PPIBL); (c) good cooperation between the Bank PSAL/PAL and the
PIBL/PPIBL teams in the headquarters and in the country office (whereby the PAL team
assisted the Borrower with the TORs and monitored outcomes and the PPIBL team
supervised the fiduciary aspects) and with the PPIBL PMU and PAL PMU that allowed
good coordination of the supervision effort (the team remained same for most of the life
of the PPIBL); (d) detailed monitoring and reporting of the procurement and
disbursement data prepared by the PPIBL PMU based on the TA outputs; (e) regular
financial management and procurement supervision missions and review work; (f)
cooperation with the donors that were attracted to the adjustment program due to its
success; and (g) flexibility and responsiveness to meet the Borrower's requests for TA
through two loan amendments.

The significant shortcomings relate to the inadequacy of supervision processes,
including: (a) the lack of proactivity in restructuring the PPIBL to reflect: (i) the
significant reallocations between expenditure categories, (ii) the change of the PPIBL
from a TAL to an investment loan due to the actual 50% share of infrastructure
investments of the PPIBL proceeds compared to 26% at appraisal (including significant
IT investments); and (iii) the significant change in the PDO, de facto cancellation of most
of the Parts A-D under the PPIBL financing and significantly increased scale of TA under
the original Part E due to the use of parallel financing; (b) the lack of efforts until the last
year of supervision to improve the M&E framework; (c) inappropriate PDO and
implementation progress ratings until the end of 2005; and (d) the lack of a Treasury
specialist in the supervision team after the closure of the PAL (although the lack was
compensated by the hiring of a consulting firm by the Borrower to supervise the work of
the SW developer and IT installer delivered by the consultant and involvement of a Bank
IT procurement specialist). The project supervision and reporting focused on the delivery
of the TA outputs and their completion, while the supervision of the PAL program
focused on the progress of the policy reforms and results of the TA interventions. This
followed from the "division of labor" between the PAL and PPIBL teams, but weakened
the policy focus of the supervision after the cancellation of the PAL.


                                              32

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
Although there were major shortcomings in the design phase, the overall moderately
unsatisfactory Bank performance is justified by improvements in the Bank supervision
and a number of proactive actions taken towards the end of the Project life, as well as the
satisfactory outcome of the Project.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The GOR was committed to the policy reform program that was anchored in the EU
accession program and using TA in general to support it, as demonstrated by: (a) the
achievement of the PSAL2 and PAL1 conditions and most of the PAL2 conditions by the
time Romania was ready to be accepted to the EU; (b) the establishment of the high level
PMU PAL in the Prime Minister Chancellery to help implement and monitor the PAL
program and the use of the TA and its effective cooperation and coordination with the
PPIBL PMU; and (c) the practically full disbursement of the PPIBL.

The moderate shortcomings are related to: (a) the somewhat lacking commitment in the
early phase to the use of the TA due to the availability of other funds and the subsequent
extended implementation period that yet enabled in the end full disbursement of the loan;
(b) the lack of even stronger implementation support to the beneficiaries so that they
could have more quickly launched implementation activities and complete them once the
PAL design and the TA needs were identified; and (c) the agreement to an overlapping
design of the different Bank-funded and administered activities that led to delays in
disbursing the PPIBL.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The PPIBL PMU administered and coordinated project implementation efficiently and
with dedication throughout the Project and monitored the achieving of the PSAL I, PSAL
II and PAL conditionalities, ensuring the timely release of scheduled tranches of the
proceeds of the loans. The regular financial management supervision missions carried out
by the Bank's Financial Management Specialist throughout the project life confirmed the
highly satisfactory financial management arrangements in place. The PMU procurement
function was carried out satisfactorily. The PMU's performance was particularly good
considering the complexity of the design, the challenging nature of institutional building
in beneficiaries that lacked capacity in an evolving environment, and the volume of funds
administered (the project costs included $30 million under the PIBL, $22 million under
the PPIBL and two Dutch Grants of over $6 million during 1999-2008). The PPIBL PMU
cooperated effectively with the PAL PMU in working with the beneficiaries to implement
the TA. When the PAL PMU was closed in early 2007, the PPIBL PMU took efficient
care of allocating funds to ensure that they are utilized by the closing date.




                                             33

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
Despite the Implementing Agency's satisfactory performance, the overall rating is
moderately satisfactory due to the importance of the Borrower's commitment and
strategic supervision of the use of the TA that was lacking.

6. Lessons Learned
Be pro-active. Restructure projects when needed, especially when moving from TA to an
investment project and/or when parallel financing is mobilized so that each project could
be evaluated on its own merits and so that the Government resources would not be
wasted on undisbursed funds. The PPIBL was not restructured to reflect the de facto
significantly changed PDO, project financing, as well as expenditure category and
component cost allocations. This made the PPIBL funds initially redundant; it led to
disbursement delays as the GOR preferred to withdraw the existing grant and loan funds
before or instead of the PPIBL; and it made the GOR pay commitment fees for unutilized
funds until 2005. It also complicated the Project evaluation that needed to cover all the
sources of funding and made it somewhat artificial as no clear accountability lines were
drawn between the Bank-related sources of funding since they were managed as a pool of
funds.

Choose PDO indicators carefully. A good result framework with good indicators and
independent targets for institutional development provide a fair basis for supervising and
evaluating developmental outcomes of a TA loan. In the case of the PPIBL, the result
framework was very weak and it lacked independent targets for evaluating the
institutional development results. As a result, supervision was bound to focus more on
monitoring disbursements and completion of contracts than outcomes (it is true that the
outcomes were monitored under the PAL). The project evaluation became also a complex
exercise as it was not clear what is evaluated. Further, in the absence of independent
institutional development targets, the evaluation of the Project's success became
unavoidably linked to the success of the policy programs while at the same time a TA
could not be held accountable for reforms for which it has no leverage.

Have a strong anchor for TA projects. The PAL and EU accession provided an anchor
to the Project that initially helped achieve a lot (either itself, or through the Dutch grants)
in terms of supporting the reform process. Once the anchor was raised after the
cancellation of the PAL, the results of the TA interventions were inevitably undermined
as the PPIBL had no leverage to motivate reforms (i.e. in the area of public expenditure
management, civil service, judiciary and education financing). TA projects can work best
as long as they have a strong anchor.

Shift supervision responsibilities to appropriate department/staff. While the PPIBL's
original design had a strong public sector emphasis, during the implementation, the
PPIBL changed de facto from a TA loan to an investment loan with major IT investments
in the public sector. This required expertise in IT and Treasury systems that the Bank
supervision team did not fully possess (the team included only an IT specialist). On its
part, this weakened the Bank's supervision impact as it relied only on the consultant hired



                                              34

by the Borrower to supervise the design and installation phases. As public financial
management and investment activities became prevalent, supervision should have shifted
to an appropriate department in the Bank with relevant skills to maximize the Bank's
supervision input.

Keep the design simple. The PPIBL was designed after the model of the complex and
ambitious PAL program. In addition, the original Part D included other unrelated
activities that further complicated the design. The design was therefore one more reason
for the long implementation period and challenges in supervision and monitoring the
Project properly. The complex design can therefore slow down the implementation
process and spread the resources with the subsequently fewer developmental results.

Set up PMU arrangements on the right level. The GOR maintained an experienced and
sufficiently staffed PMU throughout the Project life and established a high level PAL
PMU to monitor the preparation and implementation of the PAL reform progress in
2004-2006 (its set-up in the Prime Minister's Chancellery was seen as an insurance
against political and implementation risks). The location of the PAL PMU and the
cooperation between the PMUs provided the required leverage to launch and expedite the
project implementation because many of the beneficiary agencies had limited institutional
capacity and readiness to embark in the reform program; they had limited or even absent
experience with Bank's projects; and there was a need for coordinated intergovernmental
efforts.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The intermediate outcome indicators in Annex 10 that the Borrower refers to were moved
to the Datasheet in the final version of the ICR.

(b) Cofinanciers

*This table is imperfect but it provides an indication of the volume of parallel financing. The information was not part
of the formal financial monitoring reports reviewed by the Bank as part of the PPIBL supervision. The table took into
account of the total financing provided by the parallel financiers only those activities that were part of the "Project", as
defined in the PAD and legal amendments of the PPIBL. Therefore, the amounts are less than the total amount of these
sources. The information on the GOR financing is not complete. In addition, some of the GOR financing for the PPIBL
activities is included in the PPIBL column (i.e. for Part E, $440,000).
**The costs financed by the GOR may include some counterpart funding for the PPIBL.
*** The PMU was the same for the PIBL and PPIBL that were implemented simultaneously. It is not possible to
provide information on how much the PIBL financed of the costs related to implementing the PPIBL project activities.
****The discrepancy comes likely from the fact that the total PPIBL includes the amounts provided in smaller
decimals in the financial management report, while the sub-component costs in this table have been rounded.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The below tables describe: (i) the activities planned in the PAD or loan amendments (the
required TA); (ii) the Project outputs; and (iii) the Project outcomes in terms of: (i)
whether the Project provided or not the required TA to achieve the high level policy
objectives contained in the PDO; and (ii) the extent to which the assistance provided
contributed (a) to implementing the policy measures supported by the PSAL2 and (b) to
laying the ground for the reforms implemented under the PAL and PAL (whether they
contributed to specific PAL benchmarks or to deepening and/or broadening the
Government reform program in the policy areas included in the PDO, but not necessarily
reflected by specific PAL benchmarks). The text refers to the status of meeting the
PSAL2/PAL policy objectives for information, not for evaluation, as a TA loan cannot be
held accountable for policy reforms. That information is based on the ICR on the PAL1.

The PPIBL did not finance activities related to the CEC. The targeted TA that was
financed by the PIBL and the Dutch Grant TF050477 contributed to the Project PDOs (a)
and (b). The restructuring of the CEC in 2004 was completed under a twinning
arrangement and the CEC was prepared ready for privatization by the Privatization
Commission with the advisor's assistance. These outcomes helped meet the PSAL2 2nd
tranche and the PAL1 & 2 conditions as far as taking actions towards the restructuring
and the sale of the CEC were concerned. However, the winning bid did not meet the
expected price of the GOR, and the CEC was not privatized. Therefore the PAL policy
objective was not achieved.

The targeted TA that was financed by the Dutch Grant TF050477, EU, the PPIBL and the
beneficiaries contributed to the Project PDO (b). It helped meet specific PAL benchmarks
and/or contributed to implementing the Government's reform program in the capital
markets. The PAL policy objective of developing a comprehensive legal, regulatory and
supervisory framework was achieved.

The Dutch TF050477 and the PPIBL financed the following TA to:

 Carry out a functional capacity assessment to strengthen the capacity of the CNVM to
     deliver its responsibilities in the framework of the EU single financial market and
     helped meet the PAL1 condition. The assessment suggested measures for
     strengthening the CNVM's institutional capacity as a market regulator, covering the
     internal organization, the regulations and enforcement procedures for the 2004
     consolidated law on capital markets, as well as the training and staffing requirements
     based on the IOSCO standards and in the context of accession to the EU. The
     capacity building program was presented to a number of 20 attendees in a workshop
     (including the CNVM's staff and donors). The CNVM accepted the recommendations
     and incorporated them to a subsequent medium-term action plan for improving the
     institutional capacity as part of the CNVM's annual objectives.
 Make recommendations for a relevant out of court mechanism to establish an
     Arbitrage Chamber for the securities sector in Romania, including a model for its
     organizational structure, governance mechanism and the scope of authority, a draft
     regulation and Chamber rules for its functioning in compliance with this mechanism,
     and an internal procedure manual for the personnel of the Arbitrage Chamber. The
     CNVM accepted the regulation and the rules in 2006 and intends to implement them
     in the medium-term.
 Provide the design, supply and installation of an IT system to create an internally
     integrated database that became operational in April 2008. It has given the CNVM's
     employees the possibility to more efficiently manage information related to
     authorization of regulated entities, registration of issuers, and incomes evidence.


                                                                 48

 Provide the design of an IT system to develop and implement a web portal for the
      capital market in Romania. The web-portal became operational in March 2008.
 Launch activities for improving public awareness of and participation in capital
      markets among individual investors. The contract was cancelled after the first interim
      report based on unacceptable progress towards achieving the project results. Several
      activities like publication of awareness materials, as well as organization of events
      were included in the activities funded by the EU project.
 Provide: (i) a draft CNVM instruction for setting up and supervising credit rating
      agencies; (ii) a pilot program for the simulation of the process of assigning a rating to
      an issuer; and (iii) a training program for 10 staff members in supervising such
      agencies. The TA helped create the framework for credit rating agencies in line with
      the existing international practices (IOSCO principles) and building the CNVM's
      supervision capacity in this area. Further to this assistance, the CNVM adopted an
      instruction on this topic
 (i) Produce three new draft regulations38 (secondary legislation) that were adopted in
      line with the PAL2 condition under the mortgage markets and that, together with the
      existing four laws for the primary and secondary market, constituted the legal
      framework for these markets; (ii) provide recommendations on instruments, actions,
      measures, and regulatory and institutional developments for establishing regulated
      secondary mortgage markets that have been considered within the internal policy of
      the CNVM; and (iii) deliver three training sessions of three days for 10 staff members
      in the field of mortgage lending, mortgage bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
      The TA contributed to developing the framework for a regulated secondary market
      for mortgage backed securities, a new financial instrument in the Romanian market.
 The BSE did not request funding from the PPIBL for capacity building to enable
      trading of Government securities on the stock exchange. The objective of the TA was
      achieved on the BSE's own funds: the BSE started trading Government securities on
      the exchange on August 25, 2008.

                   implementation




38Based on the TA, the following regulations were adopted: the CNVM Regulation no. 11/2006 on securitization of receivables; the
CNVM Regulation no. 13/2006 on mortgage bonds; and the Joint NBR/CNVM Regulation no. 12/3/2006 on authorizing the agents
and portfolio management companies based on the Law no. 32/2006 on mortgage bonds.
39The Insurance Supervisory Commission (ISC) was established in July 2001 as an administrative and financial autonomous entity
responsible for supervising the insurance market in Romania.



                                                                   49

The PPIBL did not finance activities related to the ISC. The targeted TA that was
financed by the Dutch Grant TF050477 contributed to the Project PDO (b) as it
implemented a PAL1 benchmark and helped implement the Government's reform
program in the capital markets. The PAL policy objective of developing the insurance
market was achieved.

The Dutch TF050477 financed the following TA to:

 Help strengthen the ISC's capacity to supervise the motor vehicle third party liability
     market, thus helping meet the PAL1 condition. The consultant developed an
     architecture for a centralized integrated database on motor vehicle third party liability
     and provided recommendations on transposing into the Romanian regulations the
     specific EU Directives in this field. The ISC implemented the proposed centralized
     integrated database (CEDAM) on motor vehicle third party liability under the EU
     PHARE funds in 2005, and it has been operational since December 2005. The system
     can be used in real-time by the users (the ISC, insurers and police) to determine the
     coverage for a particular motor vehicle (or its lack thereof); to input and exchange
     data; to produce reports, etc. As a result, the ISC has increased the percentage of
     carriers of the motor vehicle insurance from 60% in 2003 to 90% in 2007 and
     expedited the time required to process claims. Based on the recommendations of the
     TA, the ISC also aligned the relevant national laws in line with the EU acquis to
     strengthen ISC's supervisory capacity in this area.
 (i) Help the ISC modify the accounting regulations that the ISC had drafted in line
     with the acquis prior to the IFRS implementation40; (ii) provide internal instructions
     and procedures to strengthen the ISC's institutional capacity for supervision and
     assess the financial statements of the insurers and insurance brokers; and (iii) provide
     recommendations related to the strategy for implementing IFRS in the insurance
     sector, a complex process that is in progress. Thus, the modified Accounting
     Regulations in conformity with the EU Directives specific for the insurance field
     approved by the ISC`s Order no. 3129/2005 were adopted. The TA supported the
     implementation process of the provisions of the Accounting Regulations, which were
     modified by the ISC`s Order no. 7/2007, in order to enhance the amendments of the
     EU Directives. In addition, the TA supported the issuing of the ISC`s Order no
     113.105/2006 approving the Norms regarding the criteria for approving the financial
     auditors to audit the financial statements of the insurance companies that supported
     compliance with the provisions of the proposal for the amending of the 8th Directive.
     The ISC`s Order no. 22/2008 assured compliance with the provisions of the European
     Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated
     accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and repealing
     Council Directive 84/253/EEC.




40The directives included: the COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance undertakings
(91/674/EEC); the FOURTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on the annual accounts of certain types of companies (78/660/EEC); and the
SEVENTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on consolidated accounts (83/349/EEC).

The PPIBL did not finance activities related to the privatization of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). The targeted TA that was financed by the PIBL and the GOR
contributed to the Project PDO (a) as it helped implement the related policy conditions.
Thus, the PIBL funded the privatization of four SOEs and the restructuring of three
SOEs, while the rest of the targeted privatizations and restructurings were financed by the
GOR. Although tenders were launched under the PIBL for all 20 companies to hire
privatization/workout advisors, only two contracts were signed - one out of the three
pools for privatization and one out of the four pools for workout - because of failed
negotiations, lack of bids or timing issues. As a result, 16 SOEs were privatized, one SOE
liquidated through an assets sale procedure through the Asset Resolution Agency, and
three SOEs were liquidated through voluntary/judicial procedures. The PSAL2 policy
objectives were met (the broader policy objective of the PAL of privatizing the state
manufacturing sector was achieved by the end of 2007).

Bank-funded Electricity Market Project (FY03), the PIBL and the Dutch Grant TF050477
financed TA in the targeted areas that contributed to the PDO (a) and (b).




                                                                    51

1. Regulatory capacity of the National Regulatory Authority in Natural Gas Sector

The National Regulatory Authority in Natural Gas Sector in Romania (the ANRGN)
received capacity building support from the EU, resulting in the introduction and
subsequent implementation of a new formula for gas distribution companies. The
Government merged the ANRGN into the Romanian Energy Regulatory Authority (the
ANRE) in 2007 in order to reduce the number of agencies and to have a better correlation
between gas and electricity prices. The ANRE had received TA from the EU together
with the Bank-financed Electricity Market Project (FY03) for developing a commercial
framework for electricity trading with satisfactory results (demonstrated by a commercial
framework consistent with the EU market liberalization principles), as well as for
developing a new formula to calculate the tariff for the electricity distribution. Over the
years the ANRE (and the ANRGN until its merger) built up a solid track record as
probably the most competent regulator in the region. The new commercial code and a
clear formula for establishing the tariff for the electricity and gas distribution facilitated
the privatization of five electricity distribution companies (out of eight) and of two gas
distribution companies (100 % of the gas distribution is private-owned).

2. Taxation system for the oil and gas sector

See C.4.

3. Privatization strategy for electricity distribution sector

The privatization strategy for electricity distribution sector, mentioned in the PAD, was
prepared using the EU PHARE funds in early 2000. It provided input to the Road Map
for energy sector reforms approved by the GOR in 2003 that included the policies, tasks,
targets and timetable for implementing the reforms mainly in the power and natural gas
sectors. The Road Map was submitted to the EU as the official strategy that Romania
would follow and that included the measures Romania would take to achieve compliance
with the EU's electricity and gas directives and other energy sector parts of the EU
acquis. Romania's energy market model was based on liberalization (gradual opening).
The stated aim was to create "such structures and a market environment that would
enable to respond and cope with the increasingly integrated European energy market".
The European Commission characterized the Road Map as "exemplary" and its
successful implementation facilitated (for the energy sector) Romania's entry into the EU
in January 2007. The Road Map (and its 2007 version) benefited from several reviews by
the Bank as part of supervising and preparing the PAL programs.

4. The legal and regulatory framework for private competition in the energy sector

The legal and regulatory framework for private competition in the energy sector (namely
in the network industries) was covered in the above Road Map which provided an energy
market model based on liberalization. The network industries study was done by
aggregating several studies, including taxation study, structural and regulatory
assessment of electricity, gas and oil sectors funded by the PIBL before the approval of



                                               52

the PPIBL, as well as a review of tariff methodologies funded by Dutch TF050477. This
aggregation work was done by the Bank. The legal and regulatory framework has been
implemented consistent with the EU Directives.

                     2004.


The targeted TA that was financed by the PPIBL supported the business environment
component in the Government's strategy for convergence with the EU. As such, it
strengthened e-business by providing significant inputs to the design of the Local
Community e-Networks (LCeNs) component in the Knowledge Economy Project (KEP;
FY06). These activities were not directly linked to support the PAL. No financing from
the PPIBL was requested for e-government services.

The PPIBL financed the following TA to:

 Help design the US$43 million "Improving Access by Establishing LCeNs" sub-
     component in the KEP. The consultants: (i) identified the typologies of the most
     knowledge disadvantaged communities eligible for the LCeN implementation and
     selected a sample of 80 rural and small urban communities with these typologies; (ii)
     carried out a survey in 100 communities, including the 80 communities and an
     additional 20 for benchmarking purposes, to assess the demand for knowledge driven
     activities and accordingly defined the LCeN's functional model to address the needs
     of different target groups (teachers and students, citizens, businesses) under the KEP;
     (iii) designed the business and organizational model of the LCeN; (iv) prepared
     application and business plan templates, the design of a public awareness campaign in
     support of the deployment of LCeNs, a related training program for communities, and
     technical specifications for the LCeN's equipment; and (v) piloted competitive
     selection of 9 future LCeNs from the 80, representing each of the community
     typologies, based on the above. The KEP applied the above selection criteria and
     methodology with some modifications and scaled up the exercise to select further 255
     communities under the KEP component with satisfactory results. The 255 Local



                                                              53

     Community e-Networks (LCeNs41) were established n 255 communities by the end of
     2007. They are operational; represent 44% of the most disadvantaged communities in
     Romania; and cover a population of about 1.8 million people. In each of the 255
     communities, the local electronic networks link the: (i) basic and lower secondary
     schools; (ii) local administration offices (Town Halls); (iii) public library; and (iv)
     Public Information Access Points. The KEP has already demonstrated results in terms
     of increased use of ICT as a pedagogical tool, improved networking between schools,
     increased ICT skills of pilot schools' students and teachers, etc.
 With regards to the Grant Facility sub-component42, design the eligibility criteria,
     application process and templates, selection mechanism, and the monitoring
     mechanism for use of the grants by the beneficiaries. This information was used as
     the basis for drafting an operational manual for the KEP. The Grant Facility was
     launched in August 24, 2008; 131 applications were received by November 24, 2008
     and further 279 applications were received from 35 counties in the second round of
     submissions due by January 26, 2009. The grants are intended for facilitating
     innovative business solutions, including e-business adoption among natural persons,
     family associations, micro, small and medium enterprises, as well as wide
     collaboration and innovation between them, industries, RDIs, etc., to improve their
     competitiveness.
 With regards to the Portal for E-Store, carry out an impact and needs assessment to
     design a business model for the e-Store, including organizational and legal structure,
     technological solutions appropriate for the portal, financial analysis and projection
     and supervision arrangements. This design was used as an input in designing the
     Portal for e-Store sub-component and for developing the technical specifications for
     the e-portal developed under the KEP. An e-Comunitate portal was launched in early
     2009 with the resources page, web links to similar or complementary portals (such as
     the EU-funded e-SME Portal), Business directory, Product cataloging and Job
     directory to facilitate knowledge sharing. Due to a parallel financing from the EU for
     developing an e-Store portal, the KE portal e-Comunitate assists in the development
     of business opportunities in knowledge disadvantaged areas, by providing better
     access to information and thus fostering the socio-economic development of these
     communities. This portal complements and capitalizes the EU-funded e-Store portal.

No TA was requested for e-government (neither for the SMART-card system) services
under the PPIBL as the Government developed them mainly from their own funds43.




41Communities will be offered access to knowledge through "Local Communities e-Networks" (LCeNs) which provide a number of
services and technologies, including computers, the Internet and communication services and specific content provision for different
target groups (citizens, businesses and pupils) in rural and small urban communities.
42The Grant Facility and Portal for E-Store sub-components constituted the US$11.9 million Promotion of E-commerce and
Innovation Support for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Component in the KEP.
43Regarding e-procurement, Romania has successfully implemented e-procurement starting with a pilot project in March 2002,
without requesting the project's support. The Romanian government involved key stakeholders, launched advertising campaigns,
created training programs and put an emphasis on SME-user friendliness. In addition, a gradual implementation and strong political
commitment helped to make it successful. Thus, since January 2007, all public procurement announcements of the GoR have to be
published on the national portal "e-Licitatie'' (www.e-licitatie.ro ­ on the GOR's web-site) and are transferred to the EU Official
Journal. It has hence become easier and faster for companies in Romania to participate in public procurement by simplifying access to
information and to the bidding process, which is especially important for SMEs. Today, every company wishing to learn about
contracts with the Romanian government can visit the national e-procurement website and register as a supplier. In 2007, 9,000



                                                                    54

Overall 36.8% of the public basic services are available to citizens online and 67.8% of
the basic business services are available online out of the 20 basic services agreed with
the EU under the i2010 agenda. They include 12 e-Public services for citizens (income
taxes; job search; social security benefits, passport and driving licence; car registration,
building permission, declaration to Police, public libraries, birth and marriage
certificates; enrolment in higher education; announcement of movement; health related
services) and 8 public e-services for businesses (social contributions; corporate tax; VAT;
company registration; statistical data; customs declaration; environment related permits;
public procurement).

The PPIBL did not finance the development of the e-Romania Development Gateway
Portal, which was originally expected to be financed under the PIBL and subsequently
transferred to the PPIBL, due to changed priorities of the new GOR in using the PPIBL
funds. The PIBL funded some staff costs for it. The Portal was developed and managed
by the eRomania Gateway Association within the Development Gateway initiative of the
Bank.

The PPIBL did not finance the targeted court refurbishing works and equipment to
selected local courts; these activities were included into the design of the Judicial Reform
Project (the JRP; FY06). However, as the first step, the Dutch TF050477 financed the
work of a consultant to develop space planning and design standards for modest,
functional and flexible court buildings that adapted international standards to the
Romanian practice and custom and ensured cost-effectiveness. This activity contributed

to the PDO (a) as it supported the implementation of the Government's program to
improve the judiciary. The standards were used as input in developing a manual for the
$90 million Court Infrastructure Rehabilitation component under the JRP. The manual
was envisioned to be used in rehabilitating/constructing about 25 locations under the JRP
and in any other similar projects with the courts in future. Implementation of this
component is however marginally unsatisfactory due to delays. It is likely that the JRP
will complete rehabilitation of 10 courthouses versus the projected 25 by its closing date.

The PPIBL did not finance TA to the Jiu Valley Region. The targeted TA that was
financed by the PIBL contributed to the PDO (a) as it helped implement the GOR's
reform program in the reduction of poverty and unemployment in the areas affected by
economic transition. It represented the first step before launching a projected Bank-
financed regional development loan that aimed at supporting private sector development
in areas hit by the economic transition, such as the Jiu Valley Region (JVR) to support
the related policy objectives of the PSAL2. The regional development loan did not
however materialize following changes in the Bank's assistance to Romania.

The PIBL financed the following preparatory TA:

 A household survey of business opportunities in the JVR to support an assessment of
     Competitiveness and Poverty Incidence in the JVR that resulted in a business plan
     and action plan approved by the GOR for the JV.

 A video/ audio conferencing system and equipment for the Jiu Valley Association44 to

      connecting people to training and conferences opportunities.
 An on-line information system for the collection of local taxes and charges. The
      system was implemented on a pilot basis for six Town Halls selected by the GOR for
      the implementation of the Comprehensive Development Framework. The six town
      halls use the system for local collection of taxes for those who want to pay online.
      Most of the benefits were generated by internal efficiency gains due to the
      restructuring of the business flow within the administrations.

1. (i) Public Expenditure Management

(a) Cash management within the Treasury system45

Background

In 1991 the National Bank of Romania (NBR) elaborated a timetable for the reform of
the Romanian payments system, structuring the process in two stages:

Stage 1: The main objective was to modernize the interbank payments system in the
national currency based on paper support, increasing the capacity of the NBR to
implement monetary policy through liquidity supervision during the day and starting the
transition towards a society with no cash. This was implemented by putting into operation
the national payments system on paper support, DECONT-BNR, in 1995. At this stage,
the average settlement duration of the payment instruments was about 3.65 days for a
payment order and 5.26 days for a transfer debit payment instrument.

Stage 2: The main objective was to implement an electronic system of transfer of funds
and registration and settlement of securities. The general objectives were to facilitate the
development of the economy by improving safety and efficiency of the interbank
payments system; to transition towards a society with no cash; and to set up a robust legal
framework for the payment systems with systemic importance and also, for the settlement
systems, and for transactions with Government securities.

The transition from a paper-based payment system to an electronic one was determined,
on the one hand, by development of the financial markets and the significant increase of


44The Government had approved a Development Strategy for the Jiu Valley Region prepared through a consultative process in the
region which involved all relevant development stakeholders, including central and local authorities. One of the outcomes of this
process, supported by the Bank as part of the Comprehensive Development Framework process in Romania, was the establishment of
the Jiu Valley Association (JVA) - a stakeholder partnership group that included representatives of the central and local public sectors,
private entities, and the community, and had a mandate to oversee the economic development of the region.
45The ICR provides a more detailed background and assessment of the Project's contribution to the Treasury modernization since it
was the largest sub-component under Part E.



                                                                 57

the activity carried out by the national payment system, and on the other hand, by the
need to shift towards a predominantly cashless society and by the improvements in the
cashless payments. Also, the final consumers requested for a safe, efficient, and low cost
payment services.

 Box2. The National Bank of Romania Electronic Payment System (EPS).
 In 2000-2005 the NBR had a paper-based interbank clearing and settlement system. The connection
 between the State Treasury and the NBR, where the Treasury held its accounts according to the
 legislation, was manual. The exchange of paper documents between the MOPF and the NBR was
 manually intensive at both ends because each document had to be entered into the Public Accounting IT
 system.

 The NBR and the Company for Funds Transfer and Settlement - TransFond S.A. established in May 2001
 - launched the work on implementing a fully automated real-time interbank EPS ­ STFD TransFond
 S.A.46 - funded by the EU-PHARE after the TransFond S.A. became operational. The TransFond S.A. was
 established due to Romania's commitment to revamp the domestic financial and banking infrastructure in
 order to access the EU. It became responsible for processing the interbank payments in Romania and, as
 such, it took over, as the NBR's agent, the operation of the paper-based payment system, which was thus
 outsourced by the NBR. The "Interbank Payment System" Project implemented by the NBR and
 TransFond under the EU PHARE project became operational in 2005 in three phases. At the
 incorporation date, the shareholders were the NBR and 28 commercial banks47.

 The EPS was designed as a single contact point for all the EPS participants (42 Romanian banks, the
 MOPF­the State Treasury) in order to provide customer services related to any issues which they might
 face in using the EPS system. According to its functional requirements, the implemented EPS was
 centralized with each participant entering payment instructions through the single point of access. This
 fundamental concept of the new system enabled the increasing of the system's safety and improving of the
 management of the participants' resources through a centralized ordering/sorting of the payments,
 depending on the priorities of the financial institutions. The participants to the EPS became the
 commercial banks operating in Romania and the Romanian Stock Exchange. The real time gross
 settlement (RTGS) and the government securities trading (GSRS) were architected on the SWIFTNet,
 while the net settlement (the Automated Clearing House; ACH) began to be performed on a TFDNet
 TransFonD's (market infrastructure) proprietary network.


The first institutional measure in the extensive Treasury reform was to establish a State
Treasury in 1992 (the Government Decision no.78/1992)48. It remedied the key


46STFD - TransFond S.A. is: (i) the main supplier of interbank low-value cashless payment services. Except for the card payments
(cleared by Visa and MasterCard), all low-value payments are cleared via an electronic system operated by STFD - TransFond S.A..,
i.e. SENT, and the paper-based clearing houses system; (ii) the operator of ReGIS, managed by the NBR, within the boundaries of the
mandate given by the NBR; and (iii) the technical operator of all 3 Electronic Payment System (EPS) components. The technical
infrastructure, computer infrastructure, applications, systems telecom networks and security infrastructure are all managed by STFD -
TransFond S.A., directly or by its partners.
47The system went live in three separate stages: (i) April 8th, 2005: the ReGIS became operational. The RTGS system named ReGIS
system processes the real-time settlement of large-value and/or urgent payments; (ii) May 13th, 2005: the first day of automated
clearing through the SENT system. The ACH (Automated Clearing House) component, registered under the SENT trade mark in
Romania. The State Treasury joined the other participants in the multilateral netting system; and (iii) October 3rd, 2005: the SaFIR
service was launched. This was the third EPS component that ensures the deposit and settlement of Government securities. The SaFIR
is the Romanian GSRS system. Once this stage was concluded, the EPS project implementation was considered to have been
completed. The TransFond was the technical operator of this system.
48The legal basis for the Treasury function of the MOPFP is the law on Public Finance (LPF) (Law 10/1991, further amended through
Law 72/July 12, 1996 republished through Law 500/August 13,2002) which describes broadly the roles and responsibilities of the
Treasury and the Government ordinance No 146/2002 on the Treasury which regulates in greater detail the operations of the Treasury.
The Treasury organization was established under this legal framework and now consists of two General Directorates (GD), namely the
General Directorate of Treasury and Public Debt and the GD of Treasury and Public Accounting within the MOPFP and a network of
treasury offices (42 + 6 territorial offices at the territorial level and over 305 state Treasury territorial units). Total staffing of the
Treasury at all these offices is about 6,500.

institutional weaknesses in the budget execution process in which, prior to the reform, the
budget was executed through the banking system, via a range of banks, and the Ministry
of Public Finance (MOPF) periodically deposited money in bank accounts held by the
spending units in commercial banks. The budget execution was assured by the NBR.
When the banking system developed and the NBR became more independent and mainly
focused on monetary policy regulation, the budget execution activity was transferred to
the Romanian Commercial Bank (BCR). Experimentally, the management of public
funds was done through Treasury in five counties. Having in mind that some sectors of
the economy did not benefit from enough resources, and it was consequently difficult for
the local budgets to be balanced with resources, it was necessary to find a new
mechanism/a financial instrument and a State Treasury was created mainly for the
following reasons:

 It was not possible for the MOPF to determine in a timely manner the balances in
    spending unit bank accounts and sizable idle balances could build up in them. Cash
    management was therefore weak.
 More importantly, the MOPF did not have any ex-ante control on the actual
    expenditures made by spending units to ensure that such expenditure was in
    accordance with budget appropriations. The MOPF relied on periodic reports from
    spending units detailing expenditure incurred by them. These reports were often
    received after considerable delays and the MOPF had no independent means of
    verifying the accuracy and authenticity of these reports.

After the establishment of the Treasury and a network of Treasury offices across the
country, spending unit Bank accounts in commercial banks were brought under the
control of the Treasury and balances consolidated in a Treasury Single Account (TSA) at
the NBR. The restructured budget execution process is summarized below:

 Following the MOPF's notification of the main budget administrators in line
    ministries (credit ordinators), the MOPF requested them to prepare and submit within
    20 days, quarterly breakdown of the granted appropriations, including the amounts
    required by their secondary and tertiary ordinators in subordinate units. Based on
    revenue projections, the MOPF issued monthly spending limits to spending units. The
    limits were communicated to the respective regional and local treasuries and copied
    to the institutions concerned, each of which had accounts in the Treasury from which
    payments could be made. On the basis of this information credit lines were opened
    for each institution containing details of the relevant budget chapter and category of
    expenditure.
 On receipt of goods and services, the institution checked the invoice and sent it to its
    designated local Treasury along with a payment order. The Treasury performed a
    control function by checking whether the expenditure was properly authorized and
    was within the spending limit for that institution and category of expenditure. If this
    was the case, the Treasury debited the institution's account accordingly and made the
    payment. Payments could be made in cash (e.g., for salaries) and via a payable order
    for goods and services. Payable orders were transmitted by the regional Treasuries to




                                              59

      a branch of the NBR where the Treasury held its accounts and debited the regional
      Treasury and credited the payee account.

These reforms were designed to eliminate the key weaknesses in the budget execution
process and ensured that:

 The Government has up-to-date and accurate information on the financial resources
      available to it and can make informed decisions on budget releases, borrowings and
      investments since all Government resources were now in bank accounts controlled by
      the Treasury and balances from any regional Treasury bank accounts were routinely
      consolidated in a State TSA held at the NBR's headquarters; and
 All expenditure transactions initiated by spending units were in accordance with the
      budget appropriations passed by the Parliament and within spending limits imposed
      by the MOPF taking into account revenue projections and cash availability.

These reforms addressed the key institutional weaknesses of the budget execution process,
and the consolidation of bank accounts in a TSA eliminated the idle balances in spending
units accounts. The ex-ante control exercised by Treasury units on payment requests from
spending units ensured that expenditure transactions were in accordance with budget
appropriations and within spending limits.

However, the realization of these reform objectives was critically dependent on:

 The information systems support and IT infrastructure available at the Treasury
      offices at the center and the regional and district branches which process spending
      unit transactions and enable the imposition of necessary ex ante controls before a
      transaction is passed for payment;
 The availability of a good telecommunications network that connects the central and
      regional Treasury systems and their ability to exchange information in a secure
      manner and in real time;
 The availability of a good electronic means of connecting the spending units to the
      Treasury to enable them to pass their transactions to the Treasury for processing;
 The availability of a good electronic connection between the Treasury offices and the
      banking network where the Treasury holds its accounts to enable it to process
      expenditure transactions; and
 The availability of an automated interbank clearing and settlement system that could
      provide an efficient and secure means of affecting payments initiated by the Treasury,
      consolidate balances from regional branches in a TSA, and receive accurate
      information on revenue receipts.

However, the available IT&C infrastructure in the Treasury and MOPF impeded the
capacity of the new Treasury to realize the full advantages afforded by implementation of
a Treasury system.49


49In the early years of the reform, the MOPF set up a basic network of information systems to support the Treasury functional
processes and transaction processing. The application software was built using FOXPRO. The applications were implemented under a



                                                                60

A Bank sponsored diagnostic and other similar analyses carried out in 2001-2003
highlighted the following weaknesses with the Treasury system:

 Lack of electronic links between the line ministries and the Treasury offices and
      fragility of the links between the Treasury office branches and the central offices;
 Lack of an automated interbank clearing and settlement system in the banking sector;
 Lack of secure and electronic connections between the Treasury network and the
      banking network;
 Existence of distributed data bases and absence of a central ledger data base; and
 Use of heterogeneous and outdated IT equipment in the Treasury network.

As a direct consequence of this, considerable resources were invested in manually
feeding data into the system at the different administrative levels. As a result, the speed
and accuracy of information transfer across the Treasury network and between the
Treasury and its clients (the spending units/line ministries) and the banking network were
severely impeded considerably reducing the realization of the main advantages that are
afforded by the implementation of a Treasury system.

On the functional side, the deficiencies in the IT and telecommunications infrastructure
resulted in the following weaknesses.

 The implementation of a distributed architecture and weak links between the
      subordinate and the central office meant that a central ledger containing all payment
      and accounting data could not be implemented. As a result of this, rapid collection,
      consolidation and preparation of overall system wide reports was severely impeded;
 Under the system described above, whereas the credit ordinators are required to
      record commitments and these are approved ex-ante by the MOPF controllers in
      spending units, such commitments were reported to the MOPF only on a quarterly
      basis. The Treasury therefore did not have a real time, on-line record of commitments
      before approving payment requests. This reduced its ability to monitor arrears,
      perform cash management and implement commitment accounting; and
 The lack of a central database of all transactions and lack of availability of historical
      data impedes analyses that require exploiting time series of data for several fiscal
      years.

The Bank and other donors made a set of recommendations and bench marks for
modernizing the Treasury operations based on various assessments made by them in
2001-2003. Their key features included the following:




distributed architecture with separate databases at subordinate Treasury offices. The systems at the local office were responsible for
carrying out the basic transaction processing that is required in processing payments for spending units and recording receipts.
Regional and Local Treasuries were connected via dial up connections to the central Treasury offices in the MOPF. Summary data
was forwarded to the higher levels of the Treasury network. At this time the NBR had a paper-based interbank clearing system and the
connection between the State Treasury and the NBR where the Treasury held its accounts was manual. The exchange of paper
documents between the Public Accounting Directorate and the NBR was manually intensive at both ends because each document had
to be entered into the Treasury system.



                                                                    61

 Modernizing the inter-bank clearing and settlement system used by the banking
   sector;
 Setting up a connection between the State Treasury and the interbank payment
   system;
 Renovation of the existing IT and telecommunications infra structure at the MOPF
   and at regional Treasury offices to enable a move from a distributed to a centralized
   architecture that would enable the setting up of a centralized public accounting
   ledger;
 The use of web-based internet and intranet technologies to enable better
   communications between regional and local offices and Treasury HQ, and between
   the line ministries and Treasury offices;
 The implementation of a centralized database containing up-to-date information on
   public investment contracts and commitments;
 The implementation of a system for efficient flow of information from the MOPF to
   the line ministries and the Treasury regarding budget releases - credit management
   work flows;
 Setting up of a central data warehouse comprising historical data for 7- 10 years to
   enable time series analysis; and
 Setting up of an internet portal for the MOPF's clients, including public institutions
   and providers of goods and services for these institutions, and for employee access.

The implementation of these recommendations involved investments for the following:

 Setting up an automated inter-bank clearing and settlement system and implementing
   technologies to enable the connection between the Treasury and the interbank
   clearing system;
 Installing and upgrading the server equipment and the center, the network
   connections between local and regional Treasury offices and line ministries and the
   center and deploying a new set of work stations across the network;
 Upgrading the application software to an industry standard relational database
   (ORACLE) and associated application development tools;
 Moving the application software from a client-server-based architecture to a web-
   based centralized architecture;
 Installing data warehousing software; and
 Upgrading the application software used by the Treasury to enable it to implement the
   additional functionalities including, the centralized accounting ledger, the
   commitments database; the budget release work flows.

The achievement of these benchmarks formed the specific objectives of the Bank's
intervention under the PIBL and PPIBL. Based on these recommendations, the MOPF
used part of these funds under PIBL and PPIBL to implement these recommendations
over the period 2003-2008.

                 on infrastructure in a market economy: public-private partnerships in a

The PIBL and PPIBL financed IT & C infrastructure and customized software
development to modernize the Treasury system established by Romania (in addition to
the considerable EU assistance), with significant efficiency and effectiveness
improvements in its operations. In addition, the PPIBL financed training of 121 staff
members from the MOPF under this sub-component. These activities contributed to the
PDO (b) as they helped implement the GOR's public expenditure management reforms.
The PAL policy objectives were partially achieved due to the lack of a formal medium
term expenditure framework. The GOR revised the legal framework of governing
Treasury functions by its own efforts.

The following outputs were designed, launched and developed with the assistance of the
PIBL and the PPIBL.

 Design, supply and installation of Information systems for connection of the
     state Treasury to the electronic interbank payment system (PIBL and PPIBL)

To become a participant to the Electronic Payment System (EPS) and to benefit from its
features (see Box 2), the MOPF needed to upgrade its own systems and establish a
connection to the TransFond. The Bank support for this project was provided through two
contracts. The first contract funded by PIBL started in 2004 implemented a turn key


                                                                63

system to connect the State Treasury to the EPS (TransFond). It included procurement of
hardware and software and development of a software application to interface the
Treasury systems with the TransFond and SWIFT. The contract implemented the
following technical conditions:

  Connection to the SWIFT, secured by a back-up line, for access to the ReGIS50 and
     the SaFIR51;
  Connection to a proprietary network (of the Romanian banks) that accesses the
     SENT52 and some additional functions;
  A back up and disaster recovery plan;
  An operating plan in relation with the EPS in case of malfunctions or destruction of
     the main centre;
  Hardware to install an on-line interface with the ReGIS and the SaFIR and the
     interface with the SENT;
  Provision of security of the installed software and hardware systems and the access
     to these;
  Audit of the implemented solution in order to obtain the final technical certification
     required by the TransFond and the NBR and necessary to access the EPS.

The MOPF (the State Treasury) became a direct participant (with the assigned BIC
TREZROBU) to the national settlement closed user group, for all the three subsystems:
the NBR's real time gross settlement (ReGIS), the TransFonD's net settlement (SENT)
and the Government bonds registration and settlement system (SaFIR) since the 2nd
quarter of 2005. Once the State Treasury became participant in the EPS, this eliminated
the preferential treatment granted to it in the old payment system. The State Treasury had
the same rights and obligations as other participants in the system (credit institutions in
Romania).

Obtaining the status of participant in this settlement system involved extensive efforts at
the State Treasury level, both from financial and human resources points of view, since
the solution that was to be developed included a number of business modules:

 a system for transferring funds in real time which enables automatic processing of
    payments at the central level between the State Treasury in the MOPF and economic
    operators (Treasury clients - public institutions and business community) through
    banking institutions with access to the interbank EPS operated by the TransFond;
 a control system based on a continuous accounting reconciliation of the operations
    that allows early detection and investigation of exceptions;
 the monitoring system of the liquidity in real time;
 an electronic platform for placement of securities by the MOPF in the primary market
    and a system for registration of issuance of Government securities;

 a system for continuous monitoring and control of IT&C resources and financial
    transactions; and
 a control system of the processes, operations and resources.

The system was further upgraded in June 2007 through another contract financed under
the PPIBL to ensure liquidity management, continuous accounting reconciliation and
competitive transactions report. This upgrade consisted of improving the efficiency of
performance of the STEPS, adding additional business functionalities and implementing
measures aimed at reducing the operational risk of financial transfers. This fulfilled a
requirement to ensure readiness and compliance with reforms necessary for the EU
accession.

These two contracts helped the STEPS to become compliant with the European financial
market regulations and financial industry standards. The STEPS is aligned with the
financial industry regulations by its full compliance with the SWIFT standards and its
readiness for the Target2 and SEPA. Since its implementation, the STEPS uses the EU
identification codes, such as BIC, IBAN and ISIN. The fact that the STEPS uses banking
instruments and standards creates an interoperability bridge with the business community.
Thus, the implementation of the STEPS dramatically improved the service provided by
the Treasury and Public Debt Directorate to the public administration and to the business
community both by ensuring the same day final settlement and reduced operational risk.
In particular, given the centralized architecture of the STEPS payment system engine and
the high level of straight-through-processing, all transactions flow is performed online in
real time. The Treasury clients place directly their payment orders to the closest Treasury
Unit which captures it electronically, processes it and consolidates it (through the
Treasury's proprietary network) to a central payment engine. The Treasury collections
are routed, according to their reference (IBAN account and fiscal number) to the client's
account. The funds transfers (payments and collections) are centralized, ensuring real
time cash management and forecast. By ensuring real-time and resilient straight-through-
processing of the funds transfer, the STEPS provides not only a higher velocity of fund
transfers and a diminished operational risk, but also competitive tools for public liquidity
management and successful debt administration.

Efficiency improvements of the STEPS are demonstrated by the following data:

 The move from a manual clearing and settlement mechanism used in 2002 to
    electronic, real-time system enable the Treasury to process 28,820,000 transactions in
    the first year (2005).
 The implementation of the new electronic payment system brings along a significant
    increase in the processing speed of the interbank payments. Final settlement can take
    place a few seconds (ReGIS53 and SaFIR54) or hours (SENT) after the payment
    instructions are received by the EPS. More precisely, the funds transfer from the
    payer's account to the beneficiary' account takes place as follows: (i) in real time (as

                                                                65

    soon as the funds are received from the sending participant) in case of the ReGIS and
    the SaFIR; and (ii) two hours at most after the funds are received in SENT (after
    clearing). SENT55 basically allows a payment order that a client presented at the
    bank's desk early in the morning to be submitted to settlement on the same day and
    the bank at the receiving end should be able to make that particular amount available
    to its client by the end of the bank operating day.
 The settled volume of transactions increased, as follows.
     ReGIS
           Payments: +75.49% between 4/2005 - 4/2006; +28.03% between 4/2006 ­

           Receipts: +52.86% between 4/2005 - 4/2006 ; +30.27% between 4/2006 ­
                4/2007; and +31.50% between 4/2007 ­ 4/2008.

           Receipts: +66.07% between 5/2005 - 5/2006; +24.78% between 5/2006 ­
                5/2007; and +37.31% between 5/2007 ­ 5/2008.
 The gross settlement transaction fee for the Government accounted for 27% of the
    level applicable in 5/2/2005, resulting in a net fee reduction of 72% in 2008.
 The settled volume of the MOPF's transactions (reflecting the Government
    expenditure and receipt transactions, payments through the State Treasury Electronic
    Payment System) increased between April 2005 and December 2008, as follows:

It is clear that the implementation of the new settlement system required substantial
investments. In this context, the costs related to the implementation of this system and
also, the interconnection with the EPS in Romania, cannot be analyzed separately from
the benefits this investment has on the State Treasury's customers through: (i) reducing
the financial costs, the settlement timing and streamlining of the payment circuits; (ii)
facilitate expansion of business activities on new markets; and (iii) providing of new
profitable and efficient services, such as e-invoicing, reconciliation and management of
liquidity.

In order to increase the visibility of the projects implemented by the State Treasury in the
payment area, the MOPF has participated, along with the provider of the centralized
payment solution of the State Treasury, to the SIBOS 2008 conference organized by the
SWIFT in Vienna. The SIBOS is a conference that is organized annually as the main
event in the financial industry (over 7000 participants from departmental and top
management in the most important financial banking institutions and specialized solution
all over the world).

The results of the successful implementation of the STEPS by the State Treasury have
been recognized also by awards by specialty magazines during 2007 and 2008. For
example:

 2007: Gala of Fin Media awards e-success prizes: the Romanian State Treasury, a
    SWIFT member, for supporting international banking industry standards and for its
    readines for TARGET2 and SEPA compliance;
 2008: Gala of Fin Media awards e-support prizes: for sustaining the adoption of the
    SEPA-compliant settlements in national currency and for its leading position in
    promoting the SEPA standards within both Romania's and EU's public institutions.

 Installation and upgrade of server equipment at the center, the network
    connections between local and regional Treasury offices and line ministries and
    the center and deployment of a new set of work stations across the network to
    support the migration from a distributed to a centralized architecture and the
    implementation of a real time public accounting ledger (PIBL and PPIBL)

As mentioned above, the connection between the STEPS and TransFond was at the
central level of the Treasury and the NBR. This required that Treasury move from its
distributed to a centralized architecture where the main transaction databases are located
at the center instead of being distributed across a network of databases spread across the
local and regional Treasury offices. This required that the server capacity at the central
level be augmented and the links that enable data transfer between the subordinate
Treasury offices and the center be strengthened.

The upgrade to the IT & C infra structure to accommodate a centralized public
accounting ledger was carried out under two contracts funded by the PIBL and the
PPIBL.

The main objective of the first contract was to enhance the IT technical infrastructure for
the Treasury at all the three levels of its organization structure, including, servers at the
central level, work stations, printing facilities and communications equipment. This
upgrade would support the first stage of migration to a central database using existing
versions of the Oracle DBMS and client server technology and also implement a back-up
and recovery system. This contract supplied the work stations, servers and systems
software and communications equipment for the system to function effectively. The
contract also supplied ancillary equipment, including printers, scanners, UPSs and office
automation software.

Based on this contract, 2,615 workstations and 814 printers were supplied for about
5,000 employees in the Treasury offices across the country. The application software for
this migration was developed in-house. The General Directorate for IT from MOPF
developed a software application which was implemented country wide on the upgraded
infrastructure in January 1st, 2005.

At the end of phase I, the new application system was in a position to consolidate data
entered in local offices in a central database in order to ensure a secure connection
between the Treasury systems and the TransFond. The system also enabled all data
received from TransFond (e.g. in respect of Treasury receipts) to be stored centrally and
dispatched to local offices.

Procurement of additional IT & C infra structure to support the migration to the
Centralized architecture and implementation of the public accounting ledger -
phase 2: December 2004

In phase II of the implementation of the migration of the centralized architecture and
implementation of the centralized public accounting ledger, the MOPF completed the



                                               68

move to a centralized architecture and procured central infrastructure to enable
implementation of web-enabled technologies which would allow the end-users to access
the centralized Oracle database using a browser and a web application server. The
Project financed the purchase of the Oracle DBMS software and application
development tools and also paid for support/maintenance services for two years.

This infrastructure was supposed to also support better interface with the application
systems in the tax administration area and in the budget management area which were
also moving to a centralized architecture.

 Technical assistance for improvement of the information systems for the
    Treasury, public accounting and budget management (PIBL and PPIBL)

The new ORACLE client server application to consolidate data at the central level in a
central database and also to deploy data received through the TransFond to the
operational public accounting units mentioned above was implemented in a client-server
environment. The next phase of the transition was to implement technologies to enable
end-users to take advantage of web-enabled technologies to connect to the central
database using a browser and a web-application server to provide additional
functionalities. Some of the IT &C infrastructure for this was procured under the second
contract detailed above.

To assist the Government in this migration and systems upgrade, TA support was first
provided under a contract funded by the PPIBL to hire a consultant to define the
technical specifications of equipment and services required for the upgrade of
information systems in the MOPF and to assist the Government in their procurement and
implementation. This assignment provided project management technical assistance to
plan and implement the necessary activities required for the systems upgrade.

The project then provided TA under two contracts to assist the Treasury in designing
and doing the necessary application software development that would be necessary in
their existing information systems. The objective of the first TA assignment funded by
the PIBL was to hire consulting services for preparing the migration from the distributed
database architecture to a centralized architecture and from client server technology to
web enabled technologies. This assignment defined the centralized architecture of the
data base and defined the approach and road map for migration to this architecture.
Under the second assignment funded by the PPIBL funded by the project the following
activities were carried out.

 Migration of the public accounting IT systems towards a centralized architecture
    with a web-enabled interface;
 Implementation of information systems to create integrated work flows between the
    MOPF and the budget holders to support the budget distribution, release and other
    budget related processes necessary during budget execution;




                                             69

 Creation of a central data warehouse to store fiscal data for 7-10 years and provide
    the MOPF with capabilities for carrying out time series and other analyses on this
    data;
 To implement/enhance the internet MOPF Portal to enable its clients (public
    institutions and employees) to access the central database and the data warehouse;
    and
 To provide specialized training to the MOPF staff in the use of these systems.

 Provision of additional equipment and IT infra structure upgrades to support
     the set of information systems and functionalities developed for the Treasury
     (PPIBL)

To fully implement the new systems designed under the technical assistance described
above, the IT & C infrastructure across the Treasury network needed further upgrades.

Support was provided under two contracts. The main objective of the first contract was
to provide for servers and associated equipment at the central level that will allow the
implementation of the web-enabled applications designed under the contracts described
above. The infrastructure was also to allow better interfaces with the application systems
for tax administration and budget management. Support under the second contract
provided work stations and associated equipment like printers, scanners UPSs, etc.,
equipment to the subordinate Treasury units.

The MOPF did not implement the system for recording commitments and registering
public investment contracts under the PPIBL funding, as per the MOPF's IT strategy,
because it would not have been possible to complete it within the duration of the project.
Further, the establishment of such a database would also require participation from the
line ministries and spending units that enter into the contracts in addition to the MOPF's
participation. The MOPF is planning to implement it using its own resources or the EU
funds in the future after agreement has been reached with the line ministries and spending
units as to their responsibilities for keeping it up-to-date.

Thus, until the system for recording commitments and registering public investment
contracts is implemented, budget execution at the Treasury will be carried out on a cash
basis. Though the budget ordinators at spending units would ensure that commitments are
recorded, the Treasury has no advance knowledge of these commitments. This can
potentially affect the ability of the Treasury to monitor all commitments entered into by
spending units and determine spending unit cash flow requirements unless ordinators
made an effort to inform the Treasury well in advance of, for example, large payments
that would become due in the coming months.

The targeted TA that was financed by the Dutch TF054659 and the PPIBL contributed to
the PDO (b) as it helped implement the GOR's reforms in the public expenditure
management and policy formulation. The PAL policy objectives were partially achieved
due to the lack of a formal medium term expenditure framework.

The Dutch Grant TF054659 and the PPIBL financed the following TA to:

 Help implement the budget reform in the MOPF (as well as in the General Secretariat
     of Government, GSG, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Education, Health, Ministry of
     Transportation and Ministry of Environment as part of a wider TA program to
     support the budget process reform under the PAL; see Parts E.5, 8, 10-13). The
     MOPF advisor identified a number of practical key reform measures for 2006-2007 to
     improve the budget process, such as: (i) a revised policy-centered budget preparation
     calendar; (ii) guidelines for simplified version of the `resource choice' strategic
     planning process; (iii) practical steps for adapting the first guidelines developed by
     the MOPF in March 2006 for pre-budget planning in line ministries56 to become the
     means of implementing the `resource choice' strategic planning in all line ministries;
     and (iv) knowledge transfer in several workshops organized for staff from the MOPF,
     the GSG and line ministries to exchange views on the progress of the assignment
     (involving about 100-200 participants). The MOPF advisor worked most closely with
     the GSG advisor who together made important contributions to the
     legislation/procedures passed by the GSG in 2007-2008 to establish the strategic
     planning and policy formulation framework and procedures (see E.8). The guidelines
     for preparing the budget have improved significantly, following the assistance of the
     advisor (unfortunately, the numerous budget rectifications within the year make those
     ceilings largely redundant). The advisors in the line ministries, in turn: (i) were
     involved with developing strategic planning processes in their ministries and
     preparing the newly required strategic plans; (ii) provided input to their ministries'



56The MOPF instructed line ministries to present information on strategic planning by completing a newly-designed policy matrix and
to submit information on program funding requirements in advance of the annual budget preparation in March 2006.



                                                                 71

     submissions for the National Development Plan for the MOPF; and (iii) made
     recommendations on the proposed financing system changes and their impact.
 Strengthen the in-house capacity of the Directorate for Macroeconomic Analysis and
     Financial Policies in the MOPF for building the forecasts of budgetary revenues and
     expenditures and for evaluating the macroeconomic impact of various tax changes
     with a view to proposing more appropriate policy measures to the Government. In the
     previous years, the MOPF had relied on external work. The consultant delivered the
     customized macro-economic model for policy analysis and medium term forecasts
     and training for 6 staff members from the Macroeconomic Division of the Directorate
     in the use of the model. The model is used by the Directorate to check the consistency
     and coherency of the macroeconomic framework used in the budget preparation
     process. Moreover, the model was used in the preparation process of the Convergence
     Program for the sensitivity analysis and the estimation of structural, cyclical budget
     components, including output gap and potential GDP. The Directorate updates it
     quarterly with the new sets of data and runs it on a regular basis. Going forward, the
     model will be used in the process of building a medium term budgetary framework
     which is a top priority for the new Government.
 Organize a two-day "Romania Conference on Growth, Competitiveness and Real
     Income Convergence" in Bucharest in April 2008, including finalization of the
     agenda, identification of speakers, logistics and preparation of a book of speeches.
     The conference was open to the informed public and the press, and it provided a
     forum for discussing which kind of growth sustaining public policies in the area of
     labor markets, education and human capital, infrastructure (particularly network
     infrastructure), agriculture, and energy could promote the growth and real income
     convergence of Romania as it tries to integrate with the EU. The book of the
     conference proceedings was distributed to the participants and all the Government
     agencies.

The Dutch Grants TF050477 and TF054659 financed the following TA for:

 (i) An upgrade the existing UNCTAD Debt Management System (DMFAS version
    5.3) for the State Treasury Management Unit in the MOFP and the NBR; (ii) a two-
    year maintenance agreement (until mid-2008); and (iii) training of the officials on the
    system and on formulating debt strategies and debt sustainability analysis (including a
    2-week trip to Bucharest for a senior debt management expert). The upgraded system
    has been in use since 2006 and its maintenance is currently provided for free by the
    UNCTAD. This system will be replaced by a new computerized system (FTI-STAR)
    at the time when an entire database for public debt will have been created by the end
    of June 200957.
 Nonexclusive and nontransferable right to use the Bloomberg Professional service
    information, data, software and equipment from 2006 until mid-2008 for the State
    Treasury Management Unit in the MOPF. The terminals were installed on the
    MOPF's premises and have been operational since 2005.

With regards to other activities envisioned in the PAD, the MOPF implemented them
without the PPIBL's assistance. In accordance with the recommendations made by both
the IMF and the World Bank, the GOR improved the legal framework for public debt
management by adopting a new public debt law in 2004 in line with the acquis. The new
law: (i) eliminated the possibility of the line ministries directly contracting loans with the
guarantee of the State; (ii) made clarifications regarding the integration of the local public
debt as part of the public debt; and (iii) clearly defined the objectives set out in the public
debt management process, as well as the attributions of the State institutions in this
intricate process. Based on further recommendations by the World Bank, the IMF and the
foreign experts involved in the EU PHARE Project for "Improving the Treasury System
in Romania", the GOR passed Emergency Ordinance 64/2007 on the Public Debt,
introducing changes, such as the following: (i) the MOPF can contract new Government
public debt for financing the budget deficits and refinancing the existing Government
public debt and can issue guarantees for loans/grant on-lending for beneficiaries only
based on laws, in such cases needing the approval of the Parliament; (ii) starting 2009,
MOPF takes over, for management purposes, the loans contracted by the main spending
units with the guarantee of the State, or the loans directly contracted by the MOPF for on-
lending to the main spending units, in a move to centralize all the Government public
debt operations for which the only repayment source is the State budget and social
security funds at the MOPF level, for a more efficient management of the budgetary
resources and public debt; and (c) the obligation was introduced to elaborate the
Government public debt management strategy on a medium term, which may be revised
annually, and to define the strategic objective of the Government debt management
which is to secure the financing needs at a Government level, along with minimizing the
costs in the long run and reducing the risks associated with the Government debt
portfolio.58

In addition, the public debt department of the MOPF was reorganized in April 2007 to a
modern debt agency under the General Treasury and Public Debt Directorate by merging
the three former general directorates involved in the public debt management. The new
Directorate includes the contracting activity (front office), the risk analysis and
management and the liquidity management (middle office) and public debt payments
(back office).

The targeted TA in the area of Government accounting that was financed by the Dutch

policy objectives were partially achieved due to the lack of a formal medium term
expenditure framework. The additional TA that was financed by the Dutch Grant

PAL2-3 milestones for improving the transparency in the functioning of the firms. The
PAL policy objective of improving the transparency of firms was partially achieved.

The Dutch Grant TF050477 financed the following TA for public financial management
and government accounting to:

 Help improve the institutional capacity of the MOPF (and line ministries) for strategic
   management of the PFM reform and, in particular, program budgeting, accruals
   accounting, internal audit and external audit of financial statements and performance,
   as well as treasury cash management. The TA was to ensure that the Romanian
   government could meet the EU requirements under financial control which would
   facilitate the accession to the EU. The advisor: (i) helped establish and make
   operational the Inter-ministerial Committee for the PFM reform; (ii) prepared the
   Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for the PFM reform for the period 2005-2007 to
   facilitate access to the EU (these were PAL1-2 conditions); (iii) helped lead efforts to
   manage the reform based on the recommended SDP that was approved; as well as (iv)
   monitored the progress of achieving the PAL triggers and conditionality related to the
   PFM Reform. In cooperation with the other budget advisors (see Part E.1.i.b), the
   advisor helped the MOPF and line ministries implement recommendations of the
   Country Financial Accountability Assessment, included in SDP, and made further
   recommendations which are under implementation.
 With regards to results in accrual accounting, it has been introduced starting with
   January 1, 2006 for all the public institutions, but despite certain progress, this is
   happening in practice to a limited extent, mostly when it comes to reporting budget
   execution results because (i) the Treasury does not require copies of all contracts
   signed, thus lacking a complete view on commitments (as opposed to other countries,
   such as Moldova); (ii) the budget formulation is still done on a cash basis, and the
   entities in practice report both on a cash basis, as well as on an accrual basis; (iii) the
   fixed assets revaluation has been carried out on a regular basis and there are
   procedures for regular revaluations; (iv) there is no full commitment budgeting,
   although there is some progress with a relatively new concept introduced (as an "off
   budget" item) - "credite de angajament" - commitment budgets, which is used for
   example for multi-annual projects, and this is in addition to the standard regular
   budget openings - "credite bugetare" - regular budget openings; (v) there is no
   centralized public procurement contract database system; and (vi) the line ministries
   and the other budgetary entities do not have direct access to the Treasury systems.

The Dutch Grants TF050477 and TF054659 as well as the PPIBL financed the following
TA for corporate financial reporting:

 Assist the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (CCRF) develop, promote
    and coordinate implementation of the first phase of the CAP to improve financial
    reporting in Romania on the basis of the recommendations of the 2003 Accounting
    and Auditing Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). The
    recommendations were included in an updated version of the CAP and consequently
    implemented. Recommendations included, for example, suggestions: (i) to strengthen



                                             75

 accounting and auditing professional bodies; (ii) to reform accounting education; (iii)
 to create an oversight system; and (iv) on which provisions in the Romanian
 legislation related to financial audit to transpose the 8th Company Law Directive.
 Based on the recommendations, the CCRF made a decision to establish the
 Romanian Accounting Group (RAG) to address the issues arising from the adoption
 of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the increased
 influence of the IFRS on national accounting requirements in Romania.
 Assist the CCRF to create the framework for establishing the RAG, including its
 overall architecture, organization structure, resources and governance arrangements,
 as well as procedures and decision-making processes for the main functions and the
 roles and responsibilities of other relevant stakeholders. In addition, the consultant
 gave substantial contribution to further comply with the 8th Directive. The
 recommendations were included in the first draft of the Law on the Statutory Audit,
 mainly to transpose Directive 2006/43/CE regarding the statutory audit of the annual
 accounts and of the consolidated accounts and the setting up of the RAG. The draft
 Law was enacted by the relevant Emergency Government Ordinance of June 24,
 2008 and was ratified on November 7, 2008, with a delay. Once implemented, it
 provides a unified structure and central source of technical expertise on the IFRS in
 Romania. The RAG has however not been established yet.
 Assist the MOPF to further implement the 8th Directive on Statutory Audit and, in
 particular, to create a framework for organising an effective system of public
 oversight on statutory auditors and audit firms. The consultant helped prepare a draft
 law regarding implementation of the 8th Directive. The recommendations were
included into the above Law on Statutory Audit.
 Assess the national legislation and practice of liberal professions in accounting and
 auditing area, based on the recommendations of the above first assignment, to ensure
 consistency with the EU and international standards and to propose a clear and logic
 demarcation of respective roles and responsibilities of the MOPF and of both
 professional bodies concerned (i.e. the Chamber of Financial Auditors of Romania
 (CAFR) and the Body of Expert and Licensed Accountants of Romania (CECCAR).
 The recommendations urged the CAFR and the CECCAR to: (i) strengthen their
 operations in a number of key areas; (ii) suggested the professional organisations, the
 MOPF, and the auditor/audit public oversight body (when created) focus their efforts
 and resources on a number of areas; and (iii) proposed an action plan to update the
 CAP. The MOPF endorsed the recommendations and included the recommended
 action plan to the updated CAP, including actions to ensure segregation of the roles
 of the MOPF, CAFR and CECCAR. The next step is the setting up of the public
 oversight body.
 Provide a practical training course to 50 representatives from the regulatory bodies
 (the MOPF, the NBR, the ISC, the National Securities Commission and the Pension
 Supervision Commission) on the IFRS implementation in the second half of 2007.
 The program provided: (i) 20 days of initial training to all the participants; (ii) then
 specialized training from 10 to 20 days separately to each regulatory body on the
 IFRS transition issues arising in the special regulatory areas; and (iii) a five-day final
 session with all participants on the most complex issues arising within the program
 and required participation in debates and presentations on these topics.

The targeted TA that was financed by the Dutch Grant TF050477, the PPIBL and the
GOR contributed to the PDO (b) as it helped implement the Government's reforms in
public expenditure management. The PAL policy objectives were partially achieved due
to the lack of a formal medium term expenditure framework.

Following on the previous training funded by the EU PHARE, the MOPF through the
Central Unit for Internal Public Audit Harmonization launched a training project for
internal auditors from various organizations, such as the MOPF, Ministry of Industry,
Ministry of Justice, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of
Transport, Town Hall of Bucharest Ministry of Agriculture, and the Fiscal
Administrations. Training supported the decentralization of internal audit into ministries
and agencies launched after 2002. The Dutch TF050477 financed preparatory training to
42 internal auditors in the internal audit units of the above organizations for obtaining the
CIA certification that they were preparing for, with the aim of further transferring the
knowledge to other internal auditors. Three of the participants successfully completed the
CIA exam in May 2006. Some of the CIA auditors trained other internal auditors under
the umbrella of IIA-Romania (now there are 120 internal auditors). This training
complemented the extensive internal audit training carried out since 2005 with the GOR's
and the EU's funding.

Overall, a government-wide internal audit system has been initially established,
including: (i) the Law on Public Internal Audit from 2004 that regulates the organization
(the Public Internal Audit Committee, the Central Harmonization Unit for Public Internal
Audit, and internal audit services within public entities), types of audit (system,
performance and financial audits), audit planning, tasks of internal audit, and framework
for professional training; (ii) the requirement for public entities to have their own internal
audit unit (or, for smaller entities, to use the services of the parenting ministry); and (iii)
professional continued education is required by the law for all internal auditors. However,
much more capacity is required, especially at the rural level, to fill in the available posts
of internal auditors and build skills. Thus, all line ministries and large public agencies
have their own internal audit unit with 2,159 posts of internal auditors out of which 1807
are occupied. At the level of local public administration, there are 2,159 posts of internal



                                                                 77

auditors out of which 983 are occupied. An EU-funded twinning project is under
implementation to improve the internal audit function at the rural level and to assure the
adequate competencies and skills for internal auditors in the public sector.

The PPIBL did not finance acquisition of an IT system, including a data base, as initially
planned for the use of internal auditors to provide information on cases when
reconciliations between financial documents of the taxpayers (i.e. the invoice of the seller
and the cash book of the buyer) did not match. This initial request was related to the
MOPF's efforts in the early 2001 to improve the revenue collection because at that time
there was a large tax evasion. The issue was addressed by the new legal framework
drafted and specifically by the Fiscal Code, and there was no need to finance the initially
requested TA from the PPIBL.

The targeted TA that was financed by the Dutch TF054659 contributed to the PDO (b) as
it helped achieve the PAL 2 milestone for an improved decentralization framework. The
Grant financed the work of a consultant to carry out a review of the proposed legal and
institutional framework package for intergovernmental fiscal relations and local
governance finance and fiscal decentralization reform issues. The consultant made a set
of short and medium-term policy recommendations to move forward the reform agenda.
The GOR incorporated many of the recommendations into the legal and institutional
framework for the decentralization reform enacted in 2006; some were reversed in 2008
but reinstated in the 2009 budget by the new GOR.

The targeted TA that was financed by the Dutch TF050477 and the PPIBL contributed to
achieving the PDO (b) as it helped implement the Government's reform program for
public expenditure management. The PAL policy objectives were partially achieved due
to the lack of a formal medium term expenditure framework.

The PPIBL and the Dutch Grant TF050477 financed the following TA to:

 Draft a project implementation plan and a project operational manual for the planned
     Bank-financed Revenue Administration Reform Project (FY06). This TA was used to
     help the NAFA to assess its TA needs under the planned project. Eventually, the
     GOR did not approve the project at negotiations in 2006.
 Build the NAFA's capacity for compliance monitoring during 2007. In cooperation
     with the NAFA, the on-site advisor: (i) helped define a system of indicators to
     estimate tax compliance and a model to estimate non-collected revenues and VAT
     fraud; (ii) helped develop a system of mathematical models at the macroeconomic
     level for estimating revenues and tax compliance; (iii) recommended setting up a
     separate directorate for monitoring performance indicators; and (iv) provided
     practical recommendations for improving services to/communication with taxpayers.
     Based on the recommendations, the NAFA: (i) implemented the macroeconomic
     model referred above and tested it during the 2008 budget revision process; (ii) uses
     the analytical model in the discussions with the MOPF regarding the collection
     targets; (iii) set up a directorate general for strategic planning and monitoring the
     collection of budgetary claims by merging the planning and monitoring units; and (iv)
     carried out a customer survey and took a number of measures to reduce the
     administrative burden and to improve the efficiency of operations from the
     customer's point of view60.




60For example, companies can submit online tax returns country-wide; individuals receive the forms for tax returns by mail; tax
payers can access a database containing most frequently asked questions and answers (funded by the EU); overall, tax payers have
available more information on the NAFA's web-portal; and taxpayers receive more information on issues related to taxes and social
contributions through mass media than in the past.




                                                                   79

 Provide recommendations to the NAFA on organization structure and management
 system (for headquarters/regional office network, special taxpayer units),
 consolidation of functions, managerial roles, accountability, governance, internal
 control, risk management, evaluation of managerial performance, monitoring,
 reporting, and management information. The recommendations that were to be
 implemented during the planned project were accepted and implemented or are
 planned to be implemented. For example, (i) support functions, including the IT
 department, were transferred from the MOPF to the NAFA in 2007; (ii) the NAFA
 prepared its first strategy in 2007; (iii) it increased staff in the headquarters from 450
 in 2007 to 1,300 in 2008 to better coordinate the territorial activity (although it still
shares management of the county offices with the MOPF); (iv) the NAFA College
(having a consultative role for the management) and the Endowment Committee have
 been set up, and (v) an internal commission was established to develop
 managerial/internal control.
 Draft a revised legal framework to harmonize the tax base for collecting payroll taxes
and social contributions and to create a simplified and integrated declaration and
payment environment (previously, the legal provisions were part of different pieces of
legislation). The work was done in coordination with the Inter-ministerial Committee
and in cooperation with the NAFA. Part of the proposed provisions was adopted
separately, in an Emergency Ordinance of the Government, in October 2007. As a
consequence, the tax base for the social security contributions (pension's fund)
approached significantly the tax base for the income tax (defined in the Fiscal Code)
and the base for calculating contributions to the health fund. However, even though
the institutions involved in the process had previously agreed on the principles
 proposed by the consultant, the Inter-ministerial Committee did not reach an
 agreement regarding the elimination of exceptions in the tax base for the
 contributions to the unemployment fund and decided in March 2008 to postpone the
 implementation of the proposed legal framework and the single tax return until 1st of
 January 2010. However, there are expectations that the proposed legal framework and
 the implementation of the single tax return would move forward during the new
 Government that has announced some reforms of the social contributions tax base and
 accepted the idea of regulating the social contribution's collection by the Fiscal Code
 and not by special pieces of legislation. In addition, as a result of this TA an inventory
 of the information needs was made for the NAFA and the Social Houses in order to
 redesign the information flow between the tax payers, the fiscal administration and
 the social houses. Further, after the conclusion of the consultant mission, a model for
 the future single tax return was made in the beginning of 2008. The single tax return
 is supposed to replace the existing four present tax returns which are submitted to the
 NAFA and to the Social Houses.
 Draft an overall strategy and policy framework and developmental priorities on
 information management and the IT&C technology management in cooperation with
 the NAFA. Based on the strategy drafted by the consultant, the NAFA's IT functions
 and infrastructure were separated from the MOPF in October 2007. This was the key
 recommendation and the first step in the full separation. The recommendations are
 being further developed and implemented under the EU funds. Thus, PHARE 2005
 and 2006 are funding a series of contracts for services and goods to develop the



                                             80

     NAFA's IT&C system and the information management at the organization level.
     Importantly, the NAFA has now horizontal projects affecting all organizational and
     decisional structures and activities within the NAFA, such as electronic documents
     management and archives, identity and information management. In addition, there
     has been developed a concept for a major IT project that would result in the
     unification of the administration system for individuals and legal persons. This
     project is being implemented with the consulting assistance of the Spanish Fiscal
     Administration since May 2008 and is expected to last for two years.

As a result of the NAFA's efforts and TA, the administrative burden to tax payers has
been reduced, and effectiveness of the functioning of the tax administration has improved,
as demonstrated by the following:

 The administrative burden to tax payers has been reduced, for example, as follows: (i)
     special administrative structures have been set up for medium sized taxpayers
     (companies) at the level of each district and at the level of Bucharest municipality to
     improve quality of services; (ii) the procedures for tax submission have been
     modernized and simplified, respectively, as follows: (a) starting with January 1st,
     2008, the tax returns are submitted in electronic format (for all districts and for all
     companies/legal persons); (b) the payment to the single account for the correct payers
     was introduced for the first time in September 2007 and extended for all categories of
     taxpayers in January 2008; (c) tax payments by credit cards have been made possible
     since October 2008, essentially for the physical authorized persons; (d) starting from
     2007, the certificate for fiscal records has been issued on the spot, in the presence of
     the taxpayer; and (e) a database containing most frequent questions and answers
     related to tax matters is available for civil servants and, partially, for taxpayers.
 Effectiveness of the functioning of the tax administration has improved, as follows:
     (a) there is a central database and is used for the application "administration of
     individual taxpayers" since the end of 2007; (b) in accordance with the EU
     requirements, the VIES and SEED systems were implemented for the intra-
     community exchange of information (before the end of 2006); (c) better measures
     have been carried out to abate arrears61 in the economy, a policy for preventing the
     incurring of new arrears has been adopted and specific related regulations have been
     improved; (d) a risk analysis for combating tax evasion has been developed; (e) a
     series of guidelines, methodologies and themes have been elaborated, with a view to
     increase efficiency and effectiveness of fiscal inspections; and (f) the elaboration of a
     methodology for the use of electronic control in fiscal inspections and the
     improvement and the update of the system of procedures for fiscal inspections are
     underway.




61Arrears as of % of GDP have decreased: from 4.3% in 2006 to 2.9% in 2007 and to 2.5% in 2008. The stock of arrears has
decreased by 19.4% from 2006 to 2007 (from 14.711,6 millions RON to 11.861,9 millions RON).

The targeted TA that was financed by the PPIBL, the Dutch TF050477 and the EU
contributed to the PDO (b) as they helped implement the GOR's reform program for
public expenditure management. The PAL policy objectives were partially achieved due
to the lack of a formal medium term expenditure framework.

The PPIBL and the Dutch Grant TF050477 financed the following TA to:

 Supply and install modern IT and office equipment and systems (notebooks and
     computers, printers, USB memory sticks, servers, software) to the headquarters
     and/or 42 territorial offices of the Court of Accounts for carrying out their daily work
     (in particular, the county offices were poorly endowed with IT equipment). The TA
     also supported the expansion of the "national data exchange system" between the
     territorial offices and the headquarters that had been designed and piloted on the EU
     PHARE funds and that facilitated documents exchange in electronic format based on
     a Lotus Domino platform. To complete its establishment, the TA helped extend the
     "national data network" by supplying a storage and archiving data system for the
     exchanged data through the NDN and a number of workstations in order to increase
     the network's nodes number. The workstations procured under this contract were
     installed throughout the county offices for the main purpose of covering the
     communication needs between all the departments within each of the county offices.
     The following IT equipment was supplied and installed:
 The Dutch TF050477 financed two training activities: (i) training courses for staff of
     the Court of Accounts organized by the General Accounting Office Washington D.C.
     and (ii) a training seminar on budgeting and cost control for 3 staff members from
     the MOF.

                                system. The law was however not approved and          on salary setting
                                the strategy was not implemented.


The TA that was financed by the PPIBL contributed to the PDO (b) as it helped
implement a specific PAL1 benchmark about a study on the pay, grading and
employment management within the central administration and contributed to the PAL3
benchmark on the civil service law on salary setting. The PAL policy objectives were not
achieved as the PAL was cancelled and the objectives were designed to be achieved after
all the three PAL phases had been completed.

The PPIBL financed the TA to:

 Carry out a survey comparing private and public sector salaries for similar positions
      and to provide a replicable methodology for estimating civil service salaries and their
      wage bill impacts which would ensure consistent competitiveness (across positions)
      between civil service and comparable private sector positions. This review was a
      PAL1 benchmark. The consultant provided several civil service salary reform options,
      each of which ensured roughly consistent competitiveness across civil service
      positions and yielded a particular overall wage bill impact (the latter was related to
      the issue of fiscal sustainability of the wage bill). This information was used as an
      input to produce a strategy for establishing a unitary pay system for civil service
      under the second contract.
 (i) Design a 4-7 year pay and employment management implementation strategy and
      action plan based on the previous assignment and work funded by the EU PHARE;
      (ii) draft a pay framework law (a draft Law on Civil Service Salary Setting) for a
      unitary pay system for the civil service; and (iii) helped develop the secondary
      legislation necessary for the unitary pay system implementation. The law was
      however not approved and the strategy was not implemented.

The targeted TA that was financed by the PPIBL, Dutch Grant TF050477 and TF054659
contributed to achieving the PDO (b) as they either helped implement or contributed to
specific PAL benchmarks in the area of judicial reforms or business environment. The
PAL policy objectives were partially achieved either because they were targeted to be
completed after all the three PAL phases.

The PPIBL financed four consultant assignments to assist the MOJ to:

 Identify the needs towards restructuring the organizational structure of the court
     system and enhancing the court administration. While this TA did not lead to a final
     court rationalization strategy, the consultants' recommendations that were mainly
     linked to the new procedural provisions and new competencies of magistrates and
     courts described in the new drafted codes (the civil procedural code and the penal
     procedural code) are expected to be reconsidered and applied at the moment when the
     new codes will be approved. In addition to this input, the findings of the TA were



                                                               84

     used to design the JRP to help implement court rationalization. Thus, based on this
     study, the SCM has recently considered some of the recommendations and developed
     a court rationalization plan with a specific proposal on the court of first instances
     restructuring. The SCM is launching a larger consultancy under the JRP for
     developing a comprehensive plan for optimization of the court system.
 Further define the role, functions and status of economic managers and to design a
     selection process and a training program for economic managers63. This TA helped
     implement the requirements of the 2004 legal package and further amendments in
     2005. The consultant identified the training needs of economic managers and made
     recommendations on their specific job descriptions for courts and prosecutors' offices,
     segregating the roles and duties of economic managers and court presidents and other
     involved parties, and, most importantly, on a training curricula and train-the-trainers
     plan for economic managers. The proposed improved job description and selection
     process for economic managers in courts were used in the regulation on economic
     managers (that was the PAL2 benchmark). In addition, the JRP is following up on
     developing the framework for economic management of the courts (and expects to
     develop training activities for court presidents and personnel).
 Provide storage area network systems for the MOJ and the SCM to support their
     efforts in developing the automated statistical system in the court system. The judicial
     IT system (ECRIS project64) had been developed with support of the EU PHARE.
     Part of the courts, prosecutor's offices and penitentiaries had been endowed with
     software applications and hardware. At that time, new data (new judicial indicators)
     were being added to the database and the new storage area network systems enabled
     the MOJ and SCM to use the updated data more efficiently. This contributed to
     improving the management of the court system by the MOJ and SCM (allocation of
     cases per judge/ court/ region, budgetary management, human resources management
     etc).
 Support implementation of some essential changes in the budget formulation and
     execution process at the level of the MOJ, the SCM, the courts and the prosecutors'
     offices65 that had been introduced since 2004. The TA was part of the larger TA to
     improve program budgeting funded by the Dutch TF054659 (see E.1.i.b). The
     consultant drafted a manual for planning and budgeting future investments in the



63The "economic manager" program was institutionalized with the 2004 Law on the organization of the judiciary that provided for the
transfer of economic and financial responsibilities to the courts and established the role and duties of the economic managers, as well
as the criteria for his/her appointment. Later amendments, adopted in July 2005, introduced additional tasks for the court managers, as
well as modifications with regard to the competency requirements of the economic managers. By these amendments, the economic
managers were also responsible for: the efficient utilization of funds received from the state budget, social security budget or special
funds budget and funds constituted from internal incomes; ensuring accountability within the court's/prosecutor's office through the
maintenance of proper financial records and supporting documentation; coordinating the administrative activities of the court's/
prosecutor's office headquarters.
64ECRIS project was initiated in 2001 to create and implement a national system for manage legislative cases and documents. ECRIS
was first implemented during March-August 2002. National implementation was carried out using the EU PHARE funds.
65In addition to introducing the role of economic managers in the courts, as explained above, the role of the Superior Council of
Magistracy was increased in the field of formulating the budget, in the way that Council's endorsement was needed for the budget
projects elaborated at the level of the Courts of Appeal and of the Prosecutors' offices attached to the Courts of Appeal for the courts
or the Prosecutor's offices within the jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeal and of the Prosecutors' offices attached to.

   court system, providing two important tools: one for budgetary programming and one
   for prioritizing investments. The manual included a methodology of planning
   investments performed by the MOJ. The manual provided input to the Regulation for
   the 2004 Law on Judicial Organization. The manual is used by the economic
   managers in carrying out their activities in courts and prosecutors' offices.

The Dutch Grants TF050477 and TF054659 as well as the PPIBL financed four
consultant assignments to assist the SCM to:

 Carry out professional training/study tours for the institutional strengthening of the
   SCM, including a study tour to Spain for 10 members of the SCM (and 4
   representatives from the SCM's staff) and a study tour to Ireland for 6 members (and
   4 SCM's staff).
 Establish a trainers' network to support the training of the commissions' members in
   charge of the evaluation of the professional activities of judges and prosecutors. The
   objective was to implement an improved system of performance evaluation and
   new/improved performance indicators. The consultant delivered a number of outputs,
   such as: (i) a data-base analysis of the magistrates readiness to conduct evaluations
   based on the new established criteria; and (ii) an institutional appraisal, training needs
   assessment and a proposed curricula based on the needs of the participative
   evaluation process. The consultant undertook the training seminars for: (i) the 80
   magistrates, including 50 judges and 30 prosecutors, selected to be trained as future
   trainers; and (ii) 15 trainers, one for each Court of Appeal, selected out of the initial
   recruited magistrates to form the network of trainers in the participative evaluation
   process. The TA resulted in a number of outcomes. The SCM Plenum adopted a
   Regulation to establish the criteria and methodology for the evaluation of professional
   activity of magistrates (SCM Plenum' Decision no.676/2007). It included the main
   proposals made by the consultant regarding the content of the Evaluation Guide, the
   professional evaluation indicators (such as quality of work, integrity), mandatory
   participation of each evaluator in a specialized training program held by the National
   Institute of Magistracy (NIM). The magistrates who were involved in the TA program
   became trainers for the evaluators. Thus, fifteen training seminars for evaluators have
   been held between 2007 and now for each Court of Appeal.
 Develop a new methodology for psychological testing of the magistrates by
   developing logical reasoning test in the Romanian language adapted to the specifics
   of the Romanian society. The methodology now used in the Law School Admission'
   reasoning tests is based on the one proposed under the TA and have been further
   developed under the JRP. The tests have been used at the National Institute of
   Magistrate's (NIM) admission contests starting with 2005 and, in the last two years,
   they have been tested at all law faculties within the country.
 Assess the state of statistical court/judicial performance monitoring in Romania and
   develop the initial design of a comprehensive, reliable and meaningful court statistics
   system and a comprehensive system of objective indicators measuring judicial
   performance. This TA proved useful for the SCM in developing an objective system
   and indicators for monitoring court performance. The SCM used the
   recommendations for developing three main areas: (i) improvement of the statistical



                                              86

    system (under the ECRIS new versions); (ii) training for all evaluators of judges and
    prosecutors' professional activity (continued and developed also under the next
    assignment); and (iii) training material of judges and prosecutors who are candidates
    for leading positions within the Romanian judiciary. Different modules of the NIM's
    continuous training are based on the study's recommendation (for example, the
    training module on "act of justice' methodology").The JRP has been designed to
    further improve monitoring of judicial performance. This TA also served as a support
    paper in the SMC's recent efforts in preparing for a more comprehensive plan for
    optimization of court system under JRP (see above).

The PPIBL financed the following TA in the area of business environment to:

    Draft a law amending the Company Law no. 31/1990 in compliance with the OECD
    principles on corporate governance and in line with acquis communautaire. The
    Romanian legal framework for corporate governance has been in compliance with
    international standards effective as of December 1, 2006.
 Carry out a comparative analysis of various civil codes (especially with respect to
    commercial law) and to prepare a draft reformed Civil Code (books I-VII), also
    incorporating commercial obligation law, family law, special contracts law and

                   included in the GSG' 2009 budget


The targeted TA that was financed by the PPIBL and the Dutch TF054659 contributed to
the PDO (b) as it helped achieve the PAL2 benchmark about policy making procedures
and implement the GOR's reform program for public expenditure management. The PAL
policy objectives were partially achieved due to the lack of a formal medium term
expenditure framework. During the period 2005-2006 the GSG consultants coordinated
their TA with other TA programs in the GSG ­ mainly the twinning project with the State
Chancellery of Latvia that provided major contributions ­ and the budget advisor for the
MOPF (see Part E.1.i.b) and provided useful information to support their TA.

One of the key assignments financed for the GSG as part of the wider TA for the budget
reform was centered on strengthening the capacity of the GSG to assist ministerial
decision-making, along with ensuring interface with the budget system. The consultant
worked closely with the other budget reform advisors placed in the MOPF and selected
other ministries (including the consultants funded by the EU PHARE and others). The
consultant (together with the MOPF budget advisor) wrote a number of very important
reports focusing mainly on the following issues: (i) policy-making system with a special
focus on institutional mechanisms and procedures for policy-coordination and strategic
planning (including the role of the GSG); (ii) machinery of the center of the Government
and the machinery of Government (including the functioning of inter-ministerial
councils); and (iii) monitoring and evaluation issues related to the effective
implementation of policy-coordination and strategic planning framework.

The work done by the GSG and MOPF consultants contributed, together with the
twinning project, to setting up the integrated strategic planning system which has 2 parts:
the management side (Part I) and the budget side (Part II). Their recommendations were
taken into account when policy link with budget was elaborated in the GDs approved in
2006 and 2008 on the two methodologies for strategic planning. The GD 1807/2006
concerned Part I of the strategic planning methodology at line ministries level, requiring
each line ministry to clearly define its mission, vision, main directions of activities and
priorities and carry on a brief functional review to be adopted at each line ministry level.
The GD 158/2008 concerned Part II of the strategic planning methodology, including
how to transpose the policy objectives set by the first part of the strategy of line
ministries in effective programs and projects with clear budgetary requirements and how
to monitor their effective implementation. This GD 158/also had a strong chapter on how
measure the program/project result based on indicators. This part constituted the basis for
preparing budget proposals by the line ministries. The GSG/DPP (department for public
policies) used the consultant's reports in its initial work for creating a methodological
framework for policy monitoring and evaluation that started in 2008.




                                                          88

In addition to contributing to the above strategic planning system, the Bank-financed
consultants' reports informed the work carried out under the twinning arrangement to
prepare the second GD 1361/2006 regarding the content of explanation (substantiation)
of some legal proposals. The form for substantiation note designed by the GD 1361 is -
for the first time - obligatory for law and Government ordinances drafts and for majority
of Government decisions (only for Government proposals, not for proposals coming from
the members of the Parliament). The GD 1361 placed more stress on the impact
evaluation of legal proposal and sets a sort of minimum regulatory impact assessment
that should be done by the initiator line ministry.

Finally, the consultant cooperated with the twinning team to propose a clear division of
functions between the GSG and the PM Chancellery regarding the policy coordination
and strategic planning. The delimitation of their functions was approved by the Prime
Minister in March 2007. More recently, the new GOR decided to abolish the Prime
Minister Chancellery and to transfer its functions to the GSG. This is a decision,
reflecting all the recommendations from foreign advisers (including the consultants
funded by the PPIBL) from 2004-2006 (the GSG proposed a similar Government
Emergency Ordinance in the fall of 2006 but the proposal was initially postponed and
after few weeks cancelled by the former Prime Minister). The abolishment of the
Chancellery did not however affect the core functions of the Prime Minister Office
(formed by the Prime Minister advisers and their staff), which are to be preserved. The
coordination of the Prime Minister Office and the GSG on procedural aspects and
substance of policy is still to be defined.

In addition, the PPIBL financed the following TA for GSG to:

 Build capacity in the GSG PPU established in 2003 and in the line ministries' PPUs
    required since 2005. Building on the GSG's own work to establish systems and
    procedures for enhancing key aspects of policy management on the part of line
    ministries, the consultant: (i) provided valuable advice on designing the system for
    policy formulation, specifically the general structure of the public policy proposal (a
    concept paper); (ii) developed a number of monitoring indicators for the SDP
    Committee and the GSG to capture how well the policy formulation reforms are
    advancing their underlying objectives; and (iii) helped operationalize the PPUs in the
    line ministries. The consultant's reports were used to some extent in preparing the
    Government Decision (GD) 775/2005 approved in July 2005 and effective as of
    January 2006, which for the first time set the content of policy documents and the
    connection between the policy documents and the legal proposals. This GD
    introduced a new system of policy formulation in Romania whereby policy
    formulation was to concentrate on substantial policy solutions instead of mere
    normative acts and required establishment of specialized PPUs in line ministries.
    These procedures included a PPU policy proposal template with the requirements for
    budget, monitoring and evaluation information aimed at better policy documents,
    strategic prioritization and enhanced fiscal assessment.
 Provide training for 25 staff members of the GSG PPU in 2007 in policy analysis,
    monitoring and evaluation techniques for policy making process and, in particular, in



                                             89

     using more sophisticated instruments for assessing impact of policies and in selecting
     the appropriate instruments for different policies. This training proved important in
     helping the GSG PPU implement the newly clarified functions and to implement the
     strategy for improving the public policy planning and formulation system. It built on
     initial training in monitoring and evaluation provided in a twinning arrangement
     funded by the EU.
 Prepare functional requirements and bidding documents for the design and
     implementation of an integrated IT system for managing and tracking the policy
     formulation process. The project was included in the GSG's 2009 budget with the
     estimated costs of RON 2.5 million. The technical solution was designed in such a
     way that it can be adapted to the actual /future structure of the Government. The
     system would operate at the level of the GSG with the possibility of expanding it to
     the PPUs in line ministries. It would allow sending policy documents for the
     Government's approval within the IT system and show information on the status.
     This would improve communication and consultation process for policy making
     between the GSG and the line ministries, its security and quality of policy documents,
     as well as reduce costs. The system would implement the procedures and timetable
     set for each step in the first Government Decision for policy making.

Part of the targeted TA that was financed by the PPIBL contributed to achieving the PDO
(b) as it helped achieve the PAL1-2 benchmarks about the amendments to the Labor code.
The PAL policy objective of enhancing the flexibility of the labor market was partially
achieved.

The PPIBL financed the work of a consultant to assess the impact of the Labor Code on
the labor force and businesses and to propose necessary adjustments with a view to
enhance the flexibility of the labor market and improve the investment climate and the
competitiveness of the Romanian economy. The consultant made recommendations to
revise the Labor Code of which a critical number of seven were considered as
conditionalities under the PAL and IMF Stand By programs and of which about six were
considered for the Labor Code amendment (except for the conditionality related to the
obligation of the non-signing parties to observe the Collective Labor Contracts). The
amendments to the Labor Code were enacted in 2005.

The targeted TA that was financed by the PPIBL and the Dutch Grant TF054659
contributed to the PDO (b) as it helped achieved on its part the PAL 2 benchmark about
the Education Law and implement the GOR's reform program for public expenditure
management. The PAL policy objective of more effective and efficient resource
utilization in the education sector was partially achieved.

The PPIBL and the Dutch Grant TF054659 financed the following TA to:

 Assist the National Council for Pre-University Education Financing and other
    stakeholders in reviewing and enhancing the secondary legislation for implementing
    the amended versions of the Education Law and of the Statute of the Teaching Staff.
    The amendments introduced decentralized education management and per capita
    financing of pre-university education. The international consultant made
    recommendations on the design and implementation of the new management system,
    per capita financing formula and a decentralization pilot. The recommendations on
    the secondary legislation, that were in line with the PAL, were not fully incorporated
    into the version adopted in 2004 neither have they been enforced in practice. The
    recommendations on the education administration and financing strategy were
    adopted in 2005, but the strategy has not been implemented. The recommendations on
    the pilot suggested its postponement due to lack of clarity in the legislation on
    distribution of responsibilities, on the financing scheme, etc. Nevertheless, a pilot was
    carried out based on the existing norms with no subsequent national roll-out. The
    capacity building efforts were lost in the National Council for Pre-University
    Education Financing because the people who were involved in the decentralization
    and formula funding work and directly benefited from TA support left the working
    group in 2006.
 Help implement program budgeting in the Budget and Finance Department of the
    MOERYP as part of the wider TA program whereby budget advisors were placed in
    the GSG and a number of line ministries (see Part E.1.i.b). Due to slow pace of the
    budget reform, the capacity building efforts resulted in little changes at that time.

The targeted TA that was financed by the PPIBL and the Dutch Grant TF54659
contributed to the PDO (b) as it helped achieve a number of PAL benchmarks and
implement the Government's reform program for public expenditure management. The
PAL policy objective of building accountability for results around sector decision-making
structures in the health sector was largely achieved.

The PPIBL and the Dutch Grant TF054659 financed the following TA to:

 Continue the national roll-out of the hospital financing system based on the DRG
     launched in early 2000's reform, while the EU PHARE funds were being awaited for
     this activity. The consultant: (i) developed a comprehensive implementation
     methodology for continuing development of the Romanian case-based financing
     scheme and its implementation at central and local level; (ii) designed a training
     methodology that was rolled out at all implementing levels ­ central (National Health
     Insurance House) and local (hospitals and District Health Insurance House) ­ for the
     new proposed regulations and mechanisms; (iii) trained central and local staff
     involved in of the case-based financing; and (iv) made recommendations for
     improving the regulatory framework and data collection and analysis for case based
     financing, as well as for integration of case based financing with other public and
     health financing reform activities. The consultant's recommendations on
     implementing the new financing mechanism for hospitals were included into the

     Health Sector Reform Package enacted in 2006. The new hospital payment system
     was rolled out nationally on the MOH's own funds based on the methodology,
     leading to its introduction in 278 hospitals in 2006 (or 100% of all acute care
     hospitals proposed).
 Assess the magnitude and the distribution of informal payments and corruption in the
    health sector. The assessment identified the main causes, the forms of manifestation
    within the sector, as well as the transparency in the pharmaceutical sector, and
    proposed a plan of interventions for decreasing the corruption in health sector. The
    TA helped establish the magnitude of the problem, and the main results were
    disseminated to stakeholders in a workshop, but overall the recommendations were
    not implemented.
 Carry out of a study of the overall health sector financing on all levels of health care
    to support the GOR in implementing a decentralised health insurance system. The
    study complemented some earlier efforts that had focused on putting together the
    pieces of the health financing mechanism but that had suffered from a lack of
    strategy, political changes and influences, lack of data and conflict of interests/not
    clear definition of institutions roles and responsibilities. The study: (i) assessed the
    overall situation in the health sector financing in Romania and then formulated
    concrete results and made appropriate recommendations for a short and medium time
    period implementation through an action plan; (ii) provided a forecast of the
    adequacy of funding and potential sources; (iii) defined the basic package of services
    reimbursed by the National Health Insurance System and the allocation criteria
    among regions and types of services; (iv) identified the types of services that can be
    financed from other public sources (state budget, local budgets, social securities,
    private sources, etc); (v) made recommendations for an optimal regulatory framework
    for proper functioning of the social and private insurance systems; and (vi)
    disseminated the project results. Some recommendations were included in the Health
    Sector Reform Package enacted by the Parliament in 2006. Other recommendations
    that were not included are still valid.
 Comment on the extensive health sector reform legal package elaborated by the MOH
    in 2006. The consultant helped strengthen it and align it with the EU legislation or
    policies and drafted the related secondary regulations, as well as assessed the impact
    of the new legislative package (and the proposed secondary legislation) and identified
    potential barriers for implementing the legal framework. The recommendations were
    accepted and incorporated into the Health Reform Package enacted in 2006.

The targeted TA that was financed by the Dutch Grants TF050477 and TF054659
contributed to the PDO (b) through the various activities that either helped implement the
GOR's programs in the public sector modernization and public expenditure management
or helped achieve on its part a PAL benchmark. Besides the output related to the public
expenditure management, these activities were not directly linked to a PAL policy
objective.

The Dutch Grants TF050477 and TF054659 financed the following TA to:

 Assess the commercial terms of a civil works contract awarded to a consultant for the
   Brasov­Bors Motorway construction project. The civil works contract had been
   awarded but without a public tender. The contract conditions contained some special
   features wherefore, based on the IMF's recommendations, an independent evaluation
   consultant was hired to assess the financial structure of the project and the unit prices
   in the contract in comparison with similar projects carried out by consultants in the
   region (including Romania) in order to determine if they represent fair prices to the
   project; the overall cost (or likely cost) of the project and their fairness; and other
   contractual mechanisms and the financial arrangements to determine if they are in
   line with other similar motorway projects. The conclusion of the assessment was that
   the contract price was fair and comparable with those of other road contracts in the
   region, with the caveat that the contractor was given the right to introduce new unit
   prices for those quantities not found in the reference section, which was used as the
   basis of the contract's unit prices.
 Carry out: (i) review the then current housing policy documents and provide a
   comparative analysis regarding housing policy experiences in the new EU member
   states for the same reference period of time, quantitative evaluation of existing and
   contemplated subsidy programs and their impact on budget at different levels,
   housing policy goals, financial sector development etc; and made policy
   recommendations to the GOR; (ii) a feasibility study on mortgage insurance scheme
   aimed at helping develop the primary mortgage market by reducing credit risk to
   lenders who in turn would offer improved terms and conditions to borrowers; and (iii)
   a Partial Credit Facility for mortgage­backed securities in order to diversify the
   existing financing sources and to decrease the financing costs. No information was
   available on the results.

The targeted TA that was financed by the Dutch Grants TF054659 and the PPIBL
contributed to the PDO (b) as it helped implement the Government's reform program for
public expenditure management and for modernizing the public sector. The activities
related to the environment were not directly linked to a PAL policy objective.

The Dutch Grant TF054659 and the PPIBL financed the following TA to:

 On-site budget advisor, see Part E.1.i.b.
 Provide support in the implementation of the EU Nitrates Directive (and new
     Romanian legislation). The consultant: (i) reviewed the list with the Nitrate
     Vulnerable Zones or Nitrate Potentially Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) established
     through the Order 241/2005 issued by the MOEWM and performed detailed
     Diagnostic Analysis of the areas reconfirmed as NVZs; (ii) prepared Action Programs
     for the Nitrates Directive implementation on these areas; (iii) proposed and costed the
     necessary remedial measures; and (iv) developed the strategy and action plan for
     monitoring, evaluation and impact (the monitoring and evaluation plan consisted of a
     conceptual framework widely applied internationally and included a comprehensive
     set of indicators for carrying out a regular assessment of the quality of soil and
     groundwater with respect to pollution by nutrients from agricultural sources). The
     Integrated Nutrient Pollution Project (FY08) will help implement the Action
     Programs for the NVZs or most of them proposed under the TA, building on the
     previous World Bank and Global Environment Facility assistance in this area. The
     monitoring and evaluation indicators proposed under the TA are being used by the
     MOEWM together with other indicators, for reporting to the EU. The above Bank
     project will test the indicators in the program and will continue to assist the MOEWM
     in developing and consolidating the indicators in this area. Overall, these indicators
     can be used to provide information to policy makers and the public on the state of the
     environment and its changes; establish the causal link between activities/policies and
     the environment; and evaluate and adjust policies.

 Help implement the EU requirements for contaminated areas. The consultant: (i)
     drafted an outline for the Romanian strategy -- a pre-requisite for the EU funds; (ii)
     made recommendations for improving the existing environmental institutional and
     legal framework with proposals prepared to bring it line with the agreed national
     strategy; (iii) designed the necessary technical guidelines to contain standards and
     detailed instructions on investigations, risk assessments and corrective action
     planning, and a compendium on remediation and drilling techniques; and (iv) in order
     to enable the completion of a nationwide inventory of contaminated sites, created an
     intranet-based inventory system which local environmental protection agencies are
     able to use to prioritize sites based on risk and invest in those that need urgent
     attention. Based on the TA, the GOR accepted a first version of a National Strategy
     for the Management of contaminated sites in May 2008 and launched more work to
     further elaborate the Contaminated Lands Strategy in December 2008 under a
     PHARE project. While the first draft strategy was critical to move this agenda
     forward when nothing had previously existed, the new study went into further detail
     to expand on some chapters of the Strategy and create a more detailed action plan. A
     first draft of the Strategy for Contaminated Lands was recently delivered for
     consultation/comments to the MOEWM, and the final version of the Strategy is
     expected to be approved by a ministerial order in the next few months. An action plan
     is under development to implement the strategy under the PHARE financed project as
     a continuation of the PPIBL. All these two documents depend on and are related with
     the national inventory of contaminated sites that is under preparation within the
     National Environmental Protection Agency - the template for such inventory was
     prepared under PPIBL and then the agency and local EPAs worked to complete the
     entire territory; this inventory is almost completed. The existence of the inventory
     has: (i) centralized the data on the contaminated sites in one location; (ii) improved
     transparency about the quality of lands where people and will further increase it as it
     will become more complete and the information will be updated; and (ii) introduced a
     system for their risk ranking.
 Support the MOEWM in its efforts to implement the EU Directives in nature
     protection and biodiversity conservation66. The consultant: (i) made recommendations
     on the existing institutional context and legal framework regarding the functionality
     of the existing protected areas administrations, as well as their capacity for accessing
     the EU structural funds; (ii) identified and prepared a pipeline of projects for the
     National Agency for Protected Areas (NAPA) to develop and administer under the
     EU funds; (iii) provided further recommendations on the internal structure and
     operating documents of the NAPA; and (iv) drafted a 5-year institutional
     development plan that would create the operating conditions and projections for the
     NAPA, including the required legal framework, roles and functions of the NAPA and
     other organizations, a human resources plan (including a training plan), the costs and
     financing of establishing and running of the NAPA and its subordinated bodies


66The MOEWM needed assistance in setting up the operations of a new agency, the National Agency for NAPA. The GOR had made
a Decision on December 31, 2005 to establish NAPA in the future to administer environment protection issues and manage the EU
funds for supporting "Natura 2000" implementation in Romania. This decision included a timetable for further elaborating its roles
and responsibilities and structures.




                                                              96

      (investment costs, maintenance and operation costs), and a communication plan.
      These outputs represented a full package of legal framework for this new national
      agency that took over functions from several ministries and were considered useful at
      the ground level in the formulation or roles and responsibilities for this agency.
      Consequently, the TA contributed effectively to have the NAPA set up and approved
      through the Government Decision no. 1320 from October 14, 2008 - with a total
      number of staff of 50 (the NAPA started to function in Brasov this year although with
      a very reduced number of staff). The existence of the NAPA is expected to make
      provision of the related functions more efficient and cost-efficient and improve
      accountability. This is importance since Romania has a lot of work in adapting the
      EU environmental standards, and the costs of the meeting of the environmental
      commitments of the acquis are very large.

The PPIBL funded the PIBL/PPIBL PMU in 2004-2008 and the PAL PMU in 2005-2006
until the latter was closed after the cancellation of the PAL2 in early 2007. The PMUs
were instrumental in managing the implementation of the complex TA program that
eventually included about 20 sub-components and four sources of financing.

The PPIBL PMU was an independent unit operating within the MOPF under the minister
coordination67. It employed the PMU director, a minister's counselor until the closing of
the PAL, administrative staff and experts in procurement, financial management and
accounting from nine in 1999 to 12 in the busiest years and to three in 2008.

The PAL PMU was established in 2005 in the Prime Minister's Chancellery to: (i) ensure
the highest level of coordination of the PAL reform agenda; (ii) coordinate and monitor
the reform progress; (iii) keep the line ministries aware of the next steps in the PAL
program; and (iv) report to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Bank on the
progress. The Project funded a pool of experts (one expert in public finance in 2004 and
our experts in 2005-2006 to support PAL implementation, including an expert in capital
markets, public services, public administration, justice and anti-corruption), as well as the
PMU director, assistant director and administrative assistant. The PMU also The PAL
PMU was closed in January 2007.




67The PMU was established in 1999 under the Ministry of Transportation to implement the PIBL, then the PPIBL, and to monitor the
PSAL condationalities. It was moved to the MoPF in November 2000. The PIBL funded the PMU from 1999 until 2004.

       Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. The       Project     context    Development      Objectives,    Design     and
    implementation

The Private and Public Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) was signed on
September 13, 2002 for the amount of US$18.6 million to provide technical
assistance to achieve the targets and conditionalities established under the
Private Structural Adjustment Loan (PSAL 11). The PPIBL was made effective on
November     25th 2002 approved through OUG 135/2002 and ratified by the
Parliament through the Law no 1112003.

The PPIBL was approved to support reforms in both the private and public
sectors. Related to the PPIBL, a Dutch Grant Fund (TF 050744 in amount of
USD 3.17 Million) was approved in May 2002 to support part of the private sector
activities included under PPIBL. The Grant Agreement was amended to include
TA for public sector activities and was fully disbursed on April 2005.

The initial objective of the PPIBL was to provide the required technical assistance
to implement those policy measures supported by the PSAL II and to prepare the
reforms to be supported by the proposed IGRPAL.

During 2003-2005 the PPIBL was implemented in parallel with the Private sector
Institution Building Loan (PIBL) signed on 1999 and having as main objective
supporting the program under the PSAL I. The PIBL was fully disbursed on 2005,
covering a main part of the activities provided to be financed under the PPIBL.

Due to the impact of the reform programs and successfully implementation of
PSAL I (the first Loan fully withdrawn in the scheduled dead-lines and ranked
highly satisfactorily) the unexpected donors provided funds for financing part of
activities provided in PIBL and PPIBL. The PHARE funds covered the technical
assistance for privatization of state-own banking sector and the funds allocated
to these activities were reallocated to cover supplementary needs identified by
the Borrower and the Bank.

While the activities provided under the PPIBL to complete the reforms initiated
under the PSAL Ii have been financed by the savings amounts registered under
the PIBL, the institutional and governance reform component was used to help in
designing and implementation of the Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL)
program. With respect to the privatization and business environment components
under the original component provided in PPIBL and financed under PIBL and
first Dutch Grant, the TA was provided to strengthen public expenditure
management (treasury, public accounting, internal audit and decentralization
process); external audit; e-government; public administration; rule of law; and
health insurance administration. On May 09, 2005 the Bank has approved and
signed a new Trust Fund TF054659 in the amount of EUR 2 million to support



                                         104

the public administrative reform activities included under the PPIBL and also
under the PAL.

As a result of funds available under the new Dutch Grants and deleting of some
activities due to availability of other grant funds (EU PHARE), several million
dollars remained available to be utilized for other activities. In this respect, the
PPIBL was amended two times to support the PAL program and the following
additional activities were identified and included to be

financed by PPIBL and the second Dutch Grant.: (i) civil service reform; (ii)
judicial reform; (iii) public expenditure management, (iv) service delivery in the
education, health and infrastructure areas; and (v) intergovernmental fiscal
relations. An amendment to the PPIBL was done in order to allow the financing of
these activities.

2. Key factors affecting implementation and Outcomes

Due to availability of other source of funds mainly grant funds provided by Dutch
authorities and EU for similar activities the disbursements under the PPIBL
started only at the end of 2004. More than2/3 of initial activities provided to be
financed initially from the PPIBL were financed from alternative sources.

During the Joint Portfolio Performance Review session for the PPIBL in 2004, it
was agreed to up-date the procurement plan of the PPIBL in order to include new
activities related to PAL Program, particularly establishing a Project Management
Unit (PAL PMU) in the Prime Minister Chancellery, under direct coordination of
the Head of Chancellery for monitoring and implementation of PAL Program. The
up-dated procurement has been approved in the Cabinet Meeting on February 5,
2004 based on which the items and responsible ministries related to PAL
program have been included in the Loan Agreement.

However, as a result of substantial delays in the approval of the PAL program
(approved only on September 16, 2004 and effective on February 28, 2005) the
implementation progress under the PPIBL was delayed.

In April, 2006, a comprehensive list of activities related to PAL programs were
provided to be financed Out of PPIBL, part of them were not eligible, or
abandoned by the beneficiaries. In order to cover other needs, several new
activities were identified by the Borrower to be funded out of the PPIBL proceeds.
These included request from the Prime Minister's Chancellery, National Agency
for Fiscal Administration (NAFA) and the Ministry of Environment and Water
Management (MEWM). The request from the NAFA and MEWM were for the
preparation of new projects to be financed by the Bank.

The Bank agreed with the Government that funding should be provided for
priority activities to meet PAL program objectives and on a first-come-first-served
basis. Having in mind the overlapping of funds (PIBL, Dutch Grants, PHIARE



                                         105

funds) which were not envisaged at the moment of PPI.BL signing the PPIBL
funds could not be used in the initial implementation Øeriod of three years. The
Borrower, as the Bank also considered that the initial period of implementation
was not realistic, having in mind the complexity of the project and the large
number of beneficiaries and topics to be financed out of the Loan. For this reason
an extension of three years and a half was granted and the funds were fully
committed and disbursed (excepting the amount of USD 60,000 representing the
cost of a study related to the budget proceeds allocation which did not met the
contract requirements and the beneficiary had not approved the payment. The
respective amount was not disbursed and cancelled out of the Loan).

3. Assessment of the Outcomes

The PPIBL did not finance all activities included in the PAD but the development
objectives were fully met, while for different components EU funds were provided
after PPIBL signing (see energy, gas component, banking sector privatization)
and objectives meet.

Due to continue deterioration of the financial situation of the companies included
in the main list of companies agreed to be privatized/restru ctured with technical
assistance provided by PPIBL the beneficiary proceeded to the liquidation or
used own funds for their restructuring, or sold them. Also, when PPIBL was
signed the PIBL was in place, but having certain activities envisaged to be
financed. Later the funds remained available under PIEL and activities from
PPIBL were financed out of FIBL, and first Dutch Grant, based on the
Government decision to use first grant funds (EU and Dutch) to cover urgent
needs and priorities and the Bank fully agreed with the Government.

In this context the PPIBL funds contributed to the achieving of the PIBL and
Dutch Grants programs objectives.

When the PAL was envisaged and agreed with the Bank the Government
decided not to commit another TA loan, but to use the PPIBL funds to finance all
TA requested by PAL program becoming attached to it fully contributing to the
achieving of the development objective of PAL program.

The Loan Agreement was amended periodically to support PAL program and
other urgent needs of the Government without consequently adding the new
development objectives in PPIBL but there were included in the PAL program for
which the PFIBL were accountable and assured their fulfillment besides of the
EU inlegration conditionalities.

4. Assessment of the Bank and Borrower performance

The Government monitored and assessed the FPIBL not only as it was defined in
the PAD but also as it was agreed in the loan amendments and in the collateral



                                         106

financing (PIBL, Dutch Grants, PAL etc) since all the funds were designed and
managed as a pool of funds and properly supervised by the Bank, even that the
Bank prepared separate implementation completion reports for them. During the
amendment made to the Loan in 2004 and 2006 new project activities were
added under the institutional and governance reform to respond to the new
needs emerging from the deepening of the policy and the institutional reforms in
the public sector area. No new indicators had been introduced to reflect all the
planned activities and results as all these activities achieved the PAL
development objectives and were reflected in the PAL implementation
completion report.

But, in order to more accurately reflect the project activities added in 2004 and
2006 and to assess the project impact on achieving the development objective,
the Borrower established a set of expected indicators outcome/outputs to serve
as a basis for the Borrower to monitor and evaluate the progress of the Project
and the achievement of the assumed objectives. The results on each new activity
were assessed by the Borrower and beneficiaries and submitted to the Bank and
inserted in the ICR (Annex 10-- Intermediate outcomes indicators).

The Government For the implementation of the program the Government
established a PMU, under direct coordination of the minister of public finance,
fully dedicated to the project and financed out of the Loan. The PMU was initially
established for implementation of PIBL and further assigned for the management
of the pool of projects. As PIBL was extended till 2005 initially in the PPIBL were
provided funds for PFVU only for one year. The Government was fully
determined to make the EU accession a reality and achieved an ambitious
program of structural and institutional reforms. In this context was concluded the
PAL Loan and establish a PMU within the Chancellery of the Prime Minister in
2005 as a guarantor of PAL program implementation. The Loan was amended
and extended to include the PAL activities, funds have been provided for
financing of both PAL and PPIBL PMU for another three years. These units
operated very efficiently. Good performance of both the PAL PMU and PPIBL
PMU helped implement the ambitious and complex policy and TA program
satisfactorily and mitigate the lack of capacity in the beneficiary's agencies. No
risk was identified in project implementation. The Government provided adequate
funds from local contribution. The Bank supported the program implementation in
a very satisfactory and timely manner.

5. Lessons learned

A key lesson learned from implementation of the project to be avoided in the
further project is related to the negative impact on the projects implementation
done by the repeated changes in the strategies and priorities of the Government
in performing the public administrative reform. In many cases the PMU faced with
lack of commitment from the beneficiaries (Government agencies and public
entities) in achieving the objectives of the projects. In many cases they recorded



                                         107

a huge delay in preparing the technical documentation including the TOR and
adequate technical specifications in such a form and content to meet the
procurement process requirements and to accelerate the bidding process. Some
projects were abandoned or withdrawn from financing after performing all
procurement steps, including signing the contract by the consultant. In many
cases the staff nominated by the beneficiaries as their representative in the
evaluation committees of the bids received for different projects were not
available, or not very committed, or not even specialized for this activities and
jobs. Many times the committees were changed and delayed the process. Part of
these deficiencies were addressed by the PMU and the program continued on
proper way and met the objectives, but mainly these inconsistencies contributed
to the extension of the financing in order to have time to achieve the objectives
and proper use the money.

Under the public expenditure management component the main achievement of
the project represented the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Public
Finance. Based on the findings of the World Bank assessment during March
2003 on the status of the IT infrastructure of the Ministry of Economy and
Finance and the main recommendations made by the Bank, the Ministry
prepared the IT strategy for the next five years. The Bank assessments made
several recommendations for further development of the IT system, respectively:
improvement of the software applications in order to facilitate a rapid and easy
communication and to develop electronic relationships between financial
partners; renewing the IT&C infrastructure            based    on   Internet/Intranet
technologies in order to increase both for the centralized real-time data
processing and, an easy remote control management of the infrastructure.
Based on these recommendations, the MPF decided to use part of the funds
PPIBL loan for funding the above assignments and based on the Bank
agreement had started an ambitious program for improving the State Treasury
management.

The results stated on reforming of payment system to be compliant with financial
market regulations and banking practice, ensuring the transparency and
interoperability between the public sector and the business community,
implementation of a real-time electronic payment system (EPS) replacing the
manual intensive clearing and settlement mechanism, adding new business
functionalities and reducing the operational risk, aligned to financial regulation by
its full compliance with SWIFT registered standards and improvement of the
Public Accounting IT infrastructure to support the Public Accounting central
Oracle database and the web enabled application.

The main business results of implementing the new application for Budget
construction    and   Treasury    centralization   continues     on   the   ongoing
implementation of the Ministry of Public Finance reform process in these areas.
The aim of the budget process was stated as helping the Government deliver,
through better information for decision-making and, clearer managerial authority



                                        108

and accountability.

As a result, considerable effort had gone into the budget to develop a process
whereby the Budget is developed within a proper planning framework.

Implementing these applications, the main achieved results are:

· Process for the collection and consolidation of data -- offer one single
   application for entering/collecting data; data are consolidated once; clear
   process; information available immediate -- result: increase the productivity
   by reducing the clerical activity and having single source of truth

· Quality of data, as considerable work is required to be undertaken on initial
   information supplied by budgetary owners; Using the General Registers and
   Nomenclatures assure that all information provided by Budgetary Owners are
   using the same reference data, increasing the quality of data and decreasing
   the chance to introduce invalid data.
· Timeliness of reporting the information generated -- creating applications that
   are available over the WEB, all participants have to enter data in a timeframe
   well defined by MEF -- result: giving time for decision making

· Reporting: Accountability and transparency: the possibility to have a clear
   picture of public spending and transparency

· Improve quality of service: creating the environment to facilitate the
   collaborative work between MEF and Budgetary owners and increase the
   responsiveness of their requests

· Management improvement: prepare process of having aggregated views and
   complex reports to management related to public expenditures

· Governance & Public Sector Improvement: improve the data quality and the
   Opportunity of versioning of the budgets and increase the responsiveness

Given the complexity of the tasks and the need for the improvements, there
needed to be continued coordination and leadership of the Ministry of Public
Finance to ensure that relevant, accurate and timely information is available to
Executive Government to allow it to monitor government finances.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments received from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 4, 2009:

"In general, the PPIBL-program has encompassed a broad range of activities that were
designed to cover specific needs in Romania's macro-economic and institutional capacity.
In some cases, political or economic situations influenced the sustainability of the results.
The lack of judicial reforms remains a source of concern and is one of the areas that
further require strengthening.

The Dutch Grants funded activities were punctual and catalytic for other, larger scale,
activities. Given the short project cycle, the Dutch grants have been appreciated for their
flexibility which helped moving things forward. The report reflects accurately the
activities undertaken under the Dutch Grants."
