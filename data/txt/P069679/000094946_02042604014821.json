Adjustment Loan Project (PSAL II) (report no.\n            P7507), and to lay the ground for the reforms that will be\n            implemented under the proposed Programmatic Adjustment Loan\n            (PAL). The project has five project components. The first,\n            the Financial Sector Restructuring and Privatization Support\n            component, provides technical assistance to restructure CEC\n            (savings Bank) in preparation for privatization; develops\n            capital markets by strengthening legislation, regulatory\n            capacity and infrastructure; strenthens the capital markts\n            regulatory agencies; and strengthens insurance supervision.\n            The second component supports privatization of the ten\n            largest state enterprises. The third component provides\n            technical assistance for the divestiture of key enterprises\n            in the oil, gas, and electricity/power sectors, including\n            majority or strategic sales under market conditions. The\n            fourth component supports an improved business environment\n            and covers training of judges and court personnel,\n            procurement of court equipment, refurbishing works, and a\n            public awareness campaign. The fifth component strengthens\n            institutional and governance reform."}, "docdt": "2002-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
