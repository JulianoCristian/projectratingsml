ment in Pakistan.   Its paid-in share capital was increased to Rs. 50 milLion
in September 1968.  -FC has been a shareholder of PIG IC silce 1963 and its
present holding is 200,000 shares or 4 percent of PICIC's share capital.
iii.      The Bank has granted PICIC seven loans totalling $144.2 million.
Tn addition, PICIC has obtained foreign exchange loans from other sources
amounting -to about $132 million. The Government has granted PICIC four
interest-free or low-cost loans totalling Rs.80 million, subordinated to
paid-in share capital, and USAID has granted it a rupee loan of Rs.30
million, subordinated to all foreign indebtedness.
iv.       ]?ICIC is well organized and efficient.  Its management and staLf
are competent. Its operational standards are high and its follow-up
activities satisfactory. Net earnings after estimated tax amounted to
Rs.19 mill-ion in 1968, or more than 24 percent of net worth at the begin.-
ning of the year. If a 10 percent dividend is being paid for 1968, like
for 1967, it would represent less than 23 percent of the net profit, and
reserves and unappropriated earnings would have reached 104 percent of
PICIC's paid-in share capital. Serious arrears in PICIC's portfolio are
negligible. No necessity of write-offs has arisen so far.
v         PYICIC is primarily financing large projects.  About 42 percent
of the total number of loans approved during the past two years and a half
through June 1968 were above Rs. 2.5 million. PICIC has coordinated its
activities with those of other financial institutions in the country
serving the industrial sector and has excellent working relations with
the Goverrnent.
vi.       P'ICIC's main contribution to the economy of Pakistan has been its
role as an effective provider of scarce foreign exchange to sound industrial
projects in the private sector. Until June 30. 1968, PICIC's total approvals
ol' loans and investments amounted to Rs. 1.45 billion and direct loans and
equity narticinations made from abroad into PTGIG financed orolects to
Rs. 350 miLLion.   Industry surveys and market studies carried out by PICIC
have broadened the range of pntentia1 invetmrent hy nrivate industrialists.

viii.     The loan agreement for the seventh Bank loan (PAK-"09) to PICIC
limits PICUL us indebtedness to six times a borrowing base consisting oT its
own equity and subordinated loans as defined in that agreement. PICIC has
requested a relaxation of this borrowing limitation to seven times for the
purpose of enabling it to continue its growth.   3ecause of PICIC's good;
management,, sound portfolio and financial position, and adequate debt-
service coverage, it would be justified to agree to the request.
ix.       PICIC continues to be a suitable recipient for Bank loans.   It
would need additional foreign exchange resources of some $80 million for
loan commibnents by July 1970 and is expected to obtain about half of the
total requirements from sources other than the Bank. PICIC's request for an
eighth Bank loan of $40 million would therefore be justified. It should be
granted on terms and conditions which would now be available, according to
the Bank's recent policy decision, to development finance companies with
which the 3ank has had satisfactory experience over an extended period of
time.

RE-APPRAISAL OF THE PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL
CREDIT ANiVi !NVES'MENTl CUORPORTIUN bMIMED
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01.     The Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Limi.ted
(PICIC) has applied to the Bank for an eighth loan.  So far, the Bank has
granted P1CIC seven loans totalling $144.2 million,I/ which have been
utilized for financing industrial projects in the private sector in Pakistan.
1.02.     :FC has been a shareholder of PICIC since 1963 when it purchased
200,000 shaEres with a par value of Rs. 2 million, for which a total cost
equivalent; to $449,400 including a 7 per cent premium was paid.  IFC's
shareholding increased to 217,500 shares and a total investment of $486,,246
in September 1968 when, in the course of a rights issue, IFC subscribed to
17,500 new shares at par (Rs. 10). However, these new shares were sold to
an Italian bank in December 1968 and the IFC's present holding remains at
200,000 shares.
II. DESCRIPTION OF PICIC
Purposes and Powers
2.01.     The objectives of PTCIC, a private development finance company, are
to assist in the creation, expansion and modernization of private industrial
enterprisei, to encourage private capital participation from local and foreign
sources and to assist in the formation of a capital market.   It may extend
long- and mediium-term loans. take eouitv nmrticinations. underwrite and

Resources
2.04.     EICIC's long-term resources consist of its paid-in share capital,
reserves and retained earnings, Government loans, a rupee loan from US AID
counterpart funds and foreign borrowings.
2.05.     Reserves and Retained Earnings.  PICIC's reserves and retained
earnings stood at Rs. 52 million or 104 per cent of paid-in share capital
as of Decembcer 31, 1968, assuming that the dividend for the year, not yet
decided on, w'ill be 10%.
2.06.     Government loans.  The Government has granted PICIC four long-term
loans totalling Rs. 80 million, subordinated to all other debts and to issued
share capital.  The terms and conditions of these loans are summarized below:

Bank fnd biLateral line3 of credit allocated to PICIC by the Government.
2.09.     Foreign borrowing includes suppliers' credits guaranteed by PI(IC.
Th1ese guaraniteed credits are, iLn fact, -ver-y closely analogo-us to borrowuigs
and PICIC t-reats them as such.
2.10.     Foreign credits other than Bank loans are usually tied to procure-
ment from the respective creditor countries and are therefore somewnat more
difficult to allocate to projects than untied resources.  Therefore, PICIC
has sometines managed to finance single projects from more than one credLt
line, when suppliers from more than one country were involved. The joint
use of these credit lines may thus to a large  extent serve the same pur)ose
as untied resources, but since coordinating their use is not easy, PICIC
prefers Bankt loans to them.

e .11.    'oard of Directors.  llle Board of rPUICI  haas 21 meie'luuerst :  12u dui r cut rs
elected from among Pakistani shareholders, 3 appointed Government representa-
tives, 5 appointed directors representing the foreign sharehoiders and Iru, and
the Managing Director. The Chairman is elected from among non-Government
Directors. The Board usually meets four times a year.
2.12.     Executive Committee. The Executive Committee consists of 6 members:
the Chairman, the Managing Director, 2 elected Pakistani directors, a director
representing the Government and a director representing the foreign share-
holders. Tlhe Committee usually meets monthly and has the same powers as the
Board except that it may not approve loans or investments exceeding Rs. 5
million or any loans to or investments in companies in which PICIC's directors
have an interest. PICIC's Articles provide for a seat on the Committee for
IFC, but IlO has not occupied it so far. PICIC's present Board and Executive
Committee are shown in Annex 3.
2.13.     M[anagement. Since July 1966 PICIC's Managing Director has been
Mr. Said Ahmed, a respected and dedicated person with more than 30 years of
banking experience.  His second in command, Mr. Iqbaluddin Ahmed, left PICIC
to become Managing Director of the Investment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP)
in Septemrber 1968. He was replaced, in December 1968, by Mr. K. M4ushtacq Ilahi.
who joined PICIC in 1966 after a distinguished career with the Government and
was the manager of PICIC's Lahore office before being promoted to his present
position.
2.14.     Organization and Staff. The Head Office in Karachi has 6 Departments:
Operations, End-Use, Economics, Accounts, Law, and Secretariat and Administra-

2As shown, PICIC is very profitaoie, but follows a plicy- ofL m,.  Idea
dividend payments and substantial plow-back of earnings into reserves.    The
growth rate? of gross income over tne previous year was 21.2 per cent in 1967
and 24.3 per cent in 1968. Computed on the total average assets, gross income
represented 8.9 per cent in 1967 and 8.7 per cent in i968.
2.17.     ;Lne average cost of funds to PIC1C has been increasing over the years
as a consequence of the increase in interest rates on both rupee and foreign
exchange borrowings. The change in the average lending rate, average cost oI
borrowed funds and average spread on such funds is illustrated by the follow-
ing table.

2.18.     hdministrative expenses have been around 0.5 to 0.6 per cent as a
percentage of average total assets. In comparison with similar institu-tions
in other countries, PICIC's administrative expenses are moderate.
2.19.     Financial Position.   Comparative balance sheets as of December 31,
1964 througrh 1968 are shown in Annex 6.
2.20.     Annual rate of growth of total assets over the previous year was
22.7 per cent in 1967, and 20 per cent in 1968. Reserves and unap propriated
earnings increased from about 93 per cent of share capital in 1967 to 1()4
per cent in 1968.  Reserves as a percentage of the total portfolio were 5.8
per cent in 1967 and 6.8 per cent in 1968. The ratio of all debt to equity
decreased i'rom 8.6:1 in 1967 to 7.8:1 in 1968. PICIC's cash posi-tion is, very
sound. The current ratio was 4.9:1 at June 30, 1968 and 4.2:1 at end 1968.

Report dated April 17, 1968 ("Current Economic Position and Prospects of'
fl.1...  4...L...I  A C'  I 1 Z 
3.02 .    Guverunent Inust,rLal DJevelopment rlan.  The economic policy- f te
Government has been based on planning ahead for periods of five years.    The
current Third Five Year P1an covers i965-i970, during which perioci the cOvte-
all growth rate has been set at 6.5) per cent per annum and the industrial
growth rate at about 10 per cent.   Total investment in tne private industry
sector was originally envisaged at Rs. 8.3 billion for the Third Plan period.
In order to achieve the Third Plan target, a Comprehensive Industrial Invest-
ment Schedule (CIIS) was prepared to direct private investments towards more
desired sectors of industry.   It is the Government's intention that investments
should mainly be confined to the projects listed in the CIIS and only the most
essential piroposals outside CIIS are likely to receive Government approval,
which is needed for private investments in projects requiring foreign exchmge.
3.03.     T'otal investments approved in the private sector under the Third
Plan period up to March 1968 amounted to Rs. 4.2 billion.   The growth rete of
the large and medium scale industries was about 6 rer cent in 1965/66, about
11 per cent in 1966/67 and abaat 13 per cent (estimate) in 1967/68. Encou-
raged by this performance, and with a view to achieving continued accelerated
growth, the Government in June 1968 released a "Priority List", within the
framework of the CIIS, for implementation during the remainder of the Third
Plan period. Priority has been placed on projects within three industrial
categories, namely, export-oriented industries, agro-based and service in-
dustries, and import substitution industries.
3.04.     Development Finance Institutions for Industry.   There are several
financial institutions in Pakistan which primarily provide long-term finance
for industrial development in the private sector, each with a special function
of assistinag large, medium or small size industries, respectively. PICIC



-6-
is primarily designed to finance large projects. Tne Industrial Development
Bank of Pakistan (IDBP), 61 per cent of whose share capital is directly or
indirectly held by the Government, is mainly financing medium-size industries.
nDBP's annual approval of loans has been slightly lower in amount than that
of PICC1.  IDBP!s and PIC1C's special fields of activity are demarcated by
lending limits set by the Government. W4hile PICIC may not make foreign currency
loans of less than Rs. 1.5 million in West Pakistan and Rs. 1.0 million in
East Pakistan (except for balancing and modernization purposes), IDBP's upper
lending limit in foreign currency is normally Rs. 2 million.    Financing up to
Rs. 0.5 million of small industries is handled by two Small Industries Corpo-
rations, one in East and the other in West Pakistan, both are wholly owned by
the respective provincial governments. The total amount of loans handled by
these corporations is rather small, around Rs. 30 million annually by each.
The severa:l institutions are designed to supplement rather than tc compete
with each other. Both PICIC and IDBP are represented on a number of Govern-
ment Committees concerned with induistrial development in the private sector.
3.05.     Ihere is another financial institution, the Investment Corporation
of Pakista:n (ICP), which is mainly concerned with providing equity financing
for industrial development in the private sector. ICP's objectives are to
encourage and broaden industrial ownership and to develop the capital market
of Pakistan.  To this end, ICP underwrites, manages and distributes issues
of shares, bonds and debentures. ICP was created by Government Ordinance in
1966 and the Government has appointed a majority of the directors on ICP's
Board.  ICP's paid-in shares of Rs. 50 million, however, are almost entirely
privately owned.   TCP cooperates closely with other financial institutions in
the financLng of projects, and has proved to be a valuable supplement to those
institutions.
3.06.     Two ,n-uPrnTnentprom.onional institutionsn the W.n est and East Pakistan
Industrial Development Corporations (WPIDC and EPIDC), invest directly in
anrd operate large-scale indust al enterprises in t.he rspecive wings of
the country. They are primarily designed to promote enterprises which private
industriali sts are unable or nwilling to -ndertake.   The totl          -_ets of
each Corporation amount to nearly Rs. 1 billion. Their policy is to supple-
mpntj. nrot to displacej privte. enter-prise and their airn iso trans.fer ^orn-
pleted projects to private ownership, when private investors can be found
and other conditions wuld so perm.it. Under this polncy, eleven projects
involving an investnent of Rs. 45 million were transferred by WPIDC to private
hfands in 1047 and n + 1 n + +a.t^ mr^o--to  o Rs  Cf7 m; 1  . k-e L'DTTIrC  1O9R

projects are outside the "Priority List" and based upon imported raw materials,
the final approval has to be obtained from even higher authority, namely th,e
Economic Coordination Committee, comprised exclusively of cabinet members.
PICC0's reccmmendation is an important factor in the Committee's decision..
PICIC thus plays a key role in the Governmental process of project selection.
IV. PICIG'S POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES
Policies and Practices
4.01.     Certain guidelines for PICIC's operations and financial management
have been laid down in its "Outline of Business Policies Followed", given in
Annex 7. The policies emphasize PICIC's role as a financier of economically
and financially justifiable projects in the private sector. The projects it
assist have to be in line with the economic policy and planning of the Govern-
ment. The guidelines also call for geographical and Aectoral diversification
of assistance given and avoidance of management control by PICIC in enter-
prises financed by it, and prohibit short-term financing for working capital.
Other policies and practices are briefly summarized in the following.
4.02.     LLmitations on Operations.  PICIC's maximum total commitment in any
single transaction is normally limited to $4 million equivalent and in any one
company to an amount equivalent to 25 per cent of PICIC's equity, or $5 million.
whichever is the lower (now $5 million).   Lower lending limits are set by the
line of demarcation between PICIC and IDBP as described in paragraph 3.04.
PICIC does not normally finance more than 50 per cent of the total project cost.
but will do so if there is a good case for it and has, in fact, done so in
several cases. Total investments in equity will not exceed the total of PICIC's
own equity capital. As of December 31. 19681 PUCTC's total equity investments
were about Rs. 47 million below PICIC's own equity capital.
4.03.     Interest Rates and Other Charges.   The rate of interest that PICIC
may charge on its foreign exchange loans is now restricted by the Governm-ent
to 2 per cenit above the respective borrowing rates.  On rupee loans, PICIC
charges 9 per cent or 3.5 per cntr. bhnuv the rGntral Bank discount rate
(now 51), wThichever is higher.  In addition, PICIC receives an appraisal fee
of 0.5 per cent of the loan amoilmnt and a commitm.ent charge of 1.5 per cent on
the undisburSed amount. To speed up the utilization of loans, PICIC applies
an additiona7 penal charge of 0.5 -ercent per arnnm on portions of loarns
remaining unutilized, for reasons within the control of the borrowers, beyond
6 months after they were granted.  P1T1T chrges a       letter of credit opening
commission of about 5/8 per cent of the amount of the letter of credit.
4.0h.     Terms of Loans.   Miost of PICIC's loans now being approved are
repayable ~~ovfr  1o 2 years, while a few have had a term of up to 15 years.
In future, P:CIC envisages that there may be a need for a limited nlumber of
even longer loans.



0
- U-
4.05.     Exchange Risk.  PICIC does not assume the foreign exchange risk for
its foreign borrowqings, but either passes on the risk to its borrowers or,
in case of consortium credits, the Government assumes the foreign exchange
risk against a guarantee fee of one quarter of one per cent, whicn is collec-
ted by PICIC for the Government from the borrowers.
4.06.     Security. Loans are given on a secured basis, mainly against
first lien mortgages on the property but sometimes supplemented by personal
guarantees of the sponsors or third parties.
4.07.     Ayppraisals and Decision Making.  Appraisals are generally of high
standard. 11hen highly specialized know-how and experience are required to
establish the feasibility of a project, sponsors are requested to have a
detailed report prepared by independent and qualified consultants. PICIC's
loan contracts contain rather stringent conditions to be met before loans
become effective and, in sectors in which expertise is lacking in the country,
impose the use of technical assistance from experienced partners.
4.08      Project Follow-Up. The End-Use Department takes over a project
from the stage of approval.  In the past two years, partly in response to
the Bank's advice, PICIC has taken various measures to strengthen its follow-
up activity,, such as giving more and better-defined responsibilities to the
regional ofi'ices, increasine the number of field visits and the use of
engineers in this work.  The large number of projects now assisted by PICIC
(about 370) has made a selective approach necessary in the organization of
the follow-up activities. The closest attention is now given to projects
under construction. to companies knowtn to he in rifficulties; and to the
large commitments. On the whole, PICIC's management is now sufficiently well

Loan Activities
4.09.     Loan operations are sumarized in Annex 8.    By June 30, 1968, PICIC
hand grann+ted  tanl of 57 lonnq naggrgating Rs. 1 3QQ million.   Annl:l
average of loan approvals in the past two years and a half, through June 1968,
was Rs. 226 million.  However, PT1T1's loan appr^val is often only the very
fi:st step of an investment project since it amounts to an official sancltion
of the prone+cta, -tho,ut vsw4 a +he po-nsor carn,ot proceed to -,4king the
necessary arrangements for the project.   The inevitable consequence of this

4.10.     Fo,reign Exchange and Rupee Loans. An analytical summary of loans
approv-ed is shomnn i.n Annex 9.  FECIC 'has mainly lent foreign excnange.  Of
the total loans of Rs. 1,399 million, foreign exchange loans represent 9',



-9 -
per cent and rupee loans only 5 per cent.  The main reason for this is that
few capital goods manufacturing industries exist in Pakistan, and most
industrial projects which PICIC has assisted have had to rely extensively
upon imported machinery and equipment, for which PICIC lends. The Government
has recently been placing emphasis on the development of machine tools and
engineeringr industries to reduce iTmorts.  When these efforts begin to sh1ow
results, PI('IC's lending may partially shift from foreign exchange to rupee
loans. However, any large shift is unlikely in the next few years.
L.11.     Distribution of Loans bv Tndustrv.  PTCIG has financed mainlv the
traditional sectors of the private Pakistani industry. Loans to the jute

4.13.     Geographical Distribution,. 73 per cent of PICIC's lending has
Laken place in West Pakistan and 27 per cent in East Pakistan.  However,
PICIC's efforts in recent years, partly in response to the Bank's advice, to
distribute its assistance better between the two wings of the country have
shown results, and during the period from January 1966 through June 1968,
about 36 per cent of the amount of all loan approvals was for rrojects in the
Eastern wing. In comparison, private investments in East Pakistan approved
by the Govenament during the Third  Plan period, up to March 31, 1968, amountee
to about 25 per cent of total private industrial investment approvals in
Pakis tan.
4.14.     New and Existing Enterprises.  On average, 76 per cent of PIICICs
lending, by amount, has been for new enterprises, and out of the total 597
loans approved by PICIC since its inception, 87 have been given to sponsors
making their first venture in industrial activities.
4.15.     Quality of Loan Portfolio.  FICIC's total loan portfolio as at
June 30, 196tl consisted of 372 outstanding loans and guarantees in the amount
of Rs. 672.7 million (due to certain adjustments, the balance sheet in Antex
10 shows a Elightly different figure). The current debt service performance
of PICIC's borrowers is shown in the following table.

The Rs. 37.1 million "loans in arrears" represent the total amount of such
loans. The amount actually overdue as at June 30, 1968 was R?s. 5.5 mil'lion,
of which overdue installmetats of principal were Rs. 3.1 million (0.5 per
cent of the portfolio) and interest arrears Rs. 2.4 million. Out of 38
loans in arrears, 7 loans totalling Rs. 2 million may be considered serious
arrears and PICIC is considering legal action for recovery. PICIC expects
to recover virtually all outstanding amounts even in the very few cases
where the 'borrowers are in real difficulties, except for a sum of perhaps
Rs. 100,000 or 150,000. As noted in the table above, PICIC has been
preDared to reschedule the reavyment of loans in trouble. and does so
where there are reasonable prospects for smooth repayments in the future.
Such a practice has nroven to be satisfactorv so far.     During the nearlv
11 years of PICIC's existence the necessity of write-offs has never arisen.
The situation dessrrihbd ahoue has not. mhqstantiAlly chnnged since June 30O

4.17.     Direct Investment.  Direct annual equity investments for new or
expanding enterprise have been small. About Rs. 10 million was directly
invested by 1965, and Rs. 214 million in 1966, but those operations
declined to Rs. 1 million in 1967 and 1968 respectively.
4.18.     Underwritine.  PICIC has not been very active in underwriting.
However, the number of underwritings was stepped up in 1966 and 1967.
This resulted, in part, from PICIC's acquisition of fresh rupee resources.
It was also stimulated by the Government's approval of an increase in the
underwriting commission from 2 ner cent to 2   ner cent of the nominal
amount of the issue plus another 2.5 per cent of the amount taken up, and
bv the AqtahblishmT.nt of TGP in 1'366=  PT Tr coonerated with ICP in 13 of
the 55 operations in which ICP had engaged in the two years until June 1968.
Altoapthver., PICIC hari unden-ritten, until t.hen) 296 iqsllps totalling, Rs. 61X.2
million. Of this amount, Rs. 57.3 million of issues have been floated, out
of which PIGIG has taken up on'ly Rs. 9.7 million or 17 per cent.  In fact,
this gives X wrong impression of PICICs recent underwriting performance.
The percentage of take-ups under unCderr-iting -I.-itmsents since 1965 was
50.9 per cent, which is comparable to the experience of other financial
.L .L UUI,JonJs in 'PakistlCan.
onversl-on ^ tions.  In cases where '±u±u len's to new enter-
prises with a paid-in capital of Rs. 5 million or more, 20 per cent of the
loan is normially in the form of convertible debentures.  PICIC had taken
such options, until June 30, 1968, for an aggregate amount of Rs. 88.8
million, exercised them in 17 cases totliling RLs. 18.9 mi llion and allowed
them to lapse in 6 cases totalling Rs. 2.1 million.
L.20.     Evaluation of Equity Portfolio.  PICIC's equity portfolio is
considered sound.  r'ne market value as at June 30, 1968 exceeded its cost
by Rs. 18.7 million, or 37 per cent. Dividends received in 1967 represented
7.87 per cent of the average portfollo.  Returns have been constantly
increasing since 1963.
Joint Operations with IFC
4.21.     IFC has madefour equity investments, totalling $3,886,000, arid
granted five loans, totalling $18,321,000,in association with PICIC, t.o
five enterprises. Three of the companies so assisted have gone into
commercial operation.
Economic Impact of PICIC's Activities
4.22.     PICIC's activity, in one form or another, has made a substantial
contribution to the development of Pakistani industry. While no precise
figures are available to measure the actual impact of PICIC's completed
operations.. the following estimates, mainly established thraLigh PICIC's
own research,will give some indication.

L.23.    'Until June 30. 1968, PICIC's disbursements of loans and inves-t-
ments amounted to Rs. 933 million. Then all of PICIC's approvals and
narticinations; amounting to Rs. 1.J billion, have been carried out, they,
together with the entrepreneurs' own contribution, are expected to resu:Lt
in a total investment of ccice to Rs. L billion in the private sector.

4.25.     PICIC has been active in carrying out surveys and feasibility
studies. Several of its past studies have led to the establishment of new
plants in various sectors.   A recent study sponsored and financed by PICIC
has determined the possibility of developing beet crops and has led to
the establishment of a beet-cum-cane sugar processing plant.   Since August
1967, PICIC has studied, in cooperation with foreign consultants, the
feasibility of manufacturing gypsum board and sulphuric acid from gypsum.
At present, a number of applications for refractory plants, in some part
resulting from a survey initiated by PICIC, are under consideration. P'ICIC
has also sponsored a survey for the exploitation of china clay deposits.
A survey c,f the engineering industry, sponsored by PICIC, being conducted
by a British firm, aims at exploring ways and means for. optimum utilization
of existing engineering capacity and for developing additional units to
enable the country to produce more capital goods. PICIC has also proposed
to the Jute Manufacturers Association the setting up of a research
institute for the development of the jute industry.
V. PRCSPECTS
5.01.     Investment Targets.   The Government has tentatively estimatecd that
in order to achieve the industrial growth rate of 10 per cent during the
Third Plan period the growth rate of the large and medium scale industries
has to be at about 14 per cent per annum for the remaining period (1968-1970).
Accordingly, the Government has envisaged, in the "Priority List", invest-
ment approvals during the remaining Third Plan period for large and medlium
size projects in the private sector to amount to Rs. 5.3 billion, as follows:



- 13 -
Rupee         Foreign
Resources       Exchange        Total
(Rupees in Millions)
Export-orierited industries          936           1,366          2,302
Agro-based and service industries    327             432            759
Import substitution industries       943          1,280           2,193
Special provision for balancing,
modernization and replacement        20             30             50
Total                      2,226          3,078           5,304
Thus, a higher industrial investment target of Rs. 9.5 billion (consisting
of Rs. 5.3 billion of projected approvals and Rs. 4.2 billion of past
approvals) lhas been set in the "Priority List" as against the original
target of Rs. 8.3 billion.
5.02.        PICIC's Projections.  PICIC has projected its operations on the
basi.s of the total invt-etment  provls env:risaged -in the "Prioritv TList" as
wrell as on its past performance, and knowledge of specific investment projects

Pakistan would be about Rs. 400 million annually.
5.04.        PICIC, in its projections, envisages a more gradual increase over
.LU past perEV.LUrJcUe.  rt±iU apprU1vUV  f.oreignl eAclId,ge l±UWLi Uo Rs. 277
million in 1966 and Rs. 222 million in 1967 and Rs. 250 million in 1968.   Its
foreign exctLange loan approvals, net of U-nCellations, are expected to be
Rs. 250 million in 1969, Rs. 264 million in 1970, Rs. 273 million in 1971 and
Rs. 280 nrrilJLon in 1972. Seen againSt the Government' s expanded industrial
investment plan for the remaining Third Plan period, as well as against
PIGIC's past performance, these projections appear reasonable.   rupee loans
and equity investments are expected to continue at a low annual average rate
of Rs. 32 million over the next )4 years.
5.05.        Resources and Requirements of Foreign Exchange.   PIcIC has
already approved more foreign exchange loans than are covered by its presently
available foreign exchange resources. For loan commitments, however, PICJC
had still available $23.9 million as at December 31, 1968, as summarized
below:

thereafter).  These projections appear realistic.  On the basis of its
actual resource postilon as at Decerber 31, 1968 and its projec ted nlew comu,it-
ments, PICIC's foreign exchange requirements for foreign exchange loan
corim-L-itlWulti shoulU evolve as fOllowS:
Opening      ($ million)         Ciosing Position
Position   New Commitments  (New Resources Required)
Dec.31,1968;-Dec.31,1969   24.0       (69-0)                 (45.0)
Dec.31,1969.-July 31,1970  (45.0)     (37.0)                 (82.0)
In the past. about half of all PICuC's foreign exchange requirEMents have been.
provided by the Bank, the balance from other sources listed in Annex 2. PICIC
is reasonably sure that this pattern will continue in the foreseeable future.
PICIC's Board of Directors has authorized the Managing Director to negotiate
with the Barik a new loan of $40 million.  Such an amount, which would cover
about 50 per cent of the requirements through July 1970, appears justified.
5.07.        Projected Income and Profitability.  Projected earnings
statements for the years 1969-thrcugh 1972 are shown in Annex 13. PICIC's
net earnings are expected to grow from Rs. 21.3 million (43 per cent of
increased share capital) in 1969 to Rs. 25.4 million (51 per cent of share
capital) in. 1970. However, net earnings expressed as a percentage of net;
worth will remain stationary around 18 per cent due to the projected high
plow-back of profits. Unless very substantial distortions occur in the
assumptions underlying the forecasts, PICIC would easily be able to maintain
a 10 per cent dividend to its shareholders, and may well increase the
dividend rate, while continuing to make substantial appropriations to
reserves. Calculated on the basis of the present 10 per cent dividend and
the present share capital, the pay-out ratio would be only about 20 per cent
of total net earnings in 1970.

debt service coverage would be 1.12 times in 1969 and 1.18 times in 1970.
VOi a longer terl basis, PICIC could also be expected, barring majoi disloca-
tions in the economy or in PICIC's management, to retain a comfortable margin
-i1 iLs cash Illow to ensure reguar servicing of its debts, Including tIhe ne-w
proposed Bank loan.
5.09.     Projected Balance Sheets.  Projected balance sheets through 1972
are shown in Annex 14.  Tne average annual growth rate of total assets in two
years through 1970 would be about 14 per cent. Current ratios will be con-
sistently higher than 2.1 times through 1970. Total loan and investment port-
folio would go up from Rs. 766 million in 1968 to about Rs. 1,057 million
in 1970, total outstanding long-term borrowings from Rs. 730 million in 1968
to Rs. 936 million in 1970 and PICIC's equity from Rs. 102 million in 1968 to
Rs. 139 million in 1970.
5.10.     Capital Structure and Debt-E1uity Ratio. As projected, PICIC's
equity would increase proportionately faster than its total assets and this
would result in a continual decrease of PICIC's true debt/equity ratio from
its present level of 7.8:1 to 7.3:1 in 1970 (all subordinated debt considered
as debt).  However, as shown in Anne?x 14, net subordinated debt is expected
to remain p:ractically stationary. Therefore, the ratio between indebtedness
and equity (including a portion of the quasi-equity, as usually defined in
Bank loan agreements with development finance companies) will not follow a
downward trend but will remain constantly at around 6.3:1, assuming that the
last maturi-t;y of the proposed Bank loan will be June 15, 1989, as proposed.
In applying for the proposed loan, PICIC has requested that its borrowing
limit be relaxed to 7 to 1 so as to allow it to incur.with a considerable
margin,the debt necessary for it to achieve its projected operations. In
view of PICIC's sound portfolio, adequate debt service coverage, and rela-
tively trouble-free outlook, the relaxation appears prudent and justified.
VI. CCNCLUSIONS AND RECO?MNMATIONS
Conclusions
6.01.     PICIC is a well-run and sound development finance company.   Its
management and staff are competent, its investment criteria and standards
of appraisal and follow-up high.
6.02.     In its operations, PICIC has well filled the role it was set up to
plav wi thin the framework of C rmrnmPnt policies and the st. iir nf rin ncial
institutions in Pakistan.  It has the confidence and respect of the Government
s well aS of the private business co.mrmunity.  Wthir      1 V4M +th  't s -etr byhe
overall economic situation of the country, it is making an active effort to
diverqifv i +.c operatns +  the exte+.nt possible, both geographically arnd
with respect to new fields of industry.   In particular, a recent increase in
its finanrcia1 assistance and prom.o+ional ac-ivities in East Pakistan is
noteworthy.

the cost of imported machinery and equipment necessary for industrial develop-
ment. As projected, PICIC needs additional foreign currency in excess of
$80 million for loan commitments through July 1970. In the past, PICIC has
oDtained about half of its total foreign excnange resources from the Bank, the
other half f'rom various foreign sources. It is expected that PICIC will be
able to obtain a similar portion of its requirements from sources otner than
the Bank in the near future.
Recommendations
6.06.     It is recommended that the Bank grant PICIC a new loan of $40
million to cover about half of the estimated requirements for foreign exchange
resources until about July 1970.
6.07.     In view of the satisfactory experience the Bank has had with PICIC
as a borrower, through seven loans and ten years, a more flexible procedure
approved for such cases by the Ececutive Directors on November 12, 1968,
should be applicable to the proposed new loan. Accordingly,
(L) The full amount of the loan would be credited to the
Loan Account upon effectiveness of the loan;
(ii)  The Bank's prior approval of projects would be required
oniLy for those projects calling for a $4 million investment
by PICIC, even though only a part of the sum may be financed
from the proceeds of the loan;
(iii) Repayment of the loan would be made on the basis of
a 20 year fixed amortization schedule. including a 32 years'
period of grace, contained in the Loan Agreement. (Under the

.- 17 -
6.08.     In view of PICIC's strong and sound position, and in order to allow
it further room to grow, within the limits of prudence, PICIC's borrowing
limitation, as now usually defined in Bank Loan Agreements with development
finance co.mpanies, should be increased to 7-to-1.

kc)  as far as possible, to assist in broadening the base of
industrial ownership in the country and thereby develop
the Stock Market.
2. Tnese objectives are carried out through:
ki) investment eolicy
(a)  Finance are made avai:Lable only for viable projects which
will contribute to the economic growth of the country and
to saving or earning of foreign exchange. For this
purpose all projects are subjected to careful examination
through qualified staff and only those judged economically
viable, technically sound and financially profitable are
considered for assistance;
(b)  Finance are made available to projects which are in
line with the development plans of the Government, prefer-
ence being given to projects largely based on local raw
materials;
(c)  Financing is diversified, as far as possible, both as
regards different regions of the country and as regards
different industries and their ownership. Preference is
given to the financing of projects in the under-developed
areas of the two wings of the country as long as they
satisfy the conditions of economic viability and financial
soundness;
(d) In accordance with the normal business practice, adequate
security is obtained to cover the loans but in addition the
main considerations are soundness of management and projected
profitability of the enterprise to cover repayments;



PIPNEX 7

(e)  The Corporation does not seek any controlling interest
in any enterprise financed by it but, consistent with
the safety of its interests, leaves the management and
control in the hands of the entrepreneurs;
(f) Even after providing the finance, the projects are
careful-ly watched and those in difficulties are assisted
to the extent possible till the loans are repaid; andJ
(E) Corporation does not finance working capital requirements
by means of short-term local currency loans. This business
is left to the commercial banks. In other respects also
PICIC does not compete with commercial banks.
(ii) Method of Financing
Corporation provides finance according to the suitability of
each project, in the form of
(a)  direct loans, mostly in foreign currencies;
(b)  loans partly convertible into stock;
(c)  direct equity participations; and
(d)  under-writing of public issues.

others institutions and is particularly ready to receive
for training officers from newly established development
banks for their initial training.
