loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to U.S. $40 million to
The Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Limited (PICIC).
PART I -. HISTORICAL
2.        Ovcr the last cleven years the Bank has made 7 loans to
PICIC .in a total amount of $1d4.2 million (not of cancellations).
PICIC has acceptable foreign exchange loan applications in excess of
the funds available and asked the Bank for an eighth loan of $4O million
which is expected to cover, on a commitment basis, about 50% of PICIC's
foreign exchange requirements (against about 53% in the past) through
July 1970. The Company was re-appraised in September, 1968.
3.        Negotiations took place in IWashington from January 27-31, 1969.
The Islamic Republic of Pakistan was represented by Mr. A.R. Bashir,
Economic Minister to the Embassy of Pakistan. Mr. Said Ahmed, Managing
Director, represented PICIC.
4.        The Bank has made 26 loans to Pakistan totalling $517 million
of which 17 are fully disbursed. The Association has made 25 credits
totalling $332 million of which 6 are fully disbursed. The following is
a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Pakistan as of
January 31, 1969:

5.        Loans and Credits under disbursement and the status of the Bank
Group's operations in Pakistan were set out in my Report and Recommondation
for a Telecommunication Project of February 14, 1969. In the current
fiscal year credits approved so far consist of those for East Pakistan
Water Development Authority, General Consultants, $2 million (136-PAK),
and Telecommunications, $16 million (145-PAK). A proposed credit of
$30 million for a Third Agricultural Development Bank project has been
appraised and is expected to be referred to Executive Directors in
May. A Low Lift Pump (East Pakistan) Project is being appraised for
a credit of about $13 million when IDA funds are available, but is
unlikely to be ready for presentation in the current fiscal year. Loans
made in the current fiscal year so far have been for the Tarbela
Project, $25 million, 548-PAK; Dawood-Hercules Fertilizer Project,
$32 million, 5h9-PAK; and for the Second West Pakistan Highway Project,
$35 million, 578-PAK, for which a loan was made as IDA funds were not
then available. A proposed loan of $8 million for a Second Sui Northern
Gas Pipeline project is expected to be presented for Executive Directors'
consideration in April and a proposed loan of $1h.5 million for a
Ninth West Pakistan Railway Project in May.
6.        IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling $28
million. The outstanding commitment net of repayments, cahcellation,
and sales of loans, is about $23.4 million. IFC is presently con-
sidering investment applications in the engineering and chemical
industries.  The IFC operations in Pakistan are proceeding satisfactorily0

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Reappraisal of the Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Limited" (DB-45a) dated
February 5, 1969, is attached.
9.        PICIC began operations in November 1957, to assist private
industrial investment in Pakistan, and the Bank made its first loan
to it that same year. This lender-borrower relationship has now continued
for more than a decade, and the Bank considers its experience with
PICIC as very satisfactory. PICIC's paid-in share capital is now
Rs. 50 million, of which sixty percent is held by Pakistani private
and institutional investors, and forty percent by foreign institutions
and IFC. Besides the loans received from the Bank, PICIC has borrowed
$132 million equivalent of foreign exchange from several foreign
countries.
10.       By September 30, 1968, PICIC had granted a total of 630
loans aggregating Rs. 1.55 billion, of which about 28 percent had been
extended to the textile industry, 18 percent to the jute industry,
13 percent to the sugar industry, and the balance to a variety of other
manufacturing industries. PICIC's other activities, such as equity
investments and underwriting, are modest. Its equity portfolio amounted
to Rs. 50 million as of September 30, 1968, compared with its loan
portfolio of Rs. 666 million.
11.       The appraisal report notes that PICIC is well organized
and efficient. Its management and staff are competent, its operational
standards high and its follow-up activities satisfactory, all of
which have contributed to the good financial performance. In 1968,
the growth of total assets over the previous year was 20 percent.
Net profit was high, reaching Rs. 19 million or 44 percent of average
share capital in 1968. Reserves and retained earnings amounted to
Rs. 52 million, or 104 percent of PICIC's paid-in share capital and 6.8
percent of the total portfolio at end 1968.   The current ratio was .2:1
as of December 31, 1968. The loan portfolio is considered sound. The
debt service coverage is adequate. The market price of a PICIC share,
whose par value is Rs. 10, was quoted at Rs. 19.53 on January 10, 1969,
as against the book value of Rs. 20.40 as of December 31, 1968.



12.       PICIC's projections of loan operations appear reasonable.
PICIC had Rs. 112 million ($24 million) available for loan
commitments as of December 31, 1968 (including $4 million from
the last Bank loan, No. 509-PAK) but it expects to commit about
Rs. 500 million ($106 million) by July 1970 and therefore needs
additional foreign exchange resources of at least $80 million.
As in the past, about half of this can be expected to be obtained
from sources other than the Bank.
13.       The proposed loan was negotiated to include the more
flexible lending procedures proposed in my memo of November 1,
1968 (R68-204) and approved on November 12, 1968 (Sec. M 68-hb4).
14.       For previous loans the Bank credited the loan account
from time to time with various amounts for sub-projects as
requested by PICIC. Requests to credit the loan account with
$2 million equivalent or more in respect of a single sub-project
were subject to prior Bank approval. The anortization schedule
in the Loan Agreement was adjusted, after loan funds were fully
committed, so as to reflect the aggregate of all sub-loan
amortization schedules.
15.       Under the proposed Loan Agreement the full amount of
the loan would be credited to the loan account at once. PICIC
would provide information on its sub-loans only as a basis for
withdrawal requests, except where PICIC's total investment in
a single project exceeded $) million; in such cases the Bank's
approval would be required as long as any of the funds to be
used were to come from the Bank loan. Finally, the amortization
schedule would not be adjusted after the loan had been fully
committed.



16.       PICIC will continue, as it has in the past, to make sub-loans,
from the proceeds of the Bank Loan, in the foreign currency or currencies
in which PICIC itself will have to repay the Bank. However, the
repayments to PICIC on its sub-loans, the terms of which would be geared
to the requirements of each individual project financed, might not fully
coincide with PICIC's own repayment obligations to the Bank as determined
by the fixed amortization schedule. Thus there are likely to be periods
during which PICIC would have an excess of repayments received, in Rupees,
over repayments to be made to the Bank, in foreign currencies. PICIC
considers it prudent, and has undertaken the obligation (in Section 5.C3 (c)
of the Loan Agreement) to protect itself during these periods against the
risk of losses on such excess repayments received arising out of possible
changes in the exchange rate between the rupee and the foreign currencies
in which PICIC will have to make its repayments. At PICIC's request the
Government has agreed to provide, against a small fee, guarantees against
this risk.
17.       PICIC's ratio of debt to equity, as defined in Section 5.C5 of
the proposed Loan Agreement, is forecast to exceed the presently stipulated
limitation of 6 to 1 in 1969, while a ratio of 7-1 would be required to
enable PICIC to undertake the level of operations forecast. PICIC's sound
management, strong financial position, and adequate debt service coverage,
justify this relaxation of the debt/equity limitation. Debt service is
cove±red about;l.6 times.
18.       PICIC's activities have had a significant effect on the industrial
sector and the economy of Pakistan as a whole. PICIC's total approvals
of loans and investments and foreign participations in PICIC financed
projects totalled Rs. 1.8 billion by June 30, 1968. PTCIC's approvals
are currently averaging about 15 percent of total approvals by the
Government for industrial investment in the private sector. PICIC estimate!
that its investments will contribute to the gross national produce in
the order of Rs. 1 billion annually in the form of value added, and
about Rs. 59C million per year through export earnings and import savings.
New employment opportunities expected to be created through PICIC-assisted
projects so far are estimated at 98,000 jobs. Industry survey and market
studies carried out by PICIC have broadened the range of potential
investment in the private sector.
PART IV  - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and PICIC, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section b (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separatel7.



20.       Except for the Sections providing for immediate crediting of
the full amount of the Loan to the Loan Account (Section 2.C2), a fixed
rate of interest (Section 2.05) and a fixed amortization schedule (Section
2.08), the draft Loan Agreement and draft Guarantee Agreement conform
generally to the pattern of agreements for loans to development finance
companies and of agreements for previous loans to PICIC. Section 3.07
of the draft Guarantee Agreement requires the Guarantor to make arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank to protect PICIC against losses in connection
with the payment of the Loan resulting from changes in the foreign
exchange rate for rupees.
PART V  -  THE ECONOMY
21.       A report on the Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Pakistan (AS-136a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 22,
1968. Another economic mission has just returned from Pakistan. Its
report is expected to be distributed in April.
22.       A review of the more important developments in the interim
is included in the President's Report for a second West Pakistan Highway
Project (P-651) of November 13, 1968 (R-68-212).
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII  - RECOiEIDATION
24.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.
