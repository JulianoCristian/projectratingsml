The project has three\n            interrelated components.  The first focuses on qualitative\n            renewal and would support the provision of learning and\n            teaching materials and improvements in examination quality\n            and management. The second component consists of\n            rehabilitation and construction of physical facilities in\n            primary schools, which would increase access and improve the\n            education environment. The third is a planning and\n            management component which would strengthen professional and\n            administrative support to teachers and to schools; establish\n            an information management system including a system for\n            maintaining teacher's records; and undertake a series\n            of policy studies that are essential to planning further\n            development of the sector. Project conditionality would\n            ensure increased budgetary allocation to education, while\n            project implementation would buttress Government efforts to\n            involve the non-government sector in education delivery.\n            Given the immense gap between the needed investments in the\n            sector and the resources available, the proposed\n            interventions were selected on the basis of their catalytic\n            impact on education revitalization."}, "docdt": "1992-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
