capabilities to provide needed credit for economically\n            viable rural projects. Specifically, the project would\n            finance a training program for TRDB's staff and for\n            village officials; provision of consultants and local staff\n            to strengthen TRDB's organizational structure;\n            provision of new office facilities, office equipment and\n            furniture; provision of transportation facilities; an input\n            distribution study; and a line of credit to support\n            TRDB's lending program. Project benefits would be the\n            increased capacity of TRDB to efficiently meet village\n            requirements of credit which would help in increasing\n            village production and farmers' income. Recovery of the\n            credit is the basic risk under the proposed project.\n            However, seminars for village officials in accounting and\n            credit concepts, improved billing procedures, efficient\n            follow-up and supervision, and providing credit only to\n            those villages with good credit records, should minimize\n            this risk."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
