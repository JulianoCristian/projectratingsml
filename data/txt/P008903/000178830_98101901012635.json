The\n            Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK), a State Economic\n            Enterprise (SEE), is responsible for electricity generation\n            and transmission in most of the provinces in Turkey. Only in\n            four out of sixty-seven provinces are power operations in\n            the hands of two private power companies. Turkey has over a\n            hundred municipal and regional power distribution entities\n            of which the largest one is the Istanbul Electricity,\n            Tramway and Tunnel Company (IETT), the beneficiary of loan\n            892-TU made in 1973. IETT's operations cover\n            electricity distribution, public transport (buses, trolleys\n            and tunnel) and two gas plants in and around the\n            Municipality of Istanbul. The Ministry of Energy and Natural\n            Resources (MOE) has official jurisdiction over the\n            development of energy resources in Turkey and power supply\n            activities. The organizations such as TEK and IETT are\n            subject to close Governmental supervision and their autonomy\n            has been severely limited by the lack of freedom in setting\n            personnel policies and by the Government's role in\n            determining prices of their goods and services. This project\n            completion report is based on a completion report prepared\n            by IETT and on information obtained by a Bank mission from\n            IETT and other Turkish power related institutions in May\n            1981. The project's operating performance was again\n            reviewed in May 1982 after allowing sufficient time to\n            enable a judgement to be made on such operating performance."}, "docdt": "1982-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
