Development Project is rated as satisfactory,\n            sustainability as likely, institutional development impact\n            as substantial, Bank performance as highly satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance as satisfactory. Sustainable management\n            of natural resources and the environment in the northwest\n            region and in Tunisia generally will remain important goals\n            in the near future and the long term. The successful\n            implementation of this project has provided many important\n            lessons which can contribute to the attainment of this goal.\n            The key lessons include: To attain maximum impact, project\n            funded research should be limited to topics which are an\n            integral part of project activities, demand-driven, and\n            consistent with the development objectives. Dissemination\n            techniques that include local farmers can be successful if\n            they are given adequate technical assistance. When dealing\n            with small-scale farmers, techniques that take into account\n            the entire production system are more likely to be adopted\n            than those developed for a specific crop or ecosystem. When\n            a project includes land consolidation it is important to\n            provide incentive such as land titling. Participation of all\n            stakeholders ensures the success of the participatory\n            approach from the early stages of project preparation. The\n            participatory approach requires flexible project budgeting.\n            Women extension agents are necessary to ensure women's\n            participation in projects."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
