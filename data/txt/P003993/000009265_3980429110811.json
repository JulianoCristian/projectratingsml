There are three main components. The\n            first 1) supports Bappenas transport planning and guides the\n            development of increased regional and provincial autonomy;\n            2) defines a regional transport strategy, preparing\n            long-term plans, feasibility studies, and other surveys; and\n            3) improves annual planning/programming in the program area.\n            The second component improves the national, provincial, and\n            Kabupaten road networks, comprising road network\n            maintenance, widening, and rehabilitation; and major\n            capacity expansion and network extension. The third\n            component enhances quality and technical efficiency by\n            setting up consistent contract monitoring and control\n            processes, improving design and construction audit\n            processes, facilitating quality construction, and giving\n            advice on technical and contractual matters. This component\n            also builds the capacity of provincial road traffic and\n            transport agencies, makes selective investments, conducts\n            awareness campaigns, and provides equipment to reduce\n            vehicle overloading."}, "docdt": "1998-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
