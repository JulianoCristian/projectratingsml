Several lessons are drawn from the\n            experience of this project, above all, that decentralization\n            created a plethora of agencies with transport planning and\n            environmental management responsibilities; yet, a lack of\n            clarity remains within each agency regarding roles and\n            responsibilities with respect to transport planning.\n            Furthermore, the present institutional structure is\n            over-fragmented geographically, vertically and horizontally,\n            with insufficiently strong conduits for inter-agency\n            communication. One of the main constraints on a coordinated\n            approach to regional transport sector planning was the law\n            on regional autonomy. The law itself does not set out the\n            role, function and responsibility of each organization, nor,\n            the structure and staffing of a planning organization, nor,\n            the qualifications and experience for the personnel of the\n            organization. Thus, there needs to be a fully coordinated\n            institutional review of the transport sector to rationalize\n            the tasks of supply, financing and regulation. Regarding\n            road planning competency, it is good at the central level.\n            However, the principle tool employed - the inter-urban road\n            management system (IRMS), is complex and demands a large\n            volume of data. If the database is not maintained, the\n            output of IRMS is undermined in reliability, and therefore\n            often distrusted. Respect for road planning, programming and\n            budgeting activity by district level decision makers is\n            minimal. Consequently planning initiatives are few and\n            capability remains weak. Further lessons address transport\n            planning incentives, the importance of transport planning\n            groups, the role of lending institutions, and the need for\n            planning tools, in addition to an appropriate use of\n            consultants, and, road traffic safety and dimensions enforcement."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
