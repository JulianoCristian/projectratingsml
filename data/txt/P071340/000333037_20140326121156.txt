              Nigeria: Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance Project (P071340)


              On September 30, 2013, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection ("the
      Request") relating to the Nigeria: Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance Project
      (P071340) (''the Project"). The Request was sent by the Social and Economic Rights Action
      Center (SERAC) on behalf of "individuals, families and groups living in the Badia area ofLagos
      State." The Requesters allege that the Project has caused further "impoverishment and insecurity"
      of Badia residents, a vulnerable slum community in Lagos, as a result of evictions that have
      occurred under the Project "without prior consultation, notice, compensation or resettlement."

              The Panel verified that the Request met the basic requirements for Registration. However,
      based on the willingness of both the Requesters and Management to provide an opportunity to
      resolve the concerns raised, the Panel postponed its decision to register it and initiated instead the
      Pilot approach to support early solutions in the Inspection Panel process. 1 On November 11,
      2013, the Panel informed the Board that it would review the situation within three months, as of
      February 11 , 2013,2 as stipulated in the Pilot document. 3

            As set out in the Pilot document, the Panel asked Requesters and Management to keep it
     updated on developments during the three months period. In that regard, the Requesters and
     Management informed the Panel that an agreement on compensation payments was reached
     between the community representatives and Lagos State Government as a way to resolve the
     concerns of the Requesters. The Panel has learned that this agreement is currently being
     implemented, but some practical issues remain. Requesters and Management are continuing to
