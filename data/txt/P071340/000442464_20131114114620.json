The Request was sent by a civil society\n            organization based in Lagos on behalf of individuals,\n            families, and groups living in the Badia area of Lagos\n            State. The requesters believe that they have suffered\n            serious harm as a result of actions and omissions of the\n            World Bank. They state that the Bank is clearly obliged to\n            ensure that the project is implemented in accordance with\n            its own operational policies and to hold Lagos State to its\n            commitments under the LMDGP agreement. The requesters claim,\n            that the evictions and demolitions have resulted in further\n            impoverishment. The requester\u0092s state that on December 2012\n            a retroactive resettlement action plan was completed and\n            provided minimal financial assistance to 124 project\n            affected persons displaced during the March 2012 forced\n            eviction, the sums were insufficient to offset the harms\n            suffered, especially in light or the delay of nearly nine\n            months. They add that since February 23, 2013, no relief or\n            emergency aid measures have been undertaken to mitigate the\n            extreme suffering of thousands of affected persons. On\n            October 31, 2013, and in line with the new pilot approach,\n            Bank Management provided to the Panel a written note of\n            actions given by Bank Management to address the concerns of\n            the requesters, including an anticipated timeline as\n            follows: a copy of the 2012 resettlement action plan (RAP)\n            after the demolition or forced eviction in March 2012; a\n            copy of the most recent revision of the 2013 RAP (or\n            addendum to the 2012 RAP as was originally indicated), along\n            with related documents; and clarification about the\n            timetable for the setting up of the grievance mechanism with\n            reference to certain deadlines identified in the Management\n            actions. The Panel has decided to postpone its decision on\n            registration to provide an opportunity for an early\n            resolution of the concerns of the requesters under the\n            pilot. In accordance with the steps set out in the pilot\n            approach, the Panel will ask the requesters and management\n            to engage in dialogue directly on these matters, and to keep\n            it updated on progress in addressing the concerns of the\n            requesters. Also, in line with the pilot approach, the\n            requesters have the right at any time to indicate that they\n            are not satisfied and will like the Panel to register their Request."}, "docdt": "2013-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
