                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After the last mission because of the suspension of civil works due lack of compliance with safeguards little progress has been made in the provision of infrastructure through the
                         construction of water supply facilities, schools, health centers, roads and drainage facilities. Disbursement has remained below expectation, after six years of implementation only
                         50.9% has been disbursed and with an outstanding balance of $94 million, of which $33.95 million of commitments on on-going contracts and $74.38 million non-committed. This

                         project is due to close by September 2013 and the major question will therefore be to decided the best use of the amount that cannot be utilized given the challenges that the project
                         has encountered since inception.
                         Since the last mission improvement has been done on the safeguards issues as identified and correction made. Payment of displaced persons on roads and drain works are now in
                         progress. The Support to Citizens Mediation Centers is working well where there is now a strong interest by the communities.The project has initiated contacts with the other

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project implementation has progressed but still not up till the required level in comparison with the project life span. More effort will need to be done within the next few months for the
                         project to be able to show case that it can deliver what is outstanding within the remaining nine months to the closure of the project.
