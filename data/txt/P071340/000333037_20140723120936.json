On\n            September 30, 2013, the Panel received a request for\n            inspection of the Nigeria: Lagos Metropolitan Development\n            and Governance Project ('the Project'), and after\n            consulting with the requesters and management, the Panel\n            decided to consider this case under the Pilot approach. In\n            addition to presenting the results of the case in the\n            context of the Pilot, this note also provides insights into\n            the issues that arose during the Panel's assessment of\n            the case and the lessons that emerged from it. The Request\n            for Inspection ('the request') was submitted by\n            the Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) in\n            Lagos, on behalf of 'individuals, families and groups\n            living in the Badia area of Lagos State' alleging that\n            the project has caused the 'impoverishment and\n            insecurity' of Badia residents, a vulnerable slum\n            community in Lagos, as a result of evictions that have\n            occurred under the Project 'without prior consultation,\n            notice, compensation or resettlement.' The requesters\n            believe that they have suffered serious harm as a result of\n            actions and omissions of the World Bank. They state that the\n            Bank is 'clearly obliged to ensure that the project is\n            implemented in accordance with its own operational policies\n            and to hold Lagos State to its commitments under the LMDGP\n            Project Agreement.' They add that on February 23, 2013,\n            again, hundreds of structures were demolished in the area of\n            Badia East immediately adjoining the canal mentioned above,\n            forcefully evicting about 9.000 inhabitants. According to\n            the Requesters, both incidences occurred without prior\n            consultation, notice, compensation or resettlement and\n            resulted in their further impoverishment. They add that\n            since February 23, 2013, no relief or emergency aid measures\n            have been provided to mitigate the extreme suffering of\n            thousands of affected people. The Request refers to a number\n            of interactions in which these concerns have been raised\n            with World Bank representatives between March 2012 and July 2013."}, "docdt": "2014-07-16T00:00:00Z"}
