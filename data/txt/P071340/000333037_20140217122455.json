This will entail civil works, as well as\n            rehabilitation works in slum areas, in water supply and\n            sanitation, roads, drainage, power and other critical, basic\n            infrastructure. The project will thus require displacement\n            and relocation of people, currently residing around the\n            proposed roads, or on other land intended for public\n            infrastructure works. This Resettlement Policy Framework\n            provides details on the populations affected, the regulation\n            framework, the methods used to identify project affected\n            persons (PAPs), the methods and scope of consultation with\n            PAPs on resettlement issues, the resettlement and\n            compensation packages, the institutional arrangements for\n            implementing the RAP, its cost, special assistance to\n            vulnerable PAPs, and external and internal monitoring.\n            Eligibility for resettlement and compensation is based upon\n            the country's legislation on resettlement, and the\n            Bank's operational directive on involuntary\n            resettlement. Any household identified as owning structures\n            affected by the project is eligible for resettlement and\n            compensation packages. Vulnerable groups will be compensated\n            for any disturbance due to relocation. Social links will not\n            be hindered by the relocation, and people will remain as\n            close to employment opportunities as possible. Land for land\n            compensation will be available for housing, and for\n            commercial relocation as well."}, "docdt": "2013-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
