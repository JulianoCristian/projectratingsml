H. Restructuring
The project was restructured on 07/05/2011 (Level II restructuring).


I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time the project was conceived, Nigeria was Africa’s most populous country, and
the continent’s second-largest economy. It had an estimated population of about 136.51 million
people, about half of whom lived in urban areas, and accounted for almost one fifth of Africa’s
population. Nigeria’s per capita GDP was an average of USD390. Nigeria’s economy was highly
dependent on oil; 76 percent of Government revenues and 95 percent of export earnings were
derived from it2.

2.       In spite of Nigeria’s relatively strong economic track record, the country was facing
significant development challenges, and still remains off-track for meeting some of the
Millennium Development Goals. There were and continue to be large disparities in poverty
between and within regions and states (i.e., currently 63.4 percent of the total population and over
75 percent of agricultural households in the North live below the poverty line, with income of less
than USD1.25 per day).

3.       Nigeria’s urbanization rate of 5.5 percent per annum was one of the highest in the world.
It crossed the 50 percent urbanization mark in 2012, making its urban population the largest of
any low income country, except India. By 2020, 53.9 percent of Nigeria’s poor, as defined by
income poverty, will be city dwellers. Unlike most African countries dominated by one or two
large cities, Nigeria has a broadly dispersed network of cities, except for Lagos.

4.       When the project was designed, Lagos was a mega city of dominant economic
importance not just for Nigeria, but West Africa as well. Lagos’ population was larger than that
of 37 individual countries in Africa. With an estimated population of 11.14 million in 2003 (about
17 million at present); Lagos’s population growth rate of 4.8 percent per annum was a remarkably
high growth rate for a mega city. It had the largest concentration of multinationals and financial
institutions of the country, was home to almost 60 percent of Nigeria’s non-oil economy, and was
the premier manufacturing and port city in West Africa.

5.      At the time of appraisal, almost 70 percent of Lagos’ population lived in slums 3 in
extremely poor environmental surroundings. Knee-deep floods sweeping raw sewage and refuse
inside densely packed homes were frequent in neighborhoods where overcrowding was the norm.
While the average residential density for Lagos was about 260 people per hectare, the population
density in slums was between 790 and 1240 people per hectare.

6.       Regular flooding of large parts of the city was an important infrastructure problem for
Lagos, as these floods caused enormous damage to property and infrastructure, exacerbated
traffic congestion, and were a public health hazard. Tackling the problems of floods represented
an overwhelmingly complex task, partly because of the resource needs, but also because of
institutional capacity needed to develop and apply modern planning tools for the management of

  Currently, Nigeria remains highly dependent on oil, which accounts for over 95 percent of exports, nearly about 75
percent of consolidated government revenues, and over 30 percent of GDP

a complex drainage system. Benefits from improvements in the drainage system, also required
concurrent improvements in the solid waste management (SWM) system.

7.       Housing prices in Lagos were high due to the non-availability of long-term finance, high
transaction costs for obtaining land titles and/or certificates of occupancy, regulatory and
planning controls for building and construction that constrained the efficient utilization of land, as
well as high inflation rates in the Nigerian economy. The impact of these distortions has been
exacerbated because of its small land mass in comparison to the land mass of other States. Slums
have been therefore, a consequence of both market and government failures.

8.      On the political side, project preparation coincided with the period when a democratically
elected civilian government came to power in Nigeria in 1999. The newly elected government
was confronted with numerous and pressing development challenges: widespread poverty;
weakened governance environment due to a prolonged period of military rule; social and political
unrest; external debt arrears; infrastructure deficit; an oil-driven economy contributing little
towards direct employment; and lack of sound diagnostic tools to develop a comprehensive
program for priority reforms and for targeting investments to improve livelihoods of poor people.

9.        Rationale for IDA involvement. The Project rationale derives from IDA’s experience
with integrated development in large cities in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Pakistan.
Experience highlights that cities need a sustained flow of services to contribute to growth, not just
infrastructure stock. Service delivery requires substantial institutional reforms, including the
facilitation of private sector participation. These reforms take time. The ability to support sizable
investment over lengthy periods of time gives IDA the comparative advantage to both facilitate
and sustain reform processes during the transition, thereby enhancing prospects for the
effectiveness of public expenditures. Another advantage is IDA’s substantial knowledge acquired
over two decades of engagement with Lagos. Recommendations of the Bank’s 1982 Urban Sector
Review were supported by USD304.2 million of infrastructure investments through three
operations between 1985-1999. Since 2003, crosssectoral analytic work and policy dialogue
under the Lagos Strategy further enhanced IDA’s knowledge to provide cohesive, multi-sectoral,
and strategic support for integrated metropolitan development. This also enabled IDA to facilitate
dialogue with diverse stakeholders on key policy issues, including service delivery. The support
under the Lagos Urban Transport Project (LUTP) and the Second National Urban Water Sector
Reform Project (S SNUWSRP) were deliberately conceived along with LMDGP, to upgrade
Lagos across sub-sectors.

10.      Contribution to higher level objectives. This Project was consistent with the objectives
and approach of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2005-2009 that supported Nigeria’s
development priorities. The CPS aimed to achieve the following results: (i) improved service
delivery for human development; (ii) improved environment and services for nonoil growth; and
(iii) improved transparency and accountability for better governance, Lagos is one of the lead
States of the CPS, and the proposed Project supported results packages (i) and (iii) above.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11.     The Project's objective is to increase sustainable access to basic urban services through
investments in critical infrastructure. Progress towards achieving the objective of the Project was
measured through: (i) increase in the percentage of population with access to safe water in the
selected 9 slums; (ii) reduction in the percentage of households reporting flooding in the LGs
where the selected drainage basins lie; (iii) increase in the percentage of generated garbage in

Lagos that arrives for disposal at landfills; and (iv) reduced deviation between actual expenditures
and the approved budget.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

12.    The project was restructured on July 5, 2011 (Level II restructuring). The PDO was not
changed. Changes were introduced to activities under project components and the results
framework was revised. Some indicators were modified, some were introduced and some were
removed as discussed further in this ICR. The table below presents the original and revised results
frameworks.

1.6 Revised Components

22.      At restructuring, the original components were preserved but the scope of the individual
activities was changed, as follows:

            Drainage physical investment support (Component A.2.(i)) was limited to ongoing
             work on two drainage channels and on tertiary drainage and minor bridges, necessary
             to facilitate access to the schools and health centers being built. The main activities
             that were dropped included: (i) deferred maintenance program to clear the entire
             drainage network, and (ii) design and comprehensive rehabilitation of two drainage
             systems based on analysis of the basins’ hydraulics.
            Physical investments in solid waste management (Component A 3. (i) and (ii)) were
             limited to works already carried out on dumpsite cleaning and communal waste depots
             construction, and excluded all planned work on transfer stations and sanitary landfill,
             which constituted the bulk of the sub-component allocation.
            The restructuring included the scale up of the urban upgrading subcomponent
             (Component A. 1. (i)) by increasing the number of schools and health centers to be
             constructed and scaling up road construction in the same nine slums.
            The Public Governance and Capacity Building component was scaled up to better
             support the first Lagos Development Policy Operation (DPO1) activities and to the
             achievement of triggers for the Second Lagos Development Policy Operation
             (DPO2)5.

  Under the first Lagos Development Policy Operation (DPO), the Lagos Ministry of Finance was to prepare a report on
the status of Oracle Financial system and adopt a plan for full utilization of the modules purchased and for future roll-
out to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies. The Second Lagos DPO will continue to support policy measures for
achieving fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium-term, as outlined in the first DPO, with some minor


                                                           6
               The Urban Policy And Project Coordination Component, renamed to Urban Policy
                Dialogue, Communication, Coordination and Support to Citizen Mediation Centers
                and Office of Public Defender (Component C of the Project) was marginally scaled up
                to cater for increased expenses and further support to citizens mediation centers.

1.7 Other significant changes

23.   Reallocation of credit proceeds. At restructuring, credit proceeds amounted to
USD219.6 at the SDR exchange rate of June 23, 2011 as opposed to the original credit amount of
USD200 million. The restructuring re-allocated credit proceeds as follows:
     Sub-Component A.1 Upgrading: increased from the original USD40.2 to USD138.42
      million with more schools, roads and health centers to be constructed/rehabilitated
     Sub-Component A2 Drainage: reduced from the original USD61.4 to USD32.55 million
      Sub-Component A.3 Solid Waste Management: reduced from the original USD63.8 to
      USD11.60 million
     Component B Governance: increased from USD6.0 to USD14.30 million to better
      support the Lagos Development Policy Operation (DPO)
     Component C Urban Policy and Project Coordination: increased from USD12.1 to
      USD16.42 million to cater for increased operating expenses and further support to
      citizens mediation centers
     At the time of the reallocation an amount of USD5.25 million was allocated as
      contingency.

24.     Cancellation of credit amount. At project end the Government requested the
cancellation of SDR27.86 million (USD43 million). As of March 27, 2014 USD31.07 million has
not been disbursed, out of which approximately USD3 million are earmarked to cover ongoing
compensation payments. The remaining undisbursed funds will be canceled. The following table
presents the current financial information.

due to the MU ratings of the DO and IP ratings at the time of the request.




adjustments. These measures will ensure that government spending is aligned with the strategic priorities articulated in
the state’s medium-term development strategy, and that fiscal risks are properly monitored and managed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

26.      Soundness of the background analysis and lessons learned. Preparation of LMDGP
started in 2000 following a Government request for an urban project to complement the Lagos
State’s efforts on poverty alleviation. Between 2001 and 2005, project preparation stalled due to
an insufficient IDA allocation and competing investment priorities. Initially the project was
intended to include urban, water and transport sectors but was later split into three separate
projects. The background analysis for LMDGP was extensive and sound. It included a wealth of
consultations, community engagement, stakeholder analysis and relationship building, as well as
a geo-referenced household survey and technical studies informed by newly acquired satellite
imagery6 . The project was designed to address the single most serious infrastructure issue of
Lagos (drainage and flood control) comprehensively from a technical, financial, and community
perspective. Earlier lessons learned were studied and taken into consideration7. The Bank assisted
Lagos to develop policy notes on solid waste management, urban upgrading and drainage service.
These were formally endorsed by the State and provided the guiding principles for LMDGP.

27.      Assessment of project design. Project activities supported fully the achievement of the
PDO and were aligned with the results indicators. However, LMDGP was very ambitious. It
spanned over multiple sectors with multiple executing agencies, priorities, reporting lines, and
constituencies. In addition to being horizontally complex, complexity was added by the vertical
hierarchy of stakeholders – communities, local governments, the Lagos State, and the Federal
Government. As it turned out during implementation, it was very difficult to align such a
multiplicity of agencies under one project umbrella More specifically, the Bank team was often
overstretched and under-resourced, much needed coordination between the Component Executing
Agencies (CEA)8 was lagging, the intended policy dialogue was overtaken by the persistent need
to align stakeholders and advance implementation and over time, the local governments’ attention
faded affecting the sustainability of new assets.

28.      Institutional arrangements reflected the project’s multi-sectorial nature. The aim was to
place implementation above the influence of a single CEA. The PCU was therefore set up as an
independent body with oversight from a broad-based Project Steering Committee (PSC) reporting
directly to the Governor. Intended to guard against corruption and concomitant problems, the
PSC was envisaged as a strong body of statesmen and representatives from the civil society and
the private sector. As it turned out during implementation, this set up was rather vulnerable to the


6
  Activities carried out as part of the background analysis included: (i) an evaluation of a pilot upgrading project in
Badia to identify lessons learned and reflect those in the design of LMDGP; (ii) nine slum areas were surveyed to
identify development priorities for local communities followed by validation workshops with participation of local
governments, (iii) a social assessment to evaluate the viability and sustainability of specific upgrading projects
proposed by the communities, (iv) an Urban Forum open to all stakeholders to discuss urban upgrading policies for
Lagos, (v) satellite imagery and GIS software and hardware to determine the areas within the slums with most acute
needs; (vi) a poverty and service delivery assessment of Lagos which provided a baseline for monitoring service
delivery against public expenditure and was linked to the GIS, (vii) a toolkit developed to guide the scaling up of
upgrading interventions, (viii) studies and consultations related to drainage to provide a better baseline information,
estimate potential benefits and facilitate maintenance financing.
7
  These encompassed the need for a broad-based stakeholder consensus, community participation in project appraisal
and an autonomous Solid Waste Agency.
8
  Such as LASURA, LAWMA, the Office of Drainage Services (Drainage), etc.


                                                          8
level of Government commitment. When commitment weakened, the PCU was left without
effective oversight affecting implementation negatively.

29.     The design of individual project components was solid and included: (i) a hydraulic
model to guide investments in the drainage system and address routine flooding; (ii) investments
to resolve the major bottleneck for waste transportation and disposal in Lagos in parallel with
introduction of environmental controls at the largest dumpsite; (iii) an incremental approach to
upgrading rather than a full area renewal; (iv) assistance towards performance management for
better public finance and budgeting; and (v) policy dialogue for continuous stakeholder
engagement and consensus building. Additional activities included the Citizen’s Mediation
Centers and, conflict resolution and HIV campaigns, both contributing to the strengthening of the
community component of the project.

30.     Adequacy of Government commitment. At appraisal, the State Government appears to
have been fully involved and committed to project objectives and activities. During the early
stages of implementation, State Commissioners participated at the PSC which used to fulfill its
function of a high-level coordination and oversight body. Over time, Government’s interest
declined and by the end of the project, the PSC was attended by low-level officials without
decision taking authority. The multi-faceted nature of the project became its greatest weakness.
Not a single agency associated directly with the project or ‘owned’ its objectives.

31.      Assessment of risks. The overall risk at project preparation was rated substantial. Two
important risks that were identified at appraisal materialized despite the mitigation measures in
place. These included (i) ineffective coordination of metropolitan functions (moderate); and (ii)
conflicts around the locations of infrastructure improvements not resolved proactively
(moderate). The assessment of risks did not flag and/or sufficiently mitigate the complexity of the
project involving multiple sectors and agencies.

2.2 Implementation

32.     Implementation phases. The project faced numerous challenges over the course of
implementation. Implementation can notionally be divided into three phases which overlapped
with the time in office of the three Team Task Leaders (TTLs) that led the Bank’s implementation
support teams. The first phase (2007-2009) was characterized with active supervision,
complementary activities being added to the project (two carbon purchasing agreements were
signed for Olushosun landfill site under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and a World
Bank Institute-supported comprehensive training program), appearance of initial setbacks related
to fiduciary and safeguards compliance, and multiple attempts by the Bank’s team to place the
project on a successful implementation path. The second phase (2009-2011) was characterized by
a problematic project performance, a seemingly non-proactive supervision by the Bank, issues
with safeguards compliance, and project restructuring. The third phase (late 2011-2013) was
marked by a multiplicity of corrective measures, including retroactive RAPs, technical audits and
measures to repair non-performing assets developed under the project and bring them to working
order and enhanced management support.

33.     Change in enabling environment. During the initial implementation stage, the project
enjoyed strong political support from the State Government and a formidable commitment by the
Bank’s team. There was a highly cooperative environment that not only allowed the project to set
ambitious goals, but allowed an excellent implementation start with broad stakeholder
engagement and support. However, as the project progressed, and Governor and Bank’s teams
changed around 2008, the linkages that had been built began to weaken. The new State


                                                9
leadership, determined to transform Lagos, was supported by a strong revenue growth9 , both
internally generated and from federal transfers. Significant State funds were mobilized to finance
a massive drainage rehabilitation program, waste clean-up and collection, as well as other
programs such as crime prevention, beautification, etc., all outside of LMDGP. These
interventions were not always following accepted international practice but showed immediate
results. Striking progress for instance was made in the solid waste sector and Lagos became
remarkably cleaner. As a result, the funding under the LMDGP lost primacy. In parallel, major
issues related to divergent views on safeguards and resettlement policies emerged and slowed
down any momentum left from the preparation stage.

34.      Project restructuring. The project was restructured once (level II restructuring) as
discussed in Section 1.6 above. Due to difficulties with social safeguards compliance, and the fact
that LASG was making substantial investments from own resources 10 , activities under the
drainage and solid waste management11 components were scaled down to already implemented
works. The balance of project funds was reallocated mainly to Component 3 (slum upgrade).
Although the restructuring cancelled the components intended to control flooding, which was the
core activity in terms of impact, the PDO was not changed. The restructuring was not utilized to
correct other aspects of the project that were problematic (implementation arrangements, weak
use of Monitoring and Evaluation systems) or re-engage the State Government in an effective
policy dialogue about the evolving city environment. It took nearly two years to restructure the
project, which further complicated implementation.

35.      Mid-term review (MTR). A MTR was not carried out for this project. It was replaced by
the restructuring process as described above.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.      M&E Design. The PDO, project activities and performance indicators prior to
restructuring were aligned. The indicators were devised to adequately capture progress under
respective components and activities. Baseline values were determined at appraisal for both PDO
and intermediate indicators. In addition, a city-wide baseline of non-income poverty was
established as a sound foundation for target indicators. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
made specific provisions how the M&E data will be collected. The positions at the PCU included
an M&E specialist and support staff proficient in the use of information technology. Following
restructuring, the indicators were revised and aligned with the revised project activities.

37.     M&E Implementation. Reporting on physical progress of the project, expenditures, and
the achievement of results was not satisfactory. During the first year of implementation, an M&E




9
 Federal transfers grew from N36 billion in 2004 to N82 billion in 2008, while internally generated revenue (IGR)
grew form N36 billion to N137 billion during the same period. (WB, 2010).

10
   LASG’ capital spending raised to an estimate 4 percent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in 2008, up from
0.8 percent in 2005, representing an eight-fold increase in real terms over this period.

11
  The SW interventions were affected by different views of the Lagos State and the Bank regarding priorities for the
sector. This component was scaled down on safeguards grounds since the rehabilitation at the landfill would have
involved large scale resettlement and loss of livelihood.




                                                        10
Workshop was delivered by the Bank’s Results and Learning Group and focused on concepts and
approaches to results-based monitoring, especially for flood control within the Lagos setting.
Despite this workshop and follow-up trainings, data collection was poor throughout the life of the
project. Data was not made available on time, the Bank was often unable to assess the evolution
of works undertaken by different CEAs, and the progress towards achieving the objectives of the
project. When information was available, it was often of questionable quality. Disconnect
between various reports, particularly reports on physical progress and disbursements, made it
difficult to keep track of contract execution and achieving of targets. The position of the M&E
officer was vacant for lengthy periods of time impacting data collection and utilization.

38.    M&E Utilization. There is no evidence of consistent use of data to inform decision
making during project implementation. This could be due to the overall issues affecting the PCU
performance, the lack of information and the poor quality of it when available.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.      Environmental and social safeguards. The project triggered Operational Policy (OP)
4.01 (Environmental Assessment) and OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) and was classified as
category B. Both policies were related to activities under Component 1. An Environmental and
Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were prepared
and disclosed in-country and in the Bank’s Infoshop in June 2005. Avoiding or minimizing
resettlement and disruption of livelihoods was in the spirit of the project. Nevertheless, small
scale resettlement was expected under the drainage sub-component (in the magnitude of 40
instances). Medium to large scale resettlement and loss of income was expected under the waste
sub-component (hundreds of scavengers and site dwellers mostly at the Olushosun dumpsite). By
design, project funds were provisioned for compensation. At Negotiations, the State Government
confirmed its commitment to apply the principles of the RPF in all instances of city upgrade
regardless of the source of funding. An inter-Ministerial Technical Committee on safeguards was
established with assistance under the project for better monitoring and compliance.

40.     Despite the above provisions, social safeguards compliance turned problematic. Initially,
bidding documents (BDs) and bid evaluation reports (BERs) under the drainage sub-component
were prepared and submitted to the Bank without corresponding RAPs despite multiple guidance
on OP4.12 provided by the Bank. Drainage works worth USD28 million could not be cleared due
to lack of compliance and resulted in expiration of bid validity. Eventually, RAPs were prepared
for drainage works (drainage systems 2 and 5) as well as for the waste component (Olushosun
dumpsite). However, these RAPs were not implemented after the exclusion of the drainage and
waste sub-components from LMDGP. More generally, the dialogue on safeguards with Lagos
State evolved substantially from the time of preparation. There were material differences about
the principles of the RPF. The State was uninterested to apply these principles on a large scale
and in a slum setting. Even though compliance with OP 4.12 was achieved under parallel Bank
projects (within the transport portfolio for instance), material differences remained within the
LMDGP and related to the notion of informality among poor and low-income squatters, many of
which migrants. While technical solutions could have been found to substantially limit the
number of potential Project Affected Persons (PAPs) under the drainage component12, it appears



12
   The Bank team has assumed that silt and waste removed from the drainage channels could be transported by barges
in the monsoon season or from access points at every 100 meters or so in the dry season. Such solutions would have
required minimum resettlement. The ROW was 15 meters on both sides of the drains which would have triggered


                                                       11
that the State was uninterested to explore them. This could have been a function of the increase in
own resources allowing the State to finance drainage works itself or fundamental policy
difference about OP 4.12 in a slum setting.

41.      Following restructuring, safeguard policies applied to the slum-upgrade sub-component.
Compliance remained problematic. The Bank initiated a social safeguards audit, with the
following findings: (i) lack of clarity among project stakeholders on the rationale, objectives and
processes of safeguard policies 13 ; (ii) weak documentation of implementation processes;
community and asset mapping and socio-economic censuses were missing or not readily
available; consultations were not properly conducted; (iii) decisions affecting community
livelihoods were taken on an informal and ad hoc basis without consultation, restoration or
compensation; and (iv) works have proceeded and triggered demolition in several cases without
prior RAPs. Due to lack of compliance, in June 2012, the Bank suspended all activities related to
new sub-projects until an action plan to redress the situation was put in place. Corrective
measures included five (5) retroactive RAPs, including the one for the Badia area, and six (6)
retroactive Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMP). The total number of PAPs was
2605 tenants and 319 landlords. By the end of LMDGP, all retroactive RAPs were implemented
successfully.

42.      Demolitions in Badia (See Box: Request for Inspection Panel, Demolitions in Badia).
Two major demolitions took place in the Badia area of Lagos. The first one occurred in 2012 in
connection with the construction of a canal and a road where PAPs were in the Right of Way
(ROW). A retro RAP was prepared and implemented (one of the 5 RAPs mentioned in the
previous paragraph). A second demolition occurred in 2013, in a section of Badia East. This
demolition was not related to LMDGP-financed activities. Nevertheless, the Bank engaged in a
dialogue with the State requesting that the RPF is applied in the case of Badia East. Assistance
was provided and mitigation measures were initiated, which included consultations, valuation of
assets, preparation of a RAP. At the time of the ICR, the Government, the community and the
NGOs representing it seemed to have reached an amicable agreement.



                           Box 1: Request for Inspection Panel 14, Demolitions in Badia

Summary of the Request
A request for inspection of the Nigeria – Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance Project was placed by the
Social and Economic Rights Action Centre (SERAC), the NGO acting on behalf of affected people of the Badia area,
on September 30, 2013. The Requesters stated that the house demolitions carried out by the Lagos Government on
February 23, 2013, in East Badia constituted a violation of the Bank social safeguards polices and that the Bank should
ensure that the affected people be appropriately compensated.

        Upon receiving the complaint on September 30, 2013, the Inspection Panel had decided to postpone the



massive resettlement. Even a 5 meter access road along only one side of the drains would have been an easier solution
in terms of resettlement compared to access roads on both sides of the drains, which is what Lagos State asked for.

13
  Awareness among PAPs on their rights seemed to be low; contractors seemed unclear about their responsibilities; ad
hoc compensations including by contractors seemed to have taken place.

14
   The Inspection Panel is an independent complaints mechanism for people and communities who believe that they
have been, or are likely to be, adversely affected by a World Bank-funded project




                                                         12
 registration of the Request in order to provide an opportunity for the all parties (Requesters, Bank staff and Lagos
 Government) to work together to redress the livelihoods affected by these demolitions. The Panel had taken this
 decision in line with its new "Pilot approach” to support early solutions in the Inspection Panel process.

         The February 23, 2013 Demolitions: While these demolitions were not undertaken as part of project
 implementation, the affected people were clearly identified as beneficiaries of the LMDG project. In early March
 2013, the Bank advised the Government of Lagos State to adopt and apply the provisions of the project Resettlement
 Policy Framework. After contacting the Government of Lagos and the NGO acting on behalf of the affected people
 (Social and Economic Rights Action Centre SERAC), the Bank agreed with the Lagos Government on the urgent need
 to prepare a detailed and time-bound action plan to address the impacts on livelihoods of the project affected people.
 In September 2013, the Government and representatives of the community agreed on the list of affected people and
 the compensation levels. In October 2013, a meeting was held with the Lagos Government to review the RAP
 implementation plan including: (i) review of compensation levels, (ii) completion of list of beneficiaries, (iii) RAP
 support to the livelihoods of the affected people; (iv) the RAP complaints handling mechanism and; (v) the timetable
 for implementation. The Lagos Government presented its revised plan in late November 2013 which was approved by
 the community representatives on December 30, 2013.


 Update – March 28, 2014
         The Government has recognized and acknowledged its continued obligation to implement the mitigation
 measures spelled out under the Bank’s safeguard instruments notwithstanding the closure of the project.
         Project funds have been set aside for compensations under this RAP, which takes into account the
 Government’s estimate and includes a margin for any additional claims that may surface during the RAP
 implementation.
         The Lagos Government started the distribution of the compensation payments in mid-February 2014 and will
 continue until the end of May 2014. In addition, the government has committed to providing livelihood restoration
 support programmes such as training for beneficiaries upon completion of compensation payments
         The Bank is providing a close supervision of the implementation of the RAP by: a) regular visits to Lagos by
 project team and management, and b) mobilizing an experienced local consultant paid by the Bank to provide
 assistance to the Lagos Government in ensuring close adherence to Bank resettlement policies.



43.      Procurement. The procurement risk at project appraisal was rated high before mitigation
measures, and moderate following agreed mitigation. Identified mitigation measures included,
among others: (i) establishing the PCU under the office of the Executive Governor to facilitate a
direct reporting line, (ii) establishing a PSC to provide civil society and private sector oversight to
the project, (iii) recruiting the Procurement officer and the Project Director competitively, and
(iv) training staff on Bank procurement procedures. Despite these measures, procurement
remained an area of concern throughout the life of the project and was rated MU between 2008-
2009, and again, between 2012-2013. By project end, post procurement reviews elevated
procurement risk from moderate to substantial. In addition to substantial delays in evaluating
proposals and bids, issues during implementation included: (i) changes to the procurement plan
excluding activities agreed earlier with the Bank and including new ones; (ii) amendments to
terms of references (ToRs) after they have been cleared by the Bank that affected issues such as
social safeguards, timing of deliverables and total costs; (iii) multiplicity of contracts slightly
under the prior review threshold thus limiting competition without a clear benefit for the project;
(v) lack of effective communication between the procurement team and the rest of the PCU; (v)
inadequate procurement documents filing; (vi) lack of sufficient and adequately trained
procurement staff, and high staff turnover, (vii) contracts not grouped properly leading to a
multiplicity of small contracts that not only added time to the already delayed processes, but also
increased transaction costs and heightened the risk of errors made during the evaluation. Overall,
the procurement performance was problematic, and contributed to delays that affected project
implementation.

44.     Financial Management. The FM risk at project appraisal was rated high before
mitigation and moderate following agreed mitigation measures. Identified inherent risks were


                                                         13
offset at design by adoption of robust FM arrangements, including the establishment of a Project
Financial Management Unit (PFMU) in the office of the Account-General’s Office, adoption of
sound financial procedures, and inclusion of qualified staff trained in Bank procedures. During
project implementation, the PFMU deployed a full team to work in the office of the PCU to
ensure that both offices would work as a single team. Although performance was uneven over the
life of the project, FM practices were largely acceptable and met the requirements of the Bank.
The project’s internal controls were considered adequate. Annual project audits contained
unqualified audit opinion on the project financial statements throughout the project’s life.
Financial management reports were prepared and submitted generally on time. On a few
occasions in 2012 the FM performance was downgraded due to instances of outstanding un-
retired advances, inadequate documentation for incurred expenditures, failure to register all
awarded contracts in the FM reports, inconsistencies on the contract identification numbers in
different reports prepared by the PCU, and evidence of ineligible expenses related to top-up, fuel
and telephone allowances. The PCU team was generally open to suggestions and, in most cases,
followed the recommendations given by the Bank to improve monitoring of financial resources.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.      A number of civil works contracts awarded under LMDGP were not completed by
project closure. The estimated value of such contracts is in the magnitude of USD23 million. The
Lagos State Government has demonstrated commitment to complete the outstanding work; to this
end the state has allocated NGN3.2 billion (USD20.0 million equivalent) in its 2014 budget.
Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) have been signed with respective line agencies for
their utilization, including staffing and supplies.

46.     LMDGP gave support to the DPL agenda in PFM, particularly the rollout of the Oracle
system, and since then, good progress in implementing a medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF) that includes a top-down resource envelope (medium-term fiscal strategy or MTFS) and
bottom-up sector spending plans (medium-term sector strategy or MTSS) has been achieved.

47.     The policy dialogue initiated by LMDGP in areas related to financial management and
budgeting, served as a base to the development of two DPL that supported policy measures for
achieving fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium-term. Additionally, the Bank will
continue supporting the dialogue with LASG on metropolitan development and urbanization
challenges.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

48.      Even though the PDO was not formally revised at restructuring, the outcome rating is a
weighted composite of ratings before and after restructuring. This was done in view of the
significant changes in the PDO indicators at restructuring.

49.     Relevance of objective before and after restructuring. The relevance of objective
before and after the restructuring is assessed as High. The PDO was relevant to conditions in
Nigeria at the time of appraisal and remains consistent with current development priorities. At
appraisal, the PDO was aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that supported
Nigeria’s National Economic, Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS). At the time of



                                               14
the ICR, the PDO is consistent with current Government priorities as evidenced by: (i) the Lagos
State Development Plan (2012-2025) and its Pillars on infrastructure, social development and
security, and sustainable environment; (ii) the Nigeria Vision 2020, which primary objectives are
to create an enabling environment for green and inclusive economic growth; diversify the
Nigerian economy; create employment opportunities; and reduce poverty; and (iii) Nigeria’s
Transformation Agenda (2011-2015) which focuses on governance, sustainable and inclusive
growth. The PDO supported the CPS for the period FY2010-FY2013 and especially it’s Pillar I
on sustainable and inclusive non-oil growth and Pillar II on governance. The PDO is also aligned
with the proposed CPS for the period FY2014-FY2017 and its Pillar 2 on inclusion, as well as the
cross cutting Pillar on governance and public sector management.

50.      Relevance of design and implementation before restructuring. Planned project
activities supported the achievement of the PDO – to increase sustainable access to basic urban
services through investments in critical infrastructure. Drainage, waste and social facilities under
the slum-upgrade sub-component were critical infrastructure directly related to livelihoods and
productivity. Access to basic urban services was severely impacted by flooding, waste
accumulation, lack of or deplorable conditions of schools, clinics, water points, etc. Sustainability
was to be achieved through a combination of (i) technical solutions (hydraulic modelling for
drainage, communal depots and transfer stations for solid waste), (ii) predictability and
transparency in maintenance financing (addressed through the governance component), and (iii)
citizen’s involvement (through communication and dialogue, improved outreach and support for
the project). Project activities were aligned with the results indicators which adequately captured
progress. Taken individually, the design of components was solid and based on extensive analysis
and consultations with intense community engagement. However, as discussed in Section 2.1,
project activities were ambitious as they spanned over several sectors with diverse challenges and
multiple executing agencies. Implementation arrangements were intended to guard against
unwanted capture (See Section 2.1: Assessment of project design) but proved ineffective during
implementation. The relevance of design and implementation before restructuring is therefore
assessed as Modest.

51.      Relevance of design and implementation following restructuring. At restructuring,
although activities were scaled down significantly and an important part of project’s funds were
reallocated15, the PDO was not changed. The disconnect between the PDO and project activities
after restructuring should have been addressed by either scaling down the PDO, or by modifying
project activities so that they support the achievement of the objective. Issues related to
implementation arrangements were not addressed although implementation was clearly of
concern. The relevance of design and implementation following restructuring therefore remains
Modest.

52.     Based on above, the relevancy of Objectives, Design and Implementation before as
well as after restructuring is assessed as Substantial.

  Under Component A: Drainage works were reduced from USD61 million to USD11 million; Waste Management
activities were reduced from USD 63 million to USD 32 million; and Urban Upgrading activities were reduced from
USD40 million to USD138 million.




                                                     15
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

53.      Achievement of objectives before restructuring. Before the drainage and solid waste
management subcomponents were scaled down, achievements related to these activities were
modest. Major drainage works within drainage systems 2 and 5, which would have brought relief
to flooding, were not undertaken. Flooding control measures were introduced through smaller
scale works on two canals (Ogba Drainage, 1.4 km, and Alafia Drainage, 1.1 km) and the
rehabilitation of roadside drains. The design of a comprehensive program based on hydraulic
modelling for rehabilitation, construction and routine maintenance to provide a long term
technical solution to flooding was not done. Regarding the waste management subcomponent,
only two communal waste depots were built and some existing dumpsites were cleared. An
intended design, build, operate (DBO) contract for Olushosun and two transfer stations was not
awarded. The policy dialogue in the waste sector stalled due to significant divergence between
Lagos State and the Bank related to sector development and implementation methods.
Considering that both scaled down subcomponents did not achieve intended results, achievement
of objectives before restructuring is assessed as Negligible.

54.     Achievement of objectives after restructuring. Access to basic urban services
improved as a result of achievements under Component A (Slum Upgrade). The investments
brought tangible benefits to communities and enhanced the credibility of the project in view of
other (cancelled) components. Constructed boreholes provided access to improved water source
and were accepted very well by communities. Health facilities and rehabilitated roads were
assessed to have brought significant improvement in living conditions. Some of the markets and
the Citizen Mediation Centers constructed under the project were extremely successful among
residents. Street lighting improved safety. Specific achievements included:
     A population of 1.55 million (48% women) benefited from the project. The target for this
        PDO indicator was 1.6 million.
     90 boreholes were built with potential to serve a population of 112.500 (at project closing
        15 facilities were out of working order. Functioning facilities were supplying 95.000
        people with improved water source). The target population for this PDO indicator was
        112.500.
     7 primary health centers (PHC) were constructed (2 more were under construction). The
        target for this PDO indicator was 10 PHCs.
     8.7 km of roads were constructed or rehabilitated under the project (31 km were under
        construction at project closing). The target for this PDO indicator was 55 km.
     280 classrooms were built under the project (70 additional classrooms were under
        construction at project closing). The target for this PDO indicator was 450 classrooms.
     3 markets were built, two of which equipped with fish smoking facilities.
     5 km of street lighting and 14 transformers were installed.

55.     Achievements under Component B (Public Governance and Capacity Building)
contributed towards the sustainability objective of the PDO. Achievements related to the process
of budget preparation, expenditure management reform, and expenditure tracking. The following
outcomes were accomplished, achieving all results indicators:
     LASG and the State House of Assembly (SHoA) enacted the Public Finance
        Management Law (intermediate indicator).
     The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) approach was adopted by Ministry
        of Economic Planning & Budget (MEPB) for the drawing up of the State’s annual
        budgets from year 2009 to date. In addition, mechanisms were developed to support




                                               16
          projections of 3 year perspectives for aggregate and revenue expenditures (intermediate
          indicator).
         Oracle based Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) was implemented by the
          Government although its deployment and utilization are partially completed (intermediate
          indicator).
         A State-wide Household Survey with disaggregation of data on slum areas was carried
          out to provide a baseline for State Programs and activities designed to improve living
          conditions.
         Leadership training was conducted for members of the Lagos State House of Assembly
          and the Public Accounts Committee. LMDGP provided financial support in capacity
          development of state officials, such as Permanent Secretaries, Directors and senior
          officers in areas of public sector management, legal trainings, etc.

56.     Achievements under Component C (Urban Policy Dialogue, Communication,
Coordination and Support to Citizen Mediation Centers and Office of Public Defender) were
intended to contribute towards the sustainability objective of the PDO. While some workshops
and training sessions were carried out, other activities envisioned under this component did not
deliver all intended outcomes. The communication campaign and the policy dialogue on variety
of development issues had partial success; the systematic monitoring of the project was weak as
discussed before, and only 8 out of 30 Citizen’s Mediation Centers (CMC) were built. However,
these mediation centers are completely operational and have brought a new and pragmatic way to
address legal issues in Nigeria (See Box 2: Selected Impacts under LMDGP)

57.     Since the project was able to deliver results related to the public governance component
and the slum upgrading subcomponent that improved livability on some slums (See Box: Selected
Impacts under LMDGP), achievement of objectives after restructuring is assessed as Modest.


                                            Box 2: Selected Impacts under LMDGP
                    (Extracted from the document Lagos is Working, Project Coordination Unit, LMDGP, 2013)

          Water Facilities:
Before the implementation of the project, residents of Agege, like most slums intervened by the project, had to struggle
in their search for water. Access to potable water was considered a luxury and the community relied on local water
vendors who not only charged high fees but whose source of water supply was questionable. Through the construction
of water facilities, water-borne diseases outbreaks were reduced, travel time for fetching water was reduced, and while
in the past the community used to pay 50 Naira for 25 liters of water, residents now pay around 5 Naira per 25 liters.
The money is pooled together and managed by water and sanitation committees supported by the project.

         Flooding Control:
Due to the construction of roads, drains and canals, some communities in Agege, Amukoko, Badia, Bariga, Itire, Ilaje,
Iwaya, and Makoko, no longer experience flooding, and have improved community health and sanitation conditions.
Beyond the provision of infrastructure, the project also supported the strengthening of community development
associations to carry out monthly voluntary risk reduction measures such as community led cleaning and de-silting of
drains and canals. This has helped to build community ownership of infrastructure for sustainability.

        Schools:
Schools built under the LMDGP have improved access to education for children in some of the poorest parts of Lagos
and helped enhance faith in public education institutions. In many instances, parents have withdrawn their children
from private schools and put them in schools supported by the project considering that these provide a free, well-
resourced and offer favorable learning environment. Gbagada Comprehensive Junior High School is one of the schools
supported by the project and since the completion of the school there has been a steady increment in school enrollment
and absenteeism has reduced.




                                                          17
          Markets:
Although Asejere market had been in existence for several years, many people found it difficult to visit it due to the
fact that the traders used to converge on a dirty and unhealthy site. It was difficult and expensive to build any structure
in this zone due to the swampy nature of the area. Through the project, the site was cleared and a new market with a
state of the art cold room and fish smoking equipment was built. Since then, the patronage of the market has increased
by more than three folds - from an estimated 250,000 to over 750,000 people visiting daily to trade in and purchase sea
foods and other items in a healthy and secure environment.

         Health Centers:
LMDGP constructed and fully equipped a number of PHCs that offer quality healthcare, especially for women and
children. The new health centers are spacious and stocked with family planning, immunization, and anti-malaria
materials, child welfare drugs and other essential drugs.

         Citizen Mediation Centers:
These dispute resolution facilities have made available to the community a non-adversarial forum for the mediation and
settlement of disputes between parties who voluntarily agree to the mediation of their disputes by experienced
mediators. The centers have supported equitable justice by providing a rancor-free, inexpensive dispute resolution
option. Services offered by the CMC include landlord/tenant, employer/employee, employee compensation, family and
marital cases. On average, each CMC registers about 50 cases daily.



3.3 Efficiency

58.      The cost-benefit analysis evaluates the economic efficacy of the project by estimating the
present value of costs and projected benefits and by calculating the internal rate of return of the
projects. While the costs of the project investments are known, the future benefits are estimated
based on the project, outside data and reasonable assumptions about the likely impact of the
investments. This analysis evaluates the economic impact and efficacy of a subset of projects
under LMDGP. Specifically, the analysis evaluates economic impact of a sample of infrastructure
investments under Component A, including construction of new water supply facilities
(boreholes), drainage channels, and primary health centers. Some of the benefits that are likely to
result from the project implementation, and therefore are estimated and included in the project
benefits projections, are: avoided health expenditures due to decrease in illness and income
gained as a result of decrease in illness that resulted from improved water infrastructure and
upgraded public health facilities; estimated value of time savings resulting from improved
convenience of access to drinking water; reduced burden of flood cleanups; and other potential
benefits described in the annex. Many project investments implemented under Component A,
such as school construction, markets, roads, illegal dump site related projects, and construction of
communal waste depots, are excluded from the economic analysis. Even though many of these
projects have tangible and measurable economic benefits, such as public health improvements
and improved commerce and transportation, unavailability of specific and measurable project
outcome data and the difficulty of estimating monetary value of these benefits precludes their
inclusion in the cost benefit analysis. Economic benefits of activities under components B (Public
Governance and Capacity Building) and C (Urban Policy and Project Coordination) are less
tangible, long-term and diverse. It is therefore impossible to measure, within the scope of this
analysis, the economic value of the benefits of these components with any accuracy or reliability.

59.      The analysis, based on rather conservative assumptions discussed in Annex 3, concludes
that the economic internal rate of return of the project is at least 12.75% for water infrastructure
improvements (boreholes), 10.36% for drainage channel improvements, and 12.73% for primary
health center projects. At 10% assumed opportunity cost of capital, and with only limited set of
all potential benefits included in the analysis, all three categories of projects have positive net
present values of costs and benefits. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that investments in
all these three categories of projects are likely economically efficient and justified. Considering


                                                            18
that the economic assessment carried out includes only a sample of categories and sub-projects,
and because no assumption can be made that the EIRR of the sectors not analyzed in this analysis
would also exceed the 10% rate, the efficiency of the project is assessed as Modest.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

60.    The following table summarizes the overall outcome ratings based on the Relevance,
Achievements and Efficiency, before and after restructuring.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

62.     Beneficiary Survey. A beneficiary survey was carried out by the Client. The Bank was
not consulted on survey methodology or sample size. 187 slum residents were interviewed. The
ICR team is unclear whether the response was assessed against a control group. Beneficiaries
were asked to comment on their experience with the project and evaluate its impact. The results,
as reported by the Client, included: 69% of respondents had a positive experience, 12% had a
negative experience, 19% were neutral about the project. The impact of the project was evaluated



                                              19
as follows: 50% of respondents rated it as high, 25% as average, 15% as a failure and 10% did
not express an opinion.

63.     Stakeholder Workshop. The Client carried out a beneficiary workshop that included
State and Local Government representatives, members of the Local Council Development
Authority, Community members, Community Development Officers, representatives from
LASURA, LAWMA, LASURB (Lagos State Urban Renewal Board), Primary Health Care
Board, Lagos State Environmental Protection Board, and the Civil Society. The feedback from
the workshop, as outlined in the Client’s ICR, empathizes the need for continuous community
consultations and dialogue with stakeholders throughout implementation. Consultations are
viewed to increase ownership of and interest in the project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

64.     The risks to maintaining the development outcome is High and reflects (i) the high risk to
sustain achievements under Component A, and (ii) the moderate risk to sustain achievements
under Component B. The risk under Component A relates to the prospect to preserve assets
created under the project in good working order and ensuring adequate utilization. Given issues
encountered in the latter stages of the project (lack of timely hand-over agreements with local
governments, lack of agreements on asset maintenance, assets being vandalized, lack of sufficient
community engagement for asset utilization and upkeep), the risk is assessed as high. The risk
under Component B is lower on account of the intense policy dialogue between Lagos State and
the Bank in the areas of financial management and public sector reform that has led to a
Development Policy Loan (DPL) financing to the State. Achievements under Component B are
well institutionalized with a moderate risk to outcome.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

65.      The project was consistent with Nigeria’s NEEDS and the CPS at appraisal. The PDO
reflected local priorities and was commensurate to Lagos’ readiness for reforms at the time of
appraisal. Project activities and results indicators were aligned. Preparation activities included
formal and informal diagnostics, policy dialogue and shared knowledge from forums with diverse
stakeholder participation. Background analyses were extensive, technical designs were sound,
and the level of community outreach and participation was exemplary. The rapport with the
Governor of the day was excellent. Limited available resources under IDA were allocated
efficiently to maximize impact. The TTL was profoundly engaged, fully committed, and had a
deep understanding of Lagos’ development and governance issues. The preparation team was
strong with significant experience from around the continent. Mitigation measures were
consistent with the Bank’s fiduciary role. Despite being an ambitious project with implementation
arrangements that became inadequate once the enabling environment changed, the Bank’s
performance is rated moderately satisfactory on account of the quality of the background analysis,
the intensity and inclusiveness of consultations with stakeholders, the alignment between PDO,
activities and indicators, and the Bank’s fiduciary role. The Bank performance in the
identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project is therefore rated Moderately
Satisfactory.




                                               20
(b) Quality of Supervision

66.      Supervision was uneven during the implementation of the project. During the first phase
(2007-2009), supervision was intense; it proactively identified emerging issues in terms of
fiduciary compliance, safeguards compliance, quality of infrastructure works, lack of
coordination among CEAs, etc. In view of identified issues, technical and financial audits were
recommended by the outgoing TTL. Based on the available documentation to the ICR team, such
audits did not take place. During the second phase (2009-2011), Bank supervision seems to have
been less effective in resolving obstacles to implementation. Only one AM from this period was
located by the ICR team, though regularly filed ISRs point at continuous supervision The
restructuring took place in mid-2011, around 3 years after it was first contemplated by the Bank.
To a large extent this delay was caused by changes of personnel within the PIU, a period without
a PIU Director, and ongoing discussions regarding safeguards policies applicable under the
project. During restructuring, the Bank did not identify that the PDO could not be achieved
following the cancellation of the flooding and the waste sub-components. Since these components
were dropped because of divergent views on safeguards, it was assumed that the slum upgrade
component would not trigger the RPF and therefore safeguards specialists were not involved in
supervision between March 2010 and December 2011. When safeguards specialists joined Bank
supervision missions around December 2011, lack of safeguards compliance was observed and
flagged, along with other issues such as infrastructure works in non-working order, material
deterioration in community involvement, lack of asset ownership agreements, etc. By project end,
corrective measures were made on all accounts. Supervision under the third phase (late 2011-
2013) was intense, involved multi-disciplinary teams, sought guidance and involvement of Bank
Management. Supervision under the first and third phases was intense, proactive, identified
threats to achieving the PDO, and ensured safeguards and fiduciary compliance. However, since,
at restructuring, the Bank did not identify that the PDO is unlikely to be achieved, and ensured
the Client is compliant with safeguards policies only on a retroactive basis, and lack of attention
to M&E, Bank’s performance during implementation is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

67.   Given the overall outcome rating for the project, the overall Bank performance is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government performance

Initially, the Government of Lagos State was actively engaged and fully committed to prepare
and deliver LGDMP. It ensured high-level participation at the PSC (at Commissioner level),
facilitated the coordination effort among the CEAs, held consultations with communities, and led
a dynamic policy dialogue around the objectives of LGDMP. Once the Government’s sustained
attention to the project diminished (as discussed in earlier sections above), the. PSC became
represented by lower-level officials without authority to take or follow through decisions. The
PCU was not actively supported to perform its functions neither guided in terms of policy
decisions. Policy discussions were indeed relegated and lost their proactive nature. Despite the
explicit and reiterated commitment to apply the principles of the RFP, the Government failed to
comply with these policies and the project went through a lengthy restructuring that scaled down
important components and slowed implementation. The Director for the PCU was changed
several times and the position was vacant for extended periods affecting the performance of the
PCU. Since the performance of the State Government was not consistent throughout the life of


                                                21
the project and as such did not consistently facilitate an environment towards the achievement of
the PDO, performance is assessed as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency

68.       Overall, the PCU’s leadership was not strong enough and it experienced multiple
implementation challenges. Initially, the PCU was proactive and managed to prepare a number of
studies and go through several large procurements. Once the PIU lost the active support and
leadership of the PSC, it started to experience difficulties, including: : (i) lack of staff continuity
and lengthy periods of vacant positions; (ii) limited numbers of qualified staff, fragmentation,
lack of synergy and communication silos between different parts of the PCU, (iii) reporting on
physical progress of the project, expenditures, and the achievement of results were often
misaligned, (iv) lack of leadership and effective coordination with other agencies including
timely MOUs and hand-over of assets to line-agencies to improve the sustainability of new
facilities, (v) procurement and safeguards performance was often problematic. Despite these
difficulties, the PCU was effective -especially during the last phase of the project- and managed
to deliver a number of results under the slum upgrade component; however these efforts were not
enough to recuperate the time spent during less productive periods. In addition, the PCU led the
effort to engage communities and develop retroactive RAPs and ensured that these RAPs were
implemented and monitored. It also led the efforts under Component B with tangible results
which also led to follow-up engagement under two DPLs. Based on the impact of the outcomes
delivered by the project through its PCU and taking into consideration the uneasy environment
within which it operated, performance of the implementing agency is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

69.     The ICR rates the overall borrower performance as Moderately Unsatisfactory, taking
into account that both Government and the PCU failed to take proactive and timely measures
needed to achieve development outcomes.


6. Lessons Learned

Lesson 1: Bank teams should be cognizant of the prevailing political economy and calibrate
the complexity of projects accordingly. Following years of preparation, the Bank had developed
understanding for the complexity of the political economy of Lagos. Despite that, the Bank
decided to go ahead with an overly ambitious project without sufficiently mitigating identified
risks. LMDGP had a daring agenda touching on nearly every state function. Designed to address
the single most pressing infrastructure issue, flooding was to be tackled through technical
solutions, fiscal means and social engagement. This ICR makes the following recommendations
related to Bank’s engagement in complex environments: i) urban upgrading projects are by
definition multi-sectoral and complex, however, a step-wise approach could have been followed
in the case of LMDGP starting with one or two slums on a pilot basis. Such approach provides
development space to advance the policy dialogue on metropolitan urban development. It also
provides time to converge the understanding and approaches how to tackle difficult
implementation issues, including social safeguards and possible resettlement; and ii) continuous
engagement is necessary to ensure continuous support from government and stakeholders. In the
case of LMDGP, traction for the project was lost once the Government ceased to rely on the
project as a central vehicle for achieving its goals related to slum upgrading. The restructuring
offered an opportunity to re-engage the Government and preserve the initial intent of the project.


                                                  22
This opportunity was not utilized and the restructuring simply excluded activities that were
contentious. Initiated as a bold effort to offer a sustained, comprehensive solution to Lagos, by
closure, LMDGP turned into a limited-scale, limited-impact slum upgrading intervention with
questionable sustainability. Finally, this ICR recommends that a stand-alone case study is carried
out to extract lessons learned from LMDGP in a more systematic manner, provide in-depth
analysis of the modalities of urban sector engagements in a mega-city like Lagos, and make
recommendations towards the structure and manner of engagement in such settings.

Lesson 2: Projects well vested into existing institutions are less vulnerable to the presence of
political capital and might be better suited for complex environments like that of Lagos. The
LMDGP’s PCU was not anchored in any agency. LASURA could have hosted the
implementation of the slum upgrade initiatives. Instead, the implementation unit was placed
outside existing institutions. When the political support through the Governor’s office weakened,
the PCU and the PSC lost their political backing and with it – their significance. When
implementation units are placed within the beneficiary agency, this agency is likely to own and
pursue project objectives more vigorously. A related lesson concerns the structure of PIUs. Their
internal organization, staffing, reporting lines, decision authority, and performance incentives
should be carefully crafted and closely monitored at all times during implementation. Seconding
sector agency staff to PIUs may be better than assigning focal points within sector agencies.
Discrepancy in compensation (pay, benefits, entitlements) between seconded staff and consultants
has the tendency to fuel discontent and resentment. Performance-based payment with clear and
objective performance indicators should be considered as a viable alternative. Large PIUs need to
establish functional flows and clear reporting lines. Level of staffing should be realistic and
proportionate to the intensity of project activities.

Lesson 3: Simultaneous deployment of various lending instruments proved to be effective in
achieving desired outcomes. Bank support to PFM reforms through the combination of
Investment Lending and Development Policy Operations seems to have led to positive results as
demonstrated by achievements made under Component B. This Component accomplished key
PFM reforms often seen as difficult tasks (e.g., Public Finance Management Law enactment,
adoption of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, Oracle based Integrated Financial
Management System ). This positive result could have been related to the fact that a DPL
operation was prepared in parallel, and its activities were aligned to the activities included under
Component B. In addition to financing instruments, the sustained technical assistance, on-the-
ground policy dialogue and enhanced support during project implementation may have been
beneficial to achieve the expected project results.

Lesson 4: Lack of transfer of knowledge, right skill mix and appropriate background in
TTLs and sector specialists affects the relationship with the Client and poses a risk to
implementation. Hand-overs between Bank staff should be systematical, with active
participation and guidance by management. The LMDGP’s appraisal team spent years to build
trust, establish constituencies and comprehend the fabric and structure of the Lagos society. This
awareness was reduced when teams changed. A structured approach allowing sufficient overlap
between teams, formal hand-over processes, and active involvement of management in the
interim is needed. Secondly, slum upgrade projects are multi-sectoral and require an integrative
skill mix. TTLs are expected to lead a multi-dimensional dialogue with the Client and navigate
through a multiplicity of issues.

Lesson 5: When the Bank’s and the client’s commitment to safeguards policies and their
practical implementation diverges significantly, both the Bank and the client should be
upfront and eliminate instances where investments would trigger such policies. Safeguard


                                                23
compliance remains an uphill task for governments due to its fiscal burden, the potentially uneven
treatment of PAPs and people resettled under government policies, future expectations of
squatters, and the large-scale and growing informality in African cities. Intense policy discussions
during appraisal revealing governments’ inherent intent with regards to informal settlements may
lessen safeguards compliance during implementation. Such dialogue should place the emphasis
on the loss of assets and monetary value of a vulnerable segment of the population rather than on
reward of informality which is how governments see it. A sample RAP before Board approval
could demonstrate the required process and should be considered where possible in addition to a
RPF. Where possible, bidding documents for civil works may specify the manner in which
construction should be done so that large resettlement is prevented (i.e. transporting silt along one
side of a channel instead of using access roads on both sides of a drainage channel). This should
be vetted against presumed increase in bid price.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This economic analysis evaluates the economic impact of a subset of improvements in urban
upgrading and drainage under Component A (Infrastructure) of LMDP. The projects included in
the analysis are construction of new water supply facilities (boreholes), construction of drainage
channels, and construction and rehabilitation of primary health centers.
The cost-benefit analysis estimates the economic effectiveness of the project by calculating the
present value of cost and benefit streams and by determining the internal rate of return of the
project. The primary analytical challenge of this type of cost-benefit evaluation is to estimate the
expected benefits that will likely occur in the future as a result of project implementation. The
expected benefits of the project include the amount of economic costs that will likely be avoided
as a result of the project implementation.

It is important to emphasize that besides economic benefits considered in this analysis, there are
many other potential benefits that are not factored in the cost benefit calculation described here.
For instance, improved water supply can encourage additional investments and economic growth;
improved drainage may result in reduced maintenance costs for road networks, reduce travel time
and number of road accidents; all of the project investments can lead to improved economic
environment, higher economic growth rates, and higher labor productivity; primary health clinic
investments may lead to improvements in illness prevention, faster diagnosis and treatment,
reduced malnutrition, improved immunization rates and prenatal care, reduced child and maternal
mortality rates, reduced healthcare related transportation costs, time savings for healthcare
providers, etc. All of these benefits have very real economic value.

The real benefits accruing to the population may also not be solely financial or economic in
nature. For instance, improved water supply provides comfort and improves general welfare of
the population. Unfortunately, these benefits cannot always be included in the cost-benefit
analyses. This is either because estimating such benefits is impossible because of the
unavailability of the data or because it is impossible to quantify the value of these benefits.
Therefore, the estimated benefits of the project described in this analysis can be considered
conservative, and we can reasonably assume that the value of actual benefits, and consequently
the internal rate of return of these projects, is larger.

Many project investments implemented under Component A, such as school construction,
markets, roads, illegal dump site related projects, and construction of communal waste depots, are
excluded from the economic analysis. Even though many of these projects have tangible and
measurable economic benefits, such as public health improvements and improved commerce and
transportation, specific and measurable project outcome data needed to estimate monetary value
of these benefits is not available.

Economic benefits of activities under components B (Public Governance and Capacity Building)
and C (Urban Policy and Project Coordination) are less tangible and specific, with more long-
term and dispersed potential benefits. It is not possible to measure, within the scope of this
analysis, the economic value of the benefits of these components with any accuracy or reliability.

The cost benefit analysis assumes 15 year life for the water, drainage, and public health clinic
investments. This conforms to the original PAD estimate and also is conservative enough to avoid




                                                29
overestimating the total value of benefits. For example, the World Health Organization study16
suggests 20-year horizon for borehole investments, which is in line with the estimated useful lives
of other types of capital investments as well.

The ongoing annual O&M costs are calculated at 5% of initial investment costs, which is in line
with WHO recommendations and general guidelines for these types of projects.

The analysis uses a 3% inflator for calculating the value of future ongoing costs and projected
benefits. It should be noted that this rate is significantly lower than historical and projected
inflation rates for Nigeria. Applying higher rate to future cost and benefit flows would result in a
higher net benefits (because ongoing benefit streams are much larger than ongoing O&M cost
streams) and higher internal rate of return for the project. Applying a lower inflation rate likely
underestimates the potential future net benefits of these projects, but doing so results in more
conservative estimates and aims to avoids overestimating net benefits.


Water Infrastructure Projects (Boreholes)

A total of 73 boreholes were constructed under the project and are included in this section of the
cost-benefit evaluation. The total initial cost of these projects is $2.4 million, while the ongoing
O&M costs (at 5% of the total initial investments17) are $119 thousand in present value terms.
The project team estimates that 112,500 people benefit from these investments.

Water infrastructure improvement benefits estimations are based the World Health Organization’s
estimation of burden of environmental diseases, and estimated economic benefit per capita of
various water infrastructure interventions. The WHO study provides a range of monetary values
for different types of investments and geographic areas18. This analysis incorporates the lowest
estimated benefit figures for sub-Saharan Africa region.

Some of the benefits that are likely to result from the project implementation, and therefore are
estimated and included in the project benefits projections, are:

         (1) Health sector costs avoided due to avoided illness
         (2) Patient expenses avoided due to avoided illness
         (3) Value of loss-of life avoided as a result of improvements.
         (4) Value of time savings due to improved access to water (the study assumes that, on
         average, a household gaining access to improved water supply will save 30 minutes per
         day).
         (5) Value of productive days (and income) gained as a result of avoided illness

The initial investment cost per capita is about $21, which favorably compares to the WHO’s
estimated average initial investment per capita of $23 for borehole investments in the Africa
region (this is especially notable considering that the WHO estimates are based on a year 2000
data).
The total amount of water infrastructure related benefits estimated based on the WHO data is
$434 thousand per year for the target population of 112,500, or about $34.54 per capita. The
present value of all future benefits over the next 15 years is about $3.9 million, while the present
value of initial investment costs and future O&M costs is about $3.5 million. The result, at 10%
opportunity cost of capital rate, in the internal rate of return of 12.75% and the net present value
of about $422 thousand. The benefits to costs ratio of these project group is 1.12.

Drainage Channel Investments
The analysis of drainage channel investment projects includes projects in Agege and Amukoko,
with a combined investment cost of $4.8 million and combined population of 114,614. At 5% of
initial investment costs, ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures equal about $240
thousand in present value terms. The drainage channel constructed in Ogba was not included in
the analysis because no reliable estimate of affected population in this area was available. The
analysis assumes that about 60% of population in the target areas are affected by flooding19 ,
which, at five persons per household20, results in the number of households affected of almost 14
thousand.
The analysis estimates two categories of project benefits for these projects: the avoided flood
related repair expenditures and avoided annual income loss due to flooding. Assuming that the
average flood related repair expenditure equals Naira 8,50021 (USD 52), the total annual flood
related repair costs are about $715 thousand for 14 thousand affected households. At estimated
average daily household income of $5.44 (based on the PAD estimate of Naria 22,164 income per
month and 300 working days per year22), and assuming that only one productive day per year per
household are lost due to flooding (which is a very conservative assumption), the estimated
annual total benefit of avoided flood related income loss is about $75 thousand.
Combined, the total value of economic benefit estimated for drainage channel investments
(avoided the flood related repair costs and avoided income loss) equals about $790 thousand per
year (in present value terms) for the entire target population of 114,614. The present value of all
future benefits over the next 15 years is about $7.1 million, while the present value of initial
investment costs and future O&M costs is about $6.97 million. The result, at 10% opportunity
cost of capital rate, in the internal rate of return of 10.36% and the net present value of about
$107 thousand. The benefits to costs ratio of these projects is just over one.

Primary Health Centers
Primary health center projects included in the analysis are Agege, Badia and Amukoko, and
Iwaya, for the total initial investment costs of $1.18 million and combined area population of 394
thousand23. At 5% of initial investment costs, ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures
equal about $59 thousand in present value terms. The study assumes that only 25% of the target
area population will benefit from the PHCs, which, at 5 persons per household, results in the total
19.7 thousand households benefiting from these investments.

The only economic benefit included in the analysis of these projects is the estimated value of
avoided loss of productive days as a result of illness. The estimate assumes annual per capita
working days lost due to illness to be 4 days24. Assuming that PHC investments result in only one
less illness-related productive day loss per person (25% of the total), and average daily household
income of $5.44 (per PAD), the total value of avoided productive days equals about $214
thousand per year for the entire target population of 394,204 (this figure includes populations of
Agege, Badia and Amukoko, and Iwaya; the figures are based on the estimates provided in the
PAD analysis).
The present value of all future benefits over the next 15 years is about $1.9 million, while the
present value of initial investment costs and future O&M costs is about $1.7 million. The result,
at 10% opportunity cost of capital rate, in the internal rate of return of 12.73% and the net present
value of investments of about $290 thousand. The benefits to costs ratio of these project group is
1.12.

Conclusion
Even excluding many socioeconomic benefits of the project that are difficult to estimate in
monetary terms, the project’s internal rate of return exceeds the opportunity cost of capital of 10
percent. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that investments in all these three categories of
projects are likely economically efficient and justified.

KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

Management Structure
LMDGP is owned by the LASG. The implementation agency is LASG through the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) reporting directly to the Executive Governor of Lagos State. The PCU
serves as the secretariat for the LMDGP Project Steering Committee (PSC). Staffing at the PCU
is a mix of experienced employees seconded from the Lagos State Civil Service and some direct
recruits. Fund Management on the project was provided by the State Project Financial
Management Unit (PFMU) from the Office of the State Accountant General. It is responsible for
managing the financial affairs of all IDA-assisted and donor-assisted projects in the State.

Intervention Strategy
The project design was tailored to focus its intervention on a number of promising initiatives that
had the potential to create high positive impact on the beneficiaries. Component 1 was a demand
driven intervention, targeted at providing a long term technical solution to flooding in 9 selected
slums in Lagos and engender a city-wide upgrade program, which would eventually lead to urban
regeneration. Components 2 and 3 are targeted towards inhibiting change in public governance
and review of a lot of public reforms such as the MTEF, IFMIS, PFM law etc.

Implementation

Delays at Implementation
The project experienced substantial delays mid-way into its implementation. The delay was due
to the long- time taken by both parties (the World Bank and the LASG) to reach agreement on
safeguard issues during implementation, clarity of project activities and restructuring/
reallocation.

Implementation Protocol
The project was implemented with little deviation from the initial design in the PAD and PIM.
The LASG through the PCU is the implementing agency.
The State Project Steering Committee (PSC) is the overall decision making body of LMDGP. It
performs oversight functions of the project, meet to review the procurement plan and make
decisions as regards the project.

Implementation Experience
Overall project performance was acceptable despite the issues that affected implementation and
disbursement. The 2-year project inactive period created time constraint (hence the LASG’
request for extension) the result is that some KPIs were not met (even with the revision of the
scope). Some of the challenges that persisted throughout the project were:
a) High Staff turn-over was one of the major challenges that affected LMDGP. Key members of
project staff were frequently changed both at the PCU and the World Bank. Key officers in the
project such as Task-Team Leader (TTL) from the Bank, Project Director, Communication
Consultant, Procurement Consultant and M&E Consultant were changed more than twice.
b) Effective data collection is critical to ascertaining the achievement of project goals. Poor data
collection due to inability to use and/or ineffectiveness of the data collection tool designed to
capture service-level quantitative data resulted in M&E reports not been available from project
inception.
c) Adequacy of data management system for data storage and retrieval, and an improvement in the
level of data analysis for the PCU. Storage of data and ability of the PCU was problematic at the


                                                35
beginning of the project but improved significantly towards the end of the project with the
recruitment of an M&E specialist.
d) Effective information documentation and information sharing was expected to play a key role
in the project for coordination, collaboration, sharing of lessons learnt and best practices.
Different units in the PCU have unit-specific information but do not know much about other
units’ activities, except those that are closely related. There is no corporate knowledge network- a
one-stop repository where information can be accessed. Effort towards knowledge sharing was
not coordinated, which also contributed to lack of continuity with previously developed
initiatives.
e) Post Payment Audit: The PAD did not make provision for 100% Prepayment Audit, therefore,
there were issues with internal control.
f) Delay in Procurement: There were instances where procurement plan was not completely
implemented. Some activities and project that should have been implemented could not be
implemented despite “No Objection” from the Bank. In addition despite approval of the
Procurement Plan, implementation of the Plan was hampered by Bank’s decision not to award
new contracts.
g) Safeguard Issues: Compliance with Safeguard issues was one of a major challenge of the
project. In view of the Banks standards, all required documents were prepared but the project
lacked the capacity to implement as planned because of some prevailing condition beyond the
limits of the PCU.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
In retrospect, there was challenge with data management and storage which could have been
addressed during implementation. The poor data collection, organizing, storage, and reporting of
performance data of different project components led to unavailability of project data.
Furthermore, the Capacity and tools for M&E were not sufficient enough to deliver on the M&E
sub-component of the project.

There was no measure of the project’s impact on beneficiaries, despite the push from M&E unit
at the PCU to conduct a Project Intervention Evaluation. The Intervention Evaluation would have
given a true presentation of project intervention impact. M&E would have gotten the right
support if its role and function were understood from the onset of the project. There was no
evidence to show the existence of a proper M&E system at project inception. Knowledge/
capacity gap was noticed in the initial set-up of the unit.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental and Social Safeguard
LMDGP prepared two safeguard frameworks, namely the Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). These were prepared for the
project to provide guidance and identify project impact types at a generic level. At the time,
specific sub-projects or thematic project scope had not been defined. The ESMF recommended
amongst others that a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) or an Abbreviated Action Plan (ARAP) be
prepared when the project thematic scope or specific project sites had been identified.
Conflict of interest between LASG and the World Bank on safeguard issues was one of the
challenges encountered during implementation.
LASG signed on the project to implement safeguard instrument on the project and other projects
within Lagos state. The experience however was different during implementation as there were
issues with interpretation of involuntary resettlement. The World Bank and LASG perceived
involuntary resettlement of the displaced people differently.



                                                36
Financial Management
Throughout project implementation, there was a reliable Financial Management and Report
System. The PFMU promoted transparency and encouraged orderly and systematic
documentation of financial transactions.
Adherence to the Financial Management arrangements for the project was satisfactory

Procurement
The PAD rated knowledge and experience of the PCU and other CEAs with IDA’s procurement
procedures causing delay during implementation as “moderate”. Implementation experience was
that approval of Procurement Plans and “No Objection” from the Bank caused substantial delays
in Project implementation.
Procurement risk was mitigated by the involvement of a PSC to approve annual work and
procurement plans, and the use of a full-time procurement consultant on the project to provide
technical support on procurement activities. Other measures included provision of adequate
training on procurement to project staff and key staff at different CEAs. PCU was equipped with
“Client Connection” accessibility, to allow for streamlined procurement and disbursement
procedures. The internal coordination within the PCU was not strong, hence, the incidences of
poor documentation of some contracts awarded under the project.

Post- Completion Operation/ Next Phase
The LASG will continue to sustain the success of LMDGP through the activities of the CEAs and
also expand its frontiers by taking redress from the lessons learned on the project.

ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives
The project’s objective was strategically relevant, appropriate and fully consistent with the
objectives and approach of the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that supports
Nigeria’s NEEDS. The focus on making it demand driven and the top- bottom approach of
deciding on projects to be embarked upon in the slums was appropriate. The focus on
infrastructural upgrade in 9 biggest slums and emphasis on gender aspects to be replicated in
other LGAs was of equal importance.

Relevance of Design and Implementation

Project Design- Highly Satisfactory
Considering the pre-existing conditions that necessitated LMDGP’s intervention in the slums
(blighted areas), the project design in terms of PDOs was appropriate and “highly satisfactory”. It
reflected international best practice, based on sound analytical studies and extensive stakeholder’s
consultation. A detailed Project Implementation Manual reflecting the sectorial conditions as at
2005 was prepared to guide implementation but intended to be reviewed yearly to meet the
present day demand of the project. All the three components were linked to the project objective.
The changes that were made in the structure during the Restructuring were necessary adjustments
to address implementation challenges.
The Project design however failed to provide clarity of roles on project activities within the PCU
and between the PCU and stakeholders. In addition, despite challenges encountered during
implementation, there is no evidence that a review of the PIM was done. There is also no
evidence that a Mid-term review was conducted.



                                                37
Project Implementation- Satisfactory
The implementation arrangement allowed for a decentralized management structure at all levels
with reduced bureaucracy. The PD awarded contracts and reported to the State’s Executive
Governor. However, owing to the complex nature of the project (multi-sectorial), implementing
the design resulted in several challenges. As earlier stated, conflicts in roles and projects’
priorities, coupled with differentiating between the World Bank funded LMDGP and other LASG
initiatives resulted in negative perceptions of the project in some quarters. A major issue was the
negative image of the sub-project arising from demolitions (in Badia East for example) that could
not be adequately addressed.
The project displayed remarkable resilience and strength despite these challenges. The
Government and its PCU pursued implementation, such that the Project’s achievements far
outweigh the shortcomings. On balance, implementation is rated “Moderately Satisfactory”.
Based on the relevance rating of “Highly Satisfactory” for objectives and “moderately
Satisfactory” for design implementation, the overall design and implementation rating is “
Satisfactory’’.

Achievement of Project Development Objective
Overall, the Project Outcome and Development Objective were “Moderately Satisfactory”. The
project achieved notable results despite the 2-years delay at restructuring.

List of KPIs Used to Measure Achievement of the PDO and Results Achieved
Achievement of PDO was measured by pre-established (revised) Outcome Indicators as listed
below:
1) Number of direct project beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender i.e. percentage of female
A population of 1.6 million were to benefit from the project, as at the Jan 2013, a total of 1.5
million are benefiting from the project. The percentage of targeted female beneficiaries on the
project is 44%, the project has been able to meet the targeted female beneficiaries.
2) Number of additional classrooms built or rehabilitated at the primary level resulting from
project interventions Achievement of this KPI is at 50%. 450 classrooms were to be built/
renovated under the intervention, a total of 202 have been built so far, while 117 classrooms are
under construction to be completed.
3) Health facilities constructed, renovated, and/or equipped Achievement of this KPI is at 90%. A
total of 10 PHCs with adjoining CMCs were to be constructed, renovated and/or equipped. A
total of 9 PHCs and 7 CMCs have been completed. (See Annex 21 for pictures of PHCs and
CMCs constructed under LMDGP)
4) Number of people in urban areas provided with access to Improved Water Sources under the
project. Initially, as seen in the (ISR 2013) out of the 75 bore holes constructed 20 were working.
An assessment was carried out on the boreholes and remedial works were undertaken out based
on the assessment report. Presently, 80 boreholes have been constructed and all are working.
5) Number of people in urban areas provided with access to all-season roads within a 500 meter
range under the project. At inception a total of 55km roads were to be constructed but it was later
reviewed to 35.5 km. As of this writing, a total of 30.3 km roads have been constructed
representing 85.3% achievement of the KPI. An estimated 1.2 million people will benefit from
all-season road rehabilitation/construction.

Efficiency
Efficiency of operations and procedures of the project is “Moderately Satisfactory”. Budget
implementation and control was effective. Overall, there is no funding deficit. The initial budget
was USD200 Million. As of this writing USD 5,079,074.00 Million remains unallocated.
Actual spending was less than the initial estimate. The performance of LMDGP should be
considered in the light of the amount disbursed vis-à-vis value for money and actual time of


                                                38
project activities. Cost efficiency was ensured by strong internal control, aggressive supervision
and religious compliance with Bank’s standards.
Despite the challenges that faced the project, it performed fairly towards the achievement of the
PDO. A remarkable amount has been invested in capacity building during project
implementation. However, the relevance and adequacy of trainings received could not be
ascertained as there was no institutional arrangement made toward knowledge management.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Overall Outcome of Moderately Satisfactory is reasonable for the following reasons: i. PDOs
were achieved, ii. KPIs were achieved in some slums (Badia East experience not withstanding).
iii. The project rebounded despite challenges with high turn-over of key project staff such as PD,
Procurement specialist, M&E Specialist, Communication Specialist, etc. iv. Inadequate M&E
systems were addressed months before project close-out. v. The PCU adherence to the Bank’s
Policies and Procedures (except on implementation of safeguard polices) was well above average.
vi. Demand driven and Bottom –up approach (funded projects were selected based on the needs
of beneficiaries communities) resulted in projects that addressed the specific needs of beneficiary
communities. In addition, there is a high rate of adoption of the projects by the communities. vii.
Institutional and sector-wide knowledge and capacity building have been developed based on best
practice and international standards. LASG can continue to leverage this for further development
and for successful implementation of other projects.

ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
Rating: Overall Assessment is Moderate.

Risk to Objectives
The overall Risk to the Development Outcome was rated “Substantial”. These risks include
1. Lack of commitment to reforms: The Government demonstrated its commitment by making
substantial financial investment in the project and hinging its reputation on urban renewal
projects. The project implementation and management arrangement also showed a commitment to
quality and timeliness of implementation.
2. Resistance to change: Rated moderate, this risk should have been rated substantial. The
population of Lagos is largely made up of poor people from all over West Africa with pre-
existing mistrust of Government’s intentions. Ensuring the people’s understanding of the project
and the implementation processes would have reduced situations where the people felt that their
needs were not carefully thought through by the way that the sub-projects were implemented.
3. Ineffective Coordination of Metropolitan Function: Several MDAs took part in the
implementation of the components. It was anticipated that coordination of the activities of the
various MDAs might be challenging hence the rating of moderate. The rating was appropriate.
Mitigation was for PSC was set up with the primary responsibility of coordination and oversight.
The PCU was also set up as an office under the Executive Governor’s Office enabling resolution
of inter-ministerial challenges.
4. Insufficient funds to support post-completion exercise. This was rated moderate but this risk
was low. The Government made substantial investment in project. As at close of the project
undisbursed funds stands at USD 42 Million. The Government will continue to make efforts to
compete the uncompleted sub-projects even after the World Bank’s phase ends.

Sustainability
Much effort is being put into ensuring sustainability of the gains of LMDGP. It is likely that the
gains of the project be sustained due to the following reasons:
1. The project developed institutional capacity for the CEAs to adopt and replicate a city-wide
upgrade.


                                                39
2. Project Implementation Manual, Hand-over notes, Financial Management Manuals that were
used during implementation will be made available after project close-out.
3. Most operational activities and systems have been mainstreamed into the CEAs at different
MDAs. These institutional mechanisms and facilities if well maintained should help sustain
development outcomes.
4. Some of the CEAs will adopted completed projects and include them into their budgets for the
next fiscal year.
5. Agreements for commissioned projects have been prepared in process of execution.

Safeguard Risks
New risks identified during implementation and restructuring was ensuring Safeguard Policy was
implemented on projects that LASG decided to fund for itself. The safeguard risks were
underrated during project preparation, implementation experience has shown the risk to be
“Substantial”.
One of the issues that arose was that of compensating illegal occupants that were displaced due to
project activities. LASG considers them illegal occupants and should not be compensated but
World Bank insisted on the compliance with safeguard policy. “Involuntary resettlement”
required that Project Affected People (PPA), should be compensated irrespective of their status.
On the part of LASG compensation would mean encouraging illegal occupancy.

Risk to Component Result
1. Risks to component Results was rated “moderate”. The rating of this risk should have been
substantial. There were delays in implementation of infrastructure upgrade due to conflicts
around selected project sites. Some of these conflicts are yet to be resolved as of this writing.
Mitigation of this risk was as follows: a) There had been a lot of stakeholder’s consultations at the
community level and the emergence of the Community Development Associations has helped in
settling issues. b) The RFP was prepared but implementation has been weak.

ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at Entry was rated Moderately Satisfactory, due to
the following reasons:
1. The project context was highly relevant to the country’s NEEDS. The PDO and Result
indicators were in sync with the Millennium Development Goals. It identified critical area of
needs that is aimed at making life better for beneficiaries. The Bank made available a Project
Preparation Advance to be refunded during implementation.
2. During Preparation, a number of risks were identified which included Safeguard risks.
However, Safeguard risks and the risk of proper coordination were under-estimated.
3. The level of control or measure for mitigating risk to procurement was one-sided. The World
Bank shielded itself from the risk of procurement by introducing the mis-procurement clause
which exposes LASG to bear the risk.
4. The provision of Post-payment Audit and Post review in the PIM was not appropriate to
mitigate the risk with Financial Management. Emphasis was constantly placed on disbursement
without tight internal control.




                                                 40
5. There were issues with clarity of roles and authority level of each stakeholder, as well as clarity
of priority. Changing trends were not put in perspective during design, this called for a lot of time
been wasted on restructuring.
The rating of Bank’s performance as “moderately satisfactory”, was due to its involvement at
entry and ensuring proper consultations were made during preparation.

Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Bank was rated Moderately Satisfactory for these reason:
1. Bank input and processes during implementation was moderately satisfactory. It could have
been better if the Bank laid emphasis on internal coordination of the PCU. Some provisions in the
PAD and PIM were not totally implemented and there were no formal documents for
restructuring of such. These include: i. M&E systems, ii. Mid- Term Reviews, etc.
2. Development impact was reasonably consistent but supervision was uneven, especially in the
early years of the project. Adequate supervision would have meant, pro-active resolution of
implementation issues such as M&E System that was not excellent at inception. Technical
support could have been better.
3. The change of TTLs for the project affected Bank institutional memory and approach
consistency.
4. Performance reporting from the bank is not timely, most reports does not reflect true status of
project implementation.
5. Time taken for Conflict to be resolved in terms of safeguard issues between the World Bank
and LASG caused delays. Attributing LMDGP intervention to other interventions to other
interventions from LASG was not appropriate. It to lead to encouraging practices that are not
consistent with States’ policy.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

This is based on the ratings of the Bank during preparation and implementation.
1. The 18 Months restructuring period resulted in loss of time that impact the project deliverables
2. The Bank appeared to have difficulty establishing and maintaining an effective relationship
with the Project. This endangered the progress of the project.
3. Quality of the Bank Supervision was unsatisfactory as the Bank took no steps to provide
technical assistance that would have resulted in timely resolution of issues.
4. The Bank micromanaged the project and took too long to issue approvals which delayed
project activities.
5. The Bank failed to provide opportunities for the PCU to provide input into the AID Memoire.

Borrower Performance

Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

i. Government played active role in the project by focusing on the PDO and supporting all the
reforms that was established within the state. These reforms include the MTEF, IFIMS and the
PFM law for public office holders. ii. In order to move the project forward, it offered to execute
parts of the project that were of concern, to further make funds available for infrastructure up-
grade. iii. The project is a multi-sectorial intervention, there is need to improve inter-sectorial
coordination so that the gains of the project can be sustained. iv. Government needs to factor


                                                 41
safeguard policies into projects and ensure terms are properly understood. v. There should be
continuous effort towards discouraging illegal occupancy. The Gbagada/ Bariga Canal and foot
bridge needs government intervention for tangible progress to be made. vi. Government could
have worked with the Bank to develop and implement an improved M&E system during project
preparation.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

LMDGP was committed to achievement of development objective, but there are a number of
reasons for lapses, these includes:
i. The weak internal coordination and fragmented effort, affected the effectiveness and efficiency
of the PCU. Despite this, the PCU was able to make significant progress towards achieving
project objectives (close to achieving KPIs). The administration was better in terms of providing
support for achievement of PDOs. Could have been a lot better if there was stable leadership that
understood the roles and functions of Administrative Unit. ii. The transfer of the Internal Auditor
from the PCU years into implementation affected the internal control in the project, until the
incumbent was returned. The deployment of an Accountant from the PFMU helped mitigate
Financial Management Risk. iii. Initially, the CEAs were not fully carried along, there was
communication gap between the PCU and the CEAs. This was as a result of high turn-over of
communication specialists. A highly competent communication specialist was brought on board 9
months to project close-out and helped bridge the gap with a programmatic communication
strategy. iv. Staffing was not properly put into perspective, the PCU capacity was aggravated by
the high turn-over of Project Directors throughout implementation. If a Technical Assistant
(consultant) had been permanent on the project, institutional memory and compliance with
Bank’s processes would have been ensured. A new PD was brought on board October 2012, soon
after which project implementation picked-up. v. The High turnover project’s procurement
consultant, delayed procurements and slowed disbursements. This was also addressed by the
recruitment of an experienced procurement consultant, 8 months in to project close-out. vi. M&E
and project reporting could have been better, if a concrete M&E system was in place at inception.
However, with the seasoned M&E specialist on the project, the M&E unit was revamped. vii.
After restructuring, progress with works contracts were not satisfactory, but upon assumption of
the Ag. Project Engineer, progress on works improved tremendously with was complemented by
the supervising consultants. viii. One good thing is the resilient and dogged spirit that the PSC
and PCU adopted in executing the project.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
This is consistent with the performance of the Government and Implementing Agency ratings

LESSON LEARNED

Project Preparation
At inception, project preparation was perfect based on prevailing conditions. However, due to
caprices in Economic, Social and Environmental conditions the project seems over ambitious to
make remarkable changes within short period of time. The appropriateness of the concept in the
light of current realities was not properly aligned, though reflecting the Millennium Development
Goals. It would have been more effective if the project focused on one out of the sectors or an
area. Trying to cover ten slums may have been overly ambitious. The impact and implementation
challenges could have been minimized by this arrangement.



                                                42
Project Implementation
The PIM stated guidelines for project implementation. It did not clearly spell out if the PCU was
meant to coordinate projects activities to be implemented by the CEAs or be the Project
Implementation Unit. In some aspects it referred to the project coordination unit as the project
management unit. This called for clarification of roles of the stakeholders during implementation.
There should be constant review of the PIM to reflect project implementation experience.
What ended up happening was that project implementation became centralized under the PCU.
That the project covered so many MDAs and communities necessitated a decentralized
implementation arrangement and a centralized monitoring and evaluation and administration.

Administration and Management
Staffing was a key issue throughout the project. Roles were not clearly defined or understood and
the right employees were not put in the right roles. There were high incidences of frequent
turnover of key staff. Most of the employees at the project initiation are not the ones present at
the close-out. This has serious implications for continuity loss of institutional competence. The
turn-over of staff (majorly the PD, PC, M&E, and other consultants etc.) impacted the project
negatively.
A sense of team was difficult to achieve within body of staff as individuals worked to get a
handle on the role and deliver at short time and under on-going project circumstances.
Information sharing was problematic at times.
For sustainability of the project and to consolidate the gains of the project, existing staff of the
PCU (predominantly employees from LASG and the private sector) should be retained by the
Government. This will allow the Government to leverage institutional knowledge gained through
the hands-on experience gotten on the project as the LASG continues with the efforts to complete
projects in the pipeline.

Procurement Management
Delay in procurement hinders execution of project within record time and at the same time, leads
to the expiration of defect liability period. This and other issues with procurement could have
been avoided, if adequate capacity building on procurement was provided for project officers.
Though the PIM allows for a full time Procurement Consultant to provide Technical Assistance
on procurement activities, the high turn-over of Procurement Consultants impacted the project
was disruptive and contributed to slow procurement processes.
The weak inter-unit relationship at the PCU exacerbated procurement issues. Having silos in the
system will prevent synergy for smooth execution of procurement plans.

Financial Management
A multi-sectorial project of this magnitude requires the services of an internal auditor who is
resident in the PCU. On the MDGP, the Internal Audit function did not reside in the PCU. This
further slowed down administrative processes. With just Post-payment audit in place, the Internal
Auditor is not authorised to make any objection until payment. This made cost recovery difficult
or near impossible when objections are raised after payment. In addition, the institutional
arrangement for post-payment audit was not sufficient for a multi-sectorial project like LMDGP.
A Risk Based Audit that allows for 100% pre-payment audit would have ensured value for money
and reduced inefficiency in the project.

Issues of Conflicts of Interest
For any project to be successful, corporate goals should supersede personal goals. Termination of
contracts due to non-performance of contractors would have been avoided if contracts were
awarded based on competence and not sentiment. Conflict of Interest still remains a major risk in
Nigeria and measures should be taken to mitigate it majorly for future projects.


                                                43
Monitoring and Evaluation
A measure of Quality Control is needed to check project performance against acceptable
standards and making corrections when there are deviations. Therefore, an integrated M&E
Systems should be provided at project initiation with competent and well trained personnel to
drive it. The responsibility of the M&E should be clearly spelt out and should not be duplicated
by other functional unit, to ensure coordination and accountability.

Engineering
Pre-planning activities: A study of site specific soil topography as well as ground water level in
relation to the magnitude of civil works should be carried out before commencement of
procurement activities on construction. Political Interference or conflict of interest should be
discouraged. Sentiments and biases can hamper the success of a laudable project like LMDGP.
Emphasis should be placed on competence not sentiment. The minimum acceptable standard in
line with International best practice should also be clarified from the beginning of any contract.
Efforts should then be made towards ensuring that contractors comply and deliver on agreed
quality before payment are made. A measure of quality control should be enforced with the
introduction of a Quality Assurance Group on the project. This will limit ineffectiveness and
increase efficiency in the system. There should be an institutional arrangement that allows for
specialization and division of labor on a multi-sectorial project like LMDGP.

Safeguards
Risk of adherence to safeguards policy was under rated during project design. Probably the
impact of the project in terms of safeguards was not wholly considered by both the World Bank
and LASG. The delay with regards to safeguard issues could have been mitigated if the
implications of safeguard issues in the project was understood by both parties.
Contracts should be made to include proper costing of safeguards work with clear penalties for
non-compliance spelt out. Proper documentation needs to be emphasised. Progress on Safeguards
activities were not duly documented. All community consultations, processes and agreements
needs to be adequately documented and filed.

Communications
A programmatic approach to communication integrated with change management should be built
into the project implementation from inception. Ensuring proper stakeholders’ mapping and buy-
in from project inception is necessary for ensuring that stakeholder’s needs are understood and
met. Although, the PAD and PIM made arrangement for a strong communication arrangement.
The provisions of the project documents were not duly implemented.
