and Governance Project (LMDGP) for Nigeria were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Bank teams should be cognizant of the prevailing political\n            economy and calibrate the complexity of projects\n            accordingly. A stand-alone case study is carried out to\n            extract lessons learned from LMDGP in a more systematic\n            manner, provide in-depth analysis of the modalities of urban\n            sector engagements in a mega-city like Lagos, and make\n            recommendations towards the structure and manner of\n            engagement in such settings. Projects well vested into\n            existing institutions are less vulnerable to the presence of\n            political capital and may be better suited for complex\n            environments like that of Lagos. Simultaneous deployment of\n            various lending instruments proved to be effective in\n            achieving desired outcomes. Lack of transfer of knowledge,\n            right skill mix, and appropriate background in task team\n            leaders (TTLs) and sector specialists affects the\n            relationship with the client and poses a risk to\n            implementation. When the Bank's and the client's\n            commitment to safeguards policies and their practical\n            implementation diverges significantly, both the Bank and the\n            client should be upfront and eliminate instances where\n            investments will trigger such policies."}, "docdt": "2014-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
