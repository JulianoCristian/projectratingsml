                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Little progress has been achieved since the last mission even though the suspension of civil works due lack of compliance with safeguards has been lifted and the additional works
                         contract were awarded. Disbursement has remained below expectation, after six years of implementation only 58.1% has been disbursed. From a desk and field review of ongoing
                         contracts the team estimated that at the moment, about USD $35.96m has been committed in different ongoing activities and USD $43.67m would likely be uncommitted by project

                         closure in September 2013. This uncommitted amount will be left for the Lagos State Government to decide on how to use it on other ongoing World Bank assisted project. There is
                         also committed contracts to the value of USD19.83 which will not be completed by project closure and the Government is advice to continue to fund these projects and complete them
                         accordingly.
                         Physical progress in terms of the infrastructure put in place is as follows. Number of class rooms constructed is 280 as against 450, 9 nos Primary health care constructed as against

                         10, 30.15 km of roads constructed, 78 boreholes constructed as against 95 while only 2.9km canal constructed against a target of 6.7km. The project initial problem was as a result
                         delays encountered as a result of restructuring to remove solid waste component and the construction of the big drainage canal, this restructuring took long time and during this
                         period little progress was achieved. This was also followed later by suspension of all new civil works contract due to lack of compliance with safeguards issues. It is however worth to
                         note that Mediation centers constructed have been working very well and the communities concern are happy to be using it rather than to to go the court of law.
                         There is the problem also associated with the demolition in Badia which the Lagos State Government did. With serious follow up from the Bank, the Government has established two
                         committees to oversee how the the displaces person will be taken care off. As at the end August 2013, the technical committee has submitted the RAP with an estimate of USD2.0m
                         to be paid as compensation to those displaced in form of cash. The Bank is now reviewing the RAP and will soon clear it for implementation.
