The request was sent by the\n            Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) on behalf\n            of 'individuals, families and groups living in the\n            Badia area of Lagos State.' The requesters allege that\n            the project has caused further 'impoverishment and\n            insecurity' of Badia residents, a vulnerable slum\n            community in Lagos, as a result of evictions that have\n            occurred under the project 'without prior consultation,\n            notice, compensation or resettlement.' The Panel\n            verified that the request met the basic requirements for\n            registration. However, based on the willingness of both the\n            requesters and management to provide an opportunity to\n            resolve the concerns rose, the Panel postponed its decision\n            to register it and initiated instead the pilot approach to\n            support early solutions in the Inspection Panel process.  On\n            November 11, 2013, the Panel informed the board that it will\n            review the situation within three months, as of February 11,\n            2013, as stipulated in the pilot document. The Panel will\n            wait for this expected progress, and will inform the Board\n            by May 2014 on its decision, based on whether the Requesters\n            are satisfied that their concerns have been successfully\n            addressed (as set out in the pilot document)."}, "docdt": "2014-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
