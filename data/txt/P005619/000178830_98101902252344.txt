REPtORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PREsIDENT
TO THE VXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ONl A PROPOSED SIXTH LOAN
TO THE BANQUE DE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE DE TUNISIE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF TIE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Banque de Deve3oppement Economique de Tunisie to be guaranteed by the
Republic of Tunisia, for the equivalent of US$20.0 million to help finance
lending for industry. Amortization would conform substantially to the aggre-
gate of the amortization sChedules applicable to the specific investment proj-
ects financed out of the proceeds of the loan, with a maximum period of 15
years for individual investment projects. The interest rate would be 8.5
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economic Development of Tunisia - A Basic
Report" was distributed to the Executive Directors in January 1975. An up-
dating economic report, "Memorandum on the Economic position of Tunisia,"
was circulated on 'May 23, 1975. The main conclusions of the basic economic
report and the updating mission are reflected below. Country data sheets
are attached (Annex I).
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered br scarcity of natural re-
sources. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agriculture is high-
ly dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality and, apart from
phosphates, limited in quantity. Relatively small quantities of petroleum
were discovered in the mid-1960's, and have since become an increasingly
valuable source of revenue and export earnings. Industrial development has
been handicapped by the small size of the domestic market, as well as a lack
of skills and experience. Tourism has developed rapidly and workers' remit-
tances have become a significant item in the balance- of payments. Tunisia
has enjoyed a large amount of external aid and used it to expand economic
and social infrastructure, broaden the industrial base, make available a wide
range of social and welfare services to a large parl: of the population, and
increase the rate of growth.   Per capita GNP increased by 4 percent annually
from 1961 to 1974. Like most countries, however, Tunisia has not yet found
adequate ways to cope with unemployment and poverty and to achieve a balanced
distribution of consumption among income groups, bet:ween urban and rural areas,
and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central planning
of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a major
role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services. Foreign
exchange shortages and concern with inflation led tc. recourse to a pervasive
system of price determination and controls. An unusually long series of poor



- 2 -
crop years due to shortage of rainfall slowed down the growth of output. Many
of the investments in public enterprises proved to be uneconomic and private
initiative in most sectors except tourism and petroleum was limited.
5.        The Government's present development strategy was introduced after
1969. Its princiT'al objectives are: (a) accelerating growth based on export-
oriented industries, by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct
Government involvement in production and relaxing administrative regulations;
(b) creating jobs. primarily in the expanding industrial sector, encouraging
worker emigration. reducing population growth and improving education and
training; and (c) maintaining internal and external financial stability.
The 1973-76 Plan set a target rate of GDP growth of 7 percent, providing for
a 5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption. Investment was
projected to increase bv 80 percent above the level of the 1969-72 Plan.
National savings vere to finance three-quarters of investment.    Exports of
goods and services were projected to grow at R.R percent per year at contant
prices and imports at 12.2 percent. The Plan foresaw an increase in net ex-
ternal capital inflows of 55 percent over 1969-1972 average levels with ex-
ternal capital providing 23.5 percent of total investment: debt service was
to be held to below 20 percent of exports. The original Plan targets were
conservative in terms of both growth and savings potential, and have been
significantly affected by the impact of the changed petroleum and phosphate
prices on the Tunisian economy (paras. 9 and 10).
6.        The real growth of GDP has accelerated since 1970, reaching 9.4
percent per annum during 1971-1973 and 10.5 percent in 1974, compared with
4.6 percent durinf the previous decade. The acceleration can be attributed
to fortuitous factors such as good weather, leading to record cereal and
olive crops, to imcortant growth in tourism up to 1973. petroleum and phos-
phate revenues and workers' remittances, and to the general re-orientation
of Government policy since 1970, which renewed self-confidence and initiative
in the private sector. Expansion of manufacturing and phosphate production
has been significaint. By 1974, per capita GNP reached $420 at 1972 prices.
The investment rate, which averaged 23 percent of GDP at current prices in
the 1960's, declined to 21 percent in the early 1970's, but regained its
previous level in 1974. However, the increase of investment in real terms
is below Plan projections. National savings, on the other hand, rose sharply,
from an average of 13.5 percent of GDP at current prices during the 1960's to
18 percent in 1973 and 21 percent in 1974. Consequently, the share of ex-
ternal borrowing in financing investment dropped from 44 percent in the 1960 S
to 17 percent in 1973 and 9 percent in 1974.
7.        The balance of payments has improved steadily since 1967, with the
current account deficit declining from an average of $115 million per year
in 1961-1967 to $91 million in 1973 and $30 million in 1974. The effects of
improved terms of trade on the 1974 balance of payments have been significant.
Commodity export prices (mainly for petroleum, olive oil and phosphates) rose
on average by 67 percent over 1973, but were accompanied by a rise in import
prices of about 30 percent. In addition, receipts from services were affected



by the slowdown in tourist activity and in the migration of workers to Europe,
With estimated gross disbursements on external borrov ing totalling $143 mil-
lion (instead of $203 million as foreseen in the Plan), net reserves stood at
$360 million at the end of 1974, equivalent to 4 months of imports.
8.        Because of price controls and Government subsidizatlon of basic
consumer goods, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, Tunisia has main-
tained relative price stability. Domestic price increases averaged 4.2 per-
cent between 1969 and 1973. In 1974 consumer Drices increased by 4 percent
only; however, the official GDP deflator rose by an estimated 12 percent and
average investment costs increased by about 17 percent.
9.        In 1974, Tunisia was on balance a beneficiary of the change with
world economic situation, but this favorable situati.on may change in later
years.  Petroleum and phosphate prices increased about threefold since 1973;
olive oil prices also increased substantially in 1973 and 1974. As a result,
export earnings rose from $680 million in 1973 to $1,090 million in 1974.   On
the other hand, increases in import prices, combined with higher domestic
demand, caused payments on imrports to grow from $750 million in 1973 to $1,100
million in 1974. The gain from terms of trade chang?s registered by Tunisia
in 1974 is expected to disappear by 1978--79.  This reversal, which already
became apparent in the first months of 1975, will be the result mainly of a
stabilization or decrease in the prices of Ttnisia's major exports,. and fur-
ther increases in the prices of impcrted industèral goods.   At the same time,
workers' remittances may continue to be restrained bt slow economic growth in
Western Europe.  Taking into account likely capital -inflows through direct
investment and external aid, the levrel of net reserves is projected to re-
present about 4.5 months of imports Li 1976 and subsequently to decrease to
4 months of imports by 1980. At that time, the balanice of payments may re-
emerge as a more serious constraint on Tunisia's development.
10.       The recenit temporary increase in foreign exchange reserves and
Governnent savings, resulting from higher export prices and conseauent in-
creases in tax revenue, does not call for a substantial revision in develop-
ment strategy.  It suggests rather that Tunisia should step up its efforts to
achieve the investment rate projected in the original. Fourth Plan, and to
realize higher growzth rates and greater employment creation by better capacity
utilization.  Since workers' emigration to Europe is now limited, an effort to
increase investment, particularly in labor-intensive industry and agriculture,
should be made. With an adequate savings level and continuing external aid,
the Tunisian economy has the financial resources that: should enable it to
attain growth rates ranging from 7..5 to 9 percent per annum on average be-
tween 1974 and 198n. In the longer term, higher rates of growth would re-
quire substantiallv higher external aid than in the past. The level of
future growth would also depend on Tunisia continuing to stimulate private
investment, to increase the international competitiveness of industry, and
to improve public investments planning and implementation,
11.       Tunisia hlas made impressive social gains.  By 1974, primary school
enrollment had reached 88 percent and secondary enrollment 19 percent of the
relevant age-group<.  Public health services have been greatly expanded with



- 4 -
many provided free    A family planning program has been introduced.   Total
social expenditure& increased by over 9 percent per annum; in 1974, they ac-
counted for 11 percent of GDP and for 40 percent of total public expenditures.
Nonetheless, major social issues remain. Further progress is needed in land
refo-m and in creating employment.   The unemployment rate was estimated at 18
percent in the non-agricultural sectors in 1972, and underemployment in the
rural sector is hijh. There has been a growing concentration of productive
activities in a fet, urban areas, especially Tunis.
12.       So far as can be judged from available data, real incomes increased
in all sectors during the 1960's, yet by a higher percentage in the modern
sector than in the rural sector, due partly to the series of poor harvests.
In rural areas substantial income disparities remain, in part as a result of
the structure of load tenure. In the modern sector, especially in industry,
increases in real income in the 1960's exceeded the rise in productivity;
the income distribution trend has favored industrial workers. Thanks especial-
ly to the income redistribution effects of free social services, the propor-
tion of the total population living in poverty, as defined by the Tunisians
(i.e. earning less than D 70 annually at 1970 prices), was substantially
reduced during the decade. About 90 percent of this group continues to live
in rural areas, but, since 1970, increased agricultural output, rises in
minimum agriculturaL wages, the inflow of workers' remittances from abroad
and the stabilizati;n of basic commodity prices through Government subsidies
have improved the a)solute, and possibly also the relative, position of the
poorest groups.
13.       Agricultture, the dominant sector in the economy, provides nearly
half of total emplo-.ment, 30 percent of merchandise exports and 19 percent of
GDP (1972-74). Food processing industries account for another 4 percent of
GDP and over a thirl of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural production
rose substantially in recent years, largely as a result of favorable weather.
Tlfhe potential for further growth is clear. While large infrastructure invest-
mnents were made dur:ng the last decade, current policy emphasizes projects
that make a rapid aiid direct contribution to production and recognizes various
constraints on agri,:ultural development: absentee ownership, insecurity of
tenure, inadequate access to agricultural credit, inadequate extension ser-
vices, insufficient agricultural education, and underutilization of irrigation
investments. Under the Fourth Plan, more than $140 million has been allo-
cated to a rural development program to be executed by the provincial admin-
istrations.
14.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has received relatively large amounts
of external capital. During 1965-1973, loan commitments from Governments and
multilateral organizations averaged $100 million per annum, while disbursements
were some $76 million per annum, or $20 and $15, respectively, per capita per
annum. During this period, the major bilateral lenders, on a commitment basis,
were the United States (22 percent of official loans), France (14 percent), and
Germany (13 percent), with important contributions also from Canada, Italy,
Kuwait and Sweden. Loans from the Bank Group constituted the main single
source of total official lending, accounting for 25 percent of commitments



during 1965-1973. There has been a steady shift fromn program to project
lending.  Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms: in 1969-1973,
the average terms of borrowing from bilateral source; were 3.6 percent inter-
est and 24 years to maturity, including 6 years of g'!ace; from multilateral
sources 5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including 6 years of
grace.  Tunisia received annually some $30 million in grants during 1965-1973,
as well as capital inflows from private soturces amounting to some $40 million
annually.  Direct foreign private investment has been limited, but as a re-
sult of increasing outlays on petroleum exploration ind development and,
recently, foreign investment in manufacturing, it has shown a rising trend,
from $17 million in 1965 to $54 million in 1973.
15.       Tunisia's total external public debt was $',f 271 million, of which
$824 million were disbursed, at the end of 1973. Disbursed debt at the end
of 1974 is estimated at $900 million.    Debt service has fallen from 16 percent
of exports and workers' remittances in'1972 to 9 percent in 1974.     The debt
service ratio is projected to decrease to 8 percent by 1976, following recent
increases in commodity export earnings, but may rise after 1980 when external
capital requirements are likely to increase substantially.    While Tunisia is
capable of servicing substantial additional debt on less concessionary terms
than in the past, it should continue to seek part of its external resources
on concessionary terms so as to prevent the debt service ratio from rising
unduly in the long-term.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
16.       Since 1962, Tunisia has received a total of twenty-three loans and
en credits amountina respectively to $294.9 million and $65.7 million, net
of cancellations and refundings. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank Loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of October 31, 1975, and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Wrhile there have been some problems In project execution, as in the
railwavs, agricultural credit and family planning projects, on the whole proj-
ect implementation has been satisfactory.    Important institutional improve-
ments have been achieved. In a number of sectors, independent agencies have
been created or strengthened.
18.       In accordance with Tunisian priorities. pas: Bank Group lending has
emphasized support for long-term investments in infra,tructure and social
development. Lending for urban and social development, including water supply,
education, family planning and the Tunis urban planning and-public transport
project accounts for 39 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Lending
for transport, power and tourism infrastructure accounits for a further 28
percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 14 percent of total com-
mitments.   Industrial and hotel financing through Banclue de Developpement
Economique de Tunisie (BDET) has received 12 percent, and the Gafsa phosphate
development project accounts for 7 percent of total commitments.



- 6 -
9.       in addition to the $8.9 million loan for a Third Education project
and the $28 million loan for a Second iiighway project, approved by the
Executive Directors on July 1 and December 18, 1975 respectively, and the
proposed project only one additional project, an agricultural credit project,
is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors this fiscal year.
Future Bank lending to Tunisia is expected to support improvements in poli-
cies and institutions, in particular agricultural policies and agencies and
the planning and implementation machinery; it would also support measures to
create employment and to introduce institutional reform. The proposed lend-
ing program emphasizes investment in agriculture: this will require substan-
tial Government inputs of manpower and technical assistance to support in--
creased production and the creation of new institutions which can reach the
rural poor.
20.       Lending for industry has so far been largely through the main
Tunisian development finance company, BDET, and has mostly benefited medium-
size companies; the Bank has encouraged BDET to diversify its sources of funds
and progress has been made in this resDect. Such lending is expected to
continue, but at a declining rate as BDET diversifies its sources of funds.
The Bank has also lent directly for the Gafsa phosphate mining project.
Further loans for priority industrial subsectors in which Tunisia has a
comparative advantage would depend on the progress achieved in the form-
ulation of sound projects.
21.       The Bank Group accounted for almost 20 percent of disbursements of
official aid to Tunisia between 1969 and 1973 and is expected to maintain its
share, with that of the US declining and that of other, particularly Arab,
sources of funds rising. The Bank Group's shares in total debt outstanding
and disbursed at the end of 1973 (including loans from private sources) and in
debt service during 1973 were 13 percent and 9 percent respectively. Over the
rest of the decade, the Bank Group's share in disbursed external debt is ex-
pected to rise to about 20 percent; its share in debt service will probably
rise to the same level.
22.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in BDET. in COFITOUR (a
company to promote and invest in tourism projects), in RYM (a large hotel
development) and in Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce alumi-
nium fluoride fror local fluorspar for export. IFC's most recent investment,
in May 1975, was in the Sousse-Nord project, an integrated tourism development
project. Including the Sousse-Nord project, IFC's net commitments in Tunisia
total $17.2 million.
23.       Since 1'62 the Bank has chaired the Consultative Group for Tunisia
bringing together the principal donor countries and the institutions concerned
with the country'< development. The most recent meeting of the Group was held
in Paris in June 1975.   New participants in the Group included Saudi Arabia,
Japan, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Commission
of the European Communities.



PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL AND TOURIST SECTCRS IN TJNISIA
Industr'y
24.       Until 1970, Tunisia relied largely on the public sector for its
industrial development. The early thrust of industrialization was supplied
by major import substitution projects, which suffered, however, from the
limited domestic market and shortages of experienced staff and management.
The new economic policies adopted in 1970 primarily rely on the private sector
to stimulate industrial growth oriented towards exports, and to largely contri-
bute to employment creation.
25.       Industrial production has since been growing at a East pace mostly
as a result of renewed confidence of private investors. From 1971 to 1974,
the output of the manufacturing I.idustry grew by 17 percent annually, in-
creasing its share in GDP from 9 percent in 1970 to 13 percent in 1974. This
increase was largely due to the growth in food processing and other agro-
industries, and in the textile and chemical industries.   Mining, including
petroleum production, grew at a slower rate through 1973 but, as a restilt of
petroleum and phosphate price increases, its importance to the economy rose
dramatically in 1974, representing 8.6 percent of GOP compared with 5.6 per-
cent in 1973.
26.       During recent years, the Government has adopted a numiber of measures
to liberalize the economy in order to enhance the competitiveness of Tunisian
industry. The 1972 Export Industries Incentive Law and the 1974 Investment
Code provide for a wide range of fiscal incentives. In 1973 the Government
created the Agience de Promotion des Investissemernts (API), primarily to
expedite and simplify procedures for obtaining Government approval of invest-
ment and to promote private investment, both domestic and foreign; the Aence
Fonciere Industrielle (AFI) was set up in early 1974 to acquire and sell land
to investors as well as to create and administer industrial estates.    A recent-
ly established Fonds pour la Promotion et la Decentralisati'on Industrielle
(FOPRODI) is expected to provide equity capical, low-cost loans and technical
assistance to small-scale entrepreneurs. Finally, the Government established
in January 1975, the Centre Technique du Developpement de la Construction, to
help reinforce the capacity of the Tunisian constru^tion industry.
27.       Under the Fourth Plan, private manufacturing investment, particu-
larly in food processing industries, textiles, fert[lizers and electro-
mechanical industries, is expected to average D 25 inillion per year between
1973 and 1976, compared with D 12 million in 1972, and to account for two-
thirds of total investment in manufacturing. These targets are likely to be
exceeded. Foreign private investors are expected to contribute through finance,
know-how and overseas marketing, in creating competitive industries producing
for export. Tunisia's preferential trade agreement with the EEC, currently
being renegotiated, allows for duty-free import of a wide range of Tunisian
industrial products into the Common Market. Recent changes in world prices
also give Tunisia a comparative advantage for developing petroleumi and
phosphate-based chemical industries.



lo,ri. sm
28.       The development of tourism in Tunisia is relatively recent.    Between
1961f and 1972, foreign tourist arrivals increased at an average rate of 30
percent per annum, rising from 46,000 to 780,000 --- a performance unmatched
by any other M.editerranean country. In 1973, the general slowdown of tourism
growth from Europe, combined with domestic factors such as the inadequate
development of infrastructure and the weak quality of services --- led to a
drop in tourist arrivals of 7 percent and in visitor bed-nights of 13 percent.
A substantial increase in tourist arrivals and in foreia!n visitors' bednights
was noted, however, in the last months of 1974 and in 1975, partly due to
political instability in several competitive Mediterranean countries. As a
result of the 1973/74 slowdown in tourism, the Government reduced the tourism
investment projections for the Fourth Plan period. Present Government policy
aims to improve the efficiency of existing hiotel facilities rather than to
further expand accommodation capacity.
29.       The tourism sector has contributed significantly to Tunisia's
economy. Its foreign exchange earnings having risen from US83 million in
1961 to US$140 million in 1972 and about $160 million in 1973, represent a
major item of invisible receipts in Tunisia's balance of payments - about
21 percent of Tunisia's total current receipts in 1972-1973 and 15 percent
in 1974. Investments in the tourism sector averaged D 19 million per year
from 1969 to 1972, about 11 percent of total gross fixed capital formation.
After leveling off at D 24 million in 1973, tourism investments were reduced
to D 16 million in 1974, or less than 5 percent of total investments.
30.       Since 1965, the private sector has accounted for about 90 percent
of total tourism investment. The Government actively promotes tourism develop-
ment through its autonomous agency, the Office National du Tourisme (ONT).
ONT is carrying out a major tourism infrastructure project with Bank Group
and German (KfW) support. A hotel training project (Loan 1029-TUN) was ap-
proved by the Bank's Executive Directors in June 1974. The recently created
Agence Fonciere Touristique, provides fiscal incentives and land for hotel
investments. Incentive policies have been reviewed following the Government's
decision in 1974 to improve the efficiency of hotel investments. The conclu-
sions of this review, which was carried out in cooperation with the Bank, are
now under consideration.
31.       BDET and the   oMzagLe KFinanciere et Touristique (COFITOUR) together
have provided financing of about 63 percent of all term loans to the tourism
sector as of 1974. Funds available for hotel lending have thus far been
adequate. The repayment period of hotel loans (10 to 14 years), is rather
short and well below the average life of hotels and terms (15 to 25 years)
offered by hotel credit institutions in some competing Mediterranean countries.
32.       The short-term effects of the energy crisis are difficult to assess,
but the slowdown in tourism demand observed in the 1973/1974 seasons, par-
ticularly from Europe, now appears to have been reversed.    Tourists arrivals
are projected at 970,000 for 1975, compared with 780,000 for 1972, the previous



record year. The upward trend is expected to continue because of the lower
rate of inflation in Tunisia than in thie competing Mediterranean countries and
the Government's policy to maintain competitive hotel prices. An additional
bed capacity of 40,000 may be required by 1980.
PART IV - TIE PROJECT
33.       The proposed sixth loan to Banque de Developpement Economique de
Tunisie (BDET) was prepared and appraised during several missions in 1973,
1974 and 1975. Ne..otiations were held in Washington In January 1975 and in
Tunis in June 1975. Processing the Loan took an unusually long time because
of protracted disc issions with the Government and BDET on measures to satis-
factorily resolve 2omplex project issues.   Mr. Fakhfakh, BDET's General
Manager, headed thr! Tunisian negotiating team on both occasions. An appraisal
report on BDET (No. 962-TUN) dated December 19, 1975 -Is being distributed
separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached a: Annex III.
Establishment and Rlesources of BDET
34.       BDET, Up to 1973 known as Societe Nationale d'Lnvestissements (SNI),
was established in 1959 and reorganized in 1965 with the assistance of the
Bank Group.   Since then the Bank has made five loans to BDET totalling $49
million, as follows: $5 million in May 1966, $10 mil]ion in September 1967,
$10 million in December 1969, $10 million in January 1972 and $14 million in
January 1973.  BDET's dependence on the Bank for resources has declined from
78 percent of term borrowing in 1972 to 48 percent in 1974. This reflects
BDET's success in mobilizing other resources, through capital increases,
bonds sold to the Tunisian public, Central Bank loans and loans from Sweden
(SIDA), Germany (KfW), Qatar and France (CCCE).
35,       BDET doubled its share capital in January 1971 to D 3.0 million, and
again in 1974, to D 6.0 million. The ownership distribution as of June 1975
was as follows: Ttunisian public sector (30 percent), Tujnisian private sector
(27 percent), foreign shareholders (33 percent) and IP'C (10 percent).   IFC,
the largest non-Tunisian shareholder, did not subscribe to the 1974 capital
increase and its holdings therefore decreased from 20 percent in 1973 to 10
percent in 1975; during the same period, the shares of the Tunisian private
sector decreased from about 42 percent to 27 percent. An important develop-
ment for future BDTT operations is the participation of three new foreign
shareholders in BDET's share capital:   Libyan Arab Foreign Bank (7 percent),
Kuwait Investment Company (6 percent) and Deutsche Entwicklungsgesellschaft
(6 percent).
Oqjjectives and Operations of BDET
36.       BDET's policies, established at the time of its reorganization in
1965, provide that BDET is to stimulate industrializal:ion and the developmernt
of tourism in Tunisia through the financing of sound cLnd productive projects.
BDET has also played an important role in helping develop the Tunisian capital
market.  Through the projects it has financed in tourism and industry, BDET



has made a substantial contribution to the improvement of Tunisia's foreign
exchange position.   Tourism remains a major foreign exchange earner and indus-
try's share of foreign exchange receipts is expected to increase as the
Government continues to encourage export-oriented industries.
37.       From year end 1971 to 1974, BDET's medium and long-term portfolio
rose from D 11.6 million to D 31.5 million, as a result of the expansion in
Tunisia's tourism and manufacturing sectors.   Total disbursements rose from
D 3.3 million in 1971 to 1) 8 million in 1974. Of the credit extended by
Tunisia's financial community at end 1974, BDET held about 40 percent of
outstanding term loans to manufacturing. 35 percent of term loans to tourism
and 11 percent of term loans to the construction industry, BDET has been able
to achieve these results despite constraints the financial system imposes on
its efforts to mobilize domestic resources and despite the higher cost of its
resources than those of competing financial institutions. BDET's equity in-
vestments totalled D 3.9 million at the end of 1974, an increase of 34 percent
over 1973. The most important single equity investment (D 830,000) was BDET's
subscription to Compagnie Financiere et Touristique (COFITOUR) in which IFC is
a principal investor.
38.       Loans represented about 89 percent of BDET's financing operations
from 1972 to 1974. Terms were from five to fifteen years. The average inter-
est rate was 8.3 percent in 1974 compared with 8.5 percent in 1973. Due to
the increasing cost of resources used, BDET's operating margin declined from
3.41 percent in 1972 to 2.94 percent in 1973, with a further decline to 2.58
percent forecast for 1975.
39.       Up to now, BDET's single exposure limit to companies has been 15
percent of equity. During negotiations on the proposed loan, BDET proposed
that this limit be increased to 25 percent of equity; it was agreed that an
increase to 20 percent was justified because of the larger size of BDET fi-
nanced projects and the measures adopted during negotiations to improve the
quality of BDET's loan portfolio (see para. 50). In December 1973, BDET's
Shareholders amended the Statutes to make more lenient the procedures to be
followed in the course of business dealings between BDET and its Board members.
After consultation with the Bank, BDET has reinstated the earlier procedures
in its statutes to avoid conflicts of interest involving BDET Board members
(Section 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement).
40.       To strengthen BDET's profitability, an understanding was reached that
BDET would apply, as of January 1, 1976, a 9 percent interest rate on all its
loans; the Government has reserved tne right, however, to provide resident
industrial borrowers a 1 percent rebate to enhance BDET's competitiveness with
other term lending institutions in Tunisia that will continue to charge an 8
percent rate. In addition, an understanding was reached that BDET would no
longer resort to the standby subsidy arrangement it concluded with the Govern-
ment in 1973 to guarantee a minimum onerating spread of 2-1/2 percent on BDET's
borrowed resources. In light of its policy to promote industrial development
and employment creation, the Government was not prepared to adopt interest
rates above 9 percent, even though sub-borrowers will not bear the foreign
exchiange risk which is assumed by the Central Bank. The development of



Tunisia's capital market, more generall'. will remain the subject of a con -
tinuing dialogue 1-etmeen the Bank Group ancl the Tunisian authorities. In
response to tlc Government's reouest, IFC has surniltt'ed a number of proposals
to strengthen the capital market which will include a review of interest rates
and of the allocation of the exchange risk on toreign loans.   In addition, the
Central 13ank has started work on a study of the structure of interest rates
in Tunisia in general.
41 .      Despite its increasing operaitional wqorkload and shortage of ex-
perienced staff, FI)ET has made comnendable efforts in financing smaller-
sized industrial enterprises. Loans to i.ndustrial borrowvers have been geo-
graphicallv concentrated in the Tunis Region. However, the Government lhas
recentlv initiated measures to establish through API_ AFI and FOPRODI, new
industrial estates away from the Tunis area.   BDET's cperations cover a wide
range of industrial sub-sectors, in particular agro-irdustries, textiles,
and apparel manufacturing. Hiowever, no sing le branch of industry represents
more than 11 percent of BDET's portfolio, except for tourism (41 percent).
42.       A pressing issue facing the Tunisian economy is unemployment.
According, to BUDET estimates. about 12 ,0O!) jobs would Le created bv projects
which it approved in 1974. The average capital cost per job created in 1974
was about $19,000, a decrease in real terms from the 1972 level of abouNt
A1 9,7 00.
_ianageent and Orai zat ion
43.       Board of Directors and Executive Committee.   BUIDT's Board of
Directors has 15 members. Mr. Bourguiba Jr. was elected Chairman of the
Board and General Manager in -larch 1971 . The present composition of the
Board is as follown:  two Directors representing the Government, three each
from the Tunisian public and private sectors. one frorm BDET management and
six from foreign shareholders.   In April 1975, Mr. Fawzi Habib replaced
Mr. Khosropur as IFC's representative on BIDET's Board, The Board meets four
times a year. The Executive Committee. entirely Tunisian in membership, re-
views general policy matters and approves loans and investments of up to
ID 200,00n.  To li,-hten the workload of the Executive Committee, a Credit
Committee, composed of BDET management, was created to approve new loans of
up to D 50,000 and increases in existing, loans of Up to 15 percent of the
original amount approved.
44.       Staff and Procedures. In tlhe past three years, BIDET's total staff
has increased from 96 to 143, of whichi 53 are professionals. The reorgani-
zation, started in 1972 in order to assign internal resoonsibilities more
efficiently, has been successfully completed. lioweve-r, internal coordination
continues to he weak. In October 1974, the Director w:ith special executive
nouers (Administrateur delegue), MKr. Belkhodja, resi:gied from BDET uipon his
apnointment as Chairman and General Manager of Banque Nationale de Ttunisie,
leaving a gap in RBET's management.   This gap lhas partly been filled by thl
appointm,ient of Mr. Fakhfaklh. previously 31)ET's Deputv General--Manager, as thle
neu Gene ral--Manayer. Trie 13an7c has urged tliat, in addition  a qualified1 and
ex-oerienced banker be emploved to strengl-then existing ton management. As an



- 12 -
interim measure, Mr. Crifo, formerly head of the Projects Department, and Mr.
Farhat, formerly head of the Controller's department, have been appointed as
advisers to the top management. All department heads, including that of the
Projects department, are now Tunisian staff. The most positive aspect of
this restructuring is that it brings promising younger staff into positions
of higher responsibility. It does not, however, provide for a more permanent
strengthening of in-line management at the top-level, and the Bank is con-
tinuing to urge that a qualified person for such a position be found and
appointed as soon as possible.
45.       BDET's appraisal work has improved during the last three years.
The Projects Department and technical staff are now adequately manned by
fourteen economists and nine engineers; they are competent and well motivated
though less experienced than would be desirable. The financial analysis and
economic rate of return calculations used in BDET's appraisals are satisfac-
tory. Market studies have somewhat improved. Project supervision, particu-
larly for tourism, needs to be further strengthened. BDET plans to recruit
the required additional staff, and to set up training programs to improve
tourism project appraisal and supervision.
Financial Results
46.       Net earnings for 1974 were D 508,000, equivalent to 7.4 percent of
average net worth. BDET's profitability declined from 1972 to 1974 as a
result of the shrinking spread on utilized resources and the relative de-
cline of capital gains and dividends. BDET paid a 6 percent dividend in
1972, 1973 and 1974.
47.       Total assets grew from D 18 million in 1971 to D 44.5 million in
1974. Despite commendable success in mobilizing domestic and foreign ex-
change resources, BDET occasionally found itself overcommitted during this
period in seeking to meet the needs of the booming industrial sector. Pro-
visions a]_la:Q ied in 1972, 1973, and 1974 were inadequate in view of port-
folio risk2, particularly on hotel borrowers.   If sufficient provisions had
been allocated against risks in 1973 and 1974, BDET would have incurred
operating losses in those years. After excluding such provisions from
equity, BDET's debt/equity ratio, as adjusted for capital increases, was
2.7 in 1972, 3.8 in 1973 and 3.5 in 1974; the authorized limit is 4.
48.       BDET's portfolio of tourism loans has experienced serious problems.
()utstanding principal due on hotel borrowers in_arrears of three months or
more amounted to 16 percent of total loan portfolio in 1973 and 17 percent
in 1974. In addition, most tourism loans are not secured by valid mortgages,
mainly because of administrative and legal difficulties in completing regis-
tration of land ownership. BDET's portfolio of industrial loans is not cause
for any particular concern; outstanding principal due on industrial borrowers
in arrears of three months or more amounted to 4 percent of total loan port-
folio at end 1974. BDET's portfolio of equity investments is basically sound
and should remain profitable during coming years. Despite 13 investments
which had an estimated total value D 337,000 below cost and for which the
aaditors recommended that specific provision be made, the estimated market
value of BDET's total equity portfolio was D 1.1 million above cost.



- 13 -
49.       BDET replaced Peat, 'Marwick and Mitchell and Company by Arthur
Anderson and Company in March 1975 to audit. together with Cabinet Finor, a
Tunisian firm, its end 1974 accounts. Findin-s in the auditors' reports on
1972, 1973, and 1974 results have differed from BP)ET's own accounts for the
same period as a result of differences in evaluation of probable portfolio
losses and in application of accounting principles.    At the Bank's urging,
BDET agreed to give in future to all its Board members copies of the auditors'
report as soon as it becomes available (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.02).
The auditors' report on 1974 results recommended total provisions of
D 1,537,000 against probable losses on loans (D 1,20(C'.00) and investments
(D 337,000) compared with BDET's actual allocation of D 519,000. The Bank
supported this recommendation, and BDET agreed to make, and maintain, ade-
quate provisions to cover possible losses (Draft Loan. Agreement, Section
4.10(a)). An understanding was reached on how provisions are to be defined,
calculated, and made from year to year on BDE.T's acccunts. Furthermore, BDET
agreed that no dividends will be paid unless adequate provisions have been
made (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.10h).
50.       The following additional measures were alsc agreed upon by the
Government and BDET to consolidate BDET's loan portfc.lio in the tourism sector.
Firstly, BDET agreed that it would make loans in future only if it has obtained
adequate security on such loans (Draft Loan Agreement: section 3.07 b(i)). Also,
BDET would help its hotel borrowers to register their land and would disburse
funds only if evidence of a valid sale contract between the land owner and the
BDET customer can be provided. Secondlv, BDET agreec. to submit to the Bank a
program and timetable, acceptable to the Bank    for validating mortgages on
past loans, before loan effectiveness (Draft Loan Agreement, Sections 3.07
b(ii) and 6.01). Thirdly, an understanding was reached that BDET will appoint
at least one staff to work full-time on mortgage validation problems. Fourthly,
BDET will work towards reducing tourism loans and investments to 25 percent of
its portfolio. Finally, to help accelerate the land registration process in
tourism zones, the Government, which lhad established in December 1974 a topo-
graphical office, confirmed that it will continue its efforts to speed up the
survey and registration of land in tourism zones. These measures, as well as
those outlined in para. 45 should help BDET to overcome its portfolio problems
and to remain a creditworthy borrower of the Bank. -tt was therefore agreed
during negotiations to raise BDET's debt/equity limit: from 4:1 to 5:1, so that
BDET can satisfy the growing credit demands and improve its profitability
(Draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.06).
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements            -
51.       Forecast of_operations.   BDET's business pr-ospects for the medium-
term are good. The rapid increase in yearly approvaLs from D 5.1 million in
1971 to D 36.6 million in 1974 will be held down to 1) 30 million per year for
the period 1975-1977. While restraining growth throuigh 1977, BDET would con--
solidate its portfolio by improving its financial position and the quality of
its performance in the tourism sector.
52.       To finance its future operations, BDET would have to mobilize about
D 28.5 million of fresh funds per annum ovcr the 1975-77 period.    BDET has so



far raised 45 percent of the resources needed for 1975   the proposed Bank loan
of $20 million an(! borrowings from Arab countries would help finance thie addi-
tional requirements. About 50 percent of the funds to be raised in 1976, and
about one-third of those needed in 1977. are fairlv certain.  BDET expects to
meet part of its resource requirements from the Central Bank, bond issues,
capital increases, and from sources of financinp sIIclh as France (CCCE), Cermany
(KfI'') (atar, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. In addition. BDET is negotiating its first
loans from the African Development Bank. Libya, the Saudi Fund, and the Arab
Fund for Economic and Social Development. T'he proposed Bank loan represents
only 10 percent of total resources to be raised for 1975-77 compared witlh 38
percent of total I'DET resources employed at end 1974. This reflects BDET's
success in mohili.:ing funds, particularly from capital surplus Arab countries.
53.       As part of the measures it envisages to consolidate its financial
position, BDET plans to increase its capital from D 6 million to D 10 million
by end 1977. To this end, the Government has made a D 2 million advance in
1975 on future public sector subscriptions to capital and plans to make a
similar D 2 million advance in 1976. The advances, whichi will not be reim-
bursable, will be considered as quasi-equity by the Bank. Other shareholders
are expected to exercise their preferential rights in the proposed capital
increase. If private shareholders do not exercise their riglhts at all, the
shares of public enterprises in BDET's capital could increase from the present
30 percent to 58 percent, an unlikely prospect. The Government has confirmed
that it would favor greater subscription by the private sector on the occasion
of future capital increases to reduce public sector holdings in BDET's capital.
54.       BDET's earning prospects for 1975--79 are good. Net profits after
taxes are projected to rise from D 869'000 in 1975 to D 1,985,000 in 1979,
an increase from 8.7 percent of average net worth to 11.3 percent.
Terms of the Proposed Bank Loan
55.       The proposed Bank loan which would be used only for industrial in-
vestment projects, follows the terms and conditions of recent Bank loans to
other development finance companies, including the standard commitment charge.
The free limit would be increased from $400,000 to D 200,000 (about US$467,000)
so that it would be in harmony with the ceiling on loans to be approved by
BDET's Executive Committee. The aggregate free limit would remain at 25 per-
cent of the loan.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMf!ENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and BDET. the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Features of the
loan of particular interest are mentioned in paragraphs 37 through 54 of this
report. An additional condition of effectiveness is the submission by BDFT



to the Bank of a timetable and plan of action accepta!ble to the Bank for the
validation of its rmortgage security on its loans to the tourism sector. The
draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for lcans for development fi-
nance companies.
57.       1 am satilsfied that the proposed loan woul. comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECO'YIUsE'NDATTON
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. 94:   Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
Date of Effectiveness:   December 20, 1966; 'losing Date:   (original)
December 31, 1970; (current) December 31, 1975.
Ln. 1155: Third Education Project; US$8.9 million loan of August 13, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The second education project is almost entirely completed. All proj-
ect schools have been accepted by the government from the contractors, virtual-
ly all equipment and furniture have been purchased, anid most of it has been
delivered and installed.   To allow for the completion of the technical assist-
ance program, the Closing Date was extended to December 31, 1975. The loan
for the Third Education Project is expected to become effective by mid-
January 1976.
Ln. 581:  First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Date of Effectiveness: May 29, 1969; Closing Date: (original)
December 31, 1973; (current) December 31, 1975.
Cr. 209:  Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Date of Effectiveness: December 12, 1970; (losing Date: (original)
December 31, 1974; (current) December 31, 1'75.
Ln. 989:  Third Water Supply Project; US$23 million loan of May 29, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1979.
Because of problems with locally manufactured asbestos-cement pipe
completion of the First Project has been delayed.    Constraints resulting from
lack of capacity in the local construction industry required that the Closing
Date be further set back until the end of 1975. Final. project costs are ex-
pected to be about 6 percent below appraisal estimates (but 7 percent higher
in dollar terms because of devaluation).   The Second Project is 12 to 18 months
behind schedule for the same reasons as well as because of initial delays in
final design. Final costs may be about 5 percent higher than original esti-
mates because of current inflation rates, but they will be 20-25 percent higher
in dollar terms. Because of delays in execution, the Closing Date has also
been extended to the end of 1975. Procurement for the Third Project has begun
and is. on schedule.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 606:  Railways Pr2ject; U$$&.5 million loan and US$&.5 million credit,
Cr. 150:  both of June 4, 1969; Date of Effectiveness:    September 16, 1969;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973; (current) December 31,
1975.
The project was delayed both by floods (one year) and by financial
difficulties (one year). The financial problems were caused by non-payment
of freight charges by the railway's largest customer, the state-controlled
Gafsa Phosphate Company; operational deficits, due to low rates and fares;
and higher than estimated prices of rolling stock. The Government has reim-
bursed the deficit for the 1972-1974 period and has made an advance against
the 1975 deficit. A new cost-based tariff was introduced in January 1974;
a further increase in rates for phosphate traffic was approved in 1975.
Traffic continues to rise but operating results have not improved as much as
expected, and continuing Government contributions to the railways and further
tariff increases will be required. A reallocation of the proceeds of the
loan and credit permitted the placing of all outstanding orders; cost in-
creases of about $6 million for items in the original list of goods are being
financed by utilizing a Spanish line of credit. The credit has been fully
disbursed; the Closing Date of the loan was extended to permit completion of
disbursements.
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: December 29, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Since January 1974 steady progress has been made both in the
National Family Planning program, and in the management of the project. The
Government has welcomed and acted upon the recommendations of the IDA sector
mission, and there are strong indications that the program will now continue
to develop positively. The cost and availability of goods and services for
civil works have been greatly affected by the construction boom being exper-
ienced in Tunisia resulting in much higher costs than anticipated and delays
with respect to some structures. NORAD has agreed to participate in financing
the cost increases.
Ln. 746: Highways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971; Date of
Effectiveness: October 26, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project execution, which fell behind schedule initially due to
lengthy Government procedures and changes in key personnel, is now proceeding
satisfactorily. Progress in reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads and
bridges is good. The estimated cost of the project has increased significantly,
mainly as a result of dollar devaluation. The Executive Directors have ap-
proved (R75-158 of July 14, 1975) the deletion of one major road section from
the project. The Government is providing supplementary funds to permit com-
pletion of the other project components.

Ln. 779: Agricultural Credit Project; US$5 million loan and US$3 million
Cr. 263: credit, both of July 12, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: January 25,
1972; Closing Date: (original) July 31, 1975, (current) June 30, 1976.
The Project has experienced serious difficulties concerning subloans
for farm machinery and dairy farms, due to competing credit programs with more
liberal terms (FOSDA/FSA) and deteriorating price relationships between invest-
ment and outputs. In early 1975 the Government remedied the competition be-
tween FOSDA/FSA funds and IBRD funds in financing similar investments and the
mechanization component is now disbursing satisfactorily. The date palm planta-
tion component is almost completed. The dairy farm component has suffered
from fixed milk prices; funds in this category will also be used to finance a
milk processing facility. New commitments under the Project ended on
September 30, 1975, but disbursements are expected tc continue until the end
of 1976, with a consequent need further to extend the closing date.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness:   Iaxjk, 1972; Closing Date:    December 31, 1976.
The project is now being actively implemented after earlier diffi-
culties and delays experienced in design of an economic project vessel suit-
able for operation by traditional fishermen.    Problems were also encountered
in selecting the marine engine to equip the project boat. Increases in the
cost of hulls and engines led to a reduction of the number of boats to be
constructed under the project from 335 to 180; despite price increases, the
project boat is still economic because of the sharp increases in fish prices
since appraisal. The demand for the project vessel is also strong as it rep-
resents a significant improvement over traditional vessels of the same caliber
and costs about 23 percent less than these vessels.
Ln. 815:  Power Project; US$12 million loan of April 20, 1972; Date of
Effectiveness: August 4, 1972; Closing Date: (original) July 31,
1975, (current) June 30, 1976.
The project is nearing completion. Both gas turbines, as well as
all transmission lines and substations are in operation. Costs of the project
are not expected to exceed the original estimate. A recent tariff increase
will raise STEG's overall electricity revenues by 12 percent so that the rate
of return is expected to reach 9.2 percent in 1979 (8.5 percent in the Loan
Agreement).
Ln. 858: Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 million
Cr. 329: credit, both of September 28, 1972; Date of Effectiveness: June 26,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project experienced initial delays because of the time required
to adopt legislation establishing the public land corporation which is to ac-
quire land in the project zones for resale to investors. The development
studies for the six project zones, being executed by consultants, are partially



AQNNEX II

completed.  Invitations for bids for some project works have been issued;
contracts are now being concluded and some works are underway. Recent cost
overruns may lead to eventual amendments in the project. A study of Government
incentives for investment in tourism has been completed.
Ln. 798:  Fourth Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
February 4, 1972; Date of Effectiveness:   April 13, 1972; Closing
Date: March 31, 1976.
Ln. 881: Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February '0, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: May 24, 1973; Closing
Date: March 31, 1978.
Disbursements under Ln. 798 are slightly behind schedule, while
disbursements under Ln. 881 are ahead of schedule. Business greatly exceeded
projections in 1973. 1974 and 1975. Persistent problems include the adequacy
of provisions againE;t possible losses, the substantial amount of arrears of
hotel borrowers and the lack of valid mortgage security for certain sub-loans.
Appropriate solutions to these problems have been discussed with BDET (ex-SNI)
in the context of negotiations on a sixth loan to BDET. The dependence of
BDET on the Government and the IBRD is expected to be reduced by BDET's raising
substantial funds from local and foreign sources.
Ln. 937: Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432: million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Due to delays in appointment of consultants and completion of the
necessary legal actions and opinions, the loan and credit for this project
only became effective in September, 1974. As the offer of the Tunisian sup-
plier fell within 15 percent of the international reference price agreed with
the Bank/IDA, the public transport company (SNT) has decided to award him the
contract for supply of project buses. The District has faced difficulty in
recruiting the staff foreseen under the project, and in establishing itself
as an effective interlocutor of national agencies. Steps to deal with these
problems have been taken. The equipnment for the suburban railway component
has experienced major price increases, and the Government is considering ways
of financing the cost overruns.
Ln. 1029: Hotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: November 4, 1975; Closing Date: October
31, 1978.
Due largely to delays in the acquisition of sites for project hotel
training centers by the National Tourism Office (ONT), effectiveness of the
loan for this project was delayed. Consulting architects have been selected
from official lists provided by the Ministry of Equipment. The project unit
initially created for the tourism infrastructure project has been enlarged by
addition of the staff necessary for the construction of the hotel training
centers. Recruitment of technical assistance personnel is nearly complete.

Date of Ef'fectiveness: March 14, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Procurement for the new underground mind development (Sehib) is
being completed after a delay of about 10 months due to problems with consult-
ing engineers. The modernization program for existing mines is proceeding on
schedule. Terms of reference for a study of developuient possibilities in the
mining region are uider discussion.
Ln. 1068: Irrigatioi Rehabilitation Project; $12.2 mi'llion loan of December
31, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 18, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Execution of the project has begun. Both project authorities are
now selecting consultants; the key advisor for the Oifice for the Development
of Nebhana (OMIVAN) has assumed his duties.
Ln. 1088: First Urban Sewerage Project; $28 million Loan of February 18, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: August 15, 1975; Closing Date: June 15, 1979.
The contract has been awarded for rehabilit:ating and expanding the
existing treatment plant. Final designs are being carried out by consultants
for the remaining works and the bids for the first muLjor contracts are expected
to be requested before the end of the year. The Centre Technique pour le
Developpement de la Construction is engaging technical experts to assist in
preparing the inventory of basic data required for the study on Tunisia's con-
struction industry.
