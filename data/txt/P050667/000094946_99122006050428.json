42 districts of the state, especially\n            from socially disadvantaged groups, complete a five-year\n            primary education cycle of appropriate quality. This project\n            contributes to further increasing the geographical scope of\n            the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Projects (report nos.\n            11746 and 17103) and the Second District Primary Education\n            Project (report no. 15496). There are three project\n            components. The first component appoints para-professional\n            teachers, builds and rehabilitates schools and classrooms\n            and provides toilets and water facilities, pilots and\n            introduces double-shift models, provides alternative\n            schooling facilities, designs interventions to address the\n            educational needs of children from socially disadvantaged\n            groups,, conducts regular health check-ups of school\n            children, and mobilizes and strengthens community\n            organizations and launches awareness campaigns. The second\n            component institutes a comprehensive teacher development\n            system including revising the curriculum revision, improving\n            teacher materials and modules, developing a continuous\n            learning assessment, and monitoring classroom practices.\n            This component also provides book banks and assesses student\n            learning. The third component builds institutional capacity\n            at the state, district, and sub-district level to manage\n            primary education."}, "docdt": "1999-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
