Project for Serbia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; the Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is important\n            to maintain flexibility of the DPL series to adapt to\n            current realities/priorities and to respond to economic\n            crisis by focusing on the important sectors. Good\n            coordination with other partners acquires increased\n            importance in time of crisis. The cooperation among\n            international agencies World Bank, International Monetary\n            Fund (WB, IMF) and with other donors, in particular the\n            European Union (EU), was decisive since large amounts of\n            assistance have been necessary. The program supported by the\n            PFDPL series has also benefitted from Bank engagement in\n            banking sector restructuring in Serbia and Bank's\n            previous experience in financial crises. The Bank work and\n            experience in the financial sector was of particular importance."}, "docdt": "2011-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
