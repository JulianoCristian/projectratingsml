                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project would assist the State of Rio Grande do Norte to reduce high levels of rural poverty by: (a) improving well-being and incomes of the rural poor
                         through better access to basic social and economic infrastructure and services and support for productive activities, using proven community-driven
                         development techniques; (b) increasing the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively to meet own needs; (c) enhancing local governance by
                         greater citizen participation and transparency in decision-making, through the creation and strengthening of community associations and Municipal Councils;
                         and (d) fostering closer integration of development policies, programs and projects at the local level, by assisting Municipal Councils to extend their role in
                         seeking funding, priority-setting and decision-making over resource allocation.
