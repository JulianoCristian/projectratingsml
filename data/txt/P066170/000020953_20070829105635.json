The Additional Financing will continue to\n            support basic, small-scale infrastructure investments for\n            the rural poor while intensifying the focus on creating the\n            conditions for productive, employment and income-generating\n            activities, the proportion of which in the total mix of\n            investments is expected to increase to around half.
