assessment of outcome\n            is unsatisfactory, as are both performances by the Bank, and\n            Borrower. Lessons are as follows. There is a need to\n            strengthen the technical capacity of financial\n            intermediaries (FIs), before opening lines of credit aimed\n            at reducing, or preventing pollution, to avoid the delays\n            resulting from the FI's inability to screen, and\n            appraise sub-projects, and their inadequate comprehension of\n            the technical standards enforced by the Bank as a condition\n            for sub-loan approval. Furthermore, effective outreach\n            mechanisms supported by strong commitment from FI management\n            should be established, given that industrial borrowing is\n            sensitive to changes in interest rates, and perceived\n            transaction costs. Related to this, is the need for donor\n            coordination to harmonize credit terms within similar\n            on-lending operations, financed by different donors, or at\n            least to minimize the potential for confusion and overlap\n            between programs. Pollution prevention activities should be\n            focused on priority sites where the marginal benefits of\n            pollution reduction are high, and for monitoring systems\n            which can track local pollution trends over time. Therefore,\n            alternative mechanisms to spatially, or thematically target\n            polluting industries could also have been explored, with\n            complementary financial, and technical assistance. In any\n            case, a solid sub-project investment pipeline should have\n            been developed for at least the first project year.\n            Additionally, project components should be more carefully\n            linked with expected outcomes, taking into account the\n            likely time lag between efforts to strengthen regulatory\n            effectiveness, and observed changes in industrial behavior\n            to be encountered. Better analytic work before project\n            preparation might have helped regarding these issues, as\n            well as a substantial time, and level of effort for\n            preparation, and supervision, with technical inputs backed\n            by consistent management oversight and institutional memory\n            from internal reviews."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
