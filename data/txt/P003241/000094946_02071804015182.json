Following are some\n            lessons learned from the project experience. Taking into\n            account the project's expected, and improved delivery\n            of services, as well as the inherent reforms it entails,\n            such reforms must be accompanied by adequate Government\n            resources to support them, that is funding for the agreed\n            requirements under the legislation (Water and Sanitation\n            Act, 1997), redundancy payments, and working capital, while\n            the consequences of a reform agenda on the Government budget\n            must be clearly identified. Regarding civil works, the\n            choice of expenditure was for items with heavy foreign\n            exchange content, with the expectation that the public\n            sector would undertake less capital intensive works, such as\n            repair and expansion to the distribution system. This\n            technology choice is reflected in the negative Net Present\n            Value (NPV), where heavy capital costs for rehabilitation,\n            are not set against increased numbers of consumers, showing\n            instead consistent low returns, since by and large, benefits\n            in water supply systems come from expanding the\n            distribution, and selling more water. But, the public sector\n            did not choose to invest in the expansion of the\n            distribution system, actually, the number of consumers did\n            not increase dramatically. With respect to water borne\n            disease and cholera, the lack of focus on sanitation may\n            have lowered the effectiveness regarding disease control,\n            but a health component that would include hygiene education,\n            and thus achieved these objectives, may not be best placed\n            in a water rehabilitation project."}, "docdt": "2002-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
