dealing with native forests; b)\n            facilitate the development of an incentive and regulatory\n            framework to encourage decision makers; both public and\n            private, to more fully internalize within their decision\n            making processes the full range of social costs and benefits\n            associated with their decisions and actions affecting native\n            forests; c) develop a plan for transforming the National\n            Parks Administration into a world- class park management\n            organization; and d) increase the environmentally\n            sustainable level of tourism in four national parks. The\n            project will have three components: a) generation and\n            dissemination of research and information consisting of\n            policy, legal and regulatory reform, a national inventory of\n            native forests and establishment and operation of a related\n            database; and applied research and studies to facilitate\n            management and conservation of native forests and protected\n            areas; b) protected areas comprised of the development of a\n            plan for the modernization of the National Parks\n            Administration and specific infrastructure development and\n            management strengthening in four Patagonian Region parks;\n            and c) project implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
