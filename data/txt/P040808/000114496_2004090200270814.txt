if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Bank, within the period of time 
specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to 
the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts for the Special 
Account “B”; 
 
(c) 
if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the Borrower of its intention to suspend in 
whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 
 
(d) 
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories, 
less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to Parts B and C.2 the Project, shall equal the equivalent 
of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.  
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan 
allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to 
the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall 
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account “B” as of the 
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures. 
 
6. 
(a) 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the Special 
Account “B”: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of 
this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; 
or (B) deposit into the Special Account “B” (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an 
amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.  Unless 
the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account “B” shall be 
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may 
be. 
 
(b) 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special Account “B” will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
