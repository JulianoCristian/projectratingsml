Native Forests and\n            Protected Areas Project for Argentina were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            tourism can be a positive force and successful investment in\n            flagship protected areas may generate benefits for the\n            entire protected areas system The investments in the four\n            Patagonian parks under the project were highly successful in\n            their outcomes for the individual parks. In addition to the\n            conservation of biodiversity, they saw increases in their\n            fees collected, improved infrastructure and equipment for\n            their personnel, and enhanced visitor experiences. These\n            conditions create a favorable image for decision-makers as\n            sound investments for the national budget and interest is\n            generated at the national level tourism agencies and from\n            local governments in other regions that will like to benefit\n            from similar investments in parks within their localities.\n            Applied research projects are successful when attention is\n            given to stakeholders and producers needs, but weak local\n            capacities may hinder execution and sustainability. The\n            project provided for many research projects that were\n            developed to address real needs of producers facing\n            challenges in regard to degradation of natural resources,\n            sustainable production, and forest management. These\n            experiences are being widely disseminated both nationally\n            and internationally. However, those projects that were\n            located in poorer eco regions where the capacities of\n            beneficiaries, academic institutions, government agencies,\n            and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) was weaker, faced\n            more problems ranging from a lack of consensus regarding\n            thematic approaches, to the rate of disbursement and\n            implementation. Good environmental baseline information is\n            not available in these areas generally, making it more\n            difficult to target research approaches adequately, however\n            participatory approaches and consultation processes may\n            improve the focus and selection of interventions."}, "docdt": "2007-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
