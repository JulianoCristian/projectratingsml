2. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
2.01      Haiti's indigenous energy resources are limited.  The remaining
undeveloped hydro-potential amounts to about 90 KW only (of which 90% are
concentrated in two sites in the Artibonite River) and petroleum deposits at
this moment are not known to exist. Small sub-economic lignite deposits have
been identified but it is doubtful whether they can be used for power
generatton. Imported fuel, therefore, is presently used for 50% of total
electricity generation of 369 GWh (1983), and thermal power plants will have
to remain the mainstay of the Haitian power sector*
2.02      Imported refined petroleum products are the main Gource of
commercial energy. Charcoal is extensively used for domestic and small
industrial purposes. A Bank energy assessment mission estimated that in 1982
wood accounted for 76 percent of Haiti's gross energy use, bagasse for 5
percent, petroleum for 15 percent and hydropower for 4 percent. Due to the
high use of wood, much of the country has been denuded of trees; erosion is
progressing rapidly and considerable areas of once fertile land have been
stripped of soil. Moreover, because of erosion-induced siltation, the useful
volume of the reservoir of the Peligre hydropower scheme, the largest in the
country, is declining rapidly and reducing the power capacity by 400 kW per
year during the dry season. At the present rate of siltation, the reservoir
may be completely filled by year 2016, eliminating present river regulation
done for purposes of power generation, irrigation and flood control.
Impounding siltation in the incoming affluents to the reservoir might
mitigate the problem; the construction of the Guayamouc dam and hydroelectric
project, now being considered by EdH for development, is one of the proposed
partial solutions4 for containing about 40% of the sediments. Dredging of the
Peligre reservoir is not an economical proposition.
2.03      Various public institutions in Haiti are at present engaged in
evaluating solar energy technologies, windpower anu methanol production frcsi
sweet sorghum. Although some of these technologies may not be developed
economically at the present time, they could constitute an important source
of energy in the future.
Power Sector and its Organization
2.04      Electrification is limited in Haiti, reflecting the low economic
level of the country and the poverty of its population. In 1983, only 9
percent of the population had access to electricity; in Port-au-Prince 43
percent of the people had electricity and in the provinces and rural sector
only 3 percent. Power generation is highest in Port-au-Prince with about 410
kWh per capita annually, which for the whole population averages only about
70 kWh. Industries which are mainly in and around Port-au-Prince consume
about 45 percent of sales, commerce 5 percent, public institutions 12
percent, and residential consumption is about 38 percent. Since 1972,
electricity consumption in Port-au-Prince grew at an average annual rate of



- 4 -
13 percent and is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 9 percent
through 1988, while in the rural areas it is expected to grow at a rate ol
10.5 percent. Annex 2 presents detailed information on the power market in
Haiti.
2.05      Electricite d'Haiti (EdH), an autonomous Government agency created
in 1971, is the sole entity responsible for power supply in Haiti. Power
sector policies are set by the Preaident of its Board, the President of the
Republic, who delegates his authority to the Minister of Public Works,
Communications and Transport. There is no separate regulatory body for the
sector, and tariffs are approved by Edl's Board.
2.06      EdH's installed hydroelectric capacity is 54.8 MW and thermal
capacity amounts to 91.8 MW. Captive plant capaciy is 40,000 kW, all thermal
type.
Electricite d'Haiti
2.07      Annex 1 presents complete details on EdH.  EdH employs about 1,250
people of which 370 are stationed at locations outside Port-au-Prince. Only
8% of EdH's staff have a university degree. Staff quality is not fully
satisfactory and there is a shortage of managerial, technical, and
administrative skills. Under the first IDA Power Project, a training unit
was created within EdH, initially responsible for only the coordination of
training in-house and abroad. More recently, the training unit expanded into
a center with the assistance provided under the Second and Third Power
Projects, as well as by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) and the
Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW). With five full time instructors, the
Center provides courses and seminars on varied subjects such as linemen
techniques, metering, welding, diesel operation and nechanics, hydro-plant
operation, fitting, first aid, accounting, administrative and control
techniques, secretarial techniques, alphabetization, etc. In the last four
years 300 employees received training at the center. In addition to the
in-house training, the center sent 35 professionals to seminars and courses
abroad. Through the First and Second Power Projects, IDA helped to provide
training to approximately 50 percent of EdH professionals through fellowships
abroad, and approximately 50 percent of EdH personnel through in-house
training. Results were satisfactory in the financial and administration
areas where personnel were trained in modern organizational methods and data
handling equipment. In the technical area, improvements have been achieved
in systems planning and technical studies, but a great deal remains to be
done in engineering and design, construction supervision and operations and
maintenance. Under the Third Power Project, an additional 10% of the
engineers and technicians would receive training,
2.08      In general, EdH has performed reasonably well in the execution of
previously IDA-financed projects. In order to assure that the institution
continues having an adequate managemert, independence from undue government
interference, and that all projects, including the proposed Fourth Power
Project, would be executed in an efficient manner, during negotiations the
Government and EdH accepted that the specific covenants from credit 1281 HA,



- 5 -
related with the execution of the project, with financial performance and
with the management and operation of EdH, be repeated in the legal documents
for the proposed credit.
2.09      In order to monitor the future operations of EdH, new performance
and financial indicators and loss reduction targets have been negotiated and
included in the legal documents. At present there is a loss of water at
EdH's Peligre dam because of a lack of coordination between EdH and
L'Organisme de Developpement de la Vallee d'Artibonite (ODVA), an irrigation
development organization. As a condition of effectiveness, EdH would sign an
agreement with ODVA to regulate the use of the Artibonite River for
irrigation, flood control, and power generation in a manner satisfactory to
the Association. EdH would carry out periodic inspection of the Peligre dam
and related structures in accordance with sound engineering practices in
order to determine whether there are any deficiencies in the condition of
such structures, or in the quality and adequacy of maintenance and methods of
operation.
EdH's Financial Situation
2.10      Prior to 1975, EdH's financial performance had been very weak,
mostly because of inadequate tariff levels, high energy losses, non-payment
of public electricity consumption and excessive reliance on short-term debt
financing. However, starting in 1976, and particularly since 1978, EdH
finances improved gradually. Its average revenue increased by about 40
percent between 1980 and 1982. In this period, the rates of return on
revalued assets were around 5.7 percent, lower than the targeted 8 percent,
but adequate to meet EdH's cash requirements. Due to a severe drought that
affected the generation of hydropower, a constant increase in electricity
losses and lower demand because of the economic recession, earnings in 1983
dropped severely, resulting in a rate of return of zero percent. The new
financial forecast includes provisions to meet financial shortfalls in case
of drought.
2.11      EdH's financial situation is expected to be satisfactory through
FY88. The forecast rate of return on the average current net value of fixed
assets in operation would not be less than 5 percent in FY85 and FY86, 7
percent in FY87 and 8 percent in FY88. During the period, EdH would be able
to meet its financial obligations and generate internally approximately 27
percent of the financing of its construction program and working capital
needs.  However, in order to maintain a sound financial performance during
the execution of the project, the Government and EdH agreed during
negotiations not to undertake any investments in the power sector whose total
cost would exceed the equivalent of one percent of the current net value of
EdH's fixed assets in operation, with the exception of those reviewed by the
Association during appraisal. Also, they agreed on a commitment limiting the
aggregate amount of unbudgeted village and rural electrification investments
in any year to 0.2 percent of such net value. At the same time, EdH agreed
(a) not to incur long-term debt without the Association's previous consent
unless internal cash generation covers maximum future debt service by 1.5
times; (b) not increase short-term debt exceeding one sixth of its annual
cash operating, maintenance and administration expenses; and (c) maintain



- 6 -
its liquid assets in an intere6t-bearing account or in interest-bearing
investments.  The ratio between the internal cash generation and debt service
shall be calculated using a reasonable forecast for the internal cash
generation instead of historical data.
2.12      EdH's tariff structure, designed with the assistance of consultants
under previous projects, is based on the principle of marginal costing. The
tariff includes a monthly fuel surcharge, adjusted quarterly and incorporated
into the basic tariff at the end of each fiscal year. The average tariff for
FY83 was US cents 12.8 per kWh, and it has been projected to grow at 10
percent per yea, during the period 1984-88, or the same rate assumed for
local inflation and in line with what EdH achieved in recent years.  The
projected annual average tariffs are about equal to the long-run marginal
cost. At the begirnning of FY84, after incorporation of the fuel surcharge
into the basic tariff, it reached US cents 14.0 per kWh, which ie close to
the average tariff assumed in the financial forecast for FY84 (US cents 14.3
per kWh).
2.13      The collection of current electricity bills from government
agencies and public institutions has always been a problem for EdH. As of
September 1984, the Government's arrears amounted to US$ 6.10 million,
equivalent to 15 months of billing.  As a condition to begin negotiations of
the proposed project, the Ministry of Finance signed an agreement with EdH,
acceptable to the Association, under which (a) the arrears will be settled
through lump sum payments of US$2.90 million in FY85, US$2.65 million in
FY86 and the balance of approximately US$0.55 million in FY87; and (b) the
Government will start to pay on time current electricity bills, from the
beginning of FY85. The Government would maintain the financial agreement
until it is fully implemented. Finally, the Government would not permit EdH
to use its financial resources for any purpose other than to pay the costs of
its operations and investments and to service its debts.
2.14      A detailed financial analysis for EdH's operations is presented in
Annex 3.
Power Sector Strategy and Development
2.15      As part of the policy of diversifying economic activities, the
'encouragement of private sector investment in assembly industries and tourism
has become a cornerstone of Haiti's development strategy.  In this context,
the "Long-Term Pre-Investment Study of the Power Sector", the master plan in
the development of the sector, emphasizes the expansion of electric power
generation in major urban areas, especially in Port-au-Prince. This study
was financed in 1978 by UNDP and has been endorsed by Government authorities
and the main external agencies supporting the power sector (IDA, K'W, IDB,
CIDA, UNDP, CCCE).  The latest update of the study, prepared by HLdro Quebec
International in September 1983, includes an expansion program which extends
into the early years of the coming decade. In view of the limited hydro-
potential left for development in Haiti, it prescribes an intermittent
program of increasing hydroelectric and thermal capacity, in steps
commensurate with demand projections of Port-au-Prince and the main urban



-7-
centers in the provinces. As far as rural electrification is concerned, EdH
bases ita expansion program on small electric generating plants. EdlH and
German consultants financed by KfW are carrying out feasibility studies of
hydro-plants, and small diesel generating groups are being installed at
selected sites. A Rural Electrification Master Plan will be prepared in
1985-86 by consultants to be financed by of a grant from CIDA.
2.1*6     EdH's proposed investment program for the period of 1984-88 totals
US$264.7 million. Of this amotunt, about 11 percent would be invested in
rural electrification. By the end of the period, the power generating
capacity for Port-au-Prince would increase by 60 MW from its present level of
120.4 MW and the provinices by 4 MW from a level of 26.2 MW.
Sector Constraints
2.17      The main constraint to the development of the Haitian power sector
is the high investment in hydroelectric systems due to the country's
topography, hydrology, and the lack of infrastructure. Variations in the
regime of the rivers require the construction of reservoirs to regulate the.
flow of water. However, because of the nature of the terrain, the
construction of large reservoirs is very costly. The absence of adequate
roads contributes to the high cost of civil works. The limited number of
qualified staff also affects EdH's capacity to develop and manage the
system. This is currently being corrected through improvements in.
organization and training. Nevertheless, the cost of power development and
consumer tariffs for electric service will remain relatively high in Haiti,
and the Government will continue to require a substantial amount of foreign
assistance to finance it, in order to accelerate the growth of industrial
activities.
IDA Strategy and Participation in the Power Sector
2.18      Since 1976, the Association has sought to assist Haiti in the
development of its electric power sector through: (a) the formulation and
implementation of a least cost national power development plan that conforms
to the development objectives of the country; and (b) the institutional and
financial improvement of EdH. To achieve these objectives, IDA provided
three credits amounting to US$58.5 millioa and mobilized an additional amount
of US$24.0 million in co-financing and parallel financing. The development
of Haiti's power sector has cuntributed to the creation of a manufacturing
sector that has become the most consistently dynamic economic activity in
Haiti and is helping to absorb part of the unemployed labor force migrating
from the countryside to the capital city.  While EdH has become one of the
most efficient public enterprises in Haiti, IDA will have to provide
technical, managerial and financial assistance, over a long period of time,
to allow EdH to meet the institutional demands and large investment
requirements of a rapidly growing sector.
2.19      The First Power Project (Credit 645-HA of Jtuly 1976 for US$16.0
million) included the initial stage (1976-78) of a two-stage power
development program then covering the period 1976-83. The decision to carry
oW'4 this program in two stages arose from constraints in the availability of
both IDA and local counterpart funds and from the desire to strengthen EdH



-8-
institutionally before it undertook a larger investment project. Thus, EdH
was reorganized, its autonomy strengthened, and its technical. competence
supported by technical assistance for engineering, project supervision and
staff training. The Project also addressed the urgent need to install 21 'AW
of diesel generating capacity in Port-au-Prince at a new power station
(Varreux) near the industrial and commercial center of the city, together
with transmission facilities, particularly to serve industry. This part of
the project was completed about 20 months behind schedule. The delay arose
because of a transport accident affecting the two small generators and also
because of a major breakdown of the two larger units, afterwards repaired by
the supplier. Transmission facilities were completed on schedule. A new
tariff structure, coupled with improvements in operating efficiency, resulted
in a substantial improvement of EdH's financial position. The Project
Performance Audit Report (Report No. 3265) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on December 30, 19BQ.
2.20      The Second Power Project (Credit 895-HA for US$16.5 million and the
European Economic Communit:y special action credit 4-HA for US$6.0 million,
both of May 1979) covered the second stage of the power development program
for the 1979-83 period.  The project, which received parallel CIDA financing
amounting to Can$17 million, added 23 MW capacity to the Varreux diesel
station, transmission lines and substations, renovation of Port-au-Prince
distribution system, some diesel units and related distribution networks in
tb.e provinces and consulting services and training of EdH's staff. The
implementation of the project suffered a setback in 1979 due to controversies
within EdH concerning the IDA-financed contract for the Varreux diesel
station, resulting in the dismissal by the Government of the General Manager,
the Technical Director and the consultants. By allowing overlapping
consultant services, the Association endeavored to minimize the effect of the
incident which, nevertheless, resulted in a delay of 18 months in the
renovation of th%t Port-au-Prince transmission network. The CIDA financed and
administered transmission component also suffered delays, as a result of lags
in the preparation of project designs, bid evaluation and contract award.
The Second Power project is now scheduled to be completed in December 1984.
2.21      The Third Power Project (Credit 1281-HA for SDR 23.1 million, of
August 1982, and CCCE parallel financing of FF 30 million, November 1983)
which cov(rs the investment needs of the 1984-85 period of the developmer,t
program., is financing a new 23 MW diesel electric power station at Carrefour
in Port-au-Prince, additional renovation of the Port-au-Prince distribution
network, construction of a new head office for EdH, repair of the civil works
at the Peligre hydroelectric power plant, a feasibility study for the
Guayamouc hydroelectric project, consulting services and training of EdH
staff. The project is scheduled to be completed in June 1986.
Municipal Finance
2.22      Municipal government in Port-au-Prince is provided by the four
municipalities that make up the "Communaute Urbaine de Port-au-Prince", with
a population of 900,000. The role of these municipalities is restricted at
present to the administration of a few urban services, such as the collection
and disposal of garbage. Staff are insufficient in number and inadequately
trained. Their financial position is precarious; more than half of their



- 9 -
revenues come from earmarked taxes collected by the Ministry of Finance, such
as the property tax and the licence tax on enterprises. The remainder
consists essentially of grants from the central Government. In real terms,
revenues from local taxes have been falling in recent years.  The results are
insufficient funds to provide for adeqnldte urban services and maintenance of
infrastructure, let alone capital investment. There are, however, several
important capital investments in Port-au-Prince which are being financed or
prepared by international and bilateral agencies: drainage (IDB), urban
development (KfW and IDA), transportation (France) and water supply (IDA and
France). In order to operate and maintain adequately these investments and
improve the delive.-ry of basic services, it has become increasingly necessary
to strengthen urgently overall municipal management and finance. An
opportunity to improve municipal finances in Port-au-Prince has arisen during
the preparation of proposed project due to a proposal under consideration by
Government to link municipal tax collection with electricity tariffs. This
proposal revealed the need for a thorough review of municipal finance and
management in order to improve local tax administration in Port-au-Prince and
to assess other alternative measures for generating municipal revenues
without linking them to electricity tariffs. Therefore, the proposed project
would include a study of municipal finances in Port-au-Prince which should
lead to reforms in the structure of local revenues in order to allow for
improvements in the provision of urban services.
3. THE PROJECT
Project Origin and Preparation
3.01      The proposed project, which is a part of EdHts expansion program,
would cover the investment cost to increase the generation capacity for
Port-au-Prince during the period 1986-87. The project was identified by
IDA's supervision missions in 1982 and 1983, was prepared by EdH's Technical
and Planning Departments, with the assistance of consultants, and was
appraised in October 1983. Annex 2 presents full details on EdH's expansion
program for the period 1984-1995.
Project Objectives and Description
3.02      The proposed project aims at expanding and improving generating
facilities in order to meet growing demand of electricity, completing the
renovation of the Port-au-Prince distribution network as a means to improve
service and decrease energy losses, and at strengthening Edl both in the
technical and financial areas by means of training programs and the
assistance given by consultants. It also includes the final design and
preparation of bidding documents for a new hydroelectric project on the
Artibonite river b^cin and a review of the municipal finances of
Port-au-Prince.



- 10 -
3.03      The Proposed project includes:
(a)  Supply and installation of two medium-speed diesel groups, rated
7.8 MW each, at the new Carrefour power plant. The groups would be
installed in the space provided at the powerhouse constructed as
part of the Third Power Project. Once completed, the plant will
have a total of five diesel groups with a total capacity of 39 MW;
(b)  Generation improvement of existing power plants, including: (i)
installation of a new cooling tower at the Varreux diesel electric
power plant; (ii) installation of auxiliary equipment to improve
performance of selected plants; (iii) purchase of a stock of spare
parts for up to four years of operation for the Varreux and
Carrefour power plants, and for major maintenance of the three
hydro turbine-generators at the Peligre hydroelectric plant;
(c) Completion of .the distribution network renovation for Port-au-
Prince, started under the Second and Third Power Projects. When
completed, about 75% of the network would have been renewed, and
technical losses and theft of electricity would be reduced from a
present 32% to less than 17% of total production in 1988;
Cd)  Consulting services to cover: (i) engineering and supervision for
parts (a) and (c) of the proposed project; (ii) general consulting
to EdH in technical, financial and administrative matters and
monitoring of the loss reduction program; (iii) technical
assistance to be directly responsible for the operation,
maintenance and on-the-job training under part (b) of the proposed
project; (iv) review of the feasibility studies for hydro-electric
projects in the Artibonite river basin, and final design and
preparation or bidding documents for the selected hydroelectric
power plant;
Ce)  Training of EdH personnel and fellowships for studies abroad; and
*f)  Consulting services to review the municipal finances of
Port-au-Prince.
3.04      The two additional diesel generating groups included in the project
would enable EdH to meet the demand growth at Port-au-Prince until 1988, by
which time new generation capacity would be needed. The system expansion
study conducted by the consultants (para. 2.15) concluded that at the present
level of electricity productior., it is more economical to use low-priced
medium speed diesel units at Carrefour instead of more efficient and
reliable, but also more expensive low speed diesels. For these reasons, and
for a desirable standardization of equipment, EdH decided to continue with
medium speed diesels at this plant.
3.05      The operation of the seven medium speed diesel groups at Varreux
(39 MW total) has not been as successful as expected, due partly to the lack
of experienced personnel to operate and maintain the plant, and to the



- 11 -
inadequate stock. of spare parts.  In addition, there have been technical
problems such as a deficiency in the cooling system oc the first four dies l
groups installed at Varreux (First Power Project) which does not permit full
loading of the generators, and some breakdowns in the last three groups
(Second Power Project) which are beixig corrected by the manufacturer.  The
generation improvement program under part (b) of this project would correct
the situation of the existing Varreux power plant and permit proper operation
of the new Carrefout: plant. Together these plants would have a total of 78
MW, equivalent to 54% of the total ins!.±led effective (rainy season)
capacity serving Port-au-Prince by 1987.
3.06      The turbine-generators at the Peligre hydroelectric plant,
responsible for 54% of EdH's generation for Port-au-Prince in 1983, are in
urgent need of an already past due major ten-year maintenance overhaul. The
proposed project would provide the foreign funds required to import the spare
parts. Since the repair of the civil works at the Peligre dam is also being
financed by IDA under the Third Power Project, after completion of the
proposed project, the Peligre plant would have been totally overhauled with
the help of funds provided by the Association.
3.07      In order to 1iprove service, lower technical losses and
eliminate theft of electricity through illegal connections, about 75 percent
of the distribution network at Port-au-Prince needs to be replaced. This
work is being partly financed by the Association under the Second and Third
Power Projects. The actual work on the renovation, however, started only in
1983, a delay of three years, due to initial difficulties with the
consultants. The proposed project iould provide the funds to expand and
complete the renovation of the network by 1987. EdH has formulated an
electricity loss reduction program which is satisfactory to IDA and has
started to implement it. The electricity production loss would be reduced to
at least 26 percent by September 30, 1985, 22 percent by September 30, 1986,
19 percent by September 30, 1987 and 17 percent by September 30, 1988 and
thereafter.  In order to regulate the common use of utility poles for the
d.stribution networks, EdH has signed agreements satisfactory to the
Association, with the telecommunication (TELECO) and television (TeleHaiti)
companies.
3.08      Preliminary studies available on occasion of appraisal of the Third
Power Project pointed out that two small dams could be developed in the
Guayamouc river (Guayamouc I and II) with a combined capacity of about 9 MW.
Based on this information, it was decided to finance as part of the Third
Power Project the survey, feasibility study and bidding documents for the
Guayamouc I project. However, the feasibility studies concluded that the two
sites could be combined in a larger power plant with a capacity of 22 MW and
85 GWh/year. Additional feasibility studies prepared with IDB and EdH funds
in 1982-83 defined better other hydroelectric power plants on the Artibonite
river basin: La Chapelle with a maximum capacity of 56.6 MW and 281 GWh and
Mirabelais with a capacity of 30 MW and 147 GWh. Since the funds provided in
the Third Power Project were used entirely in the execution of the Guayamouc
feasibility study, the proposed project would finance consultants to review
the feasibility studies for hydroelectric plants on the Artibonite river
basin and to prepare final design and bidding documents for the selected
project.



- 12 -
3.09      The project would cover the foreign cost of 1986-87 training
program of EdH. The program includes fellowships abroad and short in-house
courses and seminars. While efforts will be continued in the financial and
administrative areas, the training will emphasize the technical area,
particularly the engineering and design, construction supervision, and
operations and maintenance. The technical experts who would assist EdH to
operate the Varreux and Carrefour stations would provide also on-the-job
training to supervisors, operators, and maintenance personnel for the medium
speed diesel groups. Under the Fourth Power Project about 75 percentage of
personnel and 15 perce-atage of professional staff will be recycled or
trained. The 1986-87 program and its implementation schedule have been
discussed and agreed with EdH. The candidates for fellowships would be
selected on the basis of criteria and under terms satisfactory to the
Association. EdH would consult the Association concerning the proposed
training institutions for these candidates and make arrangements satisfactory
to the Association for the placement of such fellowship be1leficiaries. To
ensure adequate implementation of the training component, it will be closely
monitored by the Association's Central and Regional Training Units.
3.10      The review of municipal finances, to be carried out by consultants
(36 man-months), would consist of an assessment of the existing financial
position and future prospects of municipal entities in Port-au-Prince. This
would involve a review of the adequacy of the present revenue level relative
to its function, pricing policies of basic services, revenue collection
system and mechanism of transfers from the central Government. It would also
examine the future revenue needs of the municipalities, particularly those
related to operation and maintenance of capital work investment undertaken by
other public sector entities, identify additional revenue sources, and
provide concrete proposals to strengthen accounting and financial management
systems. The Government agreed to (a) submit the study to the Association
for its review and comments no later than June 30, 1986; (b) prepare a plan
of action based on the recouAmendations of such a study taking into account
comments of the Association no later than September 30, 1986; and (c) carry
out such plan of action no later than January 31, 1987.
Project Execution
3.11      EdH would be the beneficiary of 98% of the credit and would be
responsible for the implementation of the power components of the project.
The municipal finances study would be carried out by the Department of
Economy and Industry in the Ministry of Finance. Under existing credit
agreements, EdH undertakes to assure that at all times the central managerial
positions would be filled by competent and experienced persons whose
qualifications are satisfactory to the Association. As EdH still requires
technical support, services of qualified consultants would be contracted (140
man-months) to carry out detailed engineering, procurement and supervision of
the Carrefour extension and the distribution renovation. In addition, three
foreign experts would provide technical assistance (108 man-months) in the
operation and maintenance of the Varreux and Carrefour power plants and the
procurement of spare parts and maintenance equipment. A management
consultant (80 man-months) would continue to assist EdH in all financial and



- 13 -
administrative matters related to the project and to EdH's daily operations,
including the establishment of an energy data bank to monitor production,
sales, losses and fuel consumption. Other consultants would execute the
detailed engineering and bidding documents for the selected power plant in
the Artibonite river basin (200 man-months). During the execution of the
proposed project, the existing EdH Technical Coordinating Committee will
continue its function of coordinating activities on the various projects
financed by IDA, IDB, CIDA, KfW and CCCE.
Project Cost and FLnancin
3.12      The total cost of the power project, excluding interest during
"instruction, is estimated at US$33.8 million, of which US$30.5 (or 90%)
would be foreign exchange costs. The municipal finances study cost estimate
is US$0.5 million additional (85% foreign cost). With the exception of fuel,
EdH is exempt from duties and taxes. Cost estimates are based on December
1983 prices and were calculated on the basis of Edli's experience in similar
projects. Physical contingencies are 10%, and a price contingency has been
added, assuming the following inflation rates: local costs 1944 onwards: 10%;
foreign costs 1984: 3.5%; 1985: 8.0%; and 1986 onwards: 9.0%. Foreign
consulting services are estimated at US$10,rJO per man-month, and technical
assistance for power plant maintenance at US$9,200 per man-month, including
travel and other expenses (1983 prices).
3.13      The proposed IDA credit of US$22.1 million would finance the
foreign exchange cost of the following project components: (i) generation
improvement program, including spare parts, cooling and miscellaneous
auxiliary equipment for the Varreux, Carrefour and Peligre power plants; (ii)
distribution network renovation at Port-au-Prince; (iii) technical and
administrative consulting services for the execution of the project,
including technical assistance for the operation and maintenance of power
plants and for the final design of a new hydroelectric project in the
Artibonite river basin; and (iv) the total cost of the Port-au-Prince
municipal finances study. CCCE accepted to parallel finance FF 72.0 million
to import materials and services of French origin for the expansion of the
Carrefour power plant, including two diesel-electric groups and the related
step-up substation; two credits will be provided by CCCE, one for FF 48.0
million, for a period of 15 years including 5 years grace and 5% annual
interest, and another for FF 24.0 million for a period of 30 years including
10 years grace and i.nterests of 1.5% per annum during the grace period and 2%
for the rest of the period.  EdH would finance from its funds the local
component of the project (US$3.3 million).
3.14      During negotiations the Government agreed that the amount of SDR
20.8 million from proceeds of the credit would be on-lent by the Government
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement to EdH for a period of 20 years, including
4 years of grace, at an interest rate of 9.89 percent per annum. It has been
assumed that the interest during construction, estimated at US$3.7 million,
would be capitalized and added to the subsidiary loan. The foreign exchange
risk would he assumed by EdH. The execution and ratification of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement on behalf of the Borrower and EdH will be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed project.



- 14 -
3.15      Retroactive financing not exceeding US$0.8 million haB been
accepted for consulting services for the preparation of bidding doeuments for
the expansion of the Carrefour diesel plant, initiated in January 1984, and
for the technical assistance services for Varreux and Carrefour power plants,
to be initiated by January 1985.
Procurement an! Disbursement
3.16      Equipment and materials for the distribution network renovation and
consulting services for (a) the design of a new hydroelectric project in the
Artibonite river basin, (b> technical assistance services for power plant
operation and maintenance, and (c) the Port-au-Prince municipal finances
study, will be procured in accordance with the respective Bank Group
Guidelines of Procurement or for the Hiring of Consultants. EdH recently
awarded a civil works contract for the construction of the entire
Port-au-Prince distribution network renovation. However, the contract was
divided into two parts and the validity of the second part was conditional on
the Haitian Government obtaining the IDA credit for the Fourth Power
Project. The work to be performed under the first part of the contract
during the period 1984-85, estimated at US$3.0 million, is being financed
with proceeds of credit 1281-HA. Since the contract was awarded under
international competitive bidding with the approval of IDA, and considering
reasons of economy and efficient completion of the distribution renovation,
it was accepted that this contract be considered advance contracting, and the
work to be performed during the second period of the contract (period
1986-87, approximately US3.0 million) be financed with IDA funds of the
proposed credit.
3.17      Spare parts for the diesel-electric groups at Varreux, Carrefour
and Peligre, the cooling tower for Varreux and miscellaneous auxiliary
equipment would be purchased directly from the original manufacturers of the
equipment in Holland, Zrance and Italy. At the request of EdH, the
consulting services related to the Carrefour power plant expansion and
network rehabilitation may be provided by their present consultants,
Hydro-Quebec International (HQI) of Canada. Also at the request of EdH, the
services of their present administrative and financial consultant, Price
Waterhouse of Canada, would be extended to cover the proposed projest.
3.18      CCCE would f4nance the materials, equipment and civil works of
French origin for the expansion of the Carrefour power plant. EdH decided,
with the assistance of their consultant, HQI, and the approval of the
Government, to purchase directly the two additional groups and step-up
substation from Alsthom Atlantique of France, the same supplier for Units 1,
2 and 3. Two reasons led EdH to this decision with which IDA and CCCE
agreed: (i) Groups 1, 2 and 3 were purchased under ICB, and have been the
basis for negotiating Groups 4 and 5, resulting in reasonable prices, and
(ii) standardization of equipment would facilitate operation and maintenance
of the power plant and would lower the investment in the stock of spare
parts.
3.19      There are no local manufacturers in Haiti wbo would claim a bid
-naluation preference in the procurement of equipment and materials.



- 15 -
l3owever, local civil contractors would be given a preference of 7.5% for the
purpose of bid evaluation. All bidding packages over US$50,000 equivalent
would be subject to IDA's prior review of procurement documents. All1
requests for disbursements of funds wuld be fully documented. Disbursements
would be made for 10O/ of the foreign exchange cost for IDA-financed civil
works, equipment, materials, consulting services and training including
fellowships. Disbursement for municipal finances study would be made for
100% of total cost. Disbursements for contracts parallel finance4 by CCCE
would be made directly by that agency.
Economic Evaluation
3.20      The proposed project is an initegral part of Edli's least coBt
expansion program; it includes the required investment for the period 1986-87
for the Port-au-Prince area. Since it is difficult to allocate benefits to
each component of the project, an economic evaluation of the proposed project
was not done. Instead, the internal rate of return for EdHI's overall
investment program for the slice 1984-88 was computed as the discount rate
equalizing the present value of the stream of costs and benefits associated
with it. The cost stream, in 1983 constant prices, comprises the capital
cost of the development program and the incremental operation and maintenance
costs related to the incremental sales associated with the program. As a
proxy for benefits, the revenues derived from incremental sales were used,
assuming that tariffs would be adjusted as necessary to neet the financial
objectives proposed in this report. No economic evaluation was made
utilizing shadow prices or to reflect other benefits to society and the
economy of the country, such as those derived from improvement of quality of
service to customers and availability of energy for new industries. Vo
attempt was made to assess consumer surplus as the willingness to pay may
exceed the existing tariffs. On these assumptions, the Internal rate of
return for the program is 11% (see Annex 4). This rate is equal. to the
opportunity cost of capital in Haiti. A. sensitivity analysis shows the rate
of return to be very sensitive to changes in electricity tariffs and sales
and moderately sensitive to changes in capital costs and fuel costs.
Project Risks
3.21      Except for the possibility of delays in its implementation, the
project involves no unusual risks and has no adverse impact on the
environment; the risk of delays would be diminished by the hiring of
consultants to assist the limited number of EdH qualified engineers in
supervising project execution.

dates would be used to monitor progress during the execution period of the
project, which is expected to be completed by June 30, 1987.

Disbursement Schedule
4.04      The disbursement schedule shown in Annex 7 is based on a detailed
construction and implementation program prepared by EdH and the appraisal
mission, and is based on recent experience acquired from the execution of the
First, Second and Third Power Projects; it has been assumed that there would
be a delay of six months between the completion of the various stages of a
contract and the disbursement of funds, and that a period of twelve months
would elapse between the time of completion of a contract and its final
liquidation. The estimated disbursement schedule is similar to Bank's
standard profiles, with the exception that the disbursement period has been
shortened to 4.5 years to take into consideration existing experience in the
power sector in Haiti.Z/ Credit closing date is June 1989.
Environmental Aspects
4.05      As has been done in the past, the project would be executed with
due regard to the environment. Specifications for the power plant will limit
gas emissions and noise to acceptable levels for generating facilities. The
new distribution network will use the same right of way as the old one,
improving its appearance.
Project File
4.06      Reference is made to Annex 8 for the contents of the project file.
5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(i)   EdHI signed agreements with TELECO and Tele-Haiti in terms
satisfactory to the Association (para. 3.07).
(ii)  EdH started to implement a program to reduce energy losses to
acceptable levels (para. 3.07).
(iii) The Ministry of Finances agreed to settle the arrears for
electricity consumption by the public sector in terms satisfactory
to the Association and starring in FY 1984-85, to take all measures
necessary or advisable to ensure that current electricity bills are
paid promptly when due (para.2.13).
2/  IDA's profiles for all Latin American and the Caribbean countries show
total disbursement in 5.5 years, or 6 years for IDA-financed projects in
Haiti.  Disbursements for EdH's First Power Project were completed in 3
years, and estiaates for the Third Power Project are 4.5 years. However,
disbursements for the Second Power Project would be completed in only 5
years due to project execution delays.



- 19 -
(iv)   CCCE has officially accepted to parallel finance the project in the
amount of FF 72.0 million (para. 3.13);
(v)    EdH would continue to set tariffs adequate to assure rates of
return on revalued fixed assets of not less than 5% in FY85 and 86,
7% in FY87 and 8% in FY88. (para. 2.11);
(vi)   EdH agreed to an acceptable set of financial and efficiency targets
to improve its operations (Annex 1, para. 1.12).
(vii)  terms and conditions for the subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and. EdH (para. 3.14);
(viii) the Development Credit Agreement and Project Agreement for the
proposed project will repeat the main covenants of the Third Power
Project agreements related to the execution of the project,
management and operations of EdH and financial covenants (para.
2.08).
Conditions of Effectiveness
5.02      The following events were agreed as conditions of effectiveness:
(i) the execution and delivery of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
the Government and EdH (para. 3.14);
(ii) EdH and ODVA have entered into an agreement satisfactory to the
Association (para. 2.09).
5.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for an IDA credit of SDR 21.8 million, equivalent to US$22.1 million to the
Republic of Haiti, from which the amount of SDR 21.3 million would be on-lent
to EdH for a period of 20 years, including 4 years grace, at the annual
interest rate of standard Bank loans.

ANNEX I
HAITI
J41ECTRICITE D'HAlTI - EdH
FOURTH POWER. P!tOJECT
THE BENEFICIARY
Institutional Framework
1.01      The beneficiary of the proposed IDA credit for the Fourth Power
Project would be EdH, an autonomous government-owned agency, established by
presidential decree in 1971 as the sole entity in charge of generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity in the country. EdH began its
operations in 1571 by taking over the Government-owned Peligre hydroplant and
the privately owneai Compagnie d'Eclairage Electrique of Port-au-Prince and
Cap Haitiea; since then it has gradualLy taken control of all electric
service in the country.
1.02      The President of EdH is the President of the Republic, who
delegates authority on a permanent basis to the Minister of Public Works,
Communications and Transport who acts as the Chairman of the Board of
Directors. Other nembers of the Board are the Minister of Finance and
Industry, the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Planning, the Governor of
the Central Bank and EdH's General Manager.  Policy directives at EdH are set
by its President; the Board regulates and approves major investment plans,
tariffs, borrowings and broad policies.  The General Manager has a reasoadble
degree of autonomy to direct the company.
Organization and Management
1.03      EdH's current organization (Attachment 1) was the result of an
organizational study conducted in 1981 by the consultant, Price Waterhouse
(PW) of Canada, as part of IDA's Second Power Project and is considered
adequate for today's operation. EdH's General Manager is appointed by the
President of the Republic; the Technical, Planning and Administrative
Directors are also appointed by the President on the recommendation of the
Board. The presence of the consultant, PW, has contributed to the
improvement of accounting and administrative procedures. In the technical
departments, however, improvements have been more modest, partly because the
technical consultant, Hydro Quebec International (HQI), has not had the right
people to transfer technology, partly because of the lack of engineers and
technical personnel at EdH to act as counterparts to the foreign experts.
Employment
1.04      By September 1983, EdH employed 1,246 persons (about one employee
for every 70 consumers), of which 370 are in the Provinces. In general, EdH



- 21 -
continues tco lack enough qualified managerial, technical and adminiatrative
personnel, ai.4 the dependency on costly foreign consultants will continue for
several years until a number of young professionals graduated in Haiti have
been trained and have acquired enough experience to take over technical and
managerial responsibilities. EdH's search for Haitian professionals outside
of their own country has been unsuccessful. The total number of profession-
als with university degrees is 96 (or 8% of the total employees), of which 55
are engineers. Salaries are mDdest and average for the Haitian market.
EdHIs hiring of new personnel is guided by a Manpower Forecast made by the
consultant, HQI, which predicts 1,490 employees by 1988, or one employee for
every 98 consumers.
Training
1.05      EdH has a well organized  Centre de Formation et Perfectionnement
Professionnels" responsible for trainlng programs conducted in-house and
abroad.  The Center has a staff of five full time instructors and two secre-
taries.  EdH professionals also teach some courses and seminars, and special-
ized instructors are hired from local sources and abroad.  Part of the cost
of foreign training experts and facilities and overseas expenses of trainees
has been financed by IDA; other contributors are XfW and the Fonds d'Aide et
de Cooperation (FAC) of France.  In the last four years about 35
professionals have attended courses and seminars abroad, anid about 300
employees from the technical and administrative areas have attended local
short courses and seminars on varied subjects such as linemen techniques,
metering, welding, diesel operation and mechanics, hydro-plant operation,
fitting, first aid, accounting, administrative and control techniques, data
processing, secretarial techniques, alphabetization, etc.
1.06      Under the proposed Fourth Power Project, the Association would
continue its support to EdH's training efforts. Specifically, the project
includes the hiring of 108 man-months of expatriate technical experts to
operate and train on-the-job the supervisors, operators and maintenance
personnel for the medium speed diesel groups installed at Varreux and
Carrefour, and funds to cover the foreign cost of the 1986-87 training
program of EdR and fellowships abroad.
Accountirg and Auditing
1.07      With the introduction of computerized systems, accounting proced-
ures and reporting have improved substantially in 1983. As a result, monthly
financial statements are being issued within 60 days of closing dates. An
area that still needs improvemunt is the accounting of construction in pro-
gress; this will be addressed by the administrative consultant in the near
future. In accordance with covenants of Credit 1281-HA, EdH's assets are
revalued yearly using international indices approved by the Association.
This provision has been maintained in the proposed credit.
1.08      Since 1976, EdH's accounts have been audited by Price Waterhouse
Company of Puerto Rico, an independent auditing firm acceptable to the
Association. As in previous credits, EdH agreed to continue engaging



- 22 -
qualified external auditors to review yearly its accounts, and to send to the
Association audited financial statements, including the Auditor's
recommendations, within four months of the end of each fiscal year. Internal
auditing of EdH is adequate aud is carried out by a unit attached to the
General Manager.
Billing and Collectiun
1.09      Within the context of the Second Power Project (Credit 895-HA),
EdH, with the assistance of the consultant, PW, installed computer facilities
and a modern data processing system for customner billing and accounting. EdH
personnel adapted quickly to the new system which is working well. Billing
is made in Port-au-Prince for customers for the entire country, and bills are
distributed by carriers and by mail. When the billing system was
computerized, EdH discovered that about 6,000 customers, although being
billed, were not accounted for in the total of customers. That explains the
large increase in customers from 1982 to 1983 (1982: 75,000 consumers; 1983:
87,000. See Attachment 2).
EdH's Relations with other Agencies
1.10      At the time wf appraisal of the proposed project, the Government
did not meet a covenant of Credit Agreement 895-HA, Section 4.04, which
stipulates that Telecommunications d'Haiti S.A.M. (TELECO) and the television
company Tele-Haiti shall rehabilitate their respective networks at the same
time as EdH does its distribution system. During negotiations, evidence was
presented that this condition was met, as EdH signed agreements with both
institutions regulating the use of common elements such as distribution
poles; the agreements include provisions for the relocation of telephone and
television cables, payments due to EdH for the use of poles, engineering
standards to be used, provisions for the rehabilitation, operation and
maintenance of the network, etc.
1.11      In order to optimize the use of the waters of the Artibonite River
where Haiti's major power developments are or will be located, the Government
accepted the suggestion of IDA's previous supervision missions and of the
appraisal mission, that an agreement should be signed between EdH and
L'Organisme de Developpement de la Vallee d'Artibonite (ODVA), a regional
irrigation authority. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit, the Government would present a signed agreement between EdH and ODVA,
regulating the use of the waters of the Artibonite River for irrigation,
flood control and power purposes.
Performance Indicators and Reporting
1.12      The performance indicators shown in Attachment 2 have been
agreed with EdH as targets for improving its operational efficiency, and
substitute the targets agreed under Credit 1281-HA, some of which have not
been met. EdH also agreed to prepare and send to the Association quarterly
progress reports and other such reports as the Association may reasonably
request, including a project completion report.



- 23 -
Insurance
1.13      An external expert advised EdH in 1982 on the type of insurance and
risks coverage for their installations; as a result EdH updated their insur-
ance to cover all main installations, including warehouses and buildings,
against risks arising from fire, explosion, hurricanes, earthquakes, flood,
lightning, civil liabilities, and motor vehicle claims

THE POWER MARKET
Historical Data and Existing Power Facilities
1.01      Since the Peligre hydro station was completed in 1972, sales in the
Port-au-Prince area have grown at an average of 13% per year until 1983, but
decreased to 4.5% per year in the period 1980-83. This decrease is
attributed to the stagnant economic situation of the country, increase in
theft of electricity (para. 1.05) and in 1983, to power restrictions due to
an exceptionally dry year that limited EdH's capacity to meet the demand, and
a strong campaign displayed by EdH to recoup overdue electricity bills which
resulted in a disconnection of about 10% of EdE's customers. Sales in the
provinces, on the other hand, have grown steadily at the high average rate of
18.7% per year. The following table shows EdH's sales in both areas:

1.02      In October 1983, EdH had a total of 87,600 customers which
represent approximately 480,000 persons with electric service, or only 9
percent of the total population. In Port-au-Prince 43% of the population has
electric service, in the provinces only 3%. Attachment 1 shows details of
the distribution of electricity consumption among EdR's customers. An
indication of the poverty on the population is the high proportion of low



- 27 -
consumption customers: in October 1983, 31% of EdH's consumers were
classified under the "social rate" and consumed less than 30 kWh per wnrth,
and contributed to only 4% of the energy sales. These figures represent,
however, an improvement with respect to the 1981 situation when 43% consumers
were classified as "social rate". Because the minimum monthly charge is
US$3.79, this group barely covers amortization of the capital cost invested
to reach their neighborhoods (network, house connection and meter), Let alone
the cost of generating plants, fuel and maintenance costs. Therefore, a
large cross subsidy occurs from the larger consumers to the "social rate"
consumers located in the suburbs of Port-au-Prince (approximately 26%) and in
the provinces (49%).
1.03      As of October 1983, EdH had 146.6 MW of installed capacity
(Attachment 2), of which 120.4 MW serve the Port-au-Prince area, where the
maximum demand reached 61.3 MW in 1983. Despite the apparent large margin of
reserve, EdR could not meet the demand during April and May 1983 because the
Peligre hydro-plant (47 MW) was shut down as the reservoir was depleted due
to an exceptionally dry year, and because of initial difficulties experienced
with newly installed diesel electric groups at Varreux. The distributin of
capacity in the country and allocation of generation in FY83 are sbown below:

Captive Plant
1.04      There are no detailed records on the captive plant capacity
installed in the country which is estimated to be on the order of 40,000 kW,
all thermal type. The largest plants are owned by Ciment d'Haiti (14,475
kW), by Minoterie d'Haiti (5,575 kW), the lasco Sugar Mill (2,530 kW), Usine
Sucriere de Leogane (5,200 kW), LJsine Sucriere des Cayes and Usine Sucriere
du Nord. The rest are owned by isolated customers and by hotels, industries
and large homes who use them as emergency units in case of power cuts.
Energy Losses
1.05      Energy losses in the Port-au-Prince area have grown from 26.6% in
1978 to 32.2% in 1983 (see table in para. 1.01), and are due to technical
losses (about 16.0% in 1983) and theft (16.2%). Since losses are affecting
EdH's finances, IDA has continuously requested that EdH address the problem
through a strong campaign of theft suppression and reduction of technical
losses through distribution network renovation and system operations
improvement (i.e. power factor correction). To this effect, Edil established
a "Theft Suppression Comnittee", chaired by the General Manager and advised
by EdH's consultants (Price Vaterhouse and Hydro-Quebec International), but
their success has been limited because the poor condition of the distribution
network permits easy illegal connections; as work advances on the distribu-
tion renovation being financed by the Association, losses will begin
gradually to decrease, i.e., losses for FY84 have already been reduced to
.29%.
1.06      The renovation of the networks made by EdH in important towns in
the provinces (i.e. Cap Haitian, Gonaive) has helped to reduce losses from
26.4% in 1978 to 15.1Y in 1983. EdH is confident that similar success will
occur in Port-au-Prince.  The energy loss targets agreed with EdH under the
Third Power Project have not been met 'in 1983 losses should have been 25% in
Port-au-Prince); new targets agreed with EdH are 25% in FY 1985, 22% in FY
1986, 19% in FY 1987 and 17% in FY 1988 as an average for the entire EdH
system.
Forecasts
1.07      The general consultants to EdH (IIQI) forecasted future energy sales
and requirements using a model that considers both econometric and macro-
economic inputs related to historical and projected data for consumption and
economic growth. Several scenarios were considered, and the one recommended
by the consultant assumes a GNP growth of 1.0% in 1983, 2.2% in 1984 and 3%
thereafter, and that population growth and immigration to Port-au-Prince will
be 4.5% until 1985 and 4.1% thereafter. It also assumes that energy
technical losses and thefts will gradually decrease to 15% in 1990, and that
75% of suppressed theft would be transfered to legal sales as the situation
is corrected. The model shows that sales would grow in Port-au-Prince at a
rate of 12.1% from 1983 to 1988 and 10.2% from 1988 to 1993. The transfer of
thefts to sales accounts for about 0.6% of the rate of growth. If losses
decrease as predicted, generation would grow at only 8.7% per year during the
1983-93 period. For the provinces, sales and generation growth is forecast
at 9.2% for the 1983-93 period.



- 29 -
1.08      Although the resulting rates of growth for energy sales in Port-au-
Prince are higher than the historical rates achieved during the last three
years (para. 1.01), the appraisal mission and EdH agreed to use the
consultant's forecast for equipment planning purposes (see Attachments 3 and
4). However, for financial projection purposes, the mission and PdH
developed a more conservative sales forecast (see Attachment 5) which
considers an average growth of 9.0% for the 1983-88 period, starting with a
growth of 7% in 1984.
Generation LPnsion Program
1.09      The consultant HQI executed a detailed system expansion study and
compared several generation expansion alternatives in order to recommend the
least cot;t solution to meet the forecaseed e.ectricity demand for Port-au-
Prince. A mathematical model was used to simulate EdH's system using the
following criteria:
(a)  The average and firl energy from existing and proposed
hydroelectric projects were determined based on 25-year recorded
wiver flows, extrapolated to the end of the period being
considered.
(b) The capacity margin was determined to maintain the loss of load
probability (LOLP) within two days per year in the critical month
(April); the program  takes into account equipment reliability and
maintenance, and hydroelectric generation constraints in seasonal
and cyclical dry periods.
[c) Monthly simulations were made to evaluate the ability of the power
plants to meet the demand in average and dry year conditions.
(d)  Sconomic comparisons were made for the altern.atives considered,
determining their present worth of investment and operating costs.
1.10      A total of 12 basic alternatives were considered, combining in
various arrangements and tixming the following projects:
(a)  Guayamouc Hydroelectric Project, 22 MW, 85 GWh;
(b)  La Chapelle Hydroelectric Project, Alternative I with 34 MW, 166
GWh and Alternative 1I with 56.6 MK and 281 GWh;
(c)  Medium Speed Diesel Groups rated 2.2 MW, or 7.8 MW, or 15.0 MW;
(d)  Low Speed Diesel Groups rated 7.8 MS, or 10.0 MS, or 15.0 MW;
(e)  Steam Power Plants with 20.0 MW units, either coal fired or
fuel-oil fired;
(f)  Combined Cycle plants rated 20.0 MW.



- 30 -
1.11      Fuel costs were determined assuming the international 1983 price of
crude oil of US$29.0 per barrel remaining constant in real terms during the
period of the study, with sensitivity analysis for price increases of 2% and
3% per year in real terms. The present value of the various alternatives
were compared using a discount rate of 12%, with sensitivity analysis for
rates of 2% above and below that rate. The proposed expansion program for
the Port-au-Prince area is the following:

that year is due to additional water regulation at Guayamouc.

HAITI
ELECTRICITE D'HAITI (EDH)-
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Earnings
1.01      Prior to 1975, EdH's financial performance was weak, mostly because
of inadequate tariffs and high energy losses. Hlowever, as a consequence of
IDA's involvement in the sector, EdH's finances improved gradually in the
period 1975-82. Sales growth increased at an average 13% per year over the
period but declined to about 7% in the period FY80 to FY82. Rates of return
on average revalued assets in operation for the latter period were in the
range of 5.7% and although somewhat lower than the covenanted rates of 8%,
were adequate to meet EdR's cash requirements.
1.02      Financial conditions deteriorated sharply in F"83 (Attachment 1).
This situation resulted from a combiniation of low hydro generation because of
an extremely dry season, the failure of thermal generating units at Varreux
partly compensated by EdH by hiring portable thermal units from outside
Haiti, and the lower demand of electricity due to economic recession. Growth
of sales in FY83 was about 4%, although this could have been 6% without the
rationing that took place because of the dry season. The rate of return for
this year was close to zero.
Present Financial Position
1.03      EdH's financial position as of September 30, 1983 (es-' of FY83) was
adequate. The debt/equity ratio was 40/60 and the current ratio 2.1 times.
However, the amount of MUS$6.9 due by the Government for unpaid electricity
consumption was a matter for concern, and caused EdH liquidity problems
(para. 1.05). EdH's balance sheet as of September 30, 1983 is summarized
below (see Attachment 3):

1.04      The Government is EdH's main creditor as all the financing from
international development organizations, as well as the official aid, is
received by the Government and on-lent to EdH. As of September 30, 1983, the
sources of credit and loans received by EdH were as follows: IDA and EEC,
MUS$39.5 (57%); KfW, MUS$16.0 (23%); CIDA, MUS$7.4 (11%), and CCCE and
others, MUS$6.7 (9%).
1.05      The Ministry of Finances signed an agreement, in terms acceptable
to the Association, under which the Government (a) will settle its arrears
(US$6.1 million at the end of FY84) in lump sum payments in FY85, 86 and 87
and (b) will pay on time current electricity bills, including public
lighting, starting in October 1984, the first month of FY85.
1.06      With the assistance of Consultants (SOFRELEC of France), EdH
implemented in 1976 a new tariff structure based on the principle of marginal
costing. As part of the Third Project, EdH's consultant, HQI, prepared a new
tariff study based on the same principle confirming that the present tariff
structure is adequate and suggested some minor changes which were introduced
by EdH in FY84. The tariff includes a fuel surcharge adjusted quarterly and
incorporated into the basic tariff at the end of the fiscal year (see present
tariff in Attachment 8). The average tariff for FY83 was US cents 12.8 per
kWh, and it has been projected to grow at an annual rate of 10% during the
period 1984-88, or the same rate assumed for local inflation and in line with
what EdH has achieved in recent years. The projected annual average tariffs
are about equal to the long-run marginal cost estimated by the consultant,
HQI. At the beginning of FY84, after incorporation of the fuel surcharge
into the basic tariff, the average tariff reached US cents 14.0 per kWh,
which is close to the average tariff needed to meet financial requirements in
that year (US cents 14.2 per kWh), therefore only minor adjustments were
required in that year.
Future Financing
1.07      The financial forecast for the period 1984-88 (Annex 2, Attachment
5; Annex 3, Attachments 1, 2 and 3) shows that EdH's financial performance is
expected to be satisfactory through FY88, assuming the following: (a) annual
tariff increases of 10% in nominal terms, (b) sales would gradually increase
from 7% per year in FY84 to llZ in FY88, as the present economic recession
improves, and (c) operating costs would increase at 18% average per year,
which is considered reasonable (see footnotes of Attachment 1). The rate of
return would range between 5.2% in FY84 to 8% in FY88, the debt/equity ratio
would reach a maximum of 48/52 in the latter year and the debt-service

coverage would have a minimum of 2.2 times in the period, permitting EdH to
carry out its investment program without strain. During negotiations, the
Govesnment and EdH agreed to maintain adequate tariffs to enable EdH to have
a rate of return on the average current value of fixed assets in operation of
not less than 5% until FY86, 7% in FY87 and not less than 8% in FY88. These
rates of return would be sufficient for EdH to meet its cash requirements for
the 1984-88 period. The rates for the first three years are similar to the
ones reached in recent years; higher rates of return are required in the last
two years of the period considered because of the increasing amountB of debt
service and the need of self-financing the local funds of the proposed
investment program.
1.08      Because EdH's loan agreements have generally long grace and
amortization periods, at present the debt service is relatively low.
However, borrowings and debt-service will increase steadily during the period
1984-88, long-term debt will reach MUS$225 at the end of FY88, compared with
MUS$70 in FY83. Debt/equity ratio would be 48:52 in FY88 compared with 37:63
in FY83. To provide the Association with the opportunity to review the terms
of any future borrowings, the provision under Credits 1281-HA that EdH would
not incur any long-term debt without the Association's agreement, unless its
gross internal cash generation covers its maximum future debt service at
least 1.5 times, have been repeated under the proposed credit, amended to
establish that thie ratio should be calculated using reasonable internal cash
generation forecast rather than historical data. Similarly, the covenant
which limits EdH's short-term debt to one-sixth of annual cash operating,
maintenance and administrative expenses have also been maintained.
1.09      To ensure an orderly financing process and that only technically,
economically and financially sound projects are undertaken in the power
sector, EdH agreed, as under Credit 1281-HA: (a) not to undertake any major
expansion project (defined as in excess of 1% of current net fixed assets in
operation) other than those that have been reviewed by the Association during
this appraisal unless it has furnished to the Association satisfactory
evidence that such projects are economically justified and that it will have
adequate financial, technical and managerial resources to carry them out; and
(b) to limit the amount of unbudgeted village electrification to an aggregate
anrnual amount not to exceed 0.2% of current net fixed assets in operation.
1.10      It is essential that EdH devote all its financial resources to the
development of the sector if it is to self-finance a satisfactory proportion
of its investment program. The current provision under Credit 1281-EIA that
EdH's resources be devoted exclusively to its construction program, the
payment of its debt service and to its operation, have been maintained under
the proposed credit. Moreover, because EdH expects to have some temporary
cash surplusses beginning FY86 through FY88, the provision under Credit
1281-HA that the Government authorize EdH to maintain its liquid funds in
interest-bearing accounts or in interest-bearing investments, not exceeding
SiX months maturity, has been repeated in the proposed credit.

Investment and Financing Plan
1.11      EdH's 1984-88 investment program, including interest during
construction, requirements for working capital and other applications,
amounts to MUS$264.7 of which MUS$33.8 or 12.8% corresponds to the proposed
Fourth Power Project.  The ongoing works amount to M4US$44.1 (17%) and
include the following: (a) the renovation of the distribution system,
transmission lines and substations in Port-au-Prince; (b) construction of
Carrefour 23 MW diesel plant; (c) construction of a new head office; (d)
execution of a feasibility study of Guayamouc hydroelectric project; (e)
construction of the Jacmel and Caracol hydroelectric projects; and (f)
routine investments which include line extensions, rural electrification
projects, equipment acquisition, minor plant improvements, etc. Other future
projects amount to MUS$157.3 (59%) and include a low-speed diesel power plant
and the Guayamouc hydroelectric project and initial investments for a
coal-fired steam power plant and the new La Chapelle hydroelectric project.
Interest during construction is estimated at 14US$21.0 or 8%. The increase in
working r-- ;al requirements, which includes the acquisition of spare parts
.:aeration improvement program, amounts to MUS$16.8 or 6%.  The
1.... s     program and financing plan  .e summnarized below and are showa in
detail in Attachments 2 and 4.
1.12      EdH's net internal cash generation would finance MUS$71.8 or 27% of
the total requirements of the 1984-88 program; Government capital
contribution would fund MUS$9.8 or 4% of the totai. and would consist of the
greater part of interest charges paid by EdH on tne on-lent proceeds of CIDA
and KfW loans, and the contribution of MUS$1.8 for the repair of the Peligre
hydroelectric power plant; the remaining 69% would be covered by loans
amounting to MUS$183.3. Of this figure, MUS$31.6 comes from undisbursed
proceeds of existing loans, US$3r.5 from the proposed IDA credit and CCCE
loans and US$102.3 from future. unidentified loans that would come from
international financing institutions and official aid. Finally, US$18.9
million represents the financing of interest during construction.

1.13      EdI's proposed financing plan for 1984-88 is reasonable.  EdH would
generate sufficient internal cash which, together with planned borrowings and
Government contribution, would enable timely carrying out of the proposed
project. The financing plan for the proposed project assumes a total credit
of MUS$30.5 to cover its foreign component, to be financed by a credit from
IDA in an amount of MUS$21.6, and b- tLWo CCCE loans amounting to an
equivalent of MUS$8.9.
1.14      From the proposed IDA credit of US$22.1 million, the Govennnt
will on-lend to EdH US$21.6 million at 9.89% for a period of 20 years with a
grace period of 4 years. During the grace period, interest during
construction would be capitalized. A subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to
IDA would be signed as a conclition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
EdH will bear the foreign exchange risk. Two loans totalling US$8.9 from
CCCE have been considered. Terms and conditions assumed bor financial
projections for tixese loans and for other future loans are shown in
Attachment 7.

Notes:
a/ Capital Cost
See "Investment Program", Attachesent 4 to Annex 3.  During this period, EdH would invest 89% of the total cost of the
22 MW Guayamouc hydroelectric project for operation early in 1990, and 100l   of the coat of the new 20 MW slow diesel
power plant for operation in 19C3-89.
bl Operattion and Mdaintence Costs
Incremental 0 & K costs with respect to the 1984 operation; see 'Forecast Income Statement", Attachment 1 to Annex 3:
0 & H costs were converted to 1983 constant prices, using deflactors.  0 & M costs related to the slow speed    diesel
power plant and Guayamouc hydroelectric plant are also included.
c/  Fuel Coots
Incremental fuel costs with respect to 1984 operation, including fuel costs related to the operation of the slow speed
diesel power plant. See 'Fuel Cost Forecast", Attachment 9 to Annex 3: these costs were re-calculated using the
following fuel prices, expressed in 1983 constant dollars:

,uayamouc; 89%); the last year conssidered is 1991, as from thio year both power plants will be fully loaded.
e/ Average Rate
Averagetasrlffs have been assumed to increase at a rate of 10% in current terms during the 1983-1991 period.  These
tariffs were deflated to 1983 prices, using deflactors which assumed that the influence of local costs in the cost of
electricity generation is about 30% and 70% the influence of foreign costs. The resulting tariffe ahow an increase of
2.3% per year in real terms.
