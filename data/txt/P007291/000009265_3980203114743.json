Port-au-Prince with two diesel-electric units.  The project\n            will further include: (ii) the implementation of a program\n            to improve the generation capacity of the three existing\n            power plants; (iii) the completion of the rehabilitation of\n            the distribution network at Port-au-Prince; and (iv) the\n            preparation of detailed engineering designs for a\n            hydroelectric project in the Artibonite river basin.\n            Finally, the project involves:  (v) the provision of\n            consulting services for the management and operation of EdH,\n            as well as project implementation and operation; (vi) the\n            provision of a training program including fellowships; and\n            (vii) the provision of consulting services for the municipal\n            finance study of the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area."}, "docdt": "1984-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
