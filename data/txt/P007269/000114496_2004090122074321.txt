Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement entered into between the Co-operative Republic of Guyana

amended. 
 
I
am pleased to inform you of our agreement to amend said Development Credit Agreement as follows: 
 
1. 
Section 3.09 is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: 
 
“Section 3.09. Except as the Association shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall, and shall cause the 
Procuring Entities to carry out all public procurement of goods, services and works in the Borrower’s territory 
(independently of the procurement of goods, works and consultants’ services to be financed out of the proceeds 
of the Credit which shall be governed by the provisions of  Schedule 3 to this Agreement as provided in Section 
3.02 of this Agreement) in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 5 to this Agreement until the date upon 
which an amendment (acceptable to the Association) of the Procurement Act of 2002 has been enacted.” 
 
This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall be an original. Upon receipt by 
the Association of one fully executed original of this amendment letter, this amendment will be effective as of 
the date first above written. Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating 
the two counterparts of this amendment letter.  
 
Sincerely,
