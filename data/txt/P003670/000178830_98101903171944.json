Additional student places will\n            be created in eight new vocational industrial schools; a\n            further eight vocational agricultural schools will be\n            equipped to allow industrial courses to be offered. An\n            existing junior college of technology at Kaohsiung will be\n            expanded and a similar institution set up at Taipei.
