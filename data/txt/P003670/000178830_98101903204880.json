Additional student places will\n            be created in eight new vocational industrial schools; a\n            further eight vocational agricultural schools will be\n            equipped to allow industrial courses to be offered. An\n            existing junior college of technology at Kaohsiung will be\n            expanded and a similar institution set up at Taipei. The\n            project also includes facilities to accommodate a\n            substantial increase in enrollment in the National Taiwan\n            Normal University's Development of Education and\n            College of Science; the latter will be relocated at larger\n            and better equipped premises.
