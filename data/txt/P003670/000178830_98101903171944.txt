REPORT AND RECOKMFENDATTON OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA FOR AN
EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to U.S.$9.0 million
to the Republic of China.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In 1968 a Bank economic mission to China emphasized the need
for increased investment in technical and vocational education to help
sustain rapid industrial development.  A UNESCO project preparation
mission visited China in May 1969; the following August the Government
applied for a Bank loan to assist in the development of vocational
education and the project was appraised in September and October 1969.
3.        Negotiations were held in Washington from April 22 to 29, 1970.
The Government was represented by Mr. T.Y. Sun, Vice Minister of Education,
Dlr. S.C. Yoh, Adviser, Ministry of Education, 1Mr. Martin Wong, Mr. T.W. Hu,
and Mr. N.W. Chang, the Economic Minister, the Economic Attache and the
Cultural Attache, respectively, at the Chinese Embassy.
4.        The proposed loan would be the Bank Group's first lending
operation in China for education. The following is a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits to China as at April 30, 1970:

Corporation and one of $44.5 million to the Taiwan Power Company, approved
on April 7, 1970 and April 21, 1970, respectively, were signed on Flay 16,
1970.
6.        Disbursement difficulties have been experienced with regard to
three loans in China: the first and second railway loans (409 CHA and
524 CHA) and the telecommunications loan (506 CHA). Details were
described in the report and recommendation of the President on the
Second Power Project (P-792 dated April 7, 1970) which was approved on
April 21, 1970.
7.        The Bank is currently considering a railway project and a
sewerage project for which the Government has requested assistance.

8.        China became a member of the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) in January 1969. IFC is presently considering assistance for two
projects in China which should be ready for presentation to its Board
shortly. The first is the expansion of the Asia Cement Corporation's
cement plant capacity to 1.7 million tons per year. The second project
consists of a new polyester fiber plant belonging to the Far Eastern
Textile Group with an initial capacity of about 7,500 metric tons per
year.
PART III - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN

Beneficiaries:       The Republic of China, The Taiwan
Provincial Government and the
Municipality of Taipei
Amount:               U.S. $9.0 million
Purpose:             To help the development of technical
education and vocational training.
Amortization:        In 25 years, including a ten-year period

PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of an Educational
Project in China" (PE-15a, dated May 15, 1970) on the proposed project
is attached.
11.       China's education system is well developed and has produced a
literacy rate of about 90%.  The rapid growth of education has, however,
not been closely geared to the specific needs for qualified manpower in
the various sectors of the econoiny, especially industry and fisheries.
12.       The Government plans to fill the shortage of qualified tech-
nical personnel and instructors by improving the quality of, and
improving the facilities for, vocational education at all levels and by
improving the teaching of science and industrial subjects in secondary
schools. Public expenditure on education is to be raised from NT$6,100
million ($152 million) in 1968/69 to NT$7,200 million ($180 million) in
1971/72 and to NT$9,600 million ($240 million) in 1974.
13.       The proposed project aims at the expansion and modernization
of education facilities at the vocational secondary school and junior
college levels, together with the imiprovement and enlargement of the
training of teachers specializing in science, industrial arts and voca-
tional subjects.  Additional student places wrill be created in eight
new vocatLonal industrial schools; a further eight vocational agri-
cultural schools will be equipped to allow industrial courses to be
offered. An existing junior college of technology at Kaohsiung will be
expanded and a similar institution set up at Taipei. The project also
includes facilities to accommuodate a substantial increase in enrollment
at the National Taiwan Normal University's Depart.nent of Education and
Oollege of Science;  the latter will be relocated at larger and better
equipped premises. The project will take about three and a half years
to implement. Upon completion it will contribute about 305~ of China's
annual requireimient of vocationally educated people for industry and
nearly 27% of the teachers of industrial arts, science and vocational
subjects needed yearly.
14.       The Government asked the Bank, at an early stage of this
project's processing, to consider financing fishery training and instruc-
tional television facilities. The Bank's experience with the two deep-
sea fishery projects it has financed in China (Credit 17 CHA and Loan
498 CHA) indicated that the first item deserved to be given high priority.
The shortage of classroom space and teachers in China made the develop-
ment of instructional television appear promising. These items were,
however, found to be insufficiently prepared for appraisal. Part of the
proceeds of the proposed loan are to be used to complete the preparation
of fishery training and instructional television schemes which, in due
course, could be considered for Bank financing.



15.       The responsibility for the implementation of the proposed
project will lie with a project unit to be set up in the Ministry of
Education. This unit will include a qualified architect and an educa-
tional advisor whose services, amounting to five man-years equivalent,
will be paid out of the proceeds of the proposed loan. The establish-
ment of the unit and the appointment of suitable staff for it is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
16.       The lack of planning has hampered systematic development of
China's educational system. Changes have frequently been made on an
ad hoc basis without sufficient regard being given to the specific
requirements of the labor market. To help alleviate this deficiency a
planning unit is to be established within the Ministry of Education.
The services of an educational planner and an educational specialist to
assist this unit, amounting to three man-years equivalent, will be paid
for from the proceeds of the proposed loan. The Government has under-
taken to set up this unit within three months of the proposed loan being
declared effective.
17.       The proposed project will benefit educational institutions
falling under the jurisdiction of the National Government, the Province
of Taiwan and the Municipality of Taipei. The Provincial and Municipal
Governments will receive their portion of the loan proceeds, amounting
to $4.4 million and $1.4 million respectively, from the National Govern-
ment on the same terms and conditions the latter obtains from the Bank.
18.       The total estimated cost of the proposed project is $15.0
million. The Bank loan will cover the foreign exchange component which
is expected to amount to $9.0 million or 60% of the total cost. Con-
tracts under the project will be let on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding. It is expected that construction contracts will be
won by Chinese firms since the local industry is competent and fairly
competitive. Chinese firms are also expected to bid for part of the
furniture and equipment to be procured; local manufacturers will be
allowed a margin of preference of 15% or the prevailing rate of customs
duty, whichever is lower. The Bank loan would cover 20% of the cost
of construction contracts and 50% of the contracts for locally manufac-
tured furniture and equipment, equivalent to their estimated foreign cur-
rency component. It is estimated that the foreign currency component of
contracts likely to be won by local firms will be $500,000 and $1,000,000
respectively. In the event that foreign firms win more of the contracts
than expected, the Government will make up the shortfall in the foreign
exchange required. Conversely, if local firms are awarded more contracts
than expected, there should be savings on the Bank loan.
19.       The proposed project is of high priority and urgently needed
if China is to have the skilled manpower needed for continued industrial



- 6 -
development. The Ministry of Education, with the help of consultants
provided under the proposed loan, should be capable of efficient project
implementation.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of China and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
21.       The draft Loan Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern
of other loan agreements for education projects. Effectiveness of the
Loan Agreement would be subject to the conditions that the Borrower:
(a) enter into satisfactory agreements with the Province of Taiwan and
the Municipality of Taipei for relending a part of the loan; (b) es-
tablish a project unit in the Ministry of Education under specified
terms and conditions; and (c) select a satisfactory site, and acquire
the necessary property rights, for a junior college of technology in
Taipei (Section 7.01).
PART V - THE ECONOMY
22.       A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
the Republic of China" (AS-142a), dated September 11, 1968, was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors on September 17, 1968. An economic
mission visited Taiwan in March/April 1970 and its report will be com-
pleted in July. A statement summarizing recent economic developments was
distributed to the Executive Directors on April 28, 1970 (SecM70-189).
A tabulation of recent economic data is attached hereto (Annex A).
23.       The economy of China continues to grow at high rates.   GNP in
real terms increased by slightly over 10% a year in 1967 and 1968.
Mainly because of the damage caused by two typhoons, the 1969 GNP growth
rate was lower, but at 8.7% it still ranks high in terms of international
comparison and is well above the planned figure of 7%.
24.       Rapid industrialization is a major reason for the fast economic
growth. Manufacturing output increased by 23% in 1968 and by 18% in
1969, when it reached almost one-fourth of the total domestic product and
for the first time exceeded agricultural output. The rapid growth of
industries has led to a shift of labor from rural into urban areas.
About 55% of Taiwan's total population is now living in urban communities
of over 50,000 persons. In recent years, employment in the non-agricultural
sector has increased at an annual rate of about 9%.



- 7 -
25.       There is a shortage of craftsmen, technicians and other skilled
workers. The existing education system and training facilities are in-
adequate to meet present and future technical manpower requirements of
industry. The Fifth Four-Year Plan (1969-72) provides for substantial
investments in economic infrastructure, including education. Free
schooling has been extended from six to nine years, greater emphasis
will be placed on science research and education and technical training
facilities will be expanded and improved. The Government's program
would meet the most pressing needs and prevent a serious shortage of
trained manpower.
26.       Official foreign exchange reserves stood at $477 million at
the end of 1969, equivalent to four months' imports. Total external
debt outstanding at the end of 1969 was about U.S. $720 million, of which
60% from official sources and 40% private loans. The debt service ratio
in 1969 was about 6% of exports of goods and services. Taking into
account relatively less favorable terms of future foreign borrowings,
further foreign capital inflows are expected to increase the debt ser-
vice ratio to about 10% by the mid-1970's. Given the past record of
progress and favorable prospects for future growth, the Republic of
China is considered creditworthy for the proposed Bank loan.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
