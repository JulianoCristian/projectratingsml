This additional grant will support the completion\n            of the ongoing part A: the Asmara component of the project\n            to rehabilitate the distribution system in the city in view\n            of cost overruns arising from higher unit costs of\n            electrical materials.

Overhaul has been postponed as the cost of the\n            replacement parts could not be funded from European Economic\n            Community (EEC's) capital expenditure program. While\n            well operated power companies finance the rehabilitation of\n            their generation plants from internal funds, EEC cannot\n            presently do so as its revenues have been insufficient to\n            meet its operating expenses since 2006 when international\n            fuel prices began to raise. If oil prices had remained at\n            their pre 2006 levels, EEC would have been able to carry out\n            the rehabilitation from its internal resources."}, "docdt": "2008-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
