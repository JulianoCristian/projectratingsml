(ii) improve\n            the quality and adequacy of the electricity supply; and\n            (iii) regulatory and institutional reforms in the sector to\n            increase efficiency. The Borrower requested additional\n            financing for the project on November 11, 2007. Project\n            restructuring and additional financing was approved on June\n            26, 2008. An amended and restated financing agreement was\n            prepared that inter alia sought to extend the closing date\n            of the original grant until June 30, 2010. Although the\n            amended and restated financing agreement and related project\n            agreements were signed on August 21, 2008, conditions of\n            effectiveness were not met and the additional grant was\n            withdrawn. As a consequence, the extension of the grant\n            closing date did not occur. Following the withdrawal of the\n            additional grant, the legal documents signed on September\n            22, 2004, with respect to the original grant should have\n            been amended to extend the closing date of the original\n            grant to June 30, 2010, to allow for completion of\n            activities. The retroactive extension of the closing date of\n            the grant is necessary as otherwise the recipient will be\n            required to refund the association the funds disbursed\n            against the original grant from July 1, 2009 to date."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
