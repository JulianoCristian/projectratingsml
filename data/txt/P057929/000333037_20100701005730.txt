ERITREA -- ERITREA POWER DISTRIBUTION AND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.     The closing date for Eritrea, Power Distribution and Rural Electrification
Project, Grant No H114-ER, P057929 will be extended from June 30, 2009 until June 30,
2010.

2.     The Eritrea Power Distribution and Rural Electrification Project for an amount of
SDR 34.5 million (comprising SDR 20.0 million Credit and SRD 14.5 million Grant) was
signed on September 22, 2004 and became effective on December 20, 2004. The
Borrower requested and the World Bank agreed on December 12, 2007, to extend the
closing date of the Original Credit to June 30, 2010

3.     The project's implementation progress and project development outcomes are
both Unsatisfactory. The project's rural electrification component has been completed.
The project's main component is for rehabilitation of the electricity network in Asmara
city. The failure of the turnkey contract for design, supply and installation of works in
this component is the main reason for the project's unsatisfactory ratings.

4.     The Borrower requested additional financing for the project on November 11,
2007. Project restructuring and additional financing was approved on June 26, 2008. An
Amended and Restated Financing Agreement was prepared that inter alia sought to
extend the closing date of the Original Grant until June 30, 2010. Although the Amended
and Restated Financing Agreement and related Project Agreements were signed on
August 21, 2008, conditions of effectiveness were not met and the Additional Grant was
withdrawn. As a consequence, the extension of the Grant closing date did not occur.

5.       Following the withdrawal of the Additional Grant, the legal documents signed on
September 22, 2004, with respect to the Original Grant should have been amended to
extend the closing date of the Original Grant to June 30, 2010, to allow for completion of
activities. The proposed retroactive extension of the closing date of the Grant is
necessary as otherwise the Recipient will be required to refund the Association the funds
disbursed against the Original Grant from July 1, 2009 to date.

6.      The implementing entities are compliant with the World Bank's financial
management requirements and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial
reports from these entities.
