MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
- 1.        I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the Lao People's Democratic
Republic (Lao PDR) for SDR 21.8 million (US$30 million equivalent) to help
finance a Second Highway Improvement Project. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years.
2.          Backcqround.  The transport system in Lao PDR is still rudimentary.
Road transport is by far the dominant mode, carrying most freight and passengers.
Almost all external trade goes by road from Vientiane to Bangkok via Thailand or
to the port of Da Nang in Viet Nam via National Roads (NR) 13 and 9. NR 13, the
main north-south artery in Lao PDR, is also important to internal transport and
communications as it links the mountainous, less developed north to Vientiane and
to the agriculturally-rich southern part of the country. At present, the road
is in very poor condition and not passable during the five-month rainy season,
when traffic must be diverted to the Mekong River.
3.          The condition of roads throughout Lao PDR is extremely poor.  Many
roads were constructed more than 50 years ago and have received virtually no
maintenance for the past 30 years. A large number of key road sections are
consequently impassable during the rainy season and so degraded that normal
maintenance is no longer economic. Maintenance in Lao PDR up to very recently
has been confined to reconstruction; no routine maintenance system yet exists.
The government budget has only recently begun to distinguish between capital
investments and recurrent maintenance expenditures, and while a maintenance unit
was recently created in the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and
Construction (MCTPC), the unit is understaffed, lacks transport and equipment,
and is still oriented toward rehabilitation.   MCTPC's roads budget in 1993
totaled about KN35.8 billion, of which only KNO.9 billion from the local budget
was allocated for maintenance. This is inadequate, even for the limited network
now in a maintainable state. Under a recently completed Hiqhway Maintenance Study
carried out as part of the ongoing Highway Improvement rroject, a maintenance
program has been defined in light of the network currently being upgraded, and
a program of spot improvements over about 2,000 k.m has been identified to help
keep Qtherwise impassable roads open. Increased revenues for maintenance will be
derived by selective increases in road user charges, which are in some cases now
comparatively low and lead to distortions in vehicle' use. Annual reviews of
maintenance budgets and funding sources will- help ensure that program objectives
are maintained.
4.      Recognizing the need for a sector strategy and a prioritized program of
investments in transport, the Government, with the assistance of IDA and the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), undertook a National Transport Study
(NTS) to assist it in: determining priority i vestment needs; defining a detailed
investment, operation and maintenance program for 1991-95; formulating an outline
development program for 1996-2000;  fortulating efficient sector policies;  and



-2-
identifying projects for possible foreign financing. The Study, carried out by
consultants,  was completed in 1990.   The strategy outlined in the study
recommended continued focus on road development, particularly the restoration of
NR 13, rehabilitation and construction of rural access roads in agricultural
areas, and improvement of maintenance capabilities. The recommendations have
been incorporated into the GovernmentIs Public Investment Program and have served
as a basis for IDA activities in the sector.
5,      Following completion of the National Transport Study, the MCTPC team
which had been assembled to collect and review the study data was formalized into
a transport planning unit (TPU) within the Ministry. Technical assistance under
the Highway Improvement Project (Credit 2218-LA) is being provided to assist the
TPU in its work program and will be extended under the proposed project.
6.      Lessons Learned from Previous Projects.  The experience learned from the
two ongoing projects in the highway sub-sector is that the very limiited
availability of huiman capital places a great strain on project implementation and
that for several years to come, Government will depend on technical assistance
for both implementation and quality control. Also, of critical importance to
project implementation is the timely availability of local budget inputs without
wh_Zch projects will slip. The proposed project incl des a substantial increase
in technical assistance designed to improve the effectiveness of the implementing
agency.   Local budgets for routine maintenance,  which is financed by the
Borrower, will be reviewed annually in consultation with the Association.
7.      Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would support a key subsector
goal in the Government's development strategy -- that is, to increase the
efficiency of the country's road network through specific road improvements and
through strengthening of institutional capabilities to plan, manage and maintain
the national highway network.   In addition, the project would support the
development of local contracting capacity through the commercialization of
selected state enterprises.
8.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.   The IDA Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Lao PDR, presented to the Board in October 1992, highlighted the need
to support sustainable growth, alleviate poverty and assist in development of
physical capital needed to expand production and exports. Specifically, in the
transport sector, the strategy focuses on: (a) continued assistance for
development of the backbone of a national network, (b) rehabilitating feeder
roads in major agricultural areas and (c) development of a road maintenance
capability for the country. The project supports items a and c of this strategy.
9.      IDA involvement in the project is justified for two major reasons.  The
development of MCTPC, and particularly of its maintenance capability, is a long
term process. This was begun under the Highway Improvement Project (HIP), and
the proposed project would represent a second phase of this development, for
which long term continuity is essential. The second reason is that since the key
producrive sectors of the Lao economy, particularly agriculture, depend heavily
on road transport for access to imarkets and production inputs, improvement of the
country's currently inadequate road network is central to any effort to stimulate
economic growth. The project thus-constitutes a logical follow-up to the two



-3-
ongoing IDA financed highway projects geared towards the improvement of-NR 13
sQuth of Vientiane and the development of MCTPC.
10.     Proiect Description.   The proposed project would be implemented by
MCTPC.   The project would finance:  (a) a maintenance program including the
execution of spot improvements and periodic maintenance on about 2, 000 km of the
Borrower's network; (b) upgrading of about 135 km of the Savannakhet-Pakse road
to bituminous standard, including rehabilitation of 36 bridges; (c) technical
assistance for project implementation, development of the local contracting
capability, transport planning and policy development; and ld) degree courses and
short-term training for MCTPC staff.
I1.      The project has an estimated cost of US$33.7 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$26.3 million (78 percent).  The proposed
credit will finance 100 percent of foreign costs and 54 percent of local costs.
Implementation would be over a five-year period. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.  A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of the Association's
operations in Lao PDR are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12526-LA dated March 16, 1994,
is being distributed separately.
12.     Pro lect Sustainabili'Y.  While the project can be sustained in the short
term by the extensive amount of technical assistance for supervision and project
management, there is greater concern for road maintenance in the long term. This
long term sustainability will be addressed through measures  designed to
strengthen planning of investments and maintenance management systems adapted to
the Lao context capable of expanding with the network. IDA experiences, however,
underscores the long term and incremental nature of developing a viable financial
and institutional framework for road management. This project is thus seen as one
of a series of-potential IDA interventions.
13.     Actions Agreed On.   During negotiations, agreement was obtained from
Government on: (a) that it will allocate a minimum of US$1.4 million equivalent
in its fiscal year 1995/96 for road maintenance, intreasing to US$1.8 million in
1996/97 and US$3.4 million in 1997/98 from its own budget; (b) annual reviews of
the Government's Road Maintenance Program and budgets for 1995 and subsequent
years; (c) that the Project Coordinating Unit will be maintained for the duration
of the project; (d) appointment of the technical assistance consultants to the
State Enterprise as a condition prior to effectiveness; (e) establishment of a
Project Management Unit as a condition of effectiveness, with responsibilities
and staffing acceptable to the Association; (f) issuance of a Prime Ministerial
Decree approving environmental guidelines for road projects as a condition prior
to effectiveness; (g) the establishment and maintenance of the new State
Enterprise (SE) formed from the merger of former enterprises 13/2, 13/3 and 13/4
to carry out the upgrading component under the project; (h) annual audits of
project accounts, and the special account by the Enterprise Accounting Department
of MOF in accordance with international auditing standards, to be reviewed at the
end of the first year; and if this is not acceptable to IDA, a firm of local
auditors with international accounting standards wonld be retained; and (i)
preparation of Quarterly Progress Reports and a Project Completion Report.

14.     Benefits-.  Rehabilitation under the project of the Savannakhet-Pakse
Road will facilitate flows of both export-import traffic and the important
agricultural traffic moving north from the country's southern provinces. The
proposed road upgrading will also support other development programs in the
country, enable lower-cost distribution of goods and movement of people within
the central region and between the northern and southern parts of Lao PDR and,
more importantly, provide a reliable year-round, all-weather link for the
movement of-goods and passengers. The project road would therefore assist the
Government of Lao PDR to develop its currently inadequate transport
infrastructure and to meet some of its objectives regarding regional development,
integration of the geographically large but sparsely populated country, and
promotion of exports. The maintenance component will ensure the sustainability
of the benefits of the roadworks for the future. The development of the local
contracting capability is also expected to yield long term benefits that will
allow reductions in costs of maintenance and upgrading works and improve overall
efficiency of the transport system.
1s.     Risks.   Potential risks to project implementation relate to MCTPC's
implementation capacity and, for maintenance, the inadequacies of the local
budget and the lack of local maintenance management staff. These risks would be
minimized through the provision under the project of both a consultant to help
coordinate project activities and technical assistance to help supervise
upgrading and improvement activities, technical assistance to the RMMD and the
three Maintanance Regions and technical assistance to the SE that will be trained
under the project. Training will also be provided to develop local capabilities.
Budget issues and revenue enhancement are being addressed at the macro level.
These risks would further be mitigated by the appointment of consultants for
supervision of project construction from the firm that designed the project road.
Inadequate maintenance of the road after completion is also a risk, which would
be addressed under the project by improving the country's maintenance capacity
and by designing the pavements under conservative assumptions to reduce the need
for a high level of maintenance, for a design life of 15 years. Resurfacing of
the road would be required during this period. If traffic greatly exceeds the
estimate used for the pavement design, then a strengthening overlay will be
applied as appropriate, following monitoring of the surface condition.
16.     Environmental Impact.   The project iF expected ': have no negative
environmental or ecological impact.   No majt¶r changes will be made in the
alignment of the Savannakhet-Pakse Road. The road is in an area where the primary
forest has already been cut and the secondary growth is largely scrub and brush.
Improvement of drainage along the road will improve euivironmental conditions.
The bituminous surfacing on the road will reduce the dust nuisance during the dry
season from the present gravel and earth surface. A manual has been produced on
Environmental Considerations for Road Construction in Lao PDR,- and the
recommendations therein will be applied during construction of the project road.
Specifically, measures will be taken to avoid siltation resulting from run-off
from construction sites, and drainage will be designed to prevent downstream
erosion. Higher speeds and increased traffic can, however, be expected to result
in an increase in traffic accidents. Waile no specific actions are proposed to
address the potential increase in accidents, the Government is aware of the
problem and is beginning to address i': in Vientiane Prefecture. No persons will
be resettled or displaced involuntarily under the project.

17.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
