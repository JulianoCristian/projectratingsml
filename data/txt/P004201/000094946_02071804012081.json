performances are rated as\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned include the following: 1)\n            Flexibility during implementation enhances reaching\n            outcome-oriented development objectives. The combination of\n            outcome orientation, flexible project design, and timely\n            repsonse to the implementation issues saved significant cost\n            and time while maintaining an effective development impact\n            on the ground. 2) Capacity building and commitment to\n            infrastructure asset preservation require sustained\n            involvement over time. An incremental transport sector\n            approach--based on a series of rehabilitation projects with\n            increased focus on maintenance and important capacity\n            building components--has proved to be effective. 3) Contract\n            management and timely handling of contractual disputes are\n            critical to attaining high quality infrastructure.\n            Construction defects were detected and corrected during the\n            construction phase. Additional defects appeared during the\n            Defect Liability Period. Fiedl investigations and intensive\n            studies to identify the causes, extent, and liability of\n            defects were carried out by an independent consultant, local\n            consultants, and the Ministry of Communication, Transport,\n            and Post and Construction (MTCPC). Subsequently, with the\n            Bank's support, MCTPC was able to reach an amicable\n            settlement with the contractor, and the estimated liability\n            was apportioned among the parties"}, "docdt": "2002-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
