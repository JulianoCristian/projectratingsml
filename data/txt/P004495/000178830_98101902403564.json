        at improving the allocation and efficiency of investment\n            over the medium term. The second phase of the program\n            includes: (i) a fundamental reform of the Philippines'\n            industrial incentives and promotion policy; (ii) an\n            extension of the ongoing trade policy reform through\n            measures in indirect taxation, import liberalization, and\n            tariffs; and (iii) reforms in the area of energy policy and\n            public resource management. The program is described in the\n            Government's Letter of Development Policy to the Bank.\n            The loan will finance essential imports. The main benefits\n            of the program will be improvements in the allocation and\n            efficiency of industrial investment as well as in a major\n            part of public investment; the program will also improve the\n            structure of the balance of payments by limiting the\n            country's reliance on foreign savings and reducing the\n            current account deficit to more sustainable levels."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
