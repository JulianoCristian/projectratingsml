I. 
INTRODUCTION 
1 
The 
Government 
of 
Nicaragua 
has 
requested 
an 
International 
Development 
Association 
(IDA) 
Programmatic 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(PSAC) 
to 
support 
implementation 
of 
its 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
(PRSP) 
which 
was 
completed 
last 
year, 
following 
an 
extensive 
nation-wide 
consultation 
process. 
The 
PRSP 
was 
presented 
to 
IDA’s 
Board 
in 
September 
2001. 
Since 
then, 
and 
following 
the 
installation 
of 
a 
new 
Nicaraguan 
administration 
in 
January 
2002, 
a 
PRSP 
Progress 
Report 
has 
been 
prepared 
by 
the 
Government 
and 
was 
presented 
to 
the 
Board 
in 
December 
2002, 
together 
with 
the 
IDA-IMF 
Joint 
Staff 
Assessment 
(JSA). 
The 
Bank’s 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
for 
Nicaragua, 
which 
is 
based 
on 
the 
PRSP 
and 
its 
Progress 
Report 
was 
recently 
completed 
and 
is 
being 
presented 
to 
IDA’s 
Board 
together 
with 
this 
first 
PSAC 
operation. 
It 
should 
be 
noted, 
too, 
that 
the 
IMF 
recently 
concluded 
a 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Growth 
Facility 
(PRGF) 
arrangement 
with 
Nicaragua, 
which 
was 
presented 
to 
its 
Board 
in 
December 
2002. 
2 
The 
program 
of 
actions 
supported 
by 
the 
PSAC 
have 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
ongoing 
discussions 
between 
the 
Government, 
IDA, 
IDB 
and 
the 
IMF 
over 
the 
past 
year, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
PRGF 
preparation 
and 
the 
HIPC 
completion 
point 
conditions. 
The 
policy 
measures 
included 
in 
the 
PSAC 
(and 
the 
possible 
two 
additional 
adjustment 
operations 
contemplated 
in 
the 
matrix) 
derive 
from 
the 
medium-term 
development 
framework 
laid 
out 
in 
the 
PRSPLPRSP 
Progress 
Report, 
the 
recommendations 
contained 
in 
IDA’s 
FY02 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(PER) 
and 
FYOl 
Poverty 
Assessment 
(PA), 
and 
the 
core 
findings 
of 
ongoing 
joint 
IDA-IDB 
fiduciary 
work. 
The 
PSAC 
is 
thus 
expected 
to 
help 
address 
some 
of 
the 
key 
structural 
obstacles 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
Nicaragua. 
It 
will 
also 
assist 
Nicaragua 
with 
the 
urgent 
need 
to 
strengthen 
its 
depleted 
international 
reserves 
position, 
meet 
the 
macroeconomic 
targets 
agreed 
with 
the 
IMF, 
and 
help 
reduce 
the 
country’s 
vulnerability 
to 
a 
possible 
balance 
of 
payments 
crisis. 
3 
In 
parallel 
with 
moving 
ahead 
on 
the 
PSAC, 
and 
in 
line 
with 
the 
strategy 
laid 
out 
in 
the 
CAS, 
the 
Nicaraguan 
Government 
and 
IDA 
are 
working 
towards 
putting 
in 
place 
the 
preconditions 
for 
a 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
(PRSC) 
operation(s). 
As 
indicated 
in 
the 
CAS, 
this 
would 
involve, 
inter 
ah, 
further 
strengthening 
the 
public 
sector’s 
expenditure 
management 
and 
fiduciary 
controls 
per 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
PER, 
CFAA 
and 
CPAR. 
As 
the 
implementation 
of 
recommendations 
from 
these 
analyses 
advances, 
future 
adjustment 
lending 
to 
Nicaragua 
in 
support 
of 
the 
PRSP 
would 
take 
the 
form 
of 
a 
series 
of 
PRSCs. 
In 
addition, 
work 
on 
a 
Country 
Economic 
Memorandum 
(CEM) 
and 
a 
Poverty 
and 
Social 
Impact 
Analysis 
(PSIA), 
both 
scheduled 
for 
FY04, 
would 
help 
inform 
the 
design 
of 
a 
possible 
PRSC. 
An 
eventual 
shift 
to 
the 
PRSC 
Page  5
instrument 
is 
seen 
as 
desirable 
by 
both 
the 
Nicaraguan 
Authorities 
and 
IDA 
as 
it 
would: 
(i) 
allow 
for 
a 
larger 
proportion 
of 
IDA 
resources 
to 
be 
channeled 
to 
Nicaragua 
in 
the 
form 
of 
budgetary 
support 
for 
a 
comprehensive 
set 
of 
poverty 
reducing 
programs; 
(ii) 
mobilize 
additional 
quick-disbursing 
budgetary 
support 
from 
bilateral 
partners 
who 
have 
expressed 
willingness 
to 
cofinance 
a 
PRSC; 
and 
(iii) 
increase 
harmonization 
among 
Nicaragua’s 
external 
partners 
around 
a 
government-led 
program, 
thereby 
reducing 
pressure 
on 
Nicaragua’s 
limited 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
program/project 
management. 
II. 
RECENT 
ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTS 
AND 
PROGRESS 
IN 
POVERTY 
REDUCTION 
A. 
Economic 
Performance 
4 
Following 
a 
decade 
of 
economic 
and 
political 
disarray 
in 
the 
198Os, 
Nicaragua 
has 
advanced 
significantly 
in 
restoring 
a 
stable, 
private 
sector-led, 
market 
economy. 
Hyperinflation 
was 
halted 
in 
1991 
and 
economic 
growth 
reemerged 
in 
1994. 
Trade 
barriers 
were 
progressively 
lowered 
to 
open 
up 
the 
economy, 
FDI 
increased 
until 
1999 
fi-om 
minimal 
levels 
in 
the 
early 
199Os, 
and 
by 
1997, 
private 
investors 
overtook 
the 
public 
sector 
as 
the 
main 
source 
of 
capital 
accumulation. 
The 
oversized 
public 
sector 
inherited 
in 
1990 
was 
reduced 
through 
major 
contractions 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
labor 
force, 
cuts 
in 
public 
expenditures 
and 
the 
privatization 
or 
closure 
of 
most 
state-owned 
enterprises. 
Other 
reforms 
included 
the 
modernization 
of 
financial 
sector 
legislation 
and 
prudential 
norms, 
closure 
of 
all 
state-owned 
commercial 
banks, 
privatization 
of 
public 
power 
and 
telecommunications 
utilities, 
strengthening 
of 
regulatory 
agencies 
for 
public 
services, 
restructuring 
of 
the 
public 
sector, 
initiation 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
pension 
system 
reform, 
and 
reforms 
in 
public 
administration 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
single 
treasury 
account 
(Caja 
Unica) 
and 
introduction 
of 
a 
modem 
financial 
management 
system. 
These 
measures 
were 
accompanied 
by 
the 
creation 
of 
various 
social 
funds, 
most 
importantly 
the 
Emergency 
Social 
Investment 
Fund 
(FISE), 
to 
direct 
resources 
to 
the 
poor, 
and 
steps 
to 
reform 
the 
social 
sectors, 
particularly 
health 
and 
education, 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
services 
within 
a 
highly 
constrained 
budget. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
these 
efforts, 
significant 
progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
reducing 
many 
of 
the 
most 
visible 
structural 
constraints 
on 
economic 
growth 
and 
development. 
A 
number 
of 
structural 
issues 
remain 
to 
be 
addressed, 
however. 
These 
are 
well-reco~ized 
by 
Government 
and 
are 
discussed 
in 
Section 
III 
below, 
which 
describes 
Government 
priorities 
as 
reflected 
in 
the 
PRSP. 
5 
By 
1997-98, 
the 
Nicaraguan 
Government, 
having 
accomplished 
the 
structural 
reforms 
described 
above, 
was 
well-advanced 
in 
the 
process 
of 
restoring 
fiscal 
discipline, 
rebuilding 
an 
adequate 
reserves 
cushion 
and 
reducing 
the 
country’s 
dependence 
on 
foreign 
aid. 
This 
process 
received 
support 
from 
the 
II!YIF, 
via 
a 
3-year 
PRGF 
arrangement 
which 
was 
initiated 
in 
March 
1998, 
and 
by 
other 
partners 
including 
IDA 
. 
In 
October 
1998, 
however, 
the 
process 
of 
fiscal 
consolidation 
was 
abruptly 
interrupted 
by 
the 
advent 
of 
hurricane 
Mitch. 
Fortunately, 
Nicaragua 
was 
able 
to 
rebound 
quickly 
from 
the 
physical 
damage 
caused 
by 
the 
hurricane, 
due 
in 
large 
part 
to 
the 
massive 
inflow 
of 
foreign 
aid 
that 
came 
in 
response. 
In 
addition, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
world’s 
most 
indebted 
Page  6
countries, 
Nicaragua 
was 
declared 
eligible 
for 
HIPC 
relief 
in 
1999, 
and 
reached 
the 
HIPC 
Decision 
Point 
in 
December 
2000. 
At 
the 
time, 
expectations 
were 
that 
the 
Government 
would 
negotiate 
a 
3rd 
year 
PRGF 
arrangement 
with 
the 
IMF 
for 
2001 
and 
that 
the 
HIPC 
Completion 
Point 
could 
be 
reached 
by 
late 
2002. 
6 
However, 
as 
the 
post-Mitch 
boom 
came 
to 
an 
end 
in 
2001, 
economic 
activity 
slowed 
substantially, 
resulting 
in 
large 
fiscal 
deficits 
and 
a 
weakened 
international 
reserve 
position. 
The 
economic 
and 
monetary 
situation 
was 
further 
aggravated 
by 
the 
fraud-induced 
failures 
of 
several 
major 
banks, 
which 
had 
to 
be 
intervened, 
forcing 
the 
Central 
Bank 
to 
issue 
domestic 
debt 
to 
avoid 
a 
run 
on 
deposits. 
The 
governrnent 
proved 
unable 
to 
take 
the 
necessary 
steps 
to 
correct 
the 
November

Presidential 
Election, 
and

3’ 
% 
rowing 
imbalances 
in 
the 
run-up 
to 
the 
year 
arrangement 
under 
the 
PRGF 
was 
abandoned. 
A 
less 
demanding 
Staff-Monitored 
Program 
(SMP) 
was 
agreed 
with 
the 
INIF 
for 
the 
period 
June-December 
2001. 
But 
even 
that 
program 
was 
not 
complied 
with, 
and 
most 
of 
the 
agreed 
targets 
were 
missed 
by 
wide 
margins. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
projected 
HIPC 
Completion 
Point 
date 
slipped 
into 
2003.

. 
The 
fiscal 
indiscipline 
of 
2001, 
combined 
with 
external 
price 
shocks 
(oil, 
coffee), 
exacerbated 
Nicaragua’s 
already-large 
macroeconomic 
imbalances. 
The 
most 
pressing 
imbalances 
in 
the 
short- 
to 
medium- 
term 
are 
the 
huge 
fiscal 
deficit 
and 
the 
large 
public 
debt 
(Table 
1). 
Another 
imbalance 
that 
stands 
out 
is 
the 
external 
deficit 
- 
which 
reflects 
both 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
(which 
is 
beginning 
to 
be 
addressed) 
and 
the 
massive 
aid 
inflows 
to 
Nicaragua. 
These 
aid 
inflows 
have 
propped 
up 
the 
real 
exchange 
rate, 
resulting 
in 
a 
“Dutch 
Disease” 
phenomenon 
characterized 
by 
extremely 
high 
domestic 
absorption 
rates, 
which 
may 
have 
dragged 
down 
the 
country’s 
competitiveness. 
The 
adverse 
impact 
of 
an 
appreciated 
real 
exchange 
rate 
on 
growth 
is 
undoubtedly 
offset 
to 
some 
degree 
by 
the 
competitiveness-enhancing 
impact 
of 
aid-financed 
capital 
investments. 
However, 
the 
precise 
degree 
to 
which 
competitiveness 
is 
in 
fact 
enhanced 
depends 
critically 
on 
the 
efficiency 
of 
donor 
assistance 
- 
an 
issue 
which 
should 
receive 
increasing 
attention 
in 
coming 
years 
alongside 
other 
pressing 
issues 
including 
the 
large 
fiscal 
deficit 
and 
high 
debt. 
8 
Since 
taking 
office 
in 
early 
2002, 
The 
Bolanos 
administration 
has 
begun 
to 
address 
the 
key 
macroeconomic 
issues 
discussed 
above. 
It 
entered 
into 
discussions 
with 
the 
IMF 
on 
a 
new 
three-year 
PRGF 
arrangement 
and 
an 
agreement 
was 
reached 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
The 
PRGF, 
which 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
IMF 
Board 
last 
December, 
envisages 
a 
substantial 
fiscal 
adjustment 
and 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
the 
exchange-rate 
indexed 
stock 
of 
domestic 
central 
bank 
debt. 
These 
adjustments 
are 
planned 
to 
take 
place 
through 
a 
comprehensive 
tax 
reform, 
an 
amended 
budget 
for 
2002 
and 
a 
program 
to 
recover 
assets 
of 
previously 
intervened 
banks. 
The 
measures 
are 
designed 
to 
put 
Nicaragua’s 
fiscal 
balances 
on 
a 
sustainable 
path, 
achieving 
primary 
surpluses 
in 
the 
latter 
half 
of 
the 
decade.

The 
Government’s 
program 
to 
address 
Nicaragua’s 
huge 
fiscal 
deficit 
and 
large 
public 
debt 
is 
reasonable, 
but 
not 
without 
risks. 
The 
magnitude 
of 
the 
adjustment 
foreseen 
is 
very 
large 
and 
will 
entail 
significant 
sacrifice 
- 
which, 
in 
turn, 
could 
test 
the 
Government’s 
resolve 
to 
remain 
on 
track. 
In 
addition, 
there 
remains 
a 
risk 
that 
domestic 
debt 
- 
already 
over 
50 
percent 
of 
official 
GDP 
- 
could 
increase 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
policy 
changes 
with 
regard 
to 
compensation 
payments 
to 
owners 
of 
properties 
expropriated 
in 
the 
1980s. 
This 
issue 
is 
politically 
sensitive 
since 
these 
compensations 
were 
determined 
in 
the 
early 
1990s 
as 
a 
means 
of 
redressing 
illegal 
expropriations 
and 
signaling 
respect 
for 
property 
rights. 
B. 
Poverty 
Reduction 
10 
Despite 
its 
uneven 
economic 
performance 
in 
recent 
years, 
Nicaragua 
has 
maintained 
steady 
progress 
over 
the 
last 
decade 
in 
reducing 
poverty. 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
Source: 
IMF 
and 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Nicaragua 
Page  8
2, 
results 
of 
the 
1993, 
1998 
and 
2001 
Living 
Standards 
Measurement 
Surveys 
(LSMSs) 
indicate 
a 
reduction 
of 
about 
4.5 
percent 
in 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
total 
population 
living 
under 
the 
poverty 
line 
(Table 
2). 
The 
decline 
in 
the 
share 
of 
the 
population 
living 
in 
extreme 
poverty 
is 
even 
more 
pronounced, 
having 
fallen 
from 
19.4 
percent 
in 
1993 
to 
15.1 
percent 
in 
2001. 
Poverty 
fell 
most 
in 
the 
rural 
areas, 
where 
the 
poor 
are 
concentrated, 
and 
especially 
in 
the 
Pacific 
and 
Central 
regions. 
Trends 
in 
urban 
poverty 
were 
mixed: 
poverty 
declined 
in 
the 
Central 
region, 
but 
increased 
in 
the 
Pacific 
and 
Atlantic 
regions. 
The 
Atlantic 
region 
experienced 
a 
deterioration 
in 
poverty 
during 
1993. 
1998, 
but 
this 
has 
been 
partly 
compensated 
for 
by 
improvements 
during 
1998-01. 
Although 
hurricane 
Mitch 
caused 
major 
human 
and 
physical 
damage, 
it 
did 
not 
significantly 
change 
Nicaragua’s 
overall 
poverty 
profile.

If 
Nicaragua’s 
poverty 
levels 
continue 
to 
decline 
at 
the 
same 
pace 
as 
during 
1993- 
20b1, 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goal 
(MDG) 
of 
cutting 
extreme 
poverty 
in 
half 
should 
be 
reached 
well 
before 
the 
target 
date 
of 
2015. 
There 
are 
concerns, 
however, 
about 
the 
country’s 
ability 
to 
sustain 
this 
pace. 
The 
decline 
in 
poverty 
from 
1993 
to 
1998 
was 
driven 
in 
large 
measure 
by 
extensive 
rural 
sector 
growth, 
boosted 
by 
high 
export 
commodity 
prices, 
the 
availability 
of 
unoccupied 
land 
and 
a 
return 
to 
normalcy 
after 
a 
decade 
of 
civil 
war. 
None 
of 
these 
factors 
can 
be 
expected 
to 
deliver 
a 
sustained 
growth 
impulse 
indefinitely, 
and 
indeed, 
Nicaragua’s 
main 
export 
prices 
already 
have 
experienced 
a 
major 
deterioration 
since 
2000.’ 
The 
fact 
that 
overall 
poverty 
has 
continued 
to 
decline 
over 
1998-2001 
appears 
to 
be 
due 
mainly 
to 
the 
post-Mitch 
reconstruction 
boom, 
which 
also 
came 
to 
an 
end 
in 
2001. 
This 
means 
that 
growth 
in 
the 
rural 
sector, 
where 
most 
of 
the 
poor 
are 
concentrated, 
could 
be 
short-lived 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
new 
stimuli 
to 
sustain 
agricultural 
output 
growth. 
Moreover, 
future 
growth 
needs 
to 
rely 
on 
productivity 
growth, 
since 
the 
extensive 
growth 
pattern 
followed 
during 
the 
1990s 
is 
reaching 
its 
natural 
limits 
and 
could 
result 
in 
major 
environmental 
darnage 
if 
continued. 
* 
Accordingly, 
poverty 
has 
increased 
again 
over 
199%2001in 
the 
principal 
coffee 
growing 
areas 
(Central 
Rural 
region), 
which 
are 
the 
ones 
that 
suffered 
the 
greatest 
price 
shocks; 
Table 
1. 
Page  9
12 
As 
discussed 
in 
the 
Joint 
Staff 
Assessment 
of 
the 
first 
PRSP 
Progress 
Report, 
the 
targets 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
2015 
can 
be 
achieved 
with 
an 
average 
per 
capita 
income 
growth 
of 
two 
percentage 
points 
or 
more 
over 
the 
next 
12 
years. 
Nicaragua’s 
growth 
prospects 
currently 
appear 
less 
favorable 
than 
in 
the 
latter 
half 
of 
the 
199Os, 
in 
part 
due 
to 
depressed 
export 
commodity 
prices 
and 
recessive 
international 
economic 
conditions. 
Domestically, 
a 
major 
fiscal 
adjustment 
(on 
the 
order 
of 
6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
over 
four 
years) 
is 
needed 
to 
move 
toward 
a 
sustainable 
macroeconomic 
situation, 
which 
places 
a 
significant 
constraint 
on 
the 
public 
sector’s 
ability 
to 
maneuver 
in 
years 
to 
come. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
target 
is 
considered 
attainable, 
particularly 
in 
view 
of 
the 
government’s 
commitment 
to 
protect 
poverty 
related 
spending 
when 
undertaking 
this 
adjustment; 
the 
PRSP 
Progress 
Report 
(Table 
4) 
projects 
a 
continued 
increase 
in 
the 
GDP 
share 
of 
poverty-related 
spending 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
significant 
decline 
in 
GDP-share 
of 
total 
public 
expenditures. 
Also, 
the 
program 
projections 
envisage 
a 
recovery 
of 
growth 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
of 
2 
percent 
in 
per 
capita 
terms 
by 
2004, 
as 
external 
conditions 
are 
projected 
to 
recover 
partially 
and 
the 
fiscal 
adjustment 
is 
expected 
to 
have 
a 
limited 
recessionary 
impact. 
In 
this 
last 
regard, 
it 
is 
projected 
that 
the 
growth 
retarding 
effects 
of 
reduced 
public 
expenditures 
will 
be 
largely 
offset 
by 
the 
growth 
inducing 
effects 
of 
more 
private 
investments 
facilitated 
(“crowded 
in”) 
by 
the 
reduced 
government 
presence 
in 
the 
economy, 
together 
with 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
market-oriented 
reforms 
contemplated 
in 
the 
PRSP.

As 
shown 
in 
Table 
3, 
Nicaragua 
also 
has 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
meeting 
its 
other 
PRSP 
targets, 
which 
are 
closely 
linked 
to 
the 
MDGs. 
This 
reflects 
the 
overall 
positive 
growth 
performance 
during 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
199Os, 
the 
priority 
given 
by 
the 
government 
to 
improving 
the 
coverage 
of 
basic 
social 
services 
and 
generous 
amounts 
of 
donor 
assistance, 
especially 
in 
the 
aftermath 
of 
hurricane 
Mitch.. 
For 
example, 
net 
primary 
enrollment 
rates 
have 
risen 
from 
under 
76 
percent 
in 
1993 
to 
over 
83 
percent 
in 
2001, 
significantly 
exceeding 
the 
target 
set 
in 
the 
PRSP. 
Similarly, 
PRSP 
social 
targets 
have 
been 
met 
or 
exceeded 
in 
virtually 
all 
other 
areas 
for 
which 
targets 
were 
set 
including, 
inter 
alia, 
for 
chronic 
malnutrition, 
water 
and 
sanitation. 
An 
exception 
to 
this 
general 
improvement 
in 
social 
indicators 
is 
the 
illiteracy 
rate, 
which 
in 
Nicaragua, 
as 
Page  10
elsewhere, 
has 
proved 
difficult 
to 
affect 
in 
a 
medium 
time 
frame. 
There 
also 
are 
some 
concerns 
about 
the 
pace 
at 
which 
access 
to 
reproductive 
health 
services 
and 
the 
coverage 
of 
water 
services 
are 
increasing. 
While 
progress 
in 
both 
these 
areas 
has 
been 
in 
line 
with 
PRSP 
targets 
for 
2001, 
the 
short-term 
PRSP 
targets 
themselves 
are 
relatively 
modest 
vis 
a 
vis 
MDG 
goals 
for 
2015. 
Though 
not 
listed 
as 
a 
PRSP 
target, 
the 
indicators 
on 
child 
health 
related 
to 
diarrhea 
also 
give 
cause 
for 
concern 
because 
they 
appear 
to 
have 
deteriorated 
since 
1999 
according 
to 
the 
PRSP 
Progress 
Report. 
14 
Looking 
toward 
the 
future, 
continued 
progress 
in 
Nicaragua’s 
social 
indicators 
could 
be 
held 
back 
by 
the 
country’s 
extremely 
low 
levels 
of 
social 
spending, 
which 
mainly 
reflects 
the 
country’s 
overall 
low 
level 
of 
income, 
and 
thus 
further 
emphasizes 
the 
need 
for 
higher, 
sustained 
growth. 
Even 
though 
per 
capita 
social 
spending 
increased 
by 
50 
percent 
in 
US 
Dollar 
terms 
in 
the 
aftermath 
of 
hurricane 
Mitch, 
it 
still 
remains 
far 
below 
the 
Latin 
American 
average. 
(Social 
spending 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP 
appears 
to 
be 
higher 
than 
the 
Latin 
American 
average, 
but 
that 
is 
due 
to 
the 
sub-valuation 
of 
Nicaragua’s 
GDP.) 
This 
necessarily 
directs 
attention 
to 
the 
need 
for 
sector 
reforms 
that 
aim 
to 
bring 
about 
more 
efficient 
use 
of 
existing 
resources, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
resource 
growth 
through 
higher 
GDP.

NICARAGUA’S 
GROWTH 
AND 
POVERTY 
REDUCTION 
STRATEGY 
AND 
AREAS 
FOR 
WORLD 
BANK 
SUPPORT 
A. 
The 
Government’s 
Enhanced 
Growth 
and 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
15 
The 
Government’s 
strategy 
for 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
economic 
development 
is 
outlined 
in 
its 
Enhanced 
Growth 
and 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
(PRSP) 
and 
its 
PRSP 
Progress 
Report. 
The 
PRSP 
was 
prepared 
over 
a 
period 
of 
two 
years, 
involving 
broad-based 
participation 
from 
many 
sectors 
in 
society. 
The 
overarching 
objective 
of 
policies 
and 
public 
expenditure 
programs 
prioritized 
in 
the 
PRSP 
is 
to 
reduce 
extreme 
poverty 
from 
a 
rate 
of 
19.4 
percent 
in 
1993 
to 
9.3 
percent 
in 
2015. 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
3 
(above), 
the 
PRSP 
also 
aims 
to 
achieve 
nine 
other 
targets 
by 
2015, 
mostly 
involving 
social 
indicators 
related 
to 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
16 
The 
PRSP 
rests 
on 
four 
pillars: 
(i) 
broad 
based 
economic 
growth 
with 
an 
emphasis 
on 
productive 
employment 
generation 
and 
rural 
development; 
(ii) 
greater 
and 
better 
investment 
in 
the 
human 
capital 
of 
the 
poor; 
(iii) 
better 
protection 
for 
vulnerable 
populations; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
strengthening 
of 
institutions 
and 
good 
governance. 
These 
four 
pillars 
are 
intertwined 
with 
three 
cross-cutting 
themes: 
a 
reduction 
in 
environmental 
degradation 
and 
ecological 
vulnerability, 
an 
increase 
in 
social 
equity 
and 
further 
decentralization. 
Although 
the 
PRSP 
was 
prepared 
under 
the 
previous 
Government, 
the 
Bolanos 
administration 
has 
confirmed 
its 
ownership 
of 
the 
PRSP. 
However, 
it 
has 
emphasized 
the 
need 
to 
revise 
the 
criteria 
used 
for 
allocating 
resources, 
such 
that 
both 
the 
poverty 
map 
and 
assessments 
of 
the 
productive 
potential 
of 
program 
beneficiaries 
should 
henceforth 
serve 
as 
criteria 
for 
program 
targeting 
purposes.

The 
Proposed 
Programmatic 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(PSAC) 
17 
The 
Programmatic 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(PSAC) 
is 
the 
first 
in 
a 
proposed 
series 
of 
one 
or 
two-tranche 
adjustment 
credits 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRSP. 
This 
series 
is 
intended 
to 
cover 
the 
period 
of 
this 
Government 
Administration, 
and 
gradually 
become 
synchronized 
with 
the 
government’s 
budget 
cycle, 
in 
parallel 
with 
the 
PRGF 
arrangement 
with 
the 
I&IF. 
It 
contains 
performance 
benchmarks, 
policy 
measures 
and 
outcome 
indicators, 
and 
is 
meant 
to 
anchor 
the 
Bank 
Group’s 
overall 
support 
for 
Nicaragua’s 
development 
strategy. 
As 
envisioned 
in 
the 
CAS, 
the 
PSAC 
would 
be 
followed 
by 
a 
series 
of 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Support 
Credits 
(PRSCs), 
provided 
that 
the 
analytic 
underpinnings 
and 
fiduciary 
arrangements 
required 
for 
PRSCs 
have 
been 
studied 
and 
are 
implemented 
as 
planned. 
This 
proposal 
responds 
to 
the 
interest 
expressed 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
an 
eventual 
shift 
to 
the 
PRSC 
instrument 
as 
a 
means 
of 
better 
aligning 
IDA 
assistance 
with 
its 
budgetary 
cycle, 
improving 
aid 
coordination 
within 
a 
government-led 
program 
and 
mobilizing 
additional 
resources 
from 
bilateral 
partners 
who 
have 
expressed 
interest 
in 
cofinancing 
PRSCs. 
Under 
this 
framework, 
subsequent 
PRSCs 
would 
increasingly 
provide 
the 
bulk 
of 
IDA 
assistance 
for 
investment 
purposes, 
while 
other 
IDA-firnanced 
projects 
would 
progressively 
limit 
their 
focus 
on 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
and 
on 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
to 
help 
implement 
the 
policies 
and 
measures 
highlighted 
by 
the 
PSAC 
18 
. 
Each 
adjustment 
credit 
in 
the 
proposed 
series 
would 
be 
provided 
on 
the 
up-front 
completion 
of 
a 
set 
of 
prior 
actions 
that 
demonstrate 
satisfactory 
progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
social 
and 
structural 
reform 
agenda 
contained 
in 
the 
country’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
The 
provision 
of 
each 
credit 
in 
the 
sequence 
also 
depends 
on 
continued 
satisfactory 
macroeconomic 
performance 
and 
satisfactory 
overall 
progress 
in 
achieving 
the 
social 
and 
structural 
benchmarks 
presented 
in 
the 
PRSP 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
CAS 
triggers, 
based 
on 
a 
review 
by 
IDA 
staff. 
The 
prior 
actions 
of 
the 
first 
PSAC 
would 
be 
agreed 
up 
front, 
while 
each 
subsequent 
adjustment 
credit 
would 
build 
on 
the 
previous 
ones, 
with 
prior 
actions 
formulated 
and 
agreed 
upon 
in 
reference 
to 
progress 
made 
in 
reaching 
certain 
benchmarks 
described 
at 
the 
outset 
as 
part 
of 
a 
rolling 
medium-term 
program 
framework. 
19 
. 
The 
proposed 
PSAC 
and 
PRSCs 
support 
the 
policy 
measures 
described 
in 
the 
PRSP 
in 
a 
selective 
manner. 
They 
would 
not 
reflect 
all 
the 
policy 
measures 
contained 
in 
the 
PRSP, 
but 
rather 
would 
mainly 
provide 
support 
to 
areas 
where 
IDA 
has 
a 
comparative 
advantage 
and 
toward 
reform 
measures 
expected 
to 
have 
the 
highest 
poverty 
reducing 
impact. 
In 
this 
last 
respect, 
the 
PSAC 
and 
PRSCs 
would 
give 
special 
attention 
to 
measures 
emphasized 
in 
the 
HIPC 
Completion 
Point 
Conditions, 
which 
also 
were 
derived 
from 
the 
PRSP. 
20 
The 
program 
supported 
under 
this 
PSAC 
gives 
particular 
attention 
to 
the 
first, 
sedond 
and 
fourth 
pillars 
of 
the 
PRSP, 
responding 
to 
the 
government’s 
emphasis 
on 
the 
urgent 
need 
to 
accelerate 
economic 
growth, 
build 
the 
country’s 
human 
resource 
base 
and 
improve 
governance. 
Within 
the 
first 
pillar, 
the 
PSAC 
emphasizes 
measures 
and 
policies 
to 
improve 
the 
private 
investment 
climate, 
and 
within 
the 
fourth 
pillar, 
the 
PSAC 
Page  12
emphasizes 
measures 
to 
improve 
transparency 
and 
strengthen 
public 
expenditure 
management. 
The 
restoration 
of 
rapid 
economic 
growth 
is 
essential 
for 
maintaining 
the 
positive 
momentum 
in 
reducing 
Nicaragua’s 
poverty 
indicators. 
However, 
Nicaragua’s 
public 
sector 
will 
be 
functioning 
under 
very 
tight 
fiscal 
constraints 
in 
the 
years 
to 
come, 
so 
that 
the 
main 
impulses 
for 
raising 
growth 
will 
have 
to 
come 
from 
the 
private 
sector. 
Since 
the 
government 
does 
not 
have 
the 
resources 
to 
provide 
fiscal 
incentives, 
it 
will 
need 
to 
rely 
on 
improvements 
in 
the 
overall 
policy 
environment 
to 
attract 
private 
investors. 
One 
critical 
aspect 
of 
this 
environment 
are 
governance 
indicators, 
where 
Nicaragua 
has 
not 
ranked 
well 
in 
recent 
years 
compared 
to 
other 
nations. 
Another 
critical 
element 
is 
a 
healthy 
and 
skilled 
labor 
force. 
21 
. 
The 
PSAC’s 
emphasis 
on 
improving 
public 
expenditure 
and 
financial 
management 
is 
driven 
by 
the 
urgent 
need 
to 
increase 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
those 
that 
are 
financed 
by 
foreign 
aid. 
Nicaragua 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
aid 
dependent 
countries 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
prospects 
of 
significant 
increases 
in 
aid 
to 
achieve 
the 
PRSP 
targets 
are 
slim. 
Instead, 
Nicaragua 
will 
have 
to 
rely 
on 
measures 
to 
increase 
program 
impact 
under 
existing 
levels 
of 
aid. 
This 
will 
require 
improved 
prioritization 
of 
public 
spending 
and 
better 
aid 
coordination. 
Both 
require, 
in 
turn, 
improvements 
in 
the 
government’s 
expenditure 
and 
fiduciary 
management. 
Donors, 
in 
particular, 
will 
need 
to 
be 
persuaded 
that 
the 
public 
sector’s 
financial 
management 
systems 
are 
sufficiently 
developed 
to 
entrust 
their 
funds 
through 
the 
normal 
public 
sector 
budgeting 
process, 
without 
resorting 
to 
expensive 
parallel 
administration 
systems. 
Also, 
they 
need 
to 
be 
persuaded 
of 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
public 
sector’s 
expenditure 
prioritization 
process 
to 
be 
prepared 
to 
channel 
their 
funds 
in 
the 
form 
of 
fiscal 
budget 
support 
toward 
the 
activities 
prioritized 
by 
the 
government, 
instead 
of 
supporting 
different 
agendas. 
22 
The 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
this 
PSAC 
has 
been 
carefully 
sequenced. 
The 
measures 
supported 
by 
and 
identified 
in 
the 
conditionality 
of 
the 
proposed 
first 
PSAC 
consist 
of 
important 
measures 
and 
actions 
completed 
since 
the 
PRSP 
was 
prepared 
and 
presented 
in 
2001. 
Some 
of 
these 
actions 
consist 
of 
the 
passage 
of 
important 
framework 
laws, 
whose 
implementation 
provides 
the 
content 
of 
prior 
actions 
for 
subsequent 
credits 
under 
this 
PSAC 
framework. 
The 
actions 
by 
the 
first 
proposed 
PSAC, 
together 
with 
the 
follow-up 
measures 
proposed 
as 
prior 
actions 
for 
subsequent 
PRSCs, 
are 
discussed 
next 
under 
each 
of 
the 
PSAC 
pillars. 
C. 
First 
PRSP 
Pillar 
- 
Broad-Based 
Economic 
Growth 
and 
Structural 
Reform 
23 
This 
pillar 
was 
designed 
in 
response 
to 
the 
constraints 
on 
growth 
identified 
in 
the 
PRSP 
(Chapter 
III, 
Section 
C) 
and 
rests 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
macroeconomic 
program 
of 
continued 
stabilization 
and 
structural 
reform, 
including 
privatization 
of 
government-owned 
utilities, 
actions 
aimed 
at 
modernizing 
the 
rural 
economy, 
fostering 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
businesses, 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Atlantic 
Coast, 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
strategic 
productive 
clusters. 
This 
pillar 
clearly 
relies 
on 
an 
aggressive 
private 
sector 
response. 
The 
PRSP 
expects 
the 
future 
economic 
expansion 
to 
be 
led 
by 
urban 
services 
(such 
as, 
tourism, 
banking, 
commerce 
and 
communications), 
but 
the 
Page  13
dictates 
of 
poverty 
reduction 
require 
a 
special 
effort 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
rural 
economy 
expands 
as 
well. 
With 
that 
purpose 
in 
mind, 
the 
PRSP 
focuses 
on 
the 
following 
actions: 
0 
Improving 
incentives 
for 
rural 
development 
through 
the 
elimination 
of 
price 
and 
cost 
distortions 
faced 
by 
farmers 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
free 
trade 
agreements 
with 
Nicaragua’s 
major 
trading 
partners 
to 
further 
reduce 
the 
anti-export 
bias 
facing 
rural 
producers. 
l 
Securing 
property 
rights 
and 
improving 
the 
operation 
of 
rural 
factor 
markets 
to 
widen 
credit 
improve 
the 
encourage 
private 
investment, 
while 
revising 
bank 
regulations 
to 
access, 
formalize 
non-conventional 
financial 
organizations 
and 
operations 
of 
the 
rural 
credit 
fund. 
e 
Increasing 
investments 
in 
rural 
infrastructure, 
especially 
in 
rura 
electricity 
and 
rural 
telecommunications 
services.

aimed 
at

through 
a 
strategy 
to

in 
several 
strategic 
clusters 
with 
high 
growth 
potential, 
such 
as 
tourism,

and 
clothing, 
and 
forestry 
products. 
l 
Promoting 
improved 
production 
technologies 
to 
raise

24 
Of 
these 
elements, 
the 
PSAC 
focuses 
on 
measures 
to 
improve 
the 
investment 
climate, 
especially 
to 
attract 
foreign 
direct 
investment 
and 
on 
strengthening 
the 
financial 
system, 
including 
the 
regulatory 
environment 
for 
micro-finance 
institutions. 
The 
area 
of 
macroeconomic 
stability, 
which 
is 
critical 
for 
an 
enabling 
environment, 
will 
be 
covered 
under 
the 
IMF’s 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Growth 
Facility 
(PRGF), 
with 
the 
PSAC 
focusing 
mainly 
on 
the 
composition 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
Similarly, 
IDA’s 
support 
through 
the 
PSAC 
would 
be 
complemented 
by 
support 
from 
IDB 
and 
other 
donors, 
as 
well 
as 
through 
other 
ongoing 
IDA 
operations 
(see 
CAS). 
25 
K~J.J 
Issues. 
Key 
factors 
that 
depress 
the 
investment 
climate 
are 
the 
lack 
of 
infrastructure 
which 
keeps 
transport, 
energy 
and 
telecommunications 
prices 
among 
the 
highest 
in 
the 
region, 
the 
dilution 
of 
investment 
promotion 
efforts, 
and 
uncertainties 
about 
property 
rights 
and 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
game 
in 
conducting 
business. 
The 
weak 
financial 
system, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
represents 
a 
major 
source 
of 
vulnerability 
to 
crises 
triggered 
by 
internal 
or 
external 
shocks. 
This 
weakness 
is 
compounded 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
long-term 
domestic 
savings, 
which 
limits 
the 
availability 
of 
credit 
for 
productive 
investments, 
especially 
for 
small 
and 
medium 
scale 
investors. 
26 
Reform 
Stratem 
Nicaragua’s 
large 
infrastructure 
deficit 
in 
virtually 
all 
sectors 
reflects 
many 
years 
of 
neglect 
and 
destruction 
during 
the 
198Os, 
and 
will 
take 
a 
persistent 
effort 
over 
many 
years 
to 
correct. 
Given 
its 
severe 
fiscal 
constraints, 
the 
government 
will 
not 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
finance 
the 
investments 
needed 
to 
significantly 
expend 
the 
infrastructure 
network. 
Therefore, 
its 
strategy 
is 
to 
(i) 
rely 
on 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
infrastructure 
to 
finance 
most 
of 
the 
expansion 
in 
telecommunications 
and 
energy, 
(ii) 
establish 
a 
sustainable 
road 
maintenance 
system 
to 
increase 
the 
impact 
and 
longevity 
of 
investments 
in 
roads, 
and 
rationalize 
the 
use 
of 
state-owned 
construction 
companies 
(COERCOs) 
to 
increase 
the 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
transport 
expenditures, 
and 
(iii) 
develop 
a 
cluster 
development 
approach 
whereby 
public 
investments 
are 
initially 
Page  14
concentrated 
in 
areas 
deemed 
to 
have 
the 
greatest 
growth 
potential. 
To 
strengthen 
investment 
promotion 
efforts, 
the 
government 
is 
refocusing 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Center 
for 
Exports 
and 
Investments 
toward 
export 
promotion, 
while 
creating 
a 
new 
commission 
(Pro-Nicaragua) 
to 
focus 
exclusively 
on 
investment 
promotion. 
(This 
had 
been 
recommended 
in 
an 
earlier 
FIAS 
study.) 
To 
strengthen 
property 
rights, 
the 
government 
is 
modernizing 
the 
land 
registry, 
followed 
by 
the 
cadastre, 
which 
will 
facilitate 
a 
more 
systematic 
and 
comprehensive 
titling 
process. 
These 
measures 
will 
be 
complemented 
by 
the 
passage 
of 
a 
law 
regulating 
the 
process 
of 
demarcation 
and 
titling 
of 
lands 
of 
indigenous 
and 
ethnic 
communities 
on 
the 
Atlantic 
Coast. 
The 
govemment 
is 
planning 
to 
develop 
a 
competition 
framework, 
which 
may 
require 
modernizing 
the 
Commercial 
Code. 
To 
address 
the 
weak 
financial 
system, 
the 
government 
will 
continue 
strengthening 
the 
Superintendency 
of 
Banks 
and 
revising 
prudential 
norms, 
and 
revise 
the 
framework 
for 
the 
asset 
resolution 
process 
to 
be 
better 
prepared 
for 
future 
banking 
crises. 
(In 
its 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy, 
the 
government 
is 
requesting 
IDA 
and 
IMF 
assistance 
under 
the 
Financial 
Sector 
Assessment 
Program 
to 
identify 
the 
most 
important 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
financial 
sector 
and 
develop 
a 
plan 
of 
actions 
to 
correct 
them.) 
Finally, 
the 
government 
plans 
to 
complete 
the 
pension 
reform 
process, 
which 
establishes 
a 
new 
funded 
system 
with 
the 
two-fold 
objective 
of 
placing 
the 
pension 
system 
on 
an 
actuarially 
sound 
basis 
and 
creating 
a 
source 
for 
long 
term 
savings 
that 
should 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
the 
development 
of 
local 
capital 
markets. 
27 
Expected 
Results. 
The 
main 
result 
expected 
from 
this 
strategy 
is 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
private 
direct 
investment, 
which 
would 
provide 
prima 
facie 
evidence 
of 
a 
successfully 
applied 
strategy. 
Other 
results 
expected 
are: 
a 
a 
successfully 
operating 
investment 
promotion 
commission, 
resulting 
in 
greater 
complementarity 
between 
public 
and 
private 
investments, 
0 
more 
secure 
property 
rights, 
through 
the 
modernization 
of 
the 
cadastre 
and 
public 
registry, 
and 
advances 
in 
the 
titling 
of 
properties, 
e 
clearer, 
more 
effective 
rural 
sector 
and 
forestry 
sector 
policies 
and 
investment 
plans, 
0 
a

system, 
0 
significant 
improvements 
in 
the 
flow 
of

services, 
* 
a 
significant 
expansion 
in 
telecommunications 
and 
energy 
infrastructure,

* 
a 
significant 
expansion 
of 
domestic 
savings 
through 
the 
new

28 
PSAC 
Prior 
Actimzs. 
To 
achieve 
these 
results, 
the 
Nicaraguan 
government 
has 
(i) 
implemented 
an 
adequate 
macroeconomic 
framework 
during 
the 
course 
of 
2002 
(which 
permitted 
reaching 
agreement 
with 
the 
IMF 
on 
a 
new 
PRGF 
arrangement), 
(ii) 
presented 
a 
satisfactory 
report 
to 
IDA 
on 
poverty-focused 
and 
overall 
public 
spending 
executed 
in 
2001, 
to 
be 
used 
as 
baseline 
for 
future 
expenditure 
monitoring 
purposes, 
(iii) 
adopted 
new 
regulations 
and 
by-laws 
for 
INTA 
to 
encourage 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
market 
for 
providers 
of 
agricultural 
technology 
services, 
and 
created 
the 
Technology 
and 
Forest 
Development 
Foundation 
(FUNICA) 
to, 
inter 
alia, 
administer 
a 
competitive 
fund 
to 
finance 
agricultural 
services, 
FAITAN, 
(iv) 
divested 
51 
percent 
of 
the 
state 
telecommunications 
company, 
ENITEL, 
and 
assigned 
ENEL’s 
power 
generating 
Page  15
operations 
to 
four 
successor 
companies 
of 
ENEL, 
two 
of 
which 
have 
been 
either 
sold 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
or 
are 
being 
operated 
by 
the 
private 
sector. 
These 
achievements 
have 
been 
proposed 
as 
prior 
actions 
for 
disbursement 
of 
the 
PSAC. 
29 
Other 
actions 
contemplated 
in 
the 
program 
that 
could 
be 
supported 
through 
subsequent 
adjustment 
operations 
include 
(i) 
agreement 
with 
IDA 
on 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
annual 
fiscal 
budget 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
Assembly, 
with 
outlays 
related 
to 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
representing 
at 
least 
47 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
proposed 
fiscal 
budget 
in 
2004 
and 
50 
percent 
in 
2005, 
(ii) 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
demarcation 
and 
titling 
of 
land 
in 
at 
least 
5 
indigenous 
communities 
in 
the 
Atlantic 
Coast 
and 
Bosawas 
region, 
(iii) 
the 
restructuring 
and 
strengthening 
the 
rural 
electrification 
fund 
(FODIEN) 
and 
creation 
of 
the 
telecom 
investment 
fund 
(FITEL), 
while 
having 
established 
a 
clear 
policy 
on 
long 
term 
funding 
and 
allocation 
mechanisms 
of 
subsidies 
for 
both 
programs, 
(iv) 
progress 
in 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
pension 
reform 
program 
as 
reflected 
in 
the 
appointment 
of 
a 
new 
Superintendent 
of 
Pensions, 
the 
streamlining 
of 
the 
organizational 
structure 
and 
staffing 
of 
the 
Superintendency 
of 
Pensions 
in 
line 
with 
fiscal 
budget 
constraints, 
the 
awarding 
of 
licenses 
to 
two 
private 
fund 
managers, 
the 
restructuring 
of 
INSS 
and 
the 
transfer 
of 
eligible 
social 
security 
contributions 
to 
the 
new 
pension 
system, 
and 
(v) 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
revised 
productive 
sector 
policy 
and 
development 
of 
a 
sector-wide 
investment 
plan 
(with 
special 
reference 
to 
the 
agricultural 
technology 
and 
forestry 
sectors) 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
macroeconomic 
program, 
in 
broad 
consultation 
with 
the 
private 
sector, 
donors 
and 
non-governmental 
organizations. 
D. 
Second 
Pillar 
- 
Greater 
and 
Better 
Investment 
in 
Human 
Capital 
30 
This 
pillar 
aims 
to 
increase 
the 
human 
capital 
of 
the 
poor 
through 
investments 
in 
basic 
education 
and 
technical 
training, 
preventive 
health 
care 
at 
the 
primary 
level, 
child 
nutrition 
and 
a 
stronger 
population 
policy, 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
their 
productivity, 
income 
and 
welfare. 
Structural 
reforms 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
are 
vital 
to 
the 
success 
of 
these 
efforts 
in 
view 
of 
very 
tight 
budget 
constraints 
that 
force 
the 
government 
to 
limit 
its 
social 
budget 
and 
look 
instead 
for 
institutional 
strengthening 
and 
operational 
efficiency 
gains. 
Two 
key 
ongoing 
decentralization 
efforts 
that 
the 
government 
seeks 
to 
enhance 
in 
the 
education 
and 
health 
sectors 
involve 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
power 
of 
local 
autonomy 
and 
the 
need 
to 
provide 
an 
adequate 
framework 
of 
incentives 
for 
quality 
and 
equity 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
31 
. 
The 
proposed 
PSAC 
aims 
to 
support 
this 
pillar 
of 
the 
PRSP 
by 
focusing 
on 
measures 
to 
raise 
the 
coverage 
and 
quality 
of 
primary 
education, 
increase 
the 
coverage 
and 
quality 
of 
basic 
health 
services, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas, 
improve 
child 
nutrition 
indicators, 
increase 
the 
coverage 
of 
water 
and 
sanitation 
services, 
and 
strengthen 
reproductive 
health 
programs. 
These 
measures 
are 
being 
complemented 
by 
support 
from 
ongoing 
projects 
in 
health 
and 
education 
being 
financed 
by 
IDA, 
IDB 
and 
other 
donors. 
32 
Kev 
Issues. 
Nicaragua’s 
social 
indicators 
are 
among 
the 
worst 
in 
the 
region. 
Although 
they 
have 
exhibited 
advances 
in 
many 
areas 
during 
the 
last 
decade, 
some 
key 
indicators 
such 
as 
child 
malnutrition 
rates, 
the 
illiteracy 
rate 
and 
maternal 
mortality 
have 
Page  16
not 
changed 
much. 
Also, 
population 
growth 
rates 
remain 
inordinately 
high, 
especially 
among 
the 
poor. 
Nicaragua’s 
social 
indicators 
are 
held 
back 
by 
the 
extremely 
low 
levels 
of 
social 
spending. 
Although 
this 
mainly 
reflects 
the 
country’s 
very 
low 
overall 
income 
levels, 
the 
share 
of 
public 
spending 
devoted 
to 
the 
social 
sectors 
also 
has 
been 
low 
by 
Latin 
American 
standards. 
Improving 
Nicaragua’s 
social 
indicators, 
therefore, 
will 
require 
both 
faster 
growth 
as 
well 
as 
more 
fiscal 
resources. 
Even 
if 
social 
spending 
in 
Nicaragua 
were 
to 
double, 
however, 
it 
would 
still 
remain 
far 
below 
the 
average 
per 
capita 
social 
spending 
in 
the 
other 
Latin 
American 
countries. 
This 
means 
that 
increasing 
the 
pace 
of 
improvement 
in 
social 
indicators 
also 
will 
require 
major 
sector 
reforms 
to 
create 
better 
incentives 
and 
raise 
efficiency 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
social 
services. 
33 
. 
Reform 
Stratem. 
The 
education 
strategy 
focuses 
on 
the 
delivery 
of 
quality 
educational 
services 
that 
would 
depend 
upon 
an 
adequate 
mechanism 
of 
incentives 
to 
provide 
those 
services. 
Central 
to 
the 
strategy 
is 
an 
initiative 
to 
provide 
financial 
and 
administrative 
autonomy 
to 
schools 
that 
would 
be 
more 
responsive 
to 
the 
local 
community 
that 
they 
serve, 
backed 
up 
by 
a 
strong, 
centrally 
managed 
system 
that 
would 
ensure 
an 
adherence 
to 
minimum 
quality 
standards, 
to 
capture 
spillover 
benefits 
between 
decentralized 
units, 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
equity 
objectives 
are 
not 
undermined 
due 
to 
decentralization. 
In 
addition 
to 
efforts 
to 
provide 
greater 
autonomy 
to 
schools, 
the 
government 
also 
plans 
to 
expand 
the 
coverage 
of 
preschool 
and 
make 
selective 
investments 
in 
providing 
access 
to 
school 
for 
children 
unable 
to 
attend 
early 
grades 
because 
of 
their 
distance 
to 
the 
school 
site. 
Additional 
investments 
to 
improve 
schools 
and 
schooling 
would 
guarantee 
a 
minimum 
quality 
standard 
of 
schooling 
inputs, 
conditions, 
and 
services 
for 
all 
schools, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
program 
of 
incentives 
to 
parent/school 
councils 
to 
steadily 
increase 
the 
quality 
of 
their 
schools 
and 
achieve 
higher 
outcomes 
for 
their 
students. 
The 
curricula 
of 
the 
teacher 
training 
institutes 
are 
to 
be 
improved 
and 
expanded 
to 
make 
them 
more 
relevant 
for 
local 
needs. 
34 
For 
the 
Atlantic 
Coast, 
the 
PRSP 
emphasizes 
the 
continued 
use 
of 
instruction 
in 
the 
mother 
tongue 
in 
the 
initial 
grades 
while 
strengthening 
the 
attainment 
of 
Spanish 
language 
proficiency. 
A 
series 
of 
studies 
are 
planned 
to 
assess 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
relevance 
of 
technical 
and 
tertiary 
education 
with 
a 
view 
toward 
possible 
reforms. 
(Such 
reforms 
could 
become 
an 
important 
engine 
for 
increasing 
productivity 
growth 
and 
for 
widening 
the 
skills 
and 
adaptivity 
of 
the 
workforce; 
both 
of 
which 
would 
enhance 
private 
sector 
growth 
and 
encourage 
FDI.) 
Finally, 
the 
PRSP 
proposes 
a 
family 
subsidy 
program 
to 
encourage 
very 
poor 
children 
to 
attend 
primary 
school 
on 
a 
regular 
basis. 
35 
The 
Government 
submitted 
a 
proposal 
for 
funding 
to 
the 
Secretariat 
of 
the 
Education 
for 
All 
- 
Fast 
Track 
Initiative 
(EFA-FTI), 
an 
initiative 
of 
international 
donor 
countries 
to 
provide 
grant 
financing 
for 
deserving 
countries 
towards 
the 
goal 
of 
assuring 
that 
by 
2015 
all 
children 
will 
obtain 
at 
least 
a 
complete 
primary 
school 
education. 
Nicaragua’s 
proposed 
EFA-FTI 
is 
built 
around 
a 
two-pronged 
strategy. 
First, 
it 
would 
provide 
school 
councils 
of 
all 
of 
the 
nation’s 
schools 
with 
resources, 
guidelines 
and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
raise 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
services 
their 
schools 
deliver, 
step-by-step, 
to 
guarantee 
adequate 
learning 
for 
all 
of 
the 
children 
in 
their 
community, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
holding 
these 
councils 
accountable 
for 
results. 
Page  17
Second, 
the 
proposed 
plan 
would 
provide 
demand-side 
subsidies 
through 
a 
scholarship 
incentive 
fund, 
integrating 
the 
Red 
de 
Protection 
Social 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education’s 
Beta 
program, 
to 
help 
children 
from 
the 
poorest 
families 
overcome 
hardships 
to 
enroll 
in 
school 
and 
attend 
class 
daily. 
The 
proposed 
program 
would 
also 
promote 
the 
engagement 
of 
parents 
and 
civil 
society 
in 
the 
education 
process, 
provide 
adequate 
educational 
material, 
and 
measure 
results. 
The 
educational 
administration 
at 
all 
levels 
would 
be 
strengthened 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
experiences 
from 
successful 
interventions 
and 
would 
be 
able 
to 
assist 
areas 
where 
results 
have 
been 
lacking. 
Representatives 
of 
the 
donor 
community 
have 
recently 
formally 
agreed 
to 
support 
Nicaragua’s 
EFA-FTI 
program. 
Work 
is 
now 
proceeding 
to 
build 
the 
required 
capacity 
and 
close 
the 
financing 
gap 
. 
36 
The 
health 
sector 
strategy 
contemplated 
in 
the 
PRSP 
focuses 
on 
improved 
implementation 
of 
the 
institutional 
modernization 
process, 
increasing 
the 
coverage 
and 
quality 
of 
health 
services 
and 
on 
promoting 
behavioral 
changes 
at 
the 
household 
level. 
The 
modernization 
process 
focuses 
on 
introducing 
results-based 
management 
practices, 
innovative 
ways 
of 
providing 
services 
in 
remote 
areas, 
alternative 
systems 
for 
procurement 
and 
distribution 
of 
medicines, 
the 
creation 
of 
special 
‘maternal 
houses’ 
to 
improve 
access 
to 
prenatal 
care 
and 
institutionalized 
births 
for 
women 
with 
obstetric 
risks, 
and 
a 
demand-driven 
process 
to 
target 
health 
services. 
The 
expansion 
of 
coverage 
focuses 
particularly 
on 
primary 
health 
care 
and 
on 
women 
of 
reproductive 
age, 
children 
and 
adolescents, 
and 
will 
involve 
the 
creation, 
rehabilitation 
and 
equipping 
of 
health 
care 
units 
in 
rural 
areas, 
together 
with 
the 
development 
of 
a 
cost 
effective 
package 
of 
basic 
services, 
which 
is 
to 
include 
reproductive 
health 
care 
services. 
Improving 
the 
patient 
referral 
system 
and 
expanding 
provision 
of 
vaccines 
at 
the 
primary 
level 
is 
also 
expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
a 
more 
efficient 
delivery 
of 
services. 
To 
achieve 
behavioral 
changes, 
the 
PRSP 
contemplates 
education 
programs 
to 
improve 
hygiene 
and 
nutrition 
practices 
at 
the 
community 
and 
household 
levels, 
in 
addition 
to 
their 
inclusion 
in 
the 
primary 
education 
curricula. 
Recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
access 
to 
safe 
water 
and 
sanitation 
for 
good 
health 
and 
nutrition 
outcomes, 
the 
PRSP 
also 
contemplates 
major 
investments 
to 
expand 
the 
national 
coverage 
of 
water 
and 
sanitation. 
37 
l 
In 
nutrition, 
the 
strategy 
focuses 
on 
preventive 
measures 
directed 
at 
the 
chronic 
malnutrition 
problems 
of 
children 
under 
two 
years 
of 
age. 
It 
particularly 
stresses 
family 
and 
community 
actions 
and 
programs 
to 
encourage 
healthy 
diets, 
hygiene, 
preventive 
health, 
and 
child/maternal 
care. 
Specific 
activities 
will 
concentrate 
on 
monitoring 
the 
physical 
development 
of 
children, 
negotiating 
constructive 
feeding 
and 
food 
preparation 
practices 
at 
the 
household 
level, 
and 
distributing 
vitamin 
supplements 
to 
nursing 
and 
expectant 
mothers 
and 
to 
children 
38 
In 
population, 
the 
strategy 
aims 
to

PSAC 
Prior 
Actions. 
Since 
the 
full-PRSP 
was 
presented 
in 
September 
2001, 
the 
National 
Assembly 
approved 
the 
school 
autonomy 
law 
(“Ley 
de 
Participation 
Educativa”) 
and 
the 
general 
health 
law 
(“Ley 
General 
de 
Salud)“), 
which 
provide 
the 
framework 
for 
comprehensive, 
decentralizing 
reforms 
in 
the 
education 
and 
health 
sectors 
that 
seek 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
schooling 
and 
health 
services, 
and 
the 
government 
has 
initiated 
implementation 
of 
measures 
contemplated 
by 
these 
reforms. 
In 
education, 
the 
measures 
implemented 
included 
training 
2800 
school 
council 
members 
on 
their 
responsibilities 
under 
the 
law 
and 
its 
regulation, 
distributing 
20,000 
copies 
of 
the 
law 
to 
all 
school 
councils, 
parents 
and 
teachers, 
arranging 
for 
50 
percent 
of 
all 
public 
schools 
to 
receive 
direct 
financial 
transfers 
as 
provided 
under 
the 
school 
autonomy 
law 
and 
its 
regulation 
for 
managing 
schools, 
and 
ensuring 
that 
these 
schools 
have 
been 
given 
the 
powers 
to 
hire 
and 
fire 
teachers, 
and 
carrying 
out 
a 
pilot 
program 
to 
analyze 
the 
effects 
of 
implementing 
the 
school 
autonomy 
law 
and 
its 
regulation. 
Also, 
the 
government 
has 
implemented 
a 
results-based 
management 
system 
for 
basic 
health 
care 
in 
13 
municipalities. 
Finally, 
the 
government 
has 
increased 
the 
estimated 
percentage 
of 
the 
total 
national 
population 
served 
by 
potable 
water 
connections 
by 
at 
least 
1.4 
percentage 
points 
per 
year 
in 
each 
of 
2000 
and 
2001, 
and 
increased 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
total 
population 
with 
access 
to 
sanitation 
services 
by 
0.7 
percentage 
points 
per 
year 
over 
the 
period 
1998-2001. 
41 
Further 
actions 
contemplated 
in 
the 
program 
that 
may 
be 
supported 
with 
subsequent 
adjustment 
operations 
are 
(i) 
the 
development 
of 
a 
national 
strategy 
for 
expanding 
water 
and 
sanitation 
coverage, 
including 
targets 
for 
areas 
in 
extreme 
poverty,

and 
its 
implementation, 
(ii) 
the 
implementation 
of 
actions 
contemplated 
under 
the 
school 
autonomy 
law, 
reflected 
in 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
“School 
Autonomy 
for 
Results” 
program 
to 
at 
least 
70 
municipalities, 
the 
transfer 
of 
additional 
schools 
from 
the 
traditional 
to 
the 
autonomous 
system 
in 
accordance 
with 
program 
targets, 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
adequate 
financial 
transfers 
to 
schools 
for 
infrastructure, 
didactic 
materials, 
training, 
and 
pedagogical 
and 
administrative 
support, 
and 
(iii) 
the 
replacement 
of 
the 
many 
primary 
health 
care 
models 
that 
are 
currently 
in 
use 
in 
the 
various 
health 
areas 
by 
the 
most 
cost- 
effective 
model, 
which 
remains 
to 
be 
identified. 
E. 
Third 
pillar

Better 
Protection 
for

This 
pillar 
seeks 
to 
guarantee 
access 
to 
basic 
social 
services 
for 
Nicaragua’s 
extreme 
poor 
and 
protect 
them 
from 
natural 
and 
economic

that 
perpetuate

43 
Kev 
Issue. 
Nicaragua 
has 
received 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
resources 
for 
social 
assistance 
over 
the 
last 
decade, 
but 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
coherent 
social 
protection 
strategy 
has 
diluted 
their 
impact, 
as 
many 
programs 
intended 
to 
benefit 
the 
poor 
and 
vulnerable 
are 
characterized 
by 
duplication, 
insufficient 
targeting, 
limited 
coverage, 
unknown 
administrative 
costs 
and 
limited 
information 
about 
their 
impact. 
In 
addition, 
major 
vulnerable 
groups 
of 
the 
population, 
e.g., 
children 
aged 
O-5 
years 
and 
poor 
youth 
receive 
insufficient 
attention. 
44 
Reform 
Strateffv 
Although 
the 
government 
is 
still 
in 
the 
process 
of 
developing 
a 
social 
protection 
strategy, 
immediate 
efforts 
in 
this 
area 
have 
focused 
on 
a 
program 
that 
assists 
young 
children 
in 
extremely 
poor 
households 
by 
encouraging 
their 
attendance 
in 
school 
and 
regular 
medical 
visits 
for 
checkups 
and 
vaccinations 
through 
incentives 
to 
their 
parents. 
This 
program 
has 
undergone 
a 
first 
pilot 
phase, 
was 
assessed 
positively 
and 
is 
being 
expanded. 
As 
part 
of 
its 
longer 
term 
strategy, 
the 
government 
is 
strengthening 
the 
public 
institutions 
responsible 
for 
social 
safety 
nets, 
such 
as 
the 
Ministry 
of 
the 
Family, 
and 
rationalizing 
the 
institutional 
roles 
of 
multiple 
entities 
involved 
in 
providing 
services 
to 
vulnerable 
groups. 
The 
design 
on 
assistance 
programs 
is 
being 
improved, 
with 
clearer 
targeting 
and 
monitoring 
mechanisms, 
and 
clear 
exit 
mechanisms 
to 
avoid 
dependency. 
In 
addition, 
the 
government 
is 
evaluating 
several 
programs 
targeted 
at 
children 
aged 
O-3 
years, 
based 
on 
common 
indicators, 
to 
develop 
an 
early 
childhood 
development 
strategy 
for 
the 
country 
and 
expand 
suitable 
programs 
accordingly. 
Related 
actions 
include 
efforts 
to 
improve 
preparedness 
toward 
natural 
disasters 
and 
mitigate 
their 
impact 
more 
effectively, 
as 
well 
as 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
the 
institutional 
capabilities 
of 
local 
governments 
and 
communities 
to 
deal 
with 
disasters 
and 
reduce 
vulnerability.

Prior 
Action. 
No 
prior 
actions 
are

in

this 
pillar. 
The 
adoption 
of 
a 
coherent 
and 
fiscally 
sustainable 
strategy 
and 
its 
partial 
implementation 
are 
proposed 
as 
a 
prior 
action 
for 
the 
next

credit, 
with 
follow-up 
measures 
derived 
from 
that 
strategy 
to 
be 
included 
as 
prior 
actions 
in 
subsequent 
credits. 
In 
supporting 
the 
design 
of 
a 
social 
protection 
strategy, 
IDA 
is 
placing 
special 
attention 
on 
children 
aged 
up 
to 
three

which 
have 
been 
identified 
as 
among 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
members 
of

the 
approval 
by 
the 
Cabinet 
of 
a

IF. 
Fourth 
Pillar 
- 
Good 
Governance 
and 
Institutional 
Development 
48 
. 
Good 
governance 
is 
being 
given 
special 
emphasis 
by 
the 
Bolanos 
administration, 
whose 
agenda 
during 
the 
first 
year 
in 
office 
has 
been 
dominated 
by 
an 
anti-corruption 
campaign. 
Under 
this 
pillar, 
the 
PRSP 
focuses 
on 
(i) 
consolidating 
Nicaragua’s 
democracy 
by 
developing 
strong 
independent 
institutions, 
especially 
the 
National 
Assembly, 
Judiciary 
and 
Comptroller 
General’s 
office, 
and 
better 
administration 
of 
law 
and 
justice 
(ii) 
improving 
financial 
management 
in 
the 
public 
sector, 
and 
the 
transparency 
and 
provision 
of 
timely 
information 
by 
the 
government, 
(iii) 
fighting 
corruption 
and 
strengthening 
ethical 
values, 
and 
promoting 
greater 
civil 
society 
participation 
in 
government 
affairs. 
The 
PSAC 
aims 
to 
support 
this 
pillar 
by 
focusing 
attention 
on 
measures 
to 
improve 
public 
sector 
financial 
and 
expenditure 
management 
as 
a 
key 
vehicle 
for 
raising 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
expenditures 
and 
strengthening 
donor 
coordination, 
and 
on 
civil 
service 
reform. 
These 
efforts 
are 
complemented 
by 
IDA 
support 
through 
the 
ongoing 
Economic 
Management 
Technical 
Assistance 
Credit 
and 
other 
donor-supported 
projects. 
49 
Kev 
Issues. 
Nicaragua 
ranked 
8 
lSt 
among 
102 
countries 
in 
the 
Transparency 
International’s 
Corruption 
Perceptions 
Index 
2002. 
This 
constitutes 
an 
important 
negative 
signal 
for 
potential 
investors 
interested 
in 
expanding 
their 
operations 
in 
the 
region. 
A 
lack 
of 
trust 
in 
the 
public 
sector’s 
financial 
management 
is 
a 
major 
obstacle 
to 
better 
donor 
coordination, 
as 
each 
donors 
seeks 
to 
maintain 
separate 
(and 
costly) 
project 
administration 
units. 
Inadequate 
donor 
coordination, 
in 
turn, 
is 
an 
important 
reason 
why 
the 
large 
amounts 
of 
foreign 
aid 
that 
Nicaragua 
has 
received 
in 
the 
last 
two 
decades 
has 
not 
had 
a 
greater 
impact. 
This 
pillar, 
therefore, 
plays 
a 
major 
role 
in 
the 
administration’s 
efforts 
to 
promote 
faster, 
private 
investment-led 
growth 
and 
to 
increase 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
Efforts 
to 
strengthen 
public 
sector 
management 
and 
fight 
corruption 
require 
the 
modernization 
of 
financial 
accounting 
systems 
and 
the 
development 
of 
a 
stable, 
professional 
civil 
service 
that 
provides 
continuity 
in 
public 
administrations 
and 
is 
not 
held 
hostage 
by 
politics. 
An 
integrated 
financial 
management 
system 
(SIGFA) 
for 
the 
public 
sector 
began 
to 
be 
developed 
in 
1995, 
but 
it 
proceeded 
very 
slowly 
and 
only 
began 
to 
show 
major 
results 
in 
the 
last 
two 
years. 
Since 
the 
SIGFA 
constrains 
public 
Page  21
administrators 
to 
obey 
budgetary 
and 
other 
guidelines, 
there 
is 
often 
an 
incentive 
to 
suspend 
or 
de-activate 
such 
systems; 
as 
happened 
recently 
in 
other 
countries. 
To 
avoid 
such 
an 
outcome, 
it 
may 
be 
advisable 
to 
pass 
a 
Public 
Financial 
Management 
Law, 
that 
would, 
among 
other, 
lock 
the 
SIGFA 
in 
place. 
Until 
1999, 
when 
a 
new 
procurement 
law 
was 
issued, 
the 
procurement 
system 
was 
obsolete, 
inefficient 
and 
non-transparent. 
Although 
the 
new 
procurement 
law 
has 
substantially 
improved 
the 
overall 
procurement 
system, 
there 
is 
still 
room 
for 
improvement 
of 
efficiency 
and 
transparency, 
and 
in 
making 
the 
law 
more 
compatible 
with 
international 
practices. 
A 
draft 
law 
to 
reform 
the 
civil 
service 
system 
was 
presented 
to 
the 
National 
Assembly 
in 
end-1999, 
but 
has 
been 
held 
up 
by 
concerns 
that 
this 
could 
result 
in 
a 
more 
inflexible 
system 
of 
‘tenured’ 
civil 
servants, 
while 
others 
fear 
that 
it 
may 
not 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
country’s 
labor 
code. 
Improved 
tax 
administration 
is 
crucial 
for 
bringing 
Nicaragua’s 
fiscal 
deficit 
under 
control. 
Once 
the 
sub-valuation 
of 
GDP 
is 
taken 
into 
account, 
Nicaragua’s 
tax 
revenues 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP 
is 
low 
by 
regional 
standards, 
even 
though 
the 
tax 
rates 
themselves 
are 
about 
the 
same. 
This 
means 
that 
efforts 
to 
improve 
tax 
administration 
and 
expand 
the 
tax 
base 
are 
vital 
for 
putting 
public 
finances 
on 
a 
sound 
basis 
without 
putting 
Nicaraguan 
businesses 
at 
a 
competitive 
disadvantage 
vis-a-vis 
firms 
in 
neighboring 
countries.2 
50 
Reform 
,Stratem 
With 
the 
objective 
of 
improving 
financial 
management 
and 
transparency, 
the 
Government 
has 
agreed 
to 
the 
initiation 
of 
a 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
and 
of 
a 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR), 
to 
identify 
the 
most 
important 
gaps 
and 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
country’s 
fiduciary 
arrangements 
and 
public 
expenditure 
management 
systems, 
and 
help 
define 
a 
program 
of 
corrective 
actions. 
Following 
up 
on 
the 
earlier 
recommendations 
of 
the 
FY2001 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(which 
are 
supported 
by 
the 
preliminary 
findings 
from 
the 
ongoing 
CFAA 
and 
CPAR 
teams), 
the 
strategy 
emphasizes 
the 
operation 
of 
a 
reliable 
integrated 
financial 
management 
system 
in 
the 
central 
government, 
to 
be 
expanded 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
public 
sector, 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
Single 
Treasury 
Account 
as 
a 
channel 
for 
all 
public 
(domestic 
and 
foreign) 
resources 
that 
can 
be 
better 
monitored, 
strengthening 
the 
National 
System 
of 
Public 
Investment 
(SNIP) 
as 
the 
vehicle 
to 
review 
technically 
all 
public 
investment 
proposals, 
and 
the 
modernization 
of 
the 
public 
procurement 
system. 
(Other 
relevant 
areas 
are 
the 
strengthening 
of 
internal 
controls 
and 
audit 
functions, 
the 
accountability 
on 
budget 
transfers, 
improvement 
of 
government 
financial 
statements 
and 
records, 
enhancement 
of 
external 
audit 
reporting 
and 
public 
access 
to 
information.) 
The 
reform 
strategy 
also 
contemplates 
the 
development

mechanisms 
to 
systematically 
review 
and 
assess 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
programs. 
Steps 
are 
being 
taken 
to 
strengthen 
the 
budgeting 
and 
expenditure 
planning 
framework, 
which 
would 
provide 
the 
base 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
medium 
term 
expenditure 
framework. 
The 
Government 
is 
planning 
to 
strengthen 
donor 
coordination 
mechanisms, 
among 
other 
things, 
through 
the 
establishrnent 
of 
sector 
coordination 
boards 
(‘mesas 
sectoriales’). 
A 
financial 
and 
real 
resource 
accounting 
mechanism 
is 
being 
set 
up 
through 
the 
Supplementary 
Social 
Fund 
(FSS) 
to 
track 
the 
use 
of 
debt 
relief 
provided 
under 
the 
HIPC 
initiative. 
An 
especially 
important 
feature 
of 
this 
mechanism 
is 
the 
systematic 
provision

The 
IDB 
already 
has

several 
TA 
operations 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Customs 
Administration 
(DGA) 
and 
Domestic 
Tax 
Administration 
(DGI), 
and 
is 
planning 
to 
focus 
on 
improving 
the 
tax 
in 
its 
new 
CAS 
period, 
which 
should 
cover 
foreseeable 
assistance 
requirements 
in 
this 
area.

Passage 
of 
the 
law 
to 
professionalize 
the 
civil 
service, 
clarifying 
the 
accountability 
and 
functions 
of 
public 
servants, 
is 
a 
critical 
step 
in 
the 
strategy 
to 
fight 
corruption 
and 
strengthen 
ethical 
values. 
Toward 
this 
end, 
the 
Government 
has 
been 
meeting 
with 
representatives 
of 
trade 
unions 
and 
the 
political 
opposition, 
to 
inform 
them 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
this 
law 
and 
discuss 
safeguards. 
Finally, 
the 
participation 
of 
civil 
society 
in 
public 
affairs, 
promoted 
through 
CONPES, 
is 
to 
be 
further 
strengthened 
through 
legislation 
to 
codify 
the 
participation 
of 
citizens 
in 
government 
processes. 
51 
Expected 
Results. 
An 
important 
result 
expected 
under 
this 
strategy 
is 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
share 
of 
total 
external 
funds 
that 
are 
channeled 
through 
the 
Single 
Treasury 
account, 
which 
would 
reflect 
the 
donors’ 
increased 
confidence 
in 
the 
governance

is

that 
will

G. 
Cross-Cutting 
Themes 
54 
. 
The 
PRS 
also 
refers 
to 
three 
themes 
that 
cut 
across 
the 
four 
pillars: 
environmental 
vulnerability, 
social 
equity 
and 
decentralization. 
The 
plans 
to 
reduce 
ecological 
vulnerability 
are 
laid 
out 
in 
Nicaragua’s 
Environment 
Policy 
and 
Action 
Plan 
2000-2005 
(PANic) 
that 
was 
approved 
on 
23 
February 
2001. 
It 
lays 
out 
16 
areas 
where 
the 
government 
will 
take 
environmental 
actions, 
including 
the 
promotion 
of 
a 
sustainable 
development 
model, 
harmonizing 
legislation 
that 
affects 
the 
environment, 
developing 
a 
national 
environmental 
information 
system, 
promoting 
environmental 
education, 
developing 
ways 
to 
charge 
for 
pollution 
costs 
and 
ensuring 
the 
use 
of 
environmental 
parameters 
in 
public 
projects 
to 
measures 
cost 
and 
benefits. 
Actions 
to 
promote 
social 
equity 
include 
reviewing 
legislation 
affecting 
indigenous 
groups, 
the 
children 
and 
adolescents’ 
code, 
and 
the 
adoption 
law. 
These 
reviews 
are 
expected 
to 
lead 
to 
important 
draft 
legislation 
to 
improve 
the 
rights 
of 
these 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Also, 
the 
strategy 
contemplates 
the 
development 
of 
action 
plans 
to 
improve 
opportunities 
for 
men 
and 
women, 
assist 
rural 
women 
and 
reduce 
domestic 
violence. 
Finally, 
the 
PRSP 
considers 
decentralization 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
Nicaragua’s 
modernization 
and 
reform 
process. 
In 
this 
context, 
it 
encompasses 
plans 
to 
strengthen 
the 
municipalities 
through 
development 
of 
better 
financing 
systems, 
improving 
their 
planning 
capabilities 
and 
strengthening 
their 
capacity 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
their 
performance. 
These 
three 
themes 
have 
been 
mainstreamed 
into 
the 
overall 
IDA 
program, 
and 
are 
reflected 
in 
various 
of 
the 
programs 
supported 
by 
PSAC 
conditionality. 
In 
particular, 
the 
decentralization 
theme 
figures 
prominently 
in 
the 
education 
and 
health 
sector 
reforms.

WORLD 
BANK 
GROUP 
STRATEGY 
21 
55 
A 
full 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
for 
Nicaragua 
has 
been 
prepared 
in 
collaboration 
with 
IFC 
and 
MIGA, 
and 
is 
being 
presented 
to 
the 
Board 
in 
parallel 
with 
this 
memorandum 
A. 
The 
World 
Bank 
Group 
56 
The 
CAS 
proposes 
a 
new 
framework 
for 
World 
Bank 
Group 
assistance. 
Nicaragua’s 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
(PRSP) 
is 
at 
the 
center 
of 
this 
framework 
in 
that 
it 
establishes 
the 
targets 
and 
objectives 
to 
be 
pursued 
with 
World 
Bank 
Group 
support. 
The 
proposed 
IDA 
assistance 
to 
Nicaragua 
involves 
an 
increased 
reliance 
on 
program 
lending 
beginning 
with 
a 
Programmatic 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(PSAC) 
that 
will 
support 
key 
reforms 
that 
are 
needed 
to 
achieve 
the 
PRSP 
targets. 
IDA’s 
assistance 
strategy 
contemplates 
a 
move 
towards 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Support 
Credits 
(PRSCs) 
once 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
required 
environment 
for 
this 
type 
of 
assistance 
is 
in 
place, 
i.e. 
that 
the 
public 
expenditure 
program 
supports 
PRSP 
implementation 
adequately, 
and 
that 
public 
financial 
management 
and 
procurement 
systems 
are 
in 
place 
to 
ensure 
the 
transparent, 
economic 
and 
efficient 
use 
of 
Government 
resources. 
Some 
of 
the 
required 
analytical 
work 
in 
this 
area 
has 
been 
completed, 
but 
key 
fiduciary 
assessments 
are 
still 
under 
preparation.3 
Preliminary 
findings 
indicate 
that 
the 
framework 
for 
providing 
financial 
assistance 
through 
a 
PRSC 
could 
be 
in 
place 
in 
FY04. 
Complementing 
the 
PRGF 
arrangement 
with 
the 
IMF, 
the 
PSAC 
and 
PRSCs 
will 
provide 
assistance 
that 
is 
conditioned 
on 
progress 
made 
in 
implementing 
specific 
measures 
contemplated 
in 
the 
PRSP, 
which 
coincide 
with 
key 
actions 
broadly 
identified 
in 
the 
HIPC 
Completion 
Point 
matrix. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
move 
towards 
PRSCs 
would 
improve 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
programs 
through 
better 
donor 
coordination 
and 
stronger 
country 
ownership. 
57 
Under 
this 
new 
framework, 
the 
bulk 
of 
IDA 
financial 
assistance 
eventually 
would 
be’ 
provided 
under 
the 
PRSCs 
(which 
would 
be 
larger 
in 
value 
terms 
than 
the 
PSAC). 
Once 
IDA’s 
investment 
assistance 
is 
provided 
under 
a 
PRSC 
framework, 
remaining 
IDA 
operations 
would 
consist 
mainly 
of 
technical 
assistance 
operations 
to 
help 
implement 
’ 
IDA 
is 
well 
advanced 
in 
completing 
the 
core 
diagnostic 
sector 
work 
for 
Nicaragua, 
but 
additional 
work 
is 
needed 
to 
move 
towards 
a 
PRSC 
framework. 
A 
detailed 
Poverty 
Assessment 
(PA) 
(FY02), 
based 
on 
the 
1998 
LSMS 
supported 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
PRSP, 
while 
the 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(PER) 
(FY02) 
presented 
recommendations 
for 
improving 
the 
poverty 
focus 
of 
public 
spending, 
strengthening 
public 
expenditure 
management 
and 
establishing 
a 
HIPC 
tracking 
mechanism. 
An 
update 
to 
the 
PA 
is 
underway 
to 
incorporate 
the 
results 
of 
the 
2001 
LSMS. 
A 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
(FY03) 
and 
a 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(FY03) 
also 
are 
currently 
under 
preparation. 
Once 
these 
are 
completed 
and 
their 
findings 
discussed 
with 
the 
Government, 
the 
resulting 
recommendations 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
a 
Country 
Economic 
Memorandum 
or 
Development 
Policy 
Review 
(FY04), 
which 
will 
summarize 
actions 
needed 
and 
the 
Government’s 
program 
for 
moving 
towards 
a 
PRSC 
framework. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
the 
initial 
PSAC 
will 
support 
already 
identified 
reforms 
that 
aim 
to 
bring 
the 
Government’s 
program 
and 
policies 
in 
line 
with 
public 
expenditure 
and 
fiduciary 
pre-requisites 
for 
the 
PRSC 
framework. 
This 
is 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment, 
for 
example, 
where 
initial 
mission 
recommendations 
have 
already 
been 
incorporated 
as 
reforms 
to 
be 
supported 
under 
the 
PSAC.

specific 
measures 
contemplated 
in 
the 
PRSP 
and 
highlighted 
by 
the 
PSACPRSC 
policy 
matrix 
and 
of 
small, 
innovative 
projects 
of 
an 
experimental 
nature 
or 
for 
which 
the 
institutional 
infrastructure 
needs 
strengthening. 
To 
improve 
the 
overall 
institutional 
conditions 
for 
programmatic 
lending, 
ongoing 
and 
new 
investment 
projects 
will 
contain 
enhanced 
technical 
assistance 
components 
to 
build 
institutional 
capacity. 
The 
implementation 
of 
this 
new 
approach 
will 
also 
require 
important 
internal 
administrative 
adjustments 
in 
the 
form 
of 
enhanced 
task 
team 
coordination, 
more 
intense 
program 
supervision, 
a 
greater 
focus 
on 
analytic 
and 
advisory 
services 
(AAA), 
and 
an 
enhanced 
IDA 
field 
presence. 
58 
The 
overall 
IDA 
resource 
envelope 
available 
to 
Nicaragua 
for 
this 
CAS 
period 
(FY03-FY05) 
amounts 
to 
SDRBO 
million 
(or 
approximately 
US$ 
120 
million 
equivalent) 
in 
the 
base 
case. 
The 
proposed 
PSAC 
would 
amount 
to 
12.5 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
base 
case 
IDA 
allocation. 
Overall, 
three 
adjustment 
credits 
are 
foreseen 
over 
the 
period 
that 
the 
Bolafios 
administration 
is 
in 
power, 
two 
of 
which 
are 
expected 
in 
the 
base 
case 
to 
fall 
within 
the 
current 
CAS 
period. 
Together, 
these 
two 
operations 
would 
amount 
to 
about 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
base 
case 
IDA 
allocation. 
59 
In 
tandem 
with 
IDA, 
IFC 
and 
MIGA 
will 
support 
the 
four 
pillars 
of 
the 
PRSP, 
with 
a 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
the 
first 
pillar-broad 
based 
economic 
growth. 
IFC 
and 
MIGA 
will 
pursue 
their 
objectives 
in 
partnership 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
through 
investment 
and 
non-investment 
vehicles. 
IFC’s 
approach 
in 
Nicaragua 
is 
to 
support 
private 
sector 
development 
through 
activities 
at 
both 
the 
individual 
country 
and 
regional 
levels. 
In 
support 
of 
Nicaragua’s 
PRSP 
agenda, 
IFC 
will 
continue 
supporting 
Nicaragua’s 
private 
sector 
in 
priority 
areas 
such 
as 
(i) 
strengthening 
the 
financial 
sector 
and 
capital 
market, 
(ii) 
promoting 
foreign 
private 
investment 
in 
Nicaragua, 
(iii) 
broadening 
private 
participation 
in 
infrastructure, 
and 
(iv) 
reactivating 
growth 
in 
agriculture 
and 
industry. 
The 
scope 
of 
IFC’s 
future 
investments 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
pace 
of 
improvement 
in 
removing 
the 
structural 
obstacles 
identified 
in 
the 
2001 
PRSP, 
such 
as 
the 
fragile 
banking 
systems 
and 
weak 
property 
rights, 
and 
progress 
in 
addressing 
the 
fourth 
pillar-good 
governance 
and 
institutional 
development-which 
will 
be 
critical 
for 
improving

Coordination 
with 
the 
IMF 
60 
. 
As 
previously 
noted, 
the 
MT; 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
Nicaragua 
have 
concluded 
a 
new 
3-year 
PRGF 
arrangement, 
which 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
IMF’s 
Board 
in 
December 
2002. 
The 
I~!JIF 
will 
continue 
to 
concentrate 
on 
macroeconomic 
issues, 
focusing 
specifically 
on 
short- 
and 
medium--term 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
incentives. 
As 
before, 
IDA 
will 
closely 
collaborate 
and 
coordinate 
activities 
with 
the 
IIvIF. 
The 
staffs 
of 
the 
two 
institutions 
will 
continue 
to 
conduct 
joint 
PRSP 
missions 
and 
prepare 
joint 
assessments 
of 
PRSP 
Progress 
Reports, 
and 
are 
coordinating 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
PSAC 
and 
PRGF 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
instruments 
complement 
one 
another.

C. 
Coordination 
with 
the 
IDB 
and 
other 
Donors 
61 
The 
IDB 
is 
the 
largest 
aid-providing 
international 
financial 
institution 
in 
Nicaragua, 
followed 
by 
IDA, 
and 
it 
is 
currently 
also 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
preparing 
its 
assistance 
strategy 
for 
Nicaragua. 
Coordination 
with 
IDA 
has 
been 
very 
close 
in 
this 
endeavor: 
several 
CAS 
coordination 
meetings 
were 
held 
in 
2002 
and 
early 
drafts 
of 
both 
documents 
were 
shared 
on 
a 
confidential 
basis. 
As 
with 
IDA, 
the 
IDB’s 
assistance 
strategy 
also 
is 
being 
designed 
around 
the 
implementation 
of 
Nicaragua’s 
PRSP, 
but 
with 
a 
strategic 
focus 
on 
(i) 
economic 
growth, 
(ii) 
governance, 
and 
(iii) 
the 
productivity 
of 
the 
poorest 
groups. 
In 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
strategy, 
the 
IDB 
is 
contemplating 
several 
budget 
support 
operations 
that 
are 
similar 
in 
nature 
to 
the 
PSAC. 
The 
IDB 
has 
been 
responsible 
for 
coordinating 
periodic 
consultative 
group 
meetings, 
of 
which 
the 
next 
one 
is 
scheduled 
for 
February 
2003. 
62 
Although 
IDA 
and 
IDB 
programs 
often 
overlap 
across 
sectors, 
a 
certain 
division 
of’labor 
has 
emerged 
at 
the 
sub-sector 
level. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
fiscal 
reform, 
IDA 
has 
focused 
mainly 
on 
public 
expenditures, 
while 
IDB 
has 
focused 
on 
revenue 
mobilization. 
IDA 
has 
taken 
the 
lead 
in 
telecommunications 
sector 
reform, 
while 
IDB 
has 
been 
leading 
the 
energy 
and 
water 
utility 
reforms. 
In 
the 
governance 
area, 
IDA 
is 
focusing 
on 
financial 
management 
and 
civil 
service 
reform, 
while 
IDB 
has 
been 
focusing 
on 
strengthening 
procurement 
and 
auditing 
functions, 
and 
on 
the 
institutional 
development 
of 
the 
Comptroller 
General’s 
Office 
and 
the 
Judiciary. 
In 
the 
social 
sectors, 
IDA 
has 
been 
focusing 
on 
primary 
education, 
while 
IDB 
has 
focused 
on 
secondary 
and 
tertiary 
education. 
(In 
areas 
of 
clear 
overlap, 
such 
as 
in 
the 
health 
sectors 
and 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
social 
infrastructure, 
both 
institutions 
have 
entered 
into 
a 
co-financing 
arrangement 
under 
joint 
project 
management 
structures.) 
The 
areas 
of 
the 
PRSP 
supported 
by 
IDA’s 
proposed 
PSAC 
and 
by 
the 
IDB’s 
planned 
sector 
adjustment 
operations 
are 
being 
chosen 
to 
reflect 
the 
relative 
strengths 
and 
experience 
of 
each 
institution. 
63 
Other 
donors 
also 
have 
been 
very 
supportive 
of 
the 
PRSP 
process 
and 
several 
have 
expressed 
interest 
in 
supporting 
the 
programmatic 
approach 
through 
so-called 
sector-wide 
approaches. 
These 
donors 
are 
considering 
using 
the 
PSAUPRSC 
policy 
matrix 
as 
the 
framework 
to 
disburse 
their 
support, 
while 
monitoring 
PRSP 
implementation 
through 
the 
budgetary 
process 
and 
the 
HIPC 
tracking 
mechanism 
established 
through 
the 
Supplementary 
Social 
Fund. 
After 
a 
transition 
period, 
there 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
a 
periodic 
(semi-annual 
or 
annual) 
Government 
and 
donor 
review 
of 
progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
PRSP 
and 
in 
achieving 
its 
targets.

objectives 
of 
the 
PI&P

distributing 
20,000 
copies 
of 
the

It 
is 
proposed 
that

decision 
to 
proceed 
with 
a 
second 
adjustment 
credit 
(possibly 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a

be 
made 
contingent 
on 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
significant 
deterioration 
in 
the 
overall

Cl/. 
Implementation 
and 
Monitoring 
Arrangements. 
Since 
this 
PSAC 
is 
a 
one- 
tranche 
operation, 
all 
the 
prior 
actions 
and 
reform 
measures 
contemplated 
under 
the 
credit 
have 
been 
taken 
already. 
To 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
measures 
contemplated 
for 
support 
under 
follow-up 
operations, 
be 
they 
PRSCs 
or 
PSACs, 
and 
coordinate 
the 
process 
of 
monitoring 
across 
different 
sectors, 
the 
government 
has 
set 
up 
an 
inter-ministerial 
task 
force 
that 
includes 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
the 
Central 
Bank, 
and 
the 
Technical 
Secretariat 
of 
the 
Presidency. 
IDA 
will 
meet 
with 
this 
task 
force 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
to 
agree 
on 
the 
overall 
fiscal 
budget 
allocation 
(with 
special 
attention 
paid 
to 
poverty-related 
spending) 
before 
each 
credit 
is 
declared 
effective 
and 
review 
the 
execution 
of 
total 
spending 
on 
these 
programs, 
together 
with 
a 
review 
of 
compliance 
with 
the 
PSAC 
conditionality. 
Reporting 
on 
the 
use 
of

Supervision 
and 
Subsequent 
Adjustment 
Credits. 
Supervision 
and 
preparation 
of 
*subsequent 
Credits 
should 
take 
place 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
other 
donors 
and 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
existing 
PRSP 
review 
mechanism, 
which 
operates 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
National 
Economic 
and 
Social 
Planning 
Council 
(CONPES). 
The 
Government 
will 
be 
asked 
to 
report 
to 
IDA 
and 
other 
donors 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis 
on 
progress 
made 
in 
each 
PSAC 
program 
area, 
using 
the 
same 
tracking 
mechanism 
that 
is 
being 
set 
up 
through 
the 
Supplementary 
Social 
Fund 
for 
HIPC 
funds. 
In 
addition, 
the 
achievement 
of 
future 
PRSCTSAC 
targets 
will 
be 
assessed 
annually 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the

PRSP 
review 
that 
will 
document 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
PRSP 
and 
analyze 
the 
outcome 
of 
reforms. 
It 
would 
be 
expected 
that 
if 
progress 
is 
considered 
adequate, 
Nicaragua’s 
poverty 
reduction 
program 
would 
be 
supported 
through 
subsequent 
PRSCs 
(or 
PSACs) 
under 
the 
programmatic 
lending 
framework, 
subject 
to 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Executive 
Directors. 
The 
Government 
and 
IDA 
would 
agree 
on 
the 
content 
of 
each 
PRSC 
or 
PSAC 
on 
an 
annual 
basis.

Proposed 
Borrower 
and 
Credit 
Amount. 
The 
Borrower 
would 
be 
the 
Republic 
of 
Nicaragua. 
A 
single-tranche 
of 
US$15 
million 
(equivalent) 
would 
be 
made 
available 
upon 
credit 
effectiveness, 
anticipated 
for 
January 
2003. 
The 
closing 
date 
of 
the 
Credit 
would 
be 
December 
3 
1, 
2003. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
over 
the 
following 
three 
years 
there 
would 
be 
two 
further 
one- 
or 
two-tranche 
PRSCs, 
for 
a 
total 
amount 
of 
US$60 
million 
equivalent 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRSP.

Fiduciary 
Aspects. 
The 
main 
CFAA 
mission 
visited 
Nicaragua 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
November 
and 
its 
key 
recommendations 
with 
respect 
to 
financial 
administration 
of 
the 
PSAC 
have 
been 
incorporated 
into 
the 
MOP 
and 
Credit 
Agreement. 
The 
final 
CFAA 
report, 
expected 
in 
February 
2003, 
will 
provide 
further 
recommendations 
which 
would 
be 
included 
in 
the 
policy 
matrixes 
of 
subsequent 
adjustment 
credits. 
A 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR) 
also 
is 
currently 
being 
prepared 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
IDB. 
Given 
the 
IDB’s 
support 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
an 
ongoing 
procurement 
reform 
effort, 
close 
coordination 
between 
both 
donor 
institutions 
is 
critical. 
A 
September 
2002 
CPAR 
mission 
found 
that 
Nicaragua’s 
overall 
procurement 
framework 
is 
reasonably 
acceptable. 
Although 
there 
are 
some 
provisions 
that 
do 
not 
follow 
standard 
international 
practices, 
these 
are 
not 
an 
impediment 
to 
procurement 
under 
IDA-funded 
projects 
since 
IDA 
guidelines 
prevail 
over 
local 
legislation. 
A 
December 
1999 
Procurement 
Law 
has 
substantially 
improved 
the 
public 
procurement 
system, 
but 
there 
is 
still 
room 
for 
improvement 
in 
efficiency 
and 
transparency, 
and 
for 
making 
the 
law 
more 
compatible 
with 
international 
practices. 
To 
address 
this, 
the 
Government 
has 
just 
started 
implementing 
an 
ambitious 
procurement 
reform 
program 
with 
IDB 
and 
other 
donor 
assistance 
to

The 
findings

of 
the 
CPAR, 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
in 
mid-2003, 
will 
provide 
recommendations 
for 
actions 
needed 
to 
complement 
the 
Government’s 
efforts 
under 
the 
IDB-financed 
program, 
and 
for 
reforms, 
if 
any,

PSACs 
or 
PRSCs. 
71 
Proposed 
Disbursement, 
Reporting 
and 
Auditing 
Requirements. 
The 
Credit 
will 
follow 
IDA’s 
simplified 
disbursement 
procedures 
for 
adjustment 
operations. 
That 
is, 
the 
Credit 
proceeds 
would 
be 
disbursed 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
stipulated 
single 
tranche 
release 
conditions. 
Disbursements 
will 
not 
be 
linked 
to 
any 
specific 
purchases 
and 
no 
procurement 
requirements 
would 
be 
needed. 
Once 
the 
Credit 
is 
approved 
by 
the 
Board, 
the 
Borrower 
would 
open 
and 
maintain 
a 
dedicated 
deposit 
account 
in 
US 
Dollars 
for 
the 
Borrower’s 
use. 
As 
the 
single 
tranche 
is 
released 
upon 
credit 
effectiveness, 
IDA 
will 
disburse 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Credit 
into 
the 
deposit 
account. 
If 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Credit 
Page  30
or 
any 
part 
thereof 
are 
used 
for 
ineligible 
purposes, 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement, 
IDA 
will 
require 
the 
Borrower 
to 
either 
return 
that 
amount 
to 
the 
deposit 
account 
for 
use 
for 
eligible 
purposes 
or 
refund 
the 
amount 
directly 
to 
IDA. 
The 
deposit 
account 
in 
US 
Dollars 
would 
be 
maintained 
in 
the 
Central 
Bank 
and 
its 
transactions 
and 
balances 
fully 
incorporated 
into 
the 
Government’s 
accounting 
records 
and 
financial 
statements, 
via 
the 
integrated 
financial 
management 
system 
(SIGFA). 
IDA 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
require 
an 
audit 
of 
the 
deposit 
account 
by 
independent 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
In 
such 
a 
case, 
the 
audit 
report 
would 
be 
submitted 
no 
more 
than 
six 
months 
after 
the 
date 
of 
IDA’s 
request.

. 
Environmental 
Aspects. 
The 
proposed 
PSAC 
is 
a 
structural 
adjustment 
operation 
covering 
a 
broad 
spectrum 
of 
economy-wide 
policies 
and 
institutions. 
The 
environmental 
provisions 
of 
OD8.60 
(~d~~~~~e~~ 
Lending 
Policy) 
apply. 
No 
significant

of 
the

supported 
by 
the 
proposed 
PSAC 
on 
the 
environment 
is 
foreseen. 
D. 
Benefits 
and 
Risks 
73 
Benefits. 
The 
proposed 
actions 
under 
the 
PSAC 
are 
expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
Nicaragua’s 
poverty 
reduction 
efforts 
by 
creating 
a 
better 
investment 
climate 
capable 
of 
attracting 
private 
investors 
and 
thereby 
accelerating 
economic 
growth, 
strengthening 
Nicaragua’s 
institutions 
and 
public 
sector 
management 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
encouraging 
better 
donor 
coordination 
and 
raising 
the 
development 
impact 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
and 
by 
helping 
implement 
social 
sector 
reforms 
that 
will 
improve 
the 
country’s 
social 
indicators 
in 
a 
sustained 
manner. 
The 
proposed 
Credit 
has 
several 
benefits 
over 
the 
traditional 
combination 
of 
adjustment 
credits 
and 
investment 
projects: 
l 
a 
programmatic 
approach 
would 
promote 
Nicaraguan 
ownership 
of 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
program, 
improve 
the 
predictability 
of 
funding, 
strengthen 
budgetary 
institutions 
and 
reduce 
transactions 
costs 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
foreign 
assistance; 
* 
a 
multi-sectoral 
approach 
would 
promote 
better 
coordination 
and 
collaboration 
as 
essential 
ingredients 
for 
institutional 
reforms; 
and 
* 
it 
would 
facilitate 
aid 
assistance 
coordination, 
a 
key 
component 
to 
increase 
the 
impact 
of 
external 
assistance 
in 
enhancing 
Nicaragua’s 
competitiveness.

The 
Government 
is 
planning 
to 
prepare 
a 
Poverty 
and 
Social 
Impact 
Analysis 
(P&A) 
in 
2003, 
focusing 
on 
the 
reform 
areas 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
have 
the 
greatest 
impact. 
The 
PRSP 
Progress 
Report 
has 
identified 
four 
such 
areas: 
the 
emphasis 
on 
cluster 
development 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
the 
first 
pillar 
of 
the 
strategy, 
the 
fight 
against 
corruption, 
the 
national 
education 
plan, 
including 
reforms 
in 
basic 
education, 
and 
the 
fiscal 
adjustment 
package. 
The 
Progress 
Report 
contains 
a 
very 
preliminary 
identification 
of 
possible 
effects 
from 
these 
reforms, 
suggesting 
that 
the 
expected 
impact 
of 
these 
reforms 
is, 
on 
balance, 
positive. 
The 
Joint 
IDA-Ih4F 
Staff 
Assessment 
recommends 
that 
the 
PSIA 
be 
initiated 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
so 
that 
its 
findings 
can 
accompany 
the 
next 
PRSP 
Progress 
Report.

important 
political, 
institutional 
and 
economic 
risks. 
The 
proposed 
PSAC 
faces 
several 
l 
An 
important 
political 
risk 
arises 
from 
the 
rift 
that 
emerged 
between 
the 
Bolafios 
Administration 
and 
Liberal 
party 
congressmen 
led 
by 
members 
of 
the 
previous 
administration, 
which 
could 
slow 
down 
the 
passage 
of 
important 
legislation 
needed 
to 
implement 
the 
PRSP 
agenda 
and 
would 
make 
it 
difficult 
to 
sustain 
the 
political 
support 
needed 
to 
complete 
a 
fiscal 
adjustment 
of 
the 
magnitude 
contemplated 
in 
the 
government 
program. 
Bilateral 
donors 
have 
been 
helping 
in 
the 
effort 
to 
effect 
a 
political 
reconciliation 
and 
IDA 
has 
been 
working 
with 
key 
members 
of 
the 
National 
Assembly, 
facilitating 
relevant 
information 
and 
seeking 
to 
avoid 
misunderstandings 
about 
the 
reforms 
that 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
IDA. 
A 
local 
civil 
society 
specialist 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
Country 
Office 
is 
working 
closely 
with 
civil 
society 
to 
maintain 
an 
open 
dialogue 
on 
IDA 
assistance. 
Also, 
IDA 
will 
collaborate 
with 
the 
IMF 
in 
closely 
monitoring 
the 
program 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
to 
identify 
problems 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
and 
offer 
advice 
on 
corrective 
measures. 
0 
The 
absence 
of 
a 
well-functioning 
judicial 
system 
could 
undermine 
private 
sector 
confidence 
and 
limit 
the 
impact 
of 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
through 
faster 
growth. 
Although 
IDA 
is 
currently 
not 
active 
in

sector, 
support 
is 
being 
provided 
by 
the

There 
are 
important 
economic 
risks 
to 
program 
implementation, 
from 
both 
external 
and 
internal 
sources. 
On 
the 
external 
side, 
Nicaragua 
is 
extremely 
vulnerable 
to 
natural 
disasters 
and 
to 
terms 
of 
trade 
shocks, 
which 
could 
derail 
a 
new 
PRGF 
program 
and 
stall 
progress 
under 
the 
HIPC 
Initiative. 
Two 
major 
risks 
on 
the 
internal 
side 
concern 
the 
fragility 
of 
the 
financial 
system, 
which 
keeps 
the 
country 
vulnerable 
to 
financial 
crises 
triggered 
by 
external 
shocks 
or 
corporate 
governance 
deficiencies, 
and 
the 
related 
risk 
of 
a 
rapidly 
expanding 
domestic 
debt 
which 
threatens 
to 
undermine 
fiscal 
austerity 
efforts. 
Ongoing 
IDA-supported 
programs 
that 
mitigate 
these 
risks 
include 
assistance 
to 
strengthen 
Nicaragua’s 
ability 
to 
deal 
with 
and 
mitigate 
the 
effects 
of 
natural 
disasters 
and 
terms 
of 
trade 
fluctuations, 
and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Superintendency 
of 
Banks. 
* 
There 
are 
fiduciary 
risks, 
which 
have 
been 
identified 
in 
the 
PER, 
and 
which 
are 
being 
analyzed 
in 
detail 
in 
the 
CFAA 
and 
CPAR. 
Efforts 
to 
mitigate 
these 
risks 
are 
at 
the 
center 
of 
the 
Government’s 
institutional 
reform 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
PSAC. 
Also, 
this 
risk 
is 
being 
mitigated 
by 
limiting 
the 
PSAC 
to 
a 
relatively 
modest 
credit 
amount.
