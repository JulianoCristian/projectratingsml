INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE METROPOLITAN WATER WORKS AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A
BANGKOK WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Metropolitan Water Works Authority (MWWA) with the guarantee
of the Kingdom cf Thailand for the equivalent of US$55 million to help
finance a project for water supply. The loan would have a term of 26 years,
including 6 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4% per annum. The Asian
Development Bank (ADB) has negotiated a parallel loan to the Borrower for
US$19.6 million, with the same term and grace period but at its own standard
rate of interest, which is at present 7-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Thailand" (82a-TH), based on the findings of a mission which visited the
country in September 1972, was distributed to the Executive Directors on
March 9, 1973 (R73-40 and R73-41). This updated the basic economic report
which was distributed to the Executive Directors under cover of a memorandum
from the Secretary (R72-12 of January 18, 1972). A sunmary of the mission's
findings and conclusions was given in my report on the Fourth Railway
Project which was distributed to Executive Directors under cover of a
memorandum from the Secretary (R73-71 of April 12, 1973). This summary has
been updated and revised following a meeting of the Consultative Group for
Thailand, held on May 3 and 4, 1973, and is reproduced in Annex I, following
the Country Data.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
3.        My report and recommendation on the Fourth Railway Project also
set out past Bank Group lending in Thailand and discussed the Group's
strategy for Thailand and the projects which were expected to come forward
for your consideration in the balance of this year and in FY 1974. The
relevant section has been revised to bring it up to date and is attached
at Annex I, pages 7 and 8. Annex II contains a suammary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits as at May 31, 1973, IFC investments as at March 31, 1973,
and notes on the execution of on-going projects.

PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE IN THAILAND
Settlement Patterns
4.        Thailand's population was estinated in 1971 to number 37 million.
Of this total, about 30 million were believed to live in communities with
a population of 5,000 or less, 4 million in small towas and 3 million in
the Bangkok metropolitan area.
5.        Bangkok has been the capital of the nation for almost two hundred
years, and is the center of national life in almost every field of activity.
In the i960's its annual population growth rate averaged 5.7% p.a., due in
part to the extension of the municipal bourndaries. As of 1970 its popula-
tion was growing at about 4% per year.   It iS estimated that by 1985 about
6 million people will be living in the area which MWWA is responsible for
serving.
6.        Under its Third Five-Year Plan, the Government is giving increasing
attention to investment outside Bangkok, and the Bank Group is both en-
couraging this and contributing to it through a large part of its le.nding
program.  These investments, which are both economic and soc.il, may
diminish the forces which make for such a concentration of people and resources
in Bangkok.  But the change will not occur on such a scale as to cause
Bangkok to cease to be Thailand's largest and most important city; far
less will it affect this project. The need for inves:ment to provide Bangkok
with the basic amenities of urban life will continue; in addition to lending
for water supply, the Bank has indicated an interest in helping to finance
urgently-needed transportation improvements in the city, provided that an
appropriate framework of institutions and policies emerges from current
Government consideration of these matters. The Bank has also expressed its
willingness to work with Thai agencies on the formulation of an overall
strategy for the development of Bangkok.
Water Supply
7.        Rainwater is plentiful in most parts of Thailand during the months
of March to September. Extensive irrigation works spread or store the
floodwater, and make it available over a longer perioc'. Groundwater is
readily available in many areas, but in most districts this source has been
exploited only to a limited extent. The northeastern region does not enjoy
the same abundance of water as other areas. Throughout the country, where
public water supply systems have not been constructed, people obtain their
supplies from shallow wells, roof drainage, or the numierous rivers, streams
and canals.
8.        In communities with rewer than 5,000 inhabitants, about 15% of the
population is served by some kind of public water supply system. In towns
whose populations range from 5,000 to 100,000 the proportion served rises
to about 30% and in the Bangkok metropo_Atan area to ebout 60%.



-3-
9.        Three organizations are primarily responsible for domestic and
industrial water supply. These are:
(a) the Sanitary Engineering Division (SED) of the Department
of Public Health, which is active in villages and towns
of 500-5,000 inhabitants;
(b) the Provincial Water Works Division (PWWD) of the Public
and Municipal Works Department, which helps provide water
supply in cities of over 5,000 inhabitants, other than
Bangkok; and
(c) the Metropolitan Water Works Authority (MWWA), which serves
the Bangkok metropolitan area.
10.       The Central Grovernment is by far the largest source of finance
for capital investment in the sector; outside Bangkok this finance is
provided on a grant basis. Revenue collection is generally poor and water
revenues do not cover operating costs, except for systems operated by PWWD
in medium-sized towns.
11.       Thailand does not at present have a national water use policy.
However, a proposed loan for an irrigation project in the Pitsanuloke region,
which is scheduled for presentation to the Executive Directors in FY 74, would
finance a study to recommend administrative machinery and policy-guidelines
for the allocation of water in the Chao Phya Basin at the southern end of which
lies Bangkok. This would be a major step towards a national policy.
Sewerage and Drainage
12.       Sewerage, as distinct from drainage, virtually does not exist in
Thailand. As a result, water pollution is becoming serious in Bangkok and
along the coast nearby. A Master Plan for sewerage, drainage and flood
protection in the Bangkok area was completed in 1968 and approved in prin-
ciple by the Government in 1969. Detailed design of a first phase project
was completed in about 1970. Implementation, which would require both
institution-building and construction, has not yet begun. The proposed
project would increase the need for drainage and sewerage and during nego-
tiations the Government made commitments concerning this which are described
in para 38 below.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
13.       A report entitled "Thailand - Appraisal of the Bangkok Water
Supply Project" (146a-TH of June 8, 1973) is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is provided in Annex III.



-4-
History of the Project
14.       In 1967, the Metropolitan Water Works Authority (MWWA) was estab-
lished to take over the responsibility, previously discharged by four
separate water authorities, for supplying water to the four municipalities
in the Bangkok metropolitan area. This was a major step towards building
ar institution which could implement a project of the scale now proposed.
^.:±e Government then engaged Camp, Dresser and McKee International, inc. (CDM),
zo prepare a Water Supply and Dist-ribution Master Plan for the Metropolitan
-rea.  Among otcer consultants who contributed to the preparation of the
.Haster Plan, Booz, Allen and Hamilton International Inc. (BAHINT) made a
maeor contribution in the areas of finance and general management.  In early
19iO the Master Plan was submitted to the Government. It was reviewed later
in the year at the Government's request and the Bank outlined a ntmber of
decisions and actions required before a project woulcl be ready for consider-
ation by international financial agencies.
15.       INWA then began, with the help of its consultaats, to prepaze the
project and to implement a program of improvements. Pre-appraisal was carried
out in Mlay 1972, and the project appraised jointly with ADB in July of the
same year.  Subsequent missions up-dated cost data and financial projections,
and .onitored progress in institutional reforms. The proposed loarn and the
proposed ADB loan were negotiated together at the Headquarters of the ADB
in Manila from May 21 to .iay 25, 1973. The Government delegetion was led
by HE The Thai Ambassado; to the Philippines, Khun Swate Komalabuthi, assisted
Dy Professor Chamras Chayabongse, General Manager of MWWA.
Aims of the Projec:
16.       The first aim of the project is to reduce the gap betwea.% water
demand and supply in Bangkok.  Despite an average annual growth raze in
production capacity of 12% since 1950, supply has never caught up with
demand and today less than one-quarter of the area now served has a con-
tinuous supply of water at adequate pressure. With both populaticn and
incomes in the metropolis rising steadily, demand will continue to grow.
As planned the project would provide good quality water service for about
4.6 milllion people in an area of about 400 sq km.  By comparison, at present,
about 2 million people in an area or about 180 sq km are poorly served.
17.       The second aim of the project is to strengthen MWWA's managerial
and financial performance. The need for this improvement is illu&trated by
Iche engineering consultants' estimate, based on extensive field studies, that
orLy half of the water produced by MWWA earns any revenue because less than
hal. of the system is properly metered, and because billing, collection and
accounting procedures _re most unsatisfactory.  Grave deficiencies in manage-
ment have made MWWA de-pendent on Government subsidy and prevented it from
attaining the autornomy to whi_h 4it is legally entitled. The Government and
MWhA' s awn, rianagement have shown taat they are determined to correct this
state o f affairs, and make MWWA administratively and fEinancially self-reliant.
Apart -fom ensuring better service for Bangkok, Government thereby expects
to free for other uses funds which are now subsidizing the supply of water
to a relatively affluent city at less than cost price.



-5-
Scope of the Project
18.       The project would be the first major construction stage of a
30-year program recommended in CDM's Master Plan for the city's water supply.
The main components are shown in the maps at the back of this report. Raw
water intake and pumping facilities would be expanded, and a new treatment
plant would be constructed from which treated water would be pumped through
new transmission tunnels to new ground level reservoirs at various sites in
the metropolitan area. From these reservoirs the water would be pumped into
an improved and expanded distribution network.
19.       Because it is difficult to predict the impact which the measures
designed to make metering, billing and collection more effective may have on
water consumption patterns, there is considerable uncertainty at this stage
over the rate at which demand will grow. The construction plan for some
project items has therefore been divided into two phases to permit their
partial revision or postponement in case these measures prove to be
a very strong restraint on demand. Tendering for Phase I works is scheduled
to commence towards the end of 1973 and Phase II towards the end of 1975.
MWWA agreed during negotiations to determine the timing and content of
Phase II works in consultation with the Bank and not to invite bids or award
any contract for Phase II without the prior approval of the Bank. For the
purpose of financing, the project is divided into two parts, Part A intended
for financing by the Bank, and Part B by ADB. The principal components of
the project are:
(a) Part A (proposed for Bank financing): Raw water pumping
and transmission facilities; a water treatment plant
(two phases); treated water transmission tunnels (two
phases); four distribution centers (divided equally into
two phases); three treated water storage reservoirs;
general use, maintenance and operating equipment; en-
gineering; management consulting services and training.
(b) Part B (proposed for ADB financing): Trunk and distribu-
tion mains; a metering improvement program; tubewells and
consulting engineering services.
The two Parts of the project are mutually dependent and MWWA would be responsi-
ble for coordinating their implementation. Their preparation has involved
close cooperation among MWWA and the two Banks, and this would continue in
the implementation phase.
20.       In addition to parts A and B of the project, the Government and
MWWA are considering improvements to several separate small water supply
schemes for outlying areas of Bangkok where service is very poor and exten-
sion of the MWWA supply will not be feasible in the near future. Financing
for part of the cost of these is expected to be available from bilateral
sources. Their preparation is still in a preliminary stage. To ensure that
their development will be compatible with the overall master plan, the Loan
Agreement provides that the Bank's approval would be obtained before MWWA
committed itself to any capital expenditures, including these schemes, costing
more than $1.0 million a year.

Cost Estimates
21.       The total estimated cost of the project is US$212.3 million,
including import duties and other charges. This amount includes a provision
of $28.9 million foc contingencies. The estimated foreign exchange
component is $76.7 million. (See Annex III).
''.      Part A is estimated to cost $144.0 million including a $16.9 mil-
on (12%) allowance for contingencies.   The foreign exchange costs of
this Part are estimated at $57.1 million, of which the proposed loan would
finance $55 million.   The proposed loan would cover 38% of the cost of
Par. A and 26% of the total cost of the project.
Financing Plan
23.       The financing plan for the project construction period (1973-78)
is shown below:
SOURCES OF FUNDS                    US$ million   Percentage
Irternal cash generation                          82.4          33.8
Less:  debt service requirements                12.9           5.3
Net cash generation                               69.5          28.5
Borrowings:
IBRD Loan                                       55.0         22.6
ADB Loan                                        19.6           8.0
Prior Government Loans Unutilized                8.6           3.5
Government Loan for the Project               84.1          34.5
Total Borrowings                       167.3         68.6
Government & Customer Contributions                7.1           2.9
TOTAL                                  243.9/       100.0
/a   In contrast to the total for project costs, this total includes
funds for interest during construction on the Bank and ADB
loans, non-project construction by MWWA during the period and
an increase in working capital, but excludes some project
expenditures made prior to FY73.
24.       The ADB loan is expected to be presented to the ADB Board in late
June 1973. The effectiveness of the ADB loan would be conditional upon the
signing but not the effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan. The effect-
iveness of the Bank loan wouwld be conditional upon the effectiveness of the
ADB loan.  The Government undertook during negotiations to provide whatever
fina.ce is required for the project in addition to the Bank and ADB loans



- 7 -
and the cash generated internally. This financing, which is expected to
amount to about $84 million, would be provided in the form of a loan or loans,
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
Project Execution
25.       As it faces the prospect of a major program of expansion and
managerial strengthening, MWWA has before it the example of other public
utilities in Thailand which have achieved striking improvements in performance
and thereby become self-reliant institutions. Already, during the preparation
of the project, MWWA has done considerable groundwork which will contribute
to the success 6f the project, includling the introduction of management
reforms and the recruitment of key personnel.
26.       MWWA has recently recruited a number of able and qualified
engineers who would be competent to operate the expanded system. It has
found it more difficult to recruit managerial talent in the field of
financial administration, but the Government has seconded a senior civil
servant to act as Deputy General Manager (Finance) for one year; this
official has the qualities needed to lead MWWA towards better financial
performance while efforts to recruit a permanent executive continue. During
negotiations MWWA undertook to achieve this recruitment by March 31, 1974.
27.       The contract for construction supervision for Part A is now being
negotiated with CDM (the firm which was responsible for the detailed design
of this Part) in association with another firm of consulting engineers, Black
and Veatch International. BAHINT have been retained to expand their consult-
ing services in financial and other management areas during the project im-
plementation period. Overall project coordination, control and administra-
tion is the responsibility of MWWA, which will be assisted in this task by
individual consultants and short-term specialists.
Financial Position and Prospects
28.       The gross value of the fixed assets of MWWA at the end of 1972 was
about $79 million, of which some $15 million had been added since MWWA was
established in 1967.
29.       MWWA has incurred cash losses each year since its formation, which
the Government has met with budget contributions amounting to $5 million for
the five years. In addition, until 1971, the Government also made grants
to MWWA for capital investment; since then it has made two loans for
capital expenditures, with an interest rate of 4% per annum and repayable
in 20 years after 5 years of grace.
30.       Because of this past Government policy, MWWA's ratio of debt to
equity is only about 6:94. This would change as the Bank, ADB and Govern-
ment loans were disbursed, to 63:37 in 1977 and, on present assumptions,
decline to around 48:52 by 1982.



- 8 -
31.       The major uncertainty in MWWA's financial prospects concerns the
organization's ability to collect revenues for the water it produces.
Crucial to this are effective metering and efficient billing, collection
and accounting procedures. The ADB loan would finance the expansion of a
program to improva metering which is already underway. A revenue improve-
ment program has been instituted to modernize -:he accounting, billing and
collection procedures and would be continued with the assistance of the
consultants financed by the proposed loan.   The loan agreements negotiated by
'IWWA with the Bank and ADB provide for close consultation among all parties
on these metering and revenue improvement programs, including the timing and
establishment of quantitative targets.
32.       A new tariff structure was introduced in July 1972 which increased
unit charges by about 150% but retained the free allowance of 6 m3 per
month and extended it to all consumers. The new tariff reflects more
closely than the previous one the average cost of production and distribu-
tion but its impact on MWWA's finances will depend on how effectively it
is implemented. The financial projections are based on the assumptions that
unaccounted-for water will be reduced from about 60% to about 25% of pro-
duction by 1979 and that no tariff increase would be required during the
project construction period. Tne proposed reduction in unaccounted-for water
would represent a considerable achievement but is a feasible target and should
result in a measurable and steady imuprovement in the financial position of
MWWA. However, during r gotiations it was agreed that to ensure the ade-
quacy of MNWA's cash resources to meet its requirements, the tariff levels
would be reviewed at intervals of not more than two years during the con-
struct.on period and that during this period the tariff would not be reduced
below its present level. The projections indicate that, to enable MWWA to
eenerate sufficient revenues, after the construction period, to cover all
operating expenses (including depreciation, and debt service charges to the
extent they exceed the provision for depreciation) and make a small contribu-
tion towards future expansion, a tariff increase of about 25% would be re-
quired by October 1979. On this basis, MWWA would then achieve a return of
about 8% on net fixed assets in operation, and assurances have been obtained
that the tariff would thereafter be taaintained at a level sufficient to yield
at least this return.
33.       An incremental financial return on the project was calculated to
test the extent to which water charges adequately recover the costs of
providing improved service. The return on the water supply facilities alone
was estimated to approximate 8%. The return on the project as a whole,
which also includes investments in metering and billing improvements, would
be about 12%.
Procurement
34.       The project components to be financed by the proposed loan would
be divided into about 25 tCl 30 maj-or contracts. Supply and construction
contracts would be awarded in accordance wlth the Bank's guidelines on
inte:--ational competitive bidding. Foreign suppliers and contractors
(probably in association with local firms in most cases) are expected to



-9-
win most contracts. Domestic manufacturers would be accorded the standard
preferential margin, and might win some of the smaller supply contracts.
Disbursement
35.       A disbursement forecast is given in Annex III.   Retroactive fi-
nancing is proposed to reimburse up to $1 million of the foreign exchange
costs of consulting services carried out, with the agreement of the Bank,
since September 1972.
36.       The loan will be disbursed for:   37% of the total costs of civil
works; the c.i.f. cost of equipment directly imported; the ex-factory cost
of locally manufactured equipment; 65% of the cost of imported but locally
procured equipment (i.e. off-the-shelf items), and the foreign exchange
cost of consultants' services.
Justification
37.       An adequate supply of water is essential to the proper functioning
and health of Bangkok. Bangkok is not only the capital city but is also the
center for all economic activity in Thailand and a popular tourist center.
Presently, less than 25% of the city's inhabitants enjoy an adequate supply
of water. Water demand is expected to double in the next twelve years.
Without investments on the scale now proposed even the present unsatisfactory
standards cannot be maintained as the city's population continues to increase.
The project constitutes the first major construction phase of a well prepared
program to meet water demand in the Bangkok metropolitan area through the
year 2000; it is urgent and essential, and is the least cost solution to
Bangkok's water supply problem at this stage.
Ecological Effect
38.       The project would reduce both the percentage and the absolute
number of people in Bangkok who are wholly or partly dependent on unsafe
water sources, but would increase the need for sewerage. The Government
has undertaken that by December 31, 1974 it would, in consultation with the
Bank, prepare specific proposals, including timetables and legislative and
finanding plans, for carrying out a sewerage program.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Metropolitan
Water Works Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of
Thailand and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans
for water supply projects except for the link established with the ADB by



- 10 -
the cross-default clause (Section 8.02(a)) and the additional condition of
effectiveness (Section 9.01(a)) of the draft Loan Agreement. The Executive
Directors' attention is also drawn to: (a) Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the
draft Guarantee Agreement which provide for the preparation of a plan of
action for a sewerage scheme and the designation of an agency by the
government to monitor groundwater resources and (b) Sections 4.01(a)(i) and
5.06 of the draft Loan Agreement which provide for an annual review of the
Metropolitan Water Works Authority's Metering and Revenue Improvement
Programs and a periodic review of its water rates structure.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

THE ECONOMY
/The following extract from the President's Report on the Fourth Railway
Project distributed to the Executive Directors under cover of a Memorandum
from the Secretary (IBRD/R73-71 of April 12, 1973) has been updated and
revised following a meeting of the Consultative Group for Thailand held on
May 3 and 4, 1973 77
1.        In the last two years, Thailand's rate of economic growth slowed
from the average rate of 8% a year of the 1960's to around 6%. Because of
slow export growth, capacity to finance imports was expected to become a
constraint on future expansion. However, largely due to special factors
that may not recur, exports of goods and services rose sharply, by 29%, in
1972. The external demand for three of Thailand's important export crops
- rice, sugar, and kenaf - was strong because of abrupt shifts from surplus
to shortage on the world markets; and services to the US military increased
in 1972 after declining in the previous two years. The rapid growth of
exports, combined with slower growth of imports, reduced the external re-
source deficit and helped to raise the level of foreign exchange reserves
by $200 million in 1972.
2.        The growth of exports is also causing a revival in the growth of
private demand, which expanded slowly from 1969 to mid-1972. However, the
increase in real output in 1972 was significantly below the Plan's 7% target
because a drought in the summer limited the production of rice, kenaf, and
especially maize. Rising export prices, coupled with rising import prices
and the devaluation of the Baht in February 1973 to maintain parity with
the US dollar, have, in addition, resulted in much more rapid increases in
prices than Thailand has been accustomed to in recent years. Between
December 1971 and December 1972 the consumer price index rose by 9%.
3.        Government spending and investment by state enterprises helped to
maintain the growth of demand between 1969 and 1972, as the government's cash
deficit grew from % 2.9 billion to % 7.7 billion. During this period, the
central government's current spending on security, education, and debt
service increased rapidly, reducing the current budget surplus. However, in
the coming years the government will have to reverse this decline in the
current surplus if it is to generate enough resources to finance its program
of capital expenditures without creating new inflationary pressures.
The Outlook for 1973
4.        The recovery in the growth of demand which began in late 1972 is
expected to continue in 1973. Private investment should pick up, and export
demand should continue to be strong. However, export earnings will probably
not increase very much because the 1972 drought reduced the availability of
rice, maize, and kenaf for export. Imports, on the other hand, should
increase rapidly because of rising investment, production, and incomes.
Hence, the resource gap should begin to widen again.

Development Policies and Problems
5.        The development obiectives of the Third Five-Year Plan, which
was reviewed in detail in the basic economic report, are (i) the revival
of economic growth at a rate of 7% a year while maintaining a reasonable
degree of price stability; (ii) the expansion of agricultural and industrial
-roduction for export, supported by effective export promotion programs;
Iii) a larger share of the public development effort for agriculture,
education, and other social sectors; (iv) a better regional distribution
of development gains, with particular emphasis on the Northeast; (v) further
development of institutions to channel official external capital into private
sector investments; and (vi) improvements in the formilation of projects and
sectoral and regional programs.
6.        In 1972 the government took some steps to implement the policies
called for in the Plan. A reorganization of government ministries was
effected in October with the aim of improving the administration and
coordination of economic and social services and was accompanied by
strengthening of the staff in the ministries of agriculture, industry, and
commerce. The reorganization was followed by new Cabinet appointments in
December. The regrouping of all agricultural services in one ministry
should make it easier in the future to formulate and implement agricultural
policies and programs. T e same applies to trade promotion, transport, and
communications. However, further efforts are needed to turn the reforms
at the top into lasting improvements at the departmental and local levels.
7.        The government is also allocating more resources to agriculture.
Policy-making and the dissemination of technical knowledge are expected to
imrove as a result of this increased funding and the reorganization of the
deparments providing services to the sector. However, three major policy
areas require government action if the Third Plan target for a 30% increase
in agricultural exports is to be achieved. First, the price of nitrogenous
fertilizer is artificially high because of import restrictions designed to
protect high-cost domestic production. Second, the premium charged on rice
exports, which had been eliminated in April 1971 but was reimposed in
September 1972 because of a steep increase in the external price of rice,
depresses the price received by the fa-rmer and should be lifted when ex-
ternal demand conditions warrant It. And, third, unsatisfactory institution-
sl arrangements for credit, extension services, and utilization of existing
irrigation infrastructure are limiting achievement of the Plan's targets
for agriculture.
8.        In the manufacturing sector, fiscal incentives to exporters have
been introduced.   An c'-dustrial estates authority has been established
recently, and duty-free zones for export may also be established soon.
There is room for further imp-ovements in government support for private
industrialists, but even so the Plan targets for the export of manufactures
are likely to be exceeded.
9.        in the area of capital markets and financial management, domestic
institutions which mobilize domestic and external long--term savings for the
financing of private investment need to be expanded. The government has



ANNEX I
Page 5 of 8 pages
introduced changes in taxation and regulations that should help contractual
savings institutions to expand. A start has also been made in strengthening
institutions specializing in the financing of agriculture, small industries
and residential construction, which could help raise the level of investment
in these sectors by offering more suitable terms and services to the
borrowers.
10.       The goal of government's population policy is to reduce population
growth to 2.5% per year by 1976. The dissemination of modern birtlh control
techniques has made quick progress. Because this is a recent development,
Thailand will, nonetheless, have to contend with a rapid increase in the
working-age population until at the least the mid-1980's. Unemployment is
largely frictional and seasonal at present, since Thailand still has virgin
land which is being opened up by many who would otherwise be unemployed.
Most new entrants to the labor force become farmers because of the limited
job opportunities in other sectors. However, the supply of cultivable land
is likely to be exhausted in the 1980's. Therefore, it is essential to
implement policies to increase farm employment per unit of land in
anticipation of this eventuality. These include measures to raise crop
yields, increase cropping intensity, and promote other farm activities
(livestock, fishing, silk, etc).
11.       Differences in income between urban and rural families are large,
but considerable progress was made by rural families during the 1960's. The
policies prescribed for agriculture would make for a more equal distribution
of income between city and country. The outlying regions, which are pre-
dominantly agricultural, have lagged behind the Bangkok area in development
and income growth. Government programs dealing with the special problems
of the less developed regions are farthest advanced in the Northeast and
are under preparation for the North and the South.
Balance of Payments Prospects and the External Borrowing Program
12.       The recent improvement in Thailand's balance of payments position
and the favorable outlook for the economy in 1973 indicate that the Third
Plan target of 7% a year growth in real GDP during 1972-76 is feasible.
Policies and programs to stimulate production for export should, nonetheless,
receive first priority because of the importance of exports in determining
the growth of GDP and private investment and the longer-term trends in the
balance of payments. As stated above, the external resource gap should
start to widen this year. During the remainder of the Plan period Thailand's
export markets will probably not continue to be as favorable as they are now,
and export earnings are unlikely to rise as rapidly as import requirements.
The expected rapid growth of tourism receipts should make up for possible
reduction in the level of services to the US military, which is a major
source of uncertainty.
13.       On May 3 and 4, 1973, the Consultative Group for Thailand met at
the Bank's European Office to review Thailand's development prospects and
requirements for external assistance for the remainder of the Third Plan.
At the previous meeting of the Group in 1972, the government's estimated



ANNEX I
Page 6 of 8 pages
requirement for the Plan period of $900 million in commitments of external
public capital had been accepted as reasonable. Since the Plan estimates
were made, two devaluations of the dollar and considerable increases in the
price of Thailand's imports have taken place. Because of these price changes
and inclusion in the revised project list of net additions amounting to about
$135 million, the Thai government now seeks commitments totalling about
.31,200 million in current prices for the Plan period. This amount appears
;.ikelv to be available.
14.       Cons:.derable progress has been made in project preparation since
the start of the Plan, and the external borrowing program is on schedule.
However, to achieve the government's external borrowing target, continued
effort in project preparation will be necessary. Most of the projects
financed to date have been in power, transportation, and communications, the
sectors traditionally assisted by external lenders. More project identifica-
tion and preparation effort is necessary to develop projects in agriculture,
education, and the social sectors; to develop projects outside the central
region; and to develop projects for financing at the end of this Plan period
and the start of the next one.
15.       Present government policy is to maintain the private sector's
freedom of access to private credit sources abroad; and, in consequence,
private capital inflows -e expected to continue to finance a significant
part of equipment imports. Since reserves are at a high level and there is
a need to stimulate private investment, this policy appears appropriate at
this juncture. Nevertheless, to prevent an excessive rise in private loans
and suppliers' credits and resulting increases in debt service, the government
should continue to develop the use of official credit lines by domestic
financial institutions to enable them to finance a larger share of private
equipment imports. External public and private borrowing during the Third
Plan are expected to cause debt service to rise to around 19% of exports by
1976. This would be a considerable but manageable burden on the balance of
payments. Foreign exchange reserves are projected to be drawn down at a
reasonable rate from $969 million (equivalent to seven months of imports)
at the end of 1972 to a level of three or four months of imports in 1976.
16.       Beyond 1976, however, if the predicted trends in exports, imports,
and capital inflows continue, reserves would decline further; and the growth
of Thailand's debt service burden could become a serious problem. The debt
service burden could be mitigated by a further increase in the share of
official capital in total external borrowings and by an acceleration of
export growth beyond the rate projected in the Third Plan. There is little
doubt that the former could be achieved, but a further acceleration of
exports will depend or both Thailand's own efforts and external factors.
If such an acceleration could not be realized, the country would face the
prospect of a heavy debt buidetn in the 1980's.   This prospect might force
the government to slow dowxn the growth of the economy in the late 1970's
unless it were able to obtain more of its public borrowings on substantially
imprrn-ed terms. Thus, Thailand's long-term debt prospects are sufficiently
difficult to justify some financing on concessional terms.

BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
fUpdated excerpt from the President's Report on the Fourth Railway Project
distributed to Executive Directors under cover of a memorandum from the
Secretary (R73-71 of April 12, 1973)./
'.        Since 1950 Thailand has received 26 Bank loans amounting to $459.5
million, net of cancellations. Most of these have been for transportation
($177 million), irrigation ($69.2 million) and power ($91 million) with, in
addLtor on, one for a dual-purpose power and irrigation project ($65.9 million).
The remaining loans have been for education ($21.4 million), industry
($1~ 0million) and telecommunications ($37 million). In addition, credits
of $19.5 million for education and $5.5 million for irrigation improvement,
and a loan of $15 million for the railways have recently been signed but are
not yet effective. In general, Bank-financed projects have been carried out
in accordance with expectations. Construction of the Third Bangkok Port
project, financed under Loan 702-TH, began 18 months behind schedule. The
delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Authority of Thailand
and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents and
evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realignments.
2.        For the next few years, about half the Bank's lending program for
Thailand will be directed to projects in transport, power and communications.
Irrigation development will also be a major feature. But projects in
education, family planning, agricultural credit, industry and tourism will
broaden the spectrum of the program although they will account for lesser
amounts. Both Bank and IDA projects are increasingly selected to achieve
a wider geographical spread for development benefits. One of the main
functions of the Regional Mission in Bangkok is to assist the Government in
developing projects which will contribute to this. The Bank's readiness to
finance some local costs in appropriate cases will enable it to participate
more fully in base-level projects in agriculture and the social sector.
The Consultative Group for Thailand, which is chaired by the Bank, met last
on May 3 and 4, 1973.
3.        Among the projects which should be ready for consideration in
FY 74 are a Northeast irrigation improvement project, the Pitsanuloke
irrigation project (which will probably include a seed multiplication
component) and the multi-purpose Quae Yai project, all of which are now
being appraised. Others which may be ready in FY 74 are in the fields of
industrial finance, industrial estates, and infrastructure for four cities
in northeast Thailand.   Lending prospects for FY 75 in the agricultural
sector include projects to assist irrigation development, livestock and
forestry production and possibly rubber replanting; in addition, consideration
is expected to be given to an education project, a railway project and an
urban transport project in Bangkok.
4.        In April 1972, the Government of Japan signed a Y 64 billion credit
agreement with the Government of Thailand, and a year later announced the



ANNEX I
Page 8 of 8 pages
untying of almost the entire amount. The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
of Japan has expressed an interest in using some of the untied funds thus
made available to participate in the Pitsanuloke and Quae Yai projects.
5.        Other lenders to Thailand are planning to increase their commit-
ments under the Third Plan.
6.        On December 31, 1972 Bank loans disbursed and outstanding to
Thailand amounted to $196 million, representing 22% of the country's
estimated total external debt of $893 million. The level of Bank/IDA
commitments is expected to increase substantially over the next five years,
but loans and credits disbursed and outstanding are not expected to exceed
30% of the projected external debt by 1978.
7.        Prospects for IFC operations in Thailand look reasonably good,
and IFC is taking an active part in developing a pulp and paper project for
appraisal, which is expected in the latter part of this calendar year.

1.        The original closing date, June 30, 1970, was postponed to
February 22, 1972 due to delays in appointing experts under bilateral assis-
tance. A further postponement was necessary as a result of incomplete bid-
ding for tools and scientific equipment. The project has now been virtually
completed and a completion mission will visit the cotntry in mid-July.

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 514-TH, Sirikit Dam Project; US$26 Million Loan of September 19, 1967;
Closing date: June 30, 1973
2.        The work on the project has been practically completed.   The
closure of the dam was carried out on schedule in June 1971. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$78 million, as against US$76 million
at appraisal (+2.5%). Substantial increases in the principal civil works
contract (+41%), which resulted from unforeseen adverse foundation condi-
tions, have been largely compensated by savings on other items. A request
has been received for postponement of the closing date, based mainly on
the need to examine two claims by the contractor. A supervision mission
visited the country in May-June 1973 to look into these claims and will
recommend postponement of the closing date by one year, to allow time for
their negotiation or arbitration.
Loan 626-TH, 4th Highways Project; US$23 Million Loan of June 27, 1969;
Closing date: December 31, 1973
3.        Construction of the project is on schedule and within the cost
estimates. At the request of the Government $3.0 million has been can-
celled from the unallocated category of this loan.
Loan 655-TH, First EGAT Power Project; US$46.5 Million Loan of February 10, 1970;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
4.        Foreign exchange expenditures are likely to exceed committed funds
by about US$3 million, due mainly to the revaluation of the Yen, and the
additional costs will be covered by the Borrower.
Loan 702-TH, Third Bangkok Port Project; US$12.5 Million Loan of August 6, 1970;
Closing date: July 31, 1974
5.        Construction of this project began 18 months behind schedule.
The delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Authority of
Thailand (PAT) and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender
documents and evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realignments.
More recently technical problems have arisen and the relationship between
PAT and the engineer (NEDECO) has been somewhat strained. The technical
problem has been solved satisfactorily and there is reason to believe that
the relationship is improving considerably. The technical problem has
probably caused an additional delay of 3 months.
Loan 790-TH, South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project; US$27 Million Loan
of November 11, 1971; Closing date: November 30, 1976
6.        Project is on schedule.
Loan 822-TH, Second Education Project (Kasetsart University); US$15.4 Million
Loan of May 24, 1972; Closing date: June 30, 1978
7.        The preparatory stage of project implementation is about seven
months behind schedule due to delay in appointing the campus planning

consultants but progress now is generally satisfactory and the master plan
for the development of the university's two campuses is expected to be com-
pleted by October 1973. Construction costs have risen about 20% because
of local hoarding of materials following the recent devaluation of the US
dollar and overall project costs are expected to exceed original estimates
by about 8.9% but to fall within the contingency allowances.
Loan 864-TH, Telecommunications Project; US$37 Million Loan of December 5, 1972;
Closing date: December 31, 1977
8.        The loan became effective on March 1, 1973.. The project is on
schedule.
Loan 870-TH, Fifth Highways Project; US$28.6 Million Loan of December 26, 1972;
Closing date: December 31, 1977
9.        The loan became effective on March 26, 1973.  The project is on
schedule.
Credit 369-TH, Third Education Project; US$19.5 Million Credit of April 11, 1973;
Closing date: June 30, 1978
10.       The Credit Agreement is expected to become effective before
July 10, 1973. Both Project Units are substantially established except
for the appointment of the Advisers to the respective Project Directors.
Action is being taken toward the recruitment of these Advisers, who are to
be provided under technical assistance. All sites are available and sketch
plans are under preparation for Ministry of Education project items. Construc-
tion costs have risen about 20% since negotiation of the Credit in January 1973,
because of local hoarding of materials following the recent devaluation of the
US dollar.
Credit 379-TH, Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project; US$5.5 Million Credit
of May 9, 1973; Closing date: June 30, 1978
11.       Planning and design for the first construction season are proceed-
ing well and no problems are foreseen. It is expected that the Credit will
be declared effective before August 10, 1973.
Loan 898-TH, Fourth Railway Project; US$15 Million Loan of June 1, 1973;

Financing Plan:     The following financing plan is based on the Borrower's
estimated requirements of US$243.9 million for its total
development program during the period 1973-1979. These
requirements include the cost of that part of the project
which is proposed for financing by the ADB (US$68.3 mil-
lion); interest during construction on the Bank and ADB
loans (US$18.8 million), other works by MWWA during the
period (US$15.9 million) and an increase in working
capital (US$0.5 million). They exclude US$3.6 million
of project expenditures made before Fiscal Year 1973.

Procurement
Arrangements:        Contracts would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Eligible domestic manufacturers of goods would be
accorded a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f.
price of competing imports or the rate of applicable
customs duties, whichever is lower. Thailand does not
participate in any regional arrangement which gives
import duties preference to certain foreign suppliers.
Consultants:         Camp, Dresser & McKee International (Boston) have con-
tracts for detailed design and preparation of tender
documents. A contract is being negotiated with BVI-CDM
Associates (Kansas City and Boston) to provide engineering
services during construction. Booz, Allen and HAmilton,
International (New York) are the management and
financial consultants for the project.
Rate of Return:      The incremental internal financial return is estimated
at about 8.0%.
