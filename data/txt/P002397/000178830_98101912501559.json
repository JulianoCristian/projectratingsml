"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project seeks over a five-year\n            period to consolidate and expand the assistance to small\n            farmers in the Eastern region which was begun under the\n            previous two Bank Group integrated agricultural projects. By\n            extending coverage to farmers in the entire Eastern Region,\n            it would further increase food and export crop production\n            and raise agricultural incomes. It provides: agricultural\n            inputs, credit, extension services, feeder roads, and\n            village wells in the project area; and technical assistance\n            to the Ministry of Agriculture to support and plan future\n            agricultural development projects throughout the country.\n            About 12,600 farm families, all of whom earn per capita\n            incomes below US$200 per annum, would earn significantly\n            higher incomes under the crop improvement and credit plans.\n            Taking into account the improvement in agricultural services\n            and the road and well components, altogether some 50,000 (or\n            50 percent) of the rural families in the province would\n            benefit. Normal risks associated with projects of this kind\n            would be reduced by the fact that this is the third phase in\n            the area and would build upon the organizational structure\n            and techniques developed in the previous phases. The main\n            risk would be that difficulties in strengthening the\n            extension would arise."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
