{"cdata!": "The main objectives of the Power Sector\n            Rehabilitation and Expansion Project are to: 1) assist the\n            Government in optimizing its investment decisions and help\n            meet demand growth; 2) help improve the efficiency of the\n            power supply system by rehabilitating and reinforcing\n            transmission and distribution systems; converting generating\n            plants from open to combined cycle operations; and\n            installing modern load dispatch centers; 3) strengthen the\n            planning adiministrative and management capabilities of the\n            power companies through technical assistance and training;\n            4) rationalize and strengthen the training systems for the\n            power sector; and 5) assist in the reivew of issues and\n            options in the promotion of electricity energy efficiency\n            and demand side management. The project will finance\n            priority investments in the power systems of Southern and\n            Central Vietnam falling under the jurisdictions of Power\n            Company 2 (PC2) and Power Company 3 (PC3). Components for\n            PC2 include: 1) rehabilitation and reinforcement of the\n            distribution system in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC); 2)\n            conversion of three 37.5 MW open cycle turbines to a 170 MW\n            combined cycle unit at Ba Ria; 3) establishment of the\n            Southern Region Load Dispatch Center; 4) establishment of\n            the Southern Region Training Center; 5) resettlement and/or\n            compensation of persons affected; and 6) consulting services\n            for detailed engineering, procurement and construction\n            supervision, and an engineering study for the Dai Ninh\n            Hydropower project. Components for PC3 include: 1)\n            rehabilitation and reinforcement of the distribution systems\n            of the cities of Hue and Nhatrang; 2) construction of the\n            220 kV substations at Krongbuk and Nhatrang, and expansion\n            of the 100 kV substations at Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lien Tri;\n            3) establishment of the Central Region Load Dispatch Center;\n            4) establishment of the the Central Region Training Center;\n            5) resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected; 6)\n            consulting services for detailed engineering, procurement\n            and construction supervision. The project also includes:\n            expansion of the National Load Dispatch Center; procurement\n            of equipment for the National Training Center; and\n            engineering studies for the Son La Hydropower project - for\n            the Ministry of Energy. Also for the Power Sector in\n            general: technical assistance in strategic planning, MIS,\n            human resource development, financial management and\n            materials management; and technical assistance in\n            demand-side management and electricity efficiency improvement."}, "docdt": "1995-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
