Background
2.          Viet Nami began the transifion from a cenitrally planned to a market ec(onomy in 1986. at
the Sixth Congress olf ilh Vietnamese Communist Party. Thliis process was accelerated in 1989 with the
devaluation of the Douig and (hc deconitrolling of most prices. In 1993. Viet Nain obtained access to
concessional intei-iational finance. wilie the 1JS embargo was lifted in early 1994. All these events
provided a stimulus to the cconony. whichi responded with a rapid growth of about 8%  p. a. over
1992-1994.  GDP is forecast to continue growing at this rate for the rest of the decade.  In the
economy's continueJ transiTion and growth. the energy sector. whiicih providtes approximately one third
of the naticn's lor ign exchanige earnings, will play a vital role. Viet Nam's economic development
will be closely linked it) growth in eniergy supplies in general. and electricity in particular.
3.          Per capita consumption of commercial energy and electricity in Viet Nam, at around 113
kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) and 15  kWh p. a., respectively. are amongst the lowest in the
world. In comparison, per capita consumption values are 215 kgoe and 375 kWh in the Philippines and
325 kgoe and 750 kWh in Thailand. Per capita electricity consurnption is projected to double over the
next decade, while the demand for electricitv (currentiv 2,300 MW and 1,200 Gwh p.a.) is forecast to
grow by over 12% p.a. to tihe year 2000 and about 10% p. a. thereafter. To stistain this level of
growth, the investment rcquired in the power sector during 1995-2005 would be in the order of US$6
billion, US$4.5 billion in generation andl US$1.5 billion in transmission and distribution. It would be
a challenge for the Government to raise this level of financing and for the power companies to execute
the expansion programs-
4.          Viet Nam finds itself with a power sy:;em that is old, inefficient and over-stressed. The
dependable generation capacities are well below installed capacities due to poor condition of its thermal
plants. The country's transmission and distribution systems are based on multifarious standards and are
unreliable and underrated. The transmissionl and distribution losses currently run well over 20%,
including non-technical losses of about 6%. There is an urgent need to rehabilitate and strengthen the
networks to reduce losses, improve reliability and cairy tihe forecast higher loads. The system's Load
Dispatch and Control facilities, that are so vita, for its efficient operation. are only just beginning to
take shape. Regional Load Dispatch Centers. one each in the North, South ai;d Center of Viet Nam are
yet to be built. while the recently built National Load Dispatcii Center necd- o be strengthened.
Likewise, the facilities for training of staff and technicians to wen the utilities, are woefully inadequate



-2-
and need to he substantially upgraded if the utilitics are to operate a vastly expanded power system
according to modern practices.
5.         Electricity tariffs were increased almost two-fold in 1992, with the average tariff reaching
about 4.5 USc/kWh. In August 1994. a further tariff reform was implemented, with higher rates for
consumlption above minimum levels for residential consumers. Currently tariffs average just over 5
USc/kWh. Although the tariff schedule contains peak and off-peak rates for energy, the absence of
lime-of-day metering, even for the largest consumers, makes their implementation impracticable. The
Government proposes to raise tariffs in a series of steps to 7 USc/kWh by 1999, when tariffs will be
ahout 90% of long run marginal cost, as compared to 70% at present. Its implementation would test
the Government's political resolve.
6.         Viet Nam has a low level of GDP of US$2 per kgoe of commercial energy consumption.
In comparison, in 1992 Thailand and Philippines produced US$3.1 and US$2.7 of GDP per kgoe,
respectively. The industrialization of the country and the switch to comnmercial fuels would increase the
energy intensity, and it is important that conservation measures are introduced now to moderate the
growth in the demand for energy. While there is a growing awareness of the need for energy
conservation and demand-side management in Government and utility circles, there has been very
limited application of energy efficiency measures and other demand-side management activities in Viet
Nam. The.e is also very little energy end use data available in the country. Viet Nan needs to
implement all available cost effective demand-side management (DSM) measures to use electricity in the
most efficient manner, commensurate with the country's development.
7.         In 1991, Viet Nam  adopted the National Plan for Environment and Sustainable
Development: A Framework for Action (NPESD). This provides a comprehensive framework for
establishing, over the next 10 years, the necessary policies, institutions, laws, regulations and programs
for addressing environmental issues. In the energy sector it acknowledges that programs will be
required for envionmnental impact assessments (EIAs), watershed management. oil spill contingency
planning, air, water and soil pollution, and energy demand management through conservation programs
or legislation such as fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. The Governmnent is preparing a National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), building on the Bank's report entitled Enviromnental Program and
Policy Priorities (Report No. 13200-VN). Viet Nam has also begun to establish the legal and
institutional framework required to implement environmental management programs. The Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is the Government's main environmental arm. A Law
on Protection of Environment was enacted in December 1993. Amongst other provisions it: (a)
identifies in general terms the responsibilities of the state organizations and individuals to prevent and
remedy environmental deterioration and pollution; and (b) provides for the development of
environmental standards and submission of environmental impact reports on new and existing facilities
and provides for responsible parties to pay compensation for environmental damage. Several other
legal initiatives relevant to the energy sector have been completed or are being developed. These
include the Act of Forestry Protection and Development (enacted by the National Assembly on August
18, 1991), the Regulation on Environmental Protection in Marine Petroleum Operation (enacted
September 5. 1990), waste water guidelines and regulations, and a Mining Law.
8.         Much of the energy sector remains under Government ownership and control.  All
authority within the sector is derived from the nation's senior Governmental and political body, the
Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister. Institutional arrangements in the sector are
complex, involving several ministries and Goverrnent bodies, of which the Ministry of Energy (MOE)



-3-
is the most important. Responsibility for planning, pricing and forcign investment across the whole
economy, including the energy sector, falls under the jurisdiction of three State Committecs whicih
report to the Council of Ministers. With the continued shift towards a market economy. thc role of
these committees would need to and is gradually changing from prescriptive to market-based planning.
9.         The power sector is currently divided into three distinct regional systems each managed by
a separatc power company that is responsible for generation, transmission and distribution. The
management practices of the three power companies are outdated and their financial and accounting
systems are inadequate. The companies lack defined corporate objectives and no mechanisms are in
place to foster efficiency or emphasize accountability. To meet Government's overall objectives of
reforming state enterprises and moving from centrally planned to market-oriented mechanisms, it would
be necessary to adopt a phased approach: First, strengthen the power sector institutions through
technical assistance, training and provision of modern management tools; Second, move towards
commercialization and corporatization of the institutions, increasing their autonomy and accountability;
and Third, introduce transparent regulatory mechanisms, distancing Governmcnt (the owner) from
regulating, managing and operating the institutions and thus paving the way for private sector
participation.
10.        The Government is currently developing proposals to restructure the power sector to
introduce the flexibility and efficiency that will be needed if the rapid increase in demand is to be met.
On January 1, 1995, the Government, pursuant to a Prime Ministerial decree, created the Electricity of
Viet Nam (EVN), to manage the entire power sector, with MOE, henceforth, playing a broad policy
making and oversight role. The legal charter of EVIN laying out the exact scope of its responsibilities
and the organizational boundaries of the power sector entities under it is yet to be defined. Tentative
proposals envisage the creation of multiple independent accounting and legal entities in the core
operational areas of generation, transmission and distribution. The existing three power companies
would be unbundled, each company becoming a distribution company, owning and operating the
transmission and distribution systems at 110 kV and lower, as well as small generating plant, 40 MW
and below. Separate distribution companies would be created for power distribution in Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City. A Generation Group would be created which would own and control all the larger
generating plant, with a Transmission Group owning and operating all transmission systems at and
above 220 kV. While the details remain to be decided, it is encouraging that there is to be
organizational separation of generation, transmission and distribution operations. This unbundling of
the power sector entities would make them more amenable to future corporatization and
commercialization. Also, being a strong commercially-oriented entity, EVN would be in a position to
play an effective role in negotiating and finalizing Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts.
11.        In November 1993, the Government issued a decree on BOT contracts, designed to
facilitate the introduction of this style of project into Viet Nam. The particular emphasis was on
infrastructure, including power. The regulations, among other things, seek to define the terms and
conditions under which BOT companies can be established, the taxation that such projects will attract,
and a guarantee regarding conversion of local currency into foreign expenditure. Several BOT
proposals for power generation are currently under Goverrnent's consideration.
12.        The proposed project addresses the pressing issues facing the Vietnamese power sector
today. It focuses on the three most urgent needs of the sector: First - to improve technical and
operational efficiency - through rehabilitation, reinforcement and introduction of modem system control
and training facilities; Second - to improve managerial efficiency - through the Power Sector



-4-
Institutional Strengthening study; and Third - to improve sectoral efficiency - through the Power Scctor
Reform and Restructuring study (ESMAP study associated with the project), and the Demand Sidc
Management study.
Project Objectives
13.        The main objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) assist the Government in
optimizing its investment decisions and help meet demand growth; (b) help improve the efficiency of
the power supply system by: (i) rehabilitating and reinforcing transmission and distribution systems; (ii)
converting generating plants from open to combined cycle operation; and (iii) installing modern load
dispatch centers; (c) strengthen the planning, administrative and management capabilities of the power
companies through technical assistance and training: (d) rationalize and strengthen the training systems
for the power sector; and (e) assist in the review of issues and options in the promotion of electricity
energy efficiency and demand side management.
Project Description
14.        The proposed project would finance priority investments in the power systems of Southern
and Central Viet Nam falling under the jurisdictions of PC2 and PC3, respectively. Its components
include: (a) for PC2: (i) rehabilitation and reinforcement of the distribution system in Ho Chi Minh
City; (ii) conversion of three 37.5 MW open cycle turbines to a 170 MW combined cycle unit at Ba
Ria; (iii) establishment of the Southern Region Load Dispatch Center; (iv) establishment of the Southern
Region Training Center; (v) resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by components a (i)
and a (ii); and (vi) consulting services for detailed engineering, procurement and construction
supervision, and an engineering study for the Dai Ninh Hydropower project; (b) for PC3: (i)
rehabilitation and reinforcement of the distribution systems of the cities of Hue and Nhatrang; (ii)
construction of the 220 kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line and 220 kV substations at Krongbuk
and Nhatrang, and expansion of the 110 kV substations at Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lien Tri; (iii)
establishment of the Central Region Load Dispatch Center; (iv) establishment of the Central Region
Training Center; (v) resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by components b (i) and b
(ii); and (vi) consulting services for detailed engineering, procurement and construction supervision.
The project also includes: (a) for MOE: (i) expansion of the National Load Dispatch Center; (ii)
procurement of equipment for the National Training Center; and (iii) engineering studies for the Son La
Hydropower project; and (b) for the Power Sector: (i) technical assistance in strategic planning, MIS,
human resource development, financial management and materials management; and (ii) technical
assistance in demand-side management and electricity efficiency inprovement. Also, in association
with the project, the ESMAP division of the Bank would be conducting a study entitled "Power Sector
Reform and Restructuring". This study would assist the Government and EVN in making the transition
from the existing power sector structure to the new structure. This effort is based on the principles of:
(a) improving the operational efficiency of the sector; (b) commnercialization and corporatization of the
constituent operations to provide greater managerial and financial autonomy; (c) developing an
appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would allow for greater enterprise autonomy and
requisite government regulatory oversight; and (d) a financially viable and open sector structure that
allows for increased private involvement in financing sector expansion.
15.        Total financing required for the project is US$247.9 million equivalent (including IDC),
with a foreign exchange cost of US$165.9 million. The proposed credit will finance almost the full
foreign exchange cost of the project. A breakdown of costs and the financing plans are shown in



-5-
Schledule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursemcnts, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing would bc permitted to the extent of US$5.0 million
equivalcnt for payments madc. prior to thc date of the Credit Agreement but after August 23, 1994 (the
appraisal starting date), for contracting urgently required goods and consulting services. This is
necessary to meet the projcct implementation schedule. A timetable of key processing events and status
of Bank Group operations in Viet Nam are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.13586-VN, dated April 14, 1995 is being distributed
separately.
Project Implementation
16.        PC2 and PC3 would be responsible for implementing the major portion of the project,
managing components falling within their jurisdiction in South and Central Viet Nam, respectively.
The technical experts of the MOE would be responsible for implementing the strengthening of the
National Load Dispatch Center, while PCI will assist MOE in implementing the component for
strengthening of the National Training Center in Hanoi. The Personnel Department of MOE will
manage the technical assistance studies relating to Power Sector Institutional Strengthening and Power
Sector Reform and Restructuring, while the Energy Institute will manage the technical assistance study
for Demand Side Management. Adequate consulting assistance is being provided under the project to
assist the implementing agencies in developing designs and bid documents, evaluating bids and
preparing evaluation reports, project management including construction supervision and progress
reporting. Draft bidding documents following the Bank guidelines have already been prepared by
consultants under grant funding secured by IDA; these will be refined and finalized by the consultants
employed under the project.
17.        Both PC2 and PC3 have prepared Project Implementation Plans following Bank guidelines.
Project Management Units (with a Project Manager and staff positions) will be set up within PC2 and
PC3 specifically for managing the IDA-assisted project components. Bidding Evaluation Committees
(having representation from the MOE) will be set up for PC2 and PC3 for approving bid documents
and contract awards.
18.        The major portion of the project implementation would be over the 1995-97 period. The
Vietnamese institutions are technically well experienced in implementing the project components and
with the expatriate consulting assistance provided under the project, no substantive problems are
foreseen in efficient and timely implementation of the project. The implementing arrangements are
satisfactory to IDA.
Project Sustainability
19.        The technologies for all project components are well proven and the project agencies are
adept in their application. Training would be imparted to selected personnel for operation and
maintenance of technologically complex equipment and systems such as for the load dispatch centers.
On a long term perspective, the training system for the power sector would be rationalized and
strengthened. The project's physical sustainability would be thus assured. All project components form
part of the least cost power development plan and have robust economic rates of return (para. 28). The
project would thus be economically sustainable. The management of the power utilities would be
strengthened through technical assistance and their financial performance progressively improved



-6-
throLlghl improvemicints in svstem elTiciency and rate adjustmcnts. Thcsc measures would be conducive
to Ill.: prqjicl's financial sustainability.
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement
20.        There have becin no previous IDA operations in the power sector in Viet Nam. However,
I)/A has %c cry recently bcen involved in the resettlement process in its Highway Rehabilitation Project
and the lessons learned from this projeci in regard to defining project affected persons and the legal
framework for resettlement and compensation have been drawn upon in preparing the proposed project.
Lessons from otlher power projects that are pertinent to this project are: (a) the need for thorough
investigations in the preparation of technologically complex components. This project is technically
straightforward in as much as the technologies of the various components are fairly straightforward and
familiar to the Vietnamese; where more complex technology is involved (load dispatch centers) adequate
foreign consulting assistance has been and will be availed of; (b) the need for care in preparing the cost
estimates; adequate contingencies have been provided in the project; and (c) the need to strengthen the
implementation capabilities of the institutions.  While the concerned Vietnamese institutions are
technically capable of implementing the project documents, they need considerable assistance in
preparing bidding documents, bid evaluations and progress reports. This has been addressed by
providing consulting assistance for managing each project component.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
21.        The Bank's Energy Sector Investment and Policy Review for Viet Nam (Report No.
10842-VN) has been instrumental in identifying the issues and options facing the energy sector and in
assisting the Government in developing its first least-cost power development plan. Viet Nam's need for
investment in the power sector is large. While IDA could finance only a fraction of the sector
investment program, its participation in the sector would help catalyze funds from other bilateral and
multilateral sources. The Government is committed to reforming state enterprises and moving from
centrally planned to market-oriented mechanisms. For the power sector, this would involve a staged
process of transition; first strengthening ehe existing institutions, then commercializing and corporatizing
them and subsequently introducing reforms and a regulatory framework conducive to private sector
participation.  IDA's assistance in this effort would make a major contribution to an orderly
development of the sector. Finally, involvement of IDA in the early stages of development is expected
to have a significant influence on the optimum use of limited resources in fostering efficiency and
conservation and an environmentally sustainable development.
22.        The project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. 13545-
VN, presented to the Board on October 25, 1994) which proposes working with the Government to
continuously update its development plan, taking account of changing economic conditions; to improve
efficiency of electricity utilization through rehabilitation and upgrading of the power systems, proper
pricing and conservation; and to strengthen power agencies through technical assistance and training.
23.        The policies and programs pursued by the Government in the power sector are in
compliance with the Bank's policies and guidelines for commitment to efficiency improvement
(including demand-side management and energy conservation), sector reform and restructuring, moving
towards comnmercialization and corporatization, and encouraging private participation.



-7-
Agreed Actions
24.        During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Borrower and the power companics
on the following:
(a)  annual review of the power dcvelopment plan and the electricity tariffs;
(b)  financial and non-financial covenants for the power companies in regard to: (i)
implementation of an action plan to progressively reduce nion-technical losses to 3 % and
reduce net receivables, by December 31, 1996 to no more than four months of sales
revenues for PC3; (ii) generation of funds from internal sources equivalent to 25% of
annual average investment for 3 years for PC2; (iii) realization of satisfactory operating
ratios by PC3; and (iv) achievement of debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 for
PC2 and 1.3 for PC3;
(c)  implemenitation of the environmental impact mitigation plan for the combined cycle
conversion component and rehabilitation/compensation plans for the transmission and
distribution components as detailed in documents agreed with IDA;
(d)  preparation of institutional development studies under the project and subsequent
implementation of their recommendations; and
(e)  to the extent that envisaged organizational changes in the power sector (para. 10) will
affect the implementation responsibilities for the proposed project, it will be necessary for
the Borrower to define its financial and operational objectives for the member enterprises
and discuss and agree with IDA on appropriate modifications to the legal agreements for
the project (including appropriate financial and other conditionalities), both for ensuring
satisfactory implementation of the project and for monitoring the operations of the power
sector.
Environmental and Resettlement Aspects
25.        A detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the Ba Ria Combined Cycle project
component has concluded that with proper design and mitigation measures, atmospheric and aquatic
impacts would be within acceptable limits. The EIA has beer. approved by the Government. PC2 has
agreed to design the plant and follow appropriate mitigation measures as outlined in the EIA docur.ent
and to compensate the shrimp farming cos nunity, if necessary, at rates that have been mutually agreed
upon.
26.        The 220 kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line route traversing through agricultural and
tree-crop land does not encroach on ecologically sensitive areas. The 220 kV Krongbuk and Nhatrang
substations are located on grass land. A detailed survey of persons affected by the project has been
carried out by PC3. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) acceptable to IDA has been prepared by PC3
and was agreed with the Government prior to negotiations.
27.        Rehabilitation of old, cluttered distribution networks of PC2 and PC3 in Ho Chi Minh
City, Hue and Nhatrang, would contribute to greater safety and present better aesthetic appearance.
For rehabilitation and expansion of these distribution systems, it would not be possible to estimate the



-8-
number of persons affccted by the project. until detailed designs and line surveys have been carried out
during the project implcmcntation phasc. Hcnce, a detailcd Phasc-l RAP (outlininlg the framework,
principles and practices) has becn prepared in consultation with thc powei companies. The l'hasc-l
RAP was agrecd with the Govcrnmcnt prior to negotiations. Phase-2 RAPs (giving dctailed surveys.
implementation arrangements and the budget) would bc prepared and submitted to IDA by PC2 and
PC3.  Approval of the Phase-2 RAPs by IDA and the Borrower would be a condition for IDA
disbursement against expenditurcs incurred under these components.
Benefits and Risks
28.        Development of the power sector is crucial for the economic upliftment of Vict Nam.
Implementation of the proposed project would help ensure the country's continued economic growth.
While providing the much needed capital for investment, the project would make a significant
contribution towards improving the efficiency of the power sector, in terns of reducing fuel costs,
reducing losses and improving system operation and control - all proven measures to achieve benefits at
the lowest cost. Other project benefits would be strengthening of the power sector institutions, preparing
them to handle efficiently the requirements of a rapidly growing system, and moving them towards
market-oriented approaches. The estimated economic rates of return for the various project components
range from 18% to 56%.
29.        The project faces the following potential risks: First, delay in meeting the level of demand
growth to maintain the project's economic viability, due to delays in securing counterpart funds;
Second, delays in project implementation due to: (i) teething problems of working with international
financial institutions; and (ii) unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The risk of demand
not materiali7ing as forecast is low, as the project focuses on areas of high potential growth. The risk
of undue delays in project implementation has been minimized by extensive preparation work,
institutional strcngthening measu.es and substantive consulting assistance in project detailed design and
construction supervision.
Recommendation
30.        I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
