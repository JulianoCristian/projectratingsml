capacity at Ba Ria Power Station in\n            South Vietnam.  The project has major environmental benefits\n            in the provision of an extra 80 MW generation capacity\n            without the consumption of extra fuel or additional\n            emissions to the atmosphere.  It will allow the\n            strengthening of the power supply system, the improvement of\n            living standards, and the development of industry and other\n            economic activities.   The main environmental issue that\n            arose was in relation to the cooling system.  The initially\n            selected system, which was a direct cooling system taking\n            water from the nearby Dinh river estuary, was not suitable\n            for environmental reasons.  The system eventually selected\n            was an air cooled condenser.  Planned mitigation measures\n            include noise control by the acoustic insulation of  new\n            plant as well as the treatment of all waste streams to the\n            required standard before discharge.  Because of the minor\n            residual negative impacts of the  development, no further\n            mitigation measures are required."}, "docdt": "1995-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
