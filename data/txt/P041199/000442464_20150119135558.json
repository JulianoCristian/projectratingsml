The social\n            fund for development (SFD) was established in 1997, with\n            support from the World Bank, to help reduce poverty, provide\n            basic health and social services to remote and poor\n            communities, and provide economic opportunities. In remote\n            mountaintop villages, the SFD has worked with communities to\n            restore traditional water harvesting systems and also\n            increased girls' school enrollment by constructing new\n            classrooms. In some communities, the SFD has supported new\n            health centers and connected remote villages with\n            marketplaces by building new roads."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
