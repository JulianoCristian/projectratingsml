Providing Basic Services to Isolated Villages in Yemen                                                    July 1, 2002
                      Remote mountain villages in Yemen, one of the world's poorest countries, often lack the most basic
                      services such as schools and clean water.  The Social Fund for Development (SFD) was established in
                      1997, with support from the World Bank, to help reduce poverty, provide basic health and social
                      services to remote and poor communities, and provide economic opportunities.

                      In remote mountaintop villages, the SFD has worked with communities to restore traditional water-
                      harvesting systems and also increased girls' school enrollment by constructing new classrooms.  In
                      some communities, the SFD has supported new health centers and connected remote villages with
marketplaces by building new roads.

Education projects amount to more than 50 percent of the SFD's activities, followed by water and healthcare projects.  Since
its establishment, the Fund has signed contracts for over 2,420 projects, of which some 1,115 have been completed,
benefiting more than five million people across Yemen.
