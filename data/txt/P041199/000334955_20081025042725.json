In 1997, the Social Fund for Development (SFD)\n            was established with an International Development\n            Association (IDA) credit of US$30 million. Through this\n            project, the World Bank brought its global, regional and\n            country experiences on social funds and microfinance to\n            Yemen. Two more IDA credits were provided to further support\n            the SFD in 2001 and 2005. Other donors also started\n            supporting the successful SFD. By 2005, the SFD had\n            substantially improved basic services for nearly 10 million\n            direct beneficiaries in remote mountain villages. Of these,\n            2 million people got improved water supply services."}, "docdt": "2006-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
