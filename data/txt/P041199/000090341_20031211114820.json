Project for Yemen were as follows: the outcome\n            was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both highly satisfactory.\n            The lessons learned indicate that the quite positive outcome\n            of Social Fund for Development (SFD) activities, both in\n            quantitative and qualitative terms, confirms that even in a\n            country with such human and financial capacity constraints\n            as Yemen, the Social Fund concept can work in an effective\n            and efficient manner. At the start of the project, the\n            country's poverty data were far from reliable. Although\n            the SFD had an agreed system of regional targeting as of\n            1998, its management preferred to use data on the lack of\n            services in each client community. The preparation and\n            appraisal of the small and microenterprise component did not\n            foresee the political difficulty of providing technical\n            assistance to commercial financial institutions and did not\n            sufficiently assess the financial soundness of some of those\n            institutions. Community participation in all phases of the\n            subproject cycle was a major element of the initial SFD\n            design, but implementation by the communities and training\n            by SFD-funded NGOs proved more time-consuming than expected.\n            Despite written agreements with the line agencies on\n            adequate operation and maintenance, these agencies mostly\n            were unable to deliver, particularly when it came to routine\n            and major maintenance. The introduction of proper technical\n            design and procurement requirements by the SFD led to\n            increasing competition among contractors and lower unit\n            costs for basic infrastructure, such as school construction.\n            Because of its ability to function with considerable\n            autonomy, the SFD was able to quickly establish its\n            credibility as a neutral and professional outfit. The\n            initial consideration of a separate gender office in the\n            SFD, copied from the Egypt Social Fund, was rejected in\n            favor of \"mainstreaming\" the gender issue. The\n            Bank proved willing to deliver on the PAD statement that\n            project staff should be assigned to the field office; this\n            provided the SFD with quick and ongoing access to Bank\n            supervision and technical assistance, although this did have\n            budgetary implications. The Bank proved willing to deliver\n            on the PAD statement that project staff should be assigned\n            to the field office; this provided the SFD with quick and\n            ongoing access to Bank supervision and technical assistance,\n            although this did have budgetary implications."}, "docdt": "2003-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
