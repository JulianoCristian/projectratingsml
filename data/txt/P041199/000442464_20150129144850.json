In one of the\n            poorest countries in the world, the SFD aims to improve\n            access to basic services such as education and healthcare,\n            and support income generation through micro finance and\n            access to savings services. Promoting access to safe water\n            and health services is also a project priority, accounting\n            for 24 percent of SFD funding: 518 water projects are\n            providing potable water to 1.4 million Yemenis for the first\n            time. In addition to jobs created through the expansion of\n            social services, the SFD is creating opportunities through\n            microfinance projects, which in the past five years have\n            extended loans to more than 17,000 borrowers. With other\n            donors, the World Bank is currently preparing a third phase,\n            estimated at 400 million dollars for 2004-2009."}, "docdt": "2003-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
