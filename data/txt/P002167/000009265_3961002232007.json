      government's efforts in the areas of fiscal management\n            and privatization and commercialization. The project\n            comprises the following three components: fiscal management;\n            privatization and commercialization and institutional\n            support and studies. For fiscal management, assistance will\n            be provided to departments under the Federal Ministry of\n            Finance to improve the budgetary process, in revenue\n            collection and expenditure controls, national accounting\n            operations and tax policies. The privatization and\n            commercialization component provides support to facilitate\n            the implementation of public enterprise reforms through\n            assistance to the Technical Committee for Privatization and\n            Commercialization, to the Ministry of Finance Incorporated,\n            or to any other agency. Assistance will also be provided to\n            the Utility Charges Commission, the regulatory body for\n            utility tariffs, and to parastatal agencies to assist in\n            implementing their transition to private/commercialized\n            entities. The institutional support and studies component\n            will provide funds to agencies as they develop their\n            programs within the overall objectives of the project, in\n            areas such as public expenditure control, financial sector\n            management, civil service reform, poverty alleviation and\n            gender aspects."}, "docdt": "1992-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
