Nonetheless,\n            design flaws made project implementation problematic, and\n            the failure of the project to designate responsibility, and\n            authority to a specific department at the early stages, was\n            conducive to the absence of ownership. This led to a\n            significant shift, when implementation responsibility was\n            defined, and efficiently handled, and the performance of the\n            Borrower, improved dramatically. However, infrequent, and\n            inadequate Bank supervision, failed to include training, and\n            financial management support, during early critical stages\n            of implementation. The lessons learned reinforce once again,\n            that technical assistance lending (TAL) instruments, do not\n            provide broad strategies to address various weaknesses, or\n            systemic problems in critical areas. Thus, it is suggested\n            that future TAL projects, could provide procurement clinics,\n            and workshops - prior to effectiveness - for participating\n            agencies, and stakeholders. The project also conveyed the\n            need to establish an annual review process, in order to\n            enhance a positive interaction among the Borrower, its\n            implementing agencies, and the Bank, to minimize\n            implementation difficulties. The need for adequate\n            institutional development is addressed, to achieve flawless\n            internal controls in reporting requirements, financial\n            management, and auditing procedures."}, "docdt": "2000-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
