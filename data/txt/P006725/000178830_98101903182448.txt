INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR
THE CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PROJECT

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOY'4ENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PIOPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE CAQUETA LAND COLONIZATION PRDJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed,
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$8.1 million
to the Republic of Colombia, the proceeds of which are to be made
available to the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform. (INCORA).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's seventh loan for agri-
culture in Colombia. Two loans (18 00 and 108 CO) for US$5 million Each
to finance the importation of agricultural equipment have been fully
repaid.  The third loan (448 CO) of US$16.7 million was made in October
1966 for the first livestock development project; and. the fourth loan
(502 CO) of US$9 million was made in June 1967 to INCORA for the first
stage of the Atlantico irrigation project. Another loan of US$17 million
was made in June, 1969 for an INCORA agricultural credit project, and
a loan of US$18.3 million was made in December 1969 for the second
livestock development project.
3.        The Caqueta Land Colonization Project was identified as being
of high priority by a Bank mission which reviewed INCORA's program and.
operations in 1967, and was subsequently prepared by INCORA with
assistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
4.        Bank missions to Colombia appraised the proposed loan during
January-June 1970 and negotiations were held in Washington during
January 16-25, 1971. The Government was represented by Dr. Eduardo
Gaitan (Minister Plenipotentiary of the Colombian Embassy in WJashington)
and Dr. Gabriel Pullido (Division Chief, National Planning Department),
INCORA by Dr. Carlos Villamil (General Manager), Dr. Hernando Durana
(Chief of Planning), and Dr. Gustavo Artunduaga (Project Manager),
the Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero by Dr. Eduardo Vega
(Counsellor to the General Manager) and the Banco Ganadero by Dr.
Arturo Bonnet (General Manager).
5.        The proposed loan,which would be the forty-fourth made to
Colombia, would increase the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to
US$726.8 million (net of cancellations), of which US$572.h million is now
held by the Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$19.5 million for highways
in Colombia. The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA.
credits to Colombia as of March 31, 1971:

6.        Twenty-three loans have been completely disbursed.   Of the
twenty loans with undisbursed balances, disbursements on ten continue
to proceed at a normal rate. After a somewhat slow start, due primarily
to personnel changes that occurred following the April 1970 elections,
disbursements began in March under Loan 682-Oo, in April under Loan 680-Co
and are expected to start shortly under Loan 679-Co. On the remaining
seven loans, the status of project execution is as follows: The Executive
Directors were previously informed that the Closing Date on the Loan
for the Acerias Paz del Rio steel project (Loan 345 co) had been postponed
to June 30, 1971 (R69-215). Almost the entire undisbursed balance
represents amounts being retained from the principal contractor until the
equipment he has supplied has been operating satisfactorily for one year.
Since a switch failed during test runs of this equipment in 1970 and is
in the process of being replaced, the retention period will be substantialy'
extended and a further postponement of the Closing Date is under conside-
ration. In September 1967, the Executive Directors approved amendments
to the Loan Agreement for the Nare hydroelectric project (Loan 369-CGO)
to permit the financing of additional generating units out of project
savings. Accordingly, the Closing-Date was extended by two years to
December 31, 1970    (R67-136).  Subsequent delays in the delivery of
equipment made necessary a further extension of the Closing Date until
December 31, 1971, and it is expected that the loan will be fully
disbursed by that date. Owing principally to delays in building construc-
tion, there has been some delay in the original construction timetable anc.
in the disbursement of Loan 499-O0 for the first Telecommunications project,
and the Closing Date has been postponed from December 31, 1970 to December
31, 1971 (R69-72).  The full amount of the loan has been committed and bot,
disbursement and construction are expected to be completed by the neiw
Closing Date.
7.        Disbursements under Loan 448-0o for the first livestock develop-
ment project, while rapid in the early years, slowed considerably during
the last year and one-half. Discussions uith the executing agency for
the project identified several causes for this problem, the most important
one being the agencyts failure to provide working capital finance to
project ranchers. Agreement was reached in March 1971 on the resolution
of the principal difficulties, including confirmation of the commitment
by the borrower and executing agency to provide the necessary working
capital finance. W4hile disbursements should now proceed t a satisfactory
rate, the project will be kept under close supervision during the coming
months. The problems which affected Loan 448-Go also delayed the decla-
ration of effectiveness of the loan for the second livestock development
project (Loan 651-CO) until Ilarch of this year, and it will be kept under
similar close supervision. The consultants hired under the first Atlantico
inigticn project (Loan 502-CO) encountered greater difficulty in selecting
suitable soils than had been expected and the' completion of agricultural
plans was delayed and construction purposely slowed until the problem was



- 4 -
solved (in 1970). Disbursements are now proceeding normally, and. it is
expected that they can oe completed by the original Closing Date of
December 31, 1972. The progress of the Agricultural Credit Project
(Loan 624 CO) was delayed initially by problems in the administrative
arrangements for the financing of seasonal credits for project farmers.
These problems have been resolved but contributions from the Government's
budget have not been received to the extent required by the project.
During the past month, however, the Government has paid in additional
amounts and has agreed on a timetable for providing the balance required
for the current calendar year.
8.        I expect to submit to the EXecutive Directors within the next
few weeks loans of US$15.0 million for the Second Telecommunications
Project, US$U8 million for the Second. Bogota Water Supply Project,
US$400. million for the Fourth Development Finance Companies Project,
US$2.0 million for the Palmira Water Supply Project and US$5 million
for the Second Atlantico Development Project.
9.        IFC has made 35 investments and underwriting commitment in
18 enterprises in Colombia totalling US$18.5 million (net of cancellations).

PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       An appraisal repcrt entitled "'Caqueta Land Colonization Project -
Colombia" (FA-60a) on the proposed Project is attached.
12.       INOORA. was established in 1961 as the agency with primary
responsibility for implementation of the agrarian reform law passed in
that year. Its mandate was not only to carry out land redistribution
activities but also to promote the increase in agricultural production
and productivity. Endowed with dynamic leadership, INCORA embarked upcn
an ambitious land titling program and began putting together an
impressive number of development projects in the areas of land reclamation
(irrigation, drainage and flood control), supervised agricultural credit,
and colonization. IWhile the number of titles issued by 1970 had passed
100,000 for about 2.9 million hectares of farm land and the number of
development projects has now reached 42, the agrarian reform program has
nevertheless remained, at least until the last year, the kind of moderate
reform program that had been envisaged by the framers of the 1961 law.
It had been designed as a program which would improve the lot of the small
farmer without sacrificing production, and which would move fast enough
tq4-fatisfy the rural poor without unduly antagonizing property owners.
.Thus, the titling activities have been limited largely to unused public
land,.abandoned private land which reverted to the public domain, or
.private land which was sufficiently marginal that the private owners
preferred to sell to INOORA rather than undertake the heavy investment
thnt-would be required to make the land productive. Since 1968, the
land redistribution activities have also included the granting of certi-
ficates of possessicn (entitling the recipients to INCORA supervised credit)
to farmers uho could establish their status as tenant farmers or share-
croppers, but it uas only in 1970 that steps were undertaken for the first
time to expropriate underutilized high value land. The resulting outcry
from property owiners, and counter-reaction from left of center opinion
urging more rapid redistribution on the ground that the number of small
farmers touched by agrarian reform is still a small portion of the total,
caused the Colombian President to convene a commission in late 1970
to revie-w3 the agrarian reform program and agricultural development in
general. The Commissionts report, on balance, leaned somewhat to the
right, but it is apparent that the Government still intends to push
agrarian reform more aggresively than in the past, as some further ex-
propriation of high value land has been initiated since the report was
issued.
13.       About 80 percent of INCORA's investment funds have :been divided
about equally between its supervised credit and land reclamation activities,
with the balance going to colonization projects.   It has received substantiaL



- 6 -
support from external lending agencies. In addition to the Bank loans
for the Atlantico Irrigation (502 CO for US$9 million) and the
Agricultural Credit (624 CO for US$17 million) projects, INCORA has
received loans totalling US$20.5 million from the Inter-American
Development Bank for irrigation projects and US$18.5 million from the
U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) for supervised credit.
In addition, counterpart funds from AID program and agricultural sector
loans over the past six years have been allocated to INCORA investment
activities in amounts averaging about US$13 million equivalent per
annum. The proposed Bank loan would be the first loan by a major
external lending agency specifically for an INCORA colonization project
(although a significant portion of AID supervised credit funds has been
made available to the Caqueta area).
14.       The Caqueta Project, located along the eastern foothills of
the Andes mountains, is designed to consolidate and expand the largely
spontaneous colonization already underway in the area. Its main purpose
is the same as for all INCORA colonization projects, i.e. to provide
small farmers with an alternative to either continued existence in one
of the traditional rural areas of Colombia where subsistence farming
still predominates, or migration to one of the already over-crowded
cities, where open unemployment has reached an estimated 10 to 15 per-
cent of the urban work force. About 3,500 partially established
settlers and 2,800 new settlers would benefit directly from the Project.
They wouldoperate farms averaging 75 hectares when fully cleared, and
would produce mainly beef, rice and pork for the Colombian domestic
market. Each settler could expect to reach a net cash surplus level
(above subsistence costs) of about US$1,000 per annum at full develop-
ment. The investment costs per settler to the Government of achieving
these income levels are estimated at US$2,000 and the Project would
yield an economic rate of return of 16.5 percent.
15.       Total costs of the Project are US$21.6 million, of which the
Bank would finance the estimated foreign costs of US$5.5 million and
US$2.6 million of local costs (which would represent about 32 percent
of the Banc loan and 12 percent of total local costs of the Project).
This seems fully justified, especially since the Bank's share in the
total cost of the Project would remain at 38 percent. As set forth in
some detail in the Bank's latest economic report on Colombia (WH-200a
of November 1, 1970), Colombia has a well conceived development program,
but, in spite of its efforts to zobilize domestic resources in its
support, requires external assistance in excess of the foreign exchange
component of development projects suitable for international financing.
16.       About US$4.6 million of the proposed loan would help finance
the construction of approximately 380 km. of penetration and access
roads, and US$0.6 million would assist in financing the construction
of primary schools, health centers and administration buildings and the
procurement of a small amount of vehicles and equipment. This portion



- 7-
of the Bank loan would be made available to INCORA by the Borrower on
a grant basis. The remaining US$2.9 million of the loan would finance
medium and long-term credits to about 3,500 partially established and
1,000 (of the 2,800) new settlers in the Project area for farm
investments (fencing, livestock, etc.) and would be on-lent by the
Borrower to INCORA at 4 percent interest, for a term of thirty years,
with ten years' grace. INCORA, in turn, would on-lend these funds
to the Colombian Livestock Bank (Banco Ganadero) at 4 percent interest,
and the Banco Ganadero would lend them to farmers at 8 percent interest,
for terms ranging from seven to twelve years with grace periods between
three and seven years. The exchange risk on these funds would be borne
by the Borrower and the credit risk by the Banco Ganadero. Seasonal
credit (to be financed entirely by the Borrower) would be made available
through the Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Ninern (T.Caja!) at 8 per-
cent interest to the farmers but with TNCORA assuming the credit risk.  All,
loans to farmers would be made on the basis of farm plans prepared by
INCCRA in consultation with the farmer. WTithin INCORA technical
supervision of the Project would reside in the INCORA field headquarters
in Caqueti, now under the direction of a highly ccmpetent project
manager who has supervised road and building construction activities
and coordinated credit operations with the Banco Ganadero and the
Caja in the area for the last seven years.
17.       Highway construction contracts would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding, but are expected to go all to
Colombian firms as an adequate number of qualified local contractors
is available and the contracts are likely to be too small to attract
foreign firms.  Schools would be built on a self-help basis with
materials obtained by INCORA in accordance with its local bidding
procedures. Health centers and administration buildings would be
built by local contractors selected in accordance with INCORA's local
bidding procedures. Goods for on-farm investment would be procured
through normal commercial chlannels except for livestock, which wculd
be procured either through normal commercial channels, with the approval
of the Banco Ganadero, or through the Banco's livestock purchase scheme
currently in effect in the area. The normal commercial channels and
the procedures of INCORA and the Banco Ganadero are considered adequate
to insure competitively-priced goods and services for the Project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMNUTS ATD AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between INCORA and the Bank and
the draft Project Financing Agreement between the Republic of Colombia,
INCORA, Banco Ganadero and the Caja, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.



- 8 -
19.       The draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in
agreements for road and building construction and agricultural credit
projects. The proceeds of the loan would be made available by the
Borrower to INCORA under a Project Financing Agreement wihich has to be
executed a d delivered in the S anish language before the loan can become
effective (Section 8.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
PART V- THE ECONOPY
20.       Colombia's economic situation was fully assessed in the Bank's
November 1970 report, Economic Growth of Colombia: Problems and Prospects
(WH-200a, in 12 volumes). The report emphasizes the progress achieved
in recent years, but also points out that unemployment and widespread
rural poverty require an accelerated development effort. A Basic Data
sheet is annexed.
21.       Colombia's GDP growth rate has been rising at an encouraging
pace, moving up from an average 4.7 percent per annum in the 1960-65
period to 5.2 percent in 1965-68, 6.5 percent in 1969, and approximately
7.0 percent in 1970. Planning mechanisms have been strengthened, and
the country's ability to formulate and execute investment projects is
impressive. In recognition of this ability the Bank-led Consultative
Group agreed, in principle, in February 1971 to support some US$300 million
per year in project assistance to Colombia during the next few years.
22.       The development objectives sought by the Government of Colombia
include an annual GDP growth of 7.5 percent, non-traditional export
growth of 20 percent, and rising levels of public saving and investment.
The export momentum of 1967-69 was interrupted in 1970 by adverse harvest
conditions for certain commodities and increased domestic consumption of
others. Colombia has recently suffered an extremely long and heavy rainv
season, moreover, wqhich may prevent the attainment of agricultural pro-
duction and export growth targets in 1971. On the fiscal front, decrees
have been issued to raise sales and stamp taxes, and preliminary estimates
are that these could result in as much as Col.$500 million in new revenue
during 1971. Additional measures are under consideration which, if
implemented, could provide the remaining Col.$500 million believed
necessary for full financing of the public investment program.
23.       Public and publicly guaranteed external debt, including undis-
bursed amounts, rose from US$1.5 billion at the end of 1969 to an estimated
US$1.7 billion at the end of 1970. Assuming reasonably favorable coffee
prices and a healthy expansion of non-traditional exports during the next



- 9 -
five years, the debt service ratio is expected to remain in the 12-15
percent range. Colombia should, therefore, continue to be creditworthy
for the sizable foreign borrowing program which was recently presented
to the Consultative Group and which was discussed in the aforementioned
Bank economic report.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE IITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
24.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOIMINDATION
25.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed.
loan.
