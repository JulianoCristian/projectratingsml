            PROPOSEDFOURTHPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

                          FinancingandProgramSummary

Borrower:        Government o f Ghana

ProposedAmount:  SDR 97.4 million(US$140 millionequivalent) IDA Credit

Terms:           Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturitywith a 10-year grace period

Description:     The proposed poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-4) is the first in a
                 second series o f annual operations supporting the implementation o f the
                 Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11) covering the period
                 2006-2009, in line with the 2004 Country Assistance Strategy and the
                 proposed 2006 Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CAS-PR). The
                 design o f this new series was coordinated with the other Development
                 Partners that participate in the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS)
                 framework, and this proposed operation will focus on three broad components
                 o f the new poverty reduction agenda organized under: (i)    accelerated private
                 sector-led growth, (ii)  vigorous human resource development, and (iii)    good
                 governance and civic responsibility.       While the PRSC-4 support would
                 translate primarily into funding for the implementation o f the GPRS 11,
                 particular attention i s given leveraging the poverty emphasis o f several sector
                 focused operations by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level and
                 structure) and by addressing some o f the financing implications o f proposed
                 policy actions (e.g., extension o f capitation grants, removal o f school fees,
                 deployment o f teachers and health care professional to under-served areas,
                 and the implementation o f an inclusivehealth insurance scheme). The PRSC-
                 4 also focuses on cross-cutting issues related to private sector development
                 and the strengthening o f institutions, ranging from issues related to
                 governance, public sector reform, decentralization and public financial
                 management.       Issues related to public financial management receive
                 particular attention, since robust public financial management i s critical to
                 ensure the attainment o f the objectives o f a program receiving budgetary
                 support. Hence, the program supported by this operation includes actions
                 aimed at: (i)broadening the scope o f the budget to include internally
                 generated funds, donor funds and the proceeds o f the HIPC debt relief; (ii)
                 supporting the implementation o f the new regulatory framework for public
                 financial management in Ghana (Le., the new Public Procurement Act, and
                 the Internal Audit Agency Act); and (iii)     operationalizing the government's
                 computer-based financial and accounting information system (BPEMS -
                 Budget and Expenditure Management System). Lastly, attention i s given to
                 monitoringpoverty outcomes, ensuring that sector programs deliver results in
                 terms o f human development indicators.        By helping to internalize these
                 monitoring functions, the expectation i s that the allocation of resources will
                 begin to reflect the feedback from these results.

                The forthcoming operation (PRSC-5) would aim at consolidating the
                 achievements inhuman development and public financial management, while
                 sharpening the focus o f the PRSC support on growth-related areas, such as
                the energy and financial sectors, as well as natural resource management.

Benefits:       The proposed PRSC-4 is expected to provide a series of benefits. The main
                 and ultimate benefiti s the human progress towards the MDGs expected from
                 economic growth and improvements in service delivery outcomes as a result
                 o f the implementation o f the program supported by this operation.             In
                 addition, there are two intermediate benefits. The first benefit i s helping
                 maintain macroeconomic stability by contributing to the closing o f the
                 external financing gap.     The second benefit i s enabling Government to
                 generate the funds requiredto execute GPRS I1policies and programs.

Risks:          There are five risks to the success o f the program: (i) size o f the public
                                                                           the
                 sector, which might limit the room available for private sector growth and
                 reduce the scope for fiscal management; (ii)   the continued appreciation o f the
                 cedi, which might slow down export growth; (iii)      quasi-fiscal deficits in the
                 energy sector stemming from delays in adjusting electricity tariffs and from
                 continued sales o f power to Volta Aluminum Company at subsidized rates;
                 (iv) a possible disconnect between increased health spending and improved
                 health outcomes due to weaknesses within the health system and to other
                 factors outside the health system that influence health outcomes; (v) delays in
                 the implementation of reforms that would enhance long term growth
                 prospects; and (vi) remaining fiduciary weaknesses.

Riskmitigation:  The risks associated with the large size o f the public sector are mitigatedby a
                 track record o f aggregate fiscal discipline and by the renewed attention to
                 public sector management and reform. The risk o f continued appreciation o f
                 the cedi are mitigated by reduced fiscal pressures on the exchange rate
                 following two rounds o f external debt relief and by the prospects o f a lower
                 energy import bill once the gas flowing from the West Africa Gas Pipeline
                 can be utilized.    The risks o f quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sector
                 stemming from delays in adjusting electricity tariffs and from sales to
                 VALCO at subsidized rates are mitigated, in the first case, by the anticipated
                 completion o f the utilities tariff review that i s expected to lead to an
                 adjustment in electricity tariffs and, inthe second case, by the initiative from
                 the ministries o f Energy and of Finance and Economic Planning to table to
                 Cabinet a positionpaper proposing to earmark funds inthe budget to cover
                 the tariff subsidy to VALCO.            The risk o f widening lags between
                 increased health spending and improvements in health outcomes are
                 mitigated by ongoing improvements in health administration, including
                 the establishment o f the health insurance scheme, and the government's
                 more integrated approach to the delivery o f human development services,
                 with greater attention to maternal and infant health, as well as to nutrition.
                 The risk o f delays in structural reforms i s reduced by stronger coordination
                 within government, more frequent use o f evidence-based decision making,
                 and the more effective harmonization o f aid efforts in the context o f the

                       MDBS. Lastly, the risk that residual fiduciary weaknesses may lead to the
                       misapplication o f public knds i s steadily decreasing, with continued progress
                       made on strengthening the framework for public financial management.


Disbursements:         SDR97.4 million (US$140 million equivalent) i s expected to be disbursed
                       upon PRSC-4 effectiveness.

                                 1.     INTRODUCTION

1.     This Program Document proposes a single-tranche Fourth Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC-4) for SDR 97.4 million (about US$140 million equivalent) to the
Republic of Ghana on standardIDA terms. The proposedoperation is an integral part o f the
Bank's strategy to support the implementation o f Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (GPRS 11). The proposed operation is the first in a second series of four such
operations, covering the period 2006 to 2009, and would facilitate the implementation o f cross
cutting reforms aimed at improving the living conditions of the Ghanaian population by
promoting private sector led growth, vigorous human development, and strengthening
governance and civic responsibility.

2.     The implementationofthe programsupportedby the first PRSCseries was broadly
satisfactory, and all the prior actions for the proposedPRSC-4 were completed. Actions
completed include the following:

       Eliminating government and district-controlled levies and extending capitation grants to
       all pupils attending public primary andjunior secondary schools.
       Registering the indigents @e., very poor people) at the District-wide Mutual Health
       Insurance Schemes (DMHIS) and having the National Health Insurance Council (NHIC)
       transfer the premium subsidy to district schemes.
       Including HIPC funds in the budget formulation process, with allocations by M D A s in
       the budgetproposal.
       Ensuringthat the provisions o fthe Public Procurement Act are implemented and applied
       to headquarters andregional offices o f key MDAs.
       Lowering the time requiredto register new business to 81 days by end-2005, down from
       85 days in2004.
       Reducing accounts payable to ECG by the M D A s and the Ghana Water Company Ltd.
       (GWCL) to the Electricity Company o f Ghana (ECG).
       Ratifying the United Nations and African Union's Conventions on Anti-Comption,
       ensuring that Ghana's legal definition o f corruption is consistent with international
       conventions.
       Making operational the government's computerized financial and accounting information
       system (BPEMS) at the headquarter offices of the Ministry o f Finance and Economic
       PlanningKontroller and Accountant General Department and at the Ministry o f Health,
       with the system's core functionalities (general ledger, purchase order and accounts
       payable) available for processing and reporting transactions for personnel and
       administrative expenditures.

3.      The forthcoming operation (PRSC-5) would aim at supportingthe consolidationof
the government's achievements in human development (education and health) and public
financial management, while sharpeningthe focus of the support to growth related areas,
namely energy sector reform, financial sector development and natural resource
management. The PRSC support would contribute to the government's efforts to ensure
appropriate expenditure levels in the health sector, while helping address some o f the financing
implications o f proposed increase deployment o f teachers to deprived areas. The PRSC support
would also focus on cross-cutting issues related to public financial management, including attention
to broadening budget reporting, deepening payroll management and control, and completing the
implementation o f the new procurement law. Lastly, the PRSC would support reforms aimed at
ensuring the continuity of the current economic expansion by securing that the country's
commitments to ongoing regional energy projects are maintained, that long term funds are managed
by the private sector, and that funding is available to complete reforms aimed at strengthening
forestry resource management.

4.      The reform program associated with this operation builds on the Government's
GPRS I1and is alignedwith the Bank'sFY04 CountryAssistance Strategy (CAS)' and the
proposedCountry Assistance Strategy ProgressReport (CAS-PR). Given its cross-cutting
focus, PRSC-4 helps harmonize existing sector focused operations, leveraging their poverty
focus by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level and structure) and by addressing
some o f their financing implications agreed policy actions (e.g., the expansion o f capitation
grants and the removal o f primary andjunior secondary school fees, the deployment o f teachers
and health care professional to under-served areas, and the implementation o f an inclusive health
insurance scheme). The PRSC-4 also focuses on cross-cutting issues related to private sector
development and the strengthening o f institutions, centering its support on issues related to
governance, public sector reform, decentralization and public financial management. Issues on
governance include the governance o f natural resources aiming at increasing transparency inthe
management o f forestry development programs and in the allocation of logging rights and the
distribution o f forestry revenues. Issues on governance also include the governance o f public
services, focusing on price setting regulations, as well as the need to increase the access of the
poor to water and electricity services. Issues inpublic sector reform and decentralization focus
on improving service delivery capacity at the central and local government levels. Issues in
public financial management include broadening the scope o f the budget to include internally
generated funds, donor funds and the proceeds o f the HIPC debt relief, as well as supporting the
implementation of the Public Procurement Act, the Internal Audit Agency Act and the Budget
and Expenditure Management System (BPEMS).                   Lastly, attention i s given to monitoring
poverty outcomes, ensuring that sector programs deliver results interms o f humandevelopment
indicators.  By helping to internalize these monitoring functions, the expectation is that the
allocation o f resources will begin to reflect the feedback fi-om these results.


ongoing analytical work on growth and public financial management - the latter in the
5.      PRSC-4 builds on analytical work carried out over the last few years, as well as

context of the preparation of the forthcoming 2006 External Review of Public Financial


'"Ghana:  Country Assistance Strategy"- Report No. 27838-GH, February 20,2004.

Management and the 2007 Country Economic Memorandum. Analytical work completed
during the past years include the FY04 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA),
the FY03 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), the FY03 Poverty Report entitled
`Reducing Poverty and Improving Human Development', and the FY03 FIAS study on
`Regulatory Barriers to Investment in Ghana'.          The program also builds on analytical work
carried out bythe Government and other development partners.

6.      Bilateralandmultilateraldonor assistance will continueto play an importantrole in
supporting the implementationof the GPRS, given that the country's own resources fall
short of the levels required for achieving the objectives spelled out in the strategy. The
GPRS has created the momentum for a significant group o f donors to align their budgetary
support under a common framework, the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS), o f which the
PRSC i s part. As agreed at the November 2005 Consultative Group (CG) meeting, the MDBS i s
an important step taken on the principles o f harmonization, providing a framework for policy
dialogue and decisions linkedto progress inthe implementation o f the GPRS 11.

7.      The Ghanaian economy demonstrated significant resilience in 2005, maintaining
strong real GDP growth and macroeconomicstability, notwithstandingthe sharp increase
in crude oil pricesin internationalmarkets. The latest figures indicate that: (i) annual real
                                                                                       the
GDP growth rate reached 6.0 percent in2005, up further from the 5.8 percent real GDP growth
achieved in 2004; (ii)  overall exports increased only modestly, with the decline incocoa exports
offset by increases in gold and timber exports; (iii)      imports increased by almost 25 percent,
largely due to the 45 percent rise in the price o f imported oil, leading to a sharp increase in the
trade deficit; (iv) increases in official and private transfers (primarily expatriate remittances)
partially offset the widening o f the trade deficit, rising to US$2.0 billion, or the equivalent to 20
percent o f GDP; (v) the fiscal deficit continued shrinking, falling to 3.0 percent o f GDP by end-
2005, down from 3.6 percent o f GDP in 2004, providing scope for an increase in the share o f
credit allocated to the private sector; and (vi) aggregate investment continued strong, with
increases inprivate sector investment matching the recovery inpublic sector investment (Table 1
and2).

8.       The main driver of growthin 2006 appears to have been the increase in investment,
both private and public, with road construction accounting for most of the projected 9
percent real increasein public investment. While private investment matched the increase in
public investment, suggesting that private investment have been able to respond to the
opportunities provided by the economic expansion, there appears that there is still scope for
faster growth through an increase in investment efficiency. At Ghana's current investment to
GDP ratio, almost 30 percent, ifthe efficiency o f investment were at levels comparable to other
developing countries, the country could be growing at an additional 2 to 3 percentage points per
year.2

 The l o w efficiency of investments could reflect a variety o f factors, including that: (i)
                                                                                            public investment accounts
for a large share o f aggregate investment (42 percent); (ii)a large fraction o f private investment i s skewed toward
housing construction, not necessarily leading to an increase in productive assets; and (iii)     there appears to be an
inadequate balance between new investment and expenditures o n operations and maintenance, shortening the life
span o f existing investments.

9.       One of the factors that assisted Ghana in absorbing the impact of higher crude oil
prices was the liberalization of domestic retail prices for petroleum prod~cts.~                       Domestic
retail prices for petroleum products were adjusted three times during the course o f 2005. On
February 18, 2005, the government announced new prices for petroleum retail products,
increasing the cost o f premium gasoline by 50 and all other products (kerosene, liquefied
petroleum gas, gas oil, etc.) by 37 percent. On August 8, 2005, the price for premium gasoline
and diesel oil rose again by 10 percent, and again by around 5 percent on October 5. These
increases were announced by the new independent regulator - the National Petroleum Authority
(NPA) - and designed to automatically reflect the cost o f imported oil, thus beginning the
transition away from government-set prices. Indeed, to arrive at the new ex-refinery prices for
domestic petroleum products, the NPA reviews price developments on the world market, the
prices o f imported finished products, as well as the operations o f the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR).
The price schedule set by the NPA also provides for some degree o f cross subsidization across
petroleum derivatives, with most o f the increases impingingon gasoline and diesel oil prices, and
allowing lower increases inthe prices for kerosene and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).

10.      Prudent fiscal management also contributed to ensuring macroeconomicstability,
with centralgovernmentexpendituresbeingadjusteddownwardsin the last quarter of the
year to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues. Tax revenues collection
undershot budget projections because o f a shortfall in indirect taxes, primarily due to lower than
projected revenues from value added taxes on imports. Expenditure containment, mostly by
delaying capital spending, and an end-year surge inthe collection o f profits and dividends from
State-owned enterprises and parastatals helped offset these shortfalls, however. While this last
quarter adjustment in expenditures does point to an uneven execution o f the budget, it also
signals the government's commitment to prudent o f fiscal management, reinforcing the
commitment to hrther reducing the fiscal deficit. This intention had already been signaled with
the sharp decline in subsidies to the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) following the adjustments in
domestic retail prices for petroleum products.

 11.     Prudent fiscal managementmade possiblea further reductionin the ratio of public
expenditures to GDP. Lower domestic debt service allowed, in turn, lower interest rates,
contributing to maintaining expenditures within the budget ceiling, and exerting a moderating
effect on inflation4 Thus, while headline consumer prices rose to 16.7 percent in March,




  The average price o f crude oil rose to US$54 in2005, up from a US$37 average price in 2004, and i s projected to
reach and remain at the US$60 level for the foreseeable future. Assuming that real GDP growth remains at the
current levels, the oil import bill are projected to rise by around US$200 million in 2006, reaching the US$1.2
billion range, or the equivalent to 10percent o f GDP, up from around US$1 billion in 2005 and US$SOO million in
2004.
  It is important to note that delays in adjusting electricity and water tariffs must also have mitigated the pass-
through effect o f higher petroleum prices. While utility tariffs were reviewed quarterly by the independent Public
UtilityRegulatory Commission (PURC), the regulator assessed that there was no need to adjust electricity tariffs
because of a shift in electricity generation from fuel-based to hydro power generation. With electricity tariffs
unchanged, water tariffs also remained unchanged, reflecting the fact that electricity accounts for around one-third
of the costs o f water production.

following the hike in domestic retail prices for petroleum products, it gradually eased to just
under 15 percent by end-year and inMarch2006 reached 9.9 percent (Figure 1).

12.      The exchange rate also had a moderating effect on inflation, with the cedi
depreciating by only 0.3 percent in nominal terms against the dollar, and the real effective
exchange rate appreciating by around 19 percent. The behavior o fthe exchange rate, as well
as the in-year fluctuations in international reserves at the Bank o f Ghana, reflect the seasonality
inthe country's exchange rate earnings, since most o f the revenues from cocoa exports flow in
the last quarter o f the year. The management o f monetary policy adjusted accordingly to this
seasonality, offsetting the fluctuations in foreign reserves, while supporting the disinflation
process by keeping broad money growth below 2004 levels. Domestic interest rates declined in
line with lower domestic debt stock and inflation rates, permittingcredit to the private sector as a
share o f overall credit to increase to 55 percent by end-2005, up from 50 percent in the previous
year.

13.      Notwithstanding the need to tighten expenditures at the end of the year, fiscal
management maintained its pro-poor orientation, with poverty related expenditures rising
to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2005, up from 7.7 in 2004. Furthermore, aggregate poverty related
expenditures were kept broadly in line with the budget plan, leading to a decline in the budget
deviation index, which reflects the ratio o f actual to planned expenditures.                          The increase in
overall poverty related expenditures and the lower aggregate budget deviation index need to be
considered, however, against three other factors:

    0    The budget execution of poverty related expenditures is dominated by expenditures
         on basic education and primary health care, which together account for 70 percent
         of poverty related expendit~res.~The low budget deviation index was possible




  Poverty related expenditures include current and capital expenditures on basic education, primary health care,
agricultural extension, irrigation projects, rural water, rural electrification, feeder roads, social welfare, governance,
drainage systems,    human rights, public safety, HIV/AIDS, vocationaUemployable                     skills, road safety,

                                                  - 7 -


      therefore because overspending in basic education programs was offset by the under
       spending on primary health programs. The balance between these two large programs
      was reflected ina lower budget deviation weighted by the share o f individual programs in
       overall spending, which closed the year at 16.5 percent, down from 19 percent in 2004.
       While there were larger deviations in the execution of other programs (notably rural
       water and rural electrification), their overall impact was dampened by the size of these
       programs (Figure2).

   0   The dominance of basic education and primary health care programs also meant
       that wages and salaries continued accounting for a large fraction of overall
       spending. The share o fwages andsalaries inoverall spending reached 55 percent, down
       slightly from 56 percent in 2004 (Figure 3). This large share o f wages and salaries in
       overall spending raises inturn three issues o f concern: (i) increase inpoverty related
                                                                         the
       expenditure implies a commensurate increase in spending on wages and salaries inbasic
       education programs, which rose to 81 percent o f total expenditures in 2005, up from 77
       percent in2004; (ii) o f the recent increase inthe wage bill appears to be due to real
                               most
       increases in wages, with only a smaller fraction due to increase in employment (20
       percent in the case o f primary health care); and (iii)      wages and salaries are beginning to
       account for a rising share o f spending in other programs, especially agriculture sector
       programs. In2005, agriculture sector programs saw a higher than anticipatedincreases in
       expenditures on wages and salaries, reflecting serious delays in non-wage related
       expenditures, raising the share o f spending on wages and salaries to almost two-thirds of
       overall expenditures.

     The increase in poverty related expenditures reflects to a large degree a stronger
     poverty orientation of the consolidated fund, which saw its share of funding of
     poverty relatedexpendituresrise to 61 percent, up from 58 percent in 2004 (Figure
     4).   This increase in share of fimding for poverty related expenditures through the
      consolidated fund is remarkable because 2005 saw the emergence o f new sources of
      funding for poverty related expenditures, such as the National Health Insurance Fundand
     the Social Safety Net provided by taxes on petroleum retail products. These new sources
      of funding offset other sources of funding, namely the HIPC funds and the District
     Assembly Common Fund, however, rather than the consolidated fimd, underscoring the
     poverty orientation ofthe consolidated fund.

    B.      ECONOMIC      OUTLOOK

14.     The growthoutlookfor 2006 is positive,with the expansion of the domestic economy
supported by the growth of exports and continued increases in public and private sector
investment. The real GDP growth rate is projected to stay at 6.0 percent, yielding a per capita
real GDP growth in the 3.3 percent range (Table 3). Growth will be supported by new private
sector investment inthe miningsector, as well as continued public sector investment inthe road,
electric power, and water & sanitation sectors. This investment activity i s expected to be
reflected in buoyant construction activity and cement production. Also, service sector activities,
such as tourism, banking and communication, are expected to continue expanding, catering to
visitors, returnee immigrants and a growing urban population. Export growth will be led by the
strong performance o f gold and to a lesser extent non-traditional exports, offsetting the projected
slowdown in growth in cocoa exports. The economy i s therefore expected to show continued
resilience to high crude oil prices, with world prices expected to remain at current levels,
meaning that the oil import bill will rise to the US$1.2 billion range in 2006 and 2007, up from
around US$1billion in2005 and US$SOO million in2004.

15.      The sustainability of the economic expansion is predicated on the continuation of
the current macroeconomicpolicies and the sustained inflows of external remittancesand
official transfers. Maintaining current macroeconomic policies should translate into the
continuing implementation o f prudent fiscal policies, allowing hrtherreductions inthe domestic
debt to GDP ratio, and ensuring that overall fiscal deficit that i s primarily financed through
externally grants. Prudent fiscal management i s particularly important given that the inflows o f
unrequited external transfers, including official grants, debt relief and private remittances are
projected to remain at around 20 percent o f GDP per annum during the remainder o f the decade
(Figure 5). Absorbing these inflows without compromising the performance o fthe export sector
will require ensuring that these resources are directed toward areas that encourage increased
economic productivity, including investments in services for human development (e.g.,
education, health) and inpublic infrastructure that augments the productivity of private factors,

16.    The sustainability of the economic expansion hinges also on actions aimed at
enhancing the efficiency of investment and raising productivity throughout the economy.
At present, growth is being driven primarily by factor accumulation, as reflected in a rising
investment to GDP ratio, with increases in productivity having a negligible effect. This trend
cannot be sustained, however.         Growth driven exclusively by capital accumulation looses
momentum because o f declining marginal productivity o f capital.        Sustained increases in
aggregate investment are consistent with long term growth, however, if coupled with
improvements in productivity, since the causality runs from increased productivity to
opportunities for investments that, inturn, lead to higher growth rates.

17.    Attention to raising productivity is particularly important in view of the recent
appreciation of the cedi (Figure 6). The cedi has increased by around 20 percent against a
trade-weighted basket o f foreign currencies over the last two years, placing a premium on
maintaining external competitiveness by increasingproductivity.

 18.   Actions to be considered in enhancing the efficiency of investment and raising
productivitythroughoutthe economy includethe following:

    0  Ensuring that growth continues to be export-led by maintaining a stable and
       competitive real exchange rate and by expanding the access of Ghanaian exports to
       dynamic markets. This is important because the share o f exports in GDP has been
       shrinking since the late 199Os, with the decline having only been halted after 2002, rather
       than reversed (Figure 6). It i s the domestic economy that i s currently fueling growth,
       and, given its size, broadening the export base is essential for maintaining and
       accelerating growth.

0 Taking steps to complete energy sector reforms, ensuring increased efficiency o f
  domestic utility companies and securing access to cheaper sources o f energy supply. The
  former entails reducing commercial and system losses in the utility companies through
  unbundling, improved management and need maintenance investment. The latter
  requires setting up and licensing an independent operator for the transmission systemthat
  would allow independent operators to come on line. These independent power producers
  would be drawing on the gas that will become available once the West Africa Gas
  Pipeline (WAGP) i s completed, as well as gain access to the broader regional power
  market though the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP). These actions would allow Ghana
  to reduce the country's dependency on more expensive oil-based thermal power
  generation, and eventually become an energy exporter. It is important to note that these
  two actions are interdependent, and that ensuringthe operational efficiency, and financial
  viability o f the power utility companies, are a necessary condition for the country to
  complete the investment needed to secure access to the cheaper energy supply provided
  through the West Africa Gas Pipeline.


0 Improvingthe businessenvironment,beginningwith actions aimed at:
      o Improving the proceduresfor exportingand importing;
      o Expanding private sector access to finance by establishing a credit bureau
          system,preferably privately run, improving contract enforcement and the legal
          rights of creditors;and facilitating the posting o fcollateral by reducingthe time
          neededto register property and new businesses.


0 Enhancingthe provision of infrastructure services and improving its management
  by:
      o Shiftingmore resources into operationsand maintenance;
      o Definingclear pricesetting mechanismsand marketaccess regulations;
      o Attracting private sector participationin infrastructureactivities while taking
          account of the need to increase the access o f the poor to services, especially in
          water, electricity and transport.

                                               - 12-


    0   Strengthening the management of natural resources since it is estimated that the
        degradation o f agricultural soils, forests, coastal fisheries, wildlife resources and Lake
        Volta's environment accounts for losses o f at least US$ 520 million annually (around 4.9
        percent o f Ghana's annual GDP). Actions to be considered include:
            o Providing market incentives for natural resources management, such as
               taxation, concession/licensing schemes, and payment for environmental
                services;
            o Increasing the capacity of key regulatory agencies responsible for enforcing
                environmental legislation;
            o Reinforcing local community organizationsand their involvementin natural
                resourcemanagement;and
            o Transferring knowledge         and appropriate technologies for sustainable
                agriculture,such as conservation agriculture methods.


    0   Improvingefficiencyinthe allocationof resourcesfor publicinvestmentsby:
            o Screeningpublicexpenditureproposals,allowing funds to flow to projects with
                the highest rate o freturn;
            o Evaluating public expenditures, ensuring that                the lessons from the
                implementation o f expenditure programs are drawn and internalized; and
            o Making greater use o f public-private partnership agreements for large
                infrastructure  projects,  while protecting public        finances by adequately
                provisioning for the guaranteesprovided.

19.     This last set of actions is particularly important because the funds currently
availablefrom HIPC, and proposedto be made available throughthe MDRI, flow directly
into the government budget. The availability o f these funds implies that Ghana no longer
needs to borrow to refinance external obligations. The challenge, however, is to strengthen
budget institutions to allocate this funding inways that sustain broad-based growth and improve
the delivery o fpublic services. Also, inthe wake o f HIPC andMDRI, there is an opportunity to
expand Ghana's infrastructure and improve its quality, both through public investment and by
attracting private funding. Seizing this opportunity will require that the enhanced provision o f
infrastructure services i s done in ways that are sustainable over the long term and results in
improved access for the poor.

20.     Assumingthat actions aimed at raisingproductivity are implemented,the projected
growth outlook is expected to be supported by rising investmentto GDP ratios, reaching
the 34 percentrange by end-2008,up from 29 percentin 2005. National savings is projected
to increase commensurably, meeting around 80 percent o f the investment needs (Table 3). While
the difference between savings and investment ratio suggests a relatively small contribution from
external savings, it i s important to note that estimates of public sector savings include official
transfers in the form o f grants, including HIPC and MDRIdebt relief. If one excludes official
transfers, however, the external current account gap would average just under 11percent o f GDP
for the 2006-08 period, meaning a projected overall external financing requirement during this
period averaging US$1.3 billion. After accounting for donor project and program assistance
(including an annual average o f US$117 million in HIPC and MDRI debt relief), another
US$685 million on average would be provided by project loans, leaving an average financing

gap o f be US$161 million for the 2006-08 period. From this amount, drawings from the IMF
would average US$26 million, with IDA'S support through the PRSCs providing an average
yearly installment of around US$130 million, and quick disbursing assistance from other
partners supporting the implementation of the GPRS I1covering the remainder of the gap. (Table

21.      Under current projections, Ghana's debt sustainability outlook is expected to
remainrobust, with the possibilityof improvingconsiderabl followingthe implementation
of the proposedMultilateralDebt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The main endogenous factors7
                                                                          B
contributing to this robust debt outlook are: the strong projected real GDP growth - contributing
on average to a 2 percentage points decline in the stock o f external debt to GDP ratio; and a
stable exchange rate - expected to contribute on average with another 1.5 percentage points. In
addition, net current transfers, namely remittances inflows and official transfers are expected to
contribute on average with a 12.2 percentage points o f GDP decline inthe external debt to GDP
ratio. Meanwhile, inflows o f net foreign investment (FDI) are expected to increase from the
historical average o f 1.0 percent o f GDP during 1995-2004, to 3.0 percent o f GDP during 2005-
2010, triggeredby the country's more stable macroeconomic environment.

22.      Ghana's robust external debt outlook means that the country is not expected to
breachthe thresholds indicatorsunder the most likely (baseline) scenario, and only exceed
the debt service to export thresholds in the event of external shocks, such as a slowdownin
export growthor a worseningofthe terms of external                                 Under all three scenarios,



 Following the proposed MDRI, Ghana's debt indicators are projected to improve markedly, with the nominal debt
stock falling to US$18.1billionby end-2006, down from US$58.6 billion at end-2005, meaning a decline inthe debt
to GDP ratio to 1.6percent, compared to 5.5 percent before the MDRI.
  Endogenous factors are derived from the budget constraint equation, which assesses sustainability in terms of the
growth inreal GDP, and interest rate on the stock o f debt.
* The relevant thresholds are 40 percent debt to GDP ratio; (ii) percent NPV debt to export ratio; and (iii)
                                                               145                                               16
gercent debt service to export ratio.
  The macroeconomic assumptions under the baseline scenario are as follows. On the real economy front, the real
GDP growth is assumedto grow at an average o f 5.5 percent per year over the projectionperiod, representing a one

the net present value (NPV) o f debt to GDP i s expected to remain within the indicative debt
thresholds. To illustrate this point, Figure 8 depicts the trend in external debt indicators under
three scenarios: the most likely scenario (baseline) and two stress scenarios (historical and
worsening financing terms). These two stress scenarios are triggered by either by real GDP
growth reversing downwards to the historical trend, or changes in the terms o f its external
borrowing, such as the one associated with a decline in the level o f concessionality o f the new
borrowing. The latter scenario i s particularly relevant because the baseline scenario for the DSA
assumes that the additional financing neededto cover the impact o f higher oil imports will come
from concessional sources.

23.      Under the baseline scenario, the external debt indicators remain well below
indicative thresholds. The net present value (NPV) o f external debt to GDP is expected to
actually decline by the end o fthe projection period, rising gradually from the pre-MDRIlevels o f
8.2 percent at end-2005, peaking at 16.6 percent around 2015, and dropping back to 11.2 percent
by end-2025.        In contrast, the NPV of debt to exports is expected to rise throughout the
projection period, increasing from 22.7 percent at end 2005 to 97.4 percent by end-2025, mainly
due to faster growth in the nominal value o f external debt than that o f exports. Similarly, the
debt-service-to-exports ratio i s expected to rise from below 5.0 percent at end-2005 to 8.6
percent by end-2025, underscoring the importance o f maintaining concessionality in Ghana's
new external borrowing for the realization o fthis scenario.

24.      The two other scenarios illustratethe alternative outlook for Ghana's externaldebt
sustainability; one where the NPV of the debt to GDP ratio remains within the indicative
thresholds while breaching the thresholds for the NPV of debt service to exports and for
debt service to exports.loThe historical scenario assumes that the mainmacro-indicators are to
perform at their ten year historical average throughout the projection period, meaning a real GDP
growth rate o f 4.5 percent due to lower export growth and lower net transfers fi-om abroad.
Under this scenario, the NPV o f debt to GDP ratio rises from the 8.2 percent at end-2005,
peaking at 26.2 percent by 2015, before declining to around 20 percent by the end o f the
projection period. The NPV o f debt to export ratio, however, exceeds the 145 percent threshold

percent increase over its ten year historical average. The projected increase in real GDP reflects the anticipated
decrease in the stock o f external and domestic debt throughout the projection period, along with the projected
increase in infrastructure investment where part o f the financing (related to the MDGs) will be received as grants.
Headline inflation will fall throughout the projection period averaging 6.3 percent, reflecting the decrease in the
stock o f debt and in the average nominal interest rate on domestic debt (from an average o f 28.7 percent during
 1994-2004, to an average of 6.8 percent during 2005-2025). The current account deficit i s assumed to be financed
mainly through multilateral and bilateral inflows. On the multilateral front, the majority o f the financing i s assumed
to be concessional offered by IDA. Financing from bilateral donors i s assumed to be on less concessional terms
with average nominal interest rates o f 4 percent. The current account deficit is also assumed to be financed through
the inflow o f grants from official donors-grants are assumed to average 5.2 percent o f GDP throughout the
projection period. On the external sector front, current account deficit i s assumed to average 3.1 percent o f GDP,
export, 28.9 percent o f GDP and imports, 35.0 percent o f GDP respectively.
loThe stress scenarios examine the impact o n the NPV o f external debt to both GDP and exports, checking for
solvency shocks, and o n the debt-service to-exports, as a measure o f liquidity risk. The debt sustainability
framework applies two types o f stress tests, which are designed as a permanent modification o f the framework's
main macroeconomic indicators. These stress tests are reflected in two scenarios: the historical scenario, which
assumes that the main macro-indicators are to perform at their ten year historical average throughout the projection
period, and the "worsening financing terms scenario", in which new financing is provided under less favorable
conditions throughout the projection period.

somewhere between 2016 and 2017, and continues rising, reaching 235 percent by the end of the
projection period, while the debt service to exports ratio breeches the 15 percent threshold after
end-2021,closing at 18,7 percent by 2025.l1

25.       Under the most extreme stress scenario, distress is triggered by changes in the terms
of the country's external financing, with a decline in the level of concessionality of the new
borrowing required to cover the projected external deficit. Specifically, the maturity on new
loans would average 20 years, including 5 years o f grace, with interest rates averaging 5 percent.
These new terms would be less favorable than the historical average of 40 years maturity and 2
percent interest rates. Under this worsening financing terms scenario, while the NPV o f debt to
GDP ratio remains below the 40 percent indicative threshold throughout the projection period,
the NPV o f debt to export would reach the 145 percent of GDP threshold sometime between
2016 and 2017, closing the projection period (2025) at 235 percent, while the debt service ratio
breaches the 15 percent threshold by 2021, reaching 21 percent in2025.

26.    These results suggest that Ghana's macroeconomic policy framework is adequate
for the purpose of the proposed operation        -a   finding that is corroborated by the IMF's
assessment supportingthe country's eligibility to the MDRI. The IMF documents presented
to the Board last December noted that the key macroeconomic objectives under the Fund-
supported program have generally been met. Since the completion point, real GDP growth has
been strong, at just under 6 percent on an annual basis; inflation has declined appreciably; and
gross international reserves have been maintained at a relatively high level, providing a cushion
against external shocks.       The document further           indicated that the strengthening of
macroeconomic and structural policies continues to underpin recent economic performance,
noting inparticular the contribution from prudent fiscal management, including enhanced public
expenditure and financial management.

27.     Data from the Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ) indicates an
substantial decline in asset-based poverty between 1997 and 2003, with the Eoverty
headcount falling by around 7 percentage points during this period (Table 5).                                      This
reduction in asset-based poverty headcount was due primarily to accelerating growth, with a
reduction in inequality playing a secondary, albeit important, role. Most of the reduction in
poverty was associated with the movement of people from rural to urban areas, with rural areas
seeing a decline inpoverty rates, while urban poverty rates increased slightly. Poverty remains,
nevertheless, predominantly concentrated in the three deprived regions (Northern, Upper West,
and Upper East).

28.      The decline in poverty experienced in Ghana is associatedwith an improvementin
child nutritional indicators, albeit of a smaller magnitude (Table 6).                              The nutritional
indicators based on the Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 1993, 1998 and 2003
show a reduction inthe proportion o f underweight children, declining from 27.4 percent in 1993
to 22.1 percent ten years later. Wasting indicators follow a similar path. The only exception is
the proportion o f stunted children, with an increase after 1998. The indicators for the share of
underweighted children - which combine the other two indicators - show that nine out o f ten
regions have experienced a downward trend. In2003, however, the three northern regions, along
with the Volta region, still had higher than average malnutrition rates. While the data does not
indicate a gender gap, it does indicate an urban-rural divide, with underweighted children more
prevalent in rural areas, despite recent improvements in nutritional indicators among rural



l2This section summarizes findings from the following papers: Diallo, Amadou and Quentin Wodon (2006),
Determinants of and trends in asset poverty in Ghana using the CWZQ and the DHS datasets (forthcoming), and
Cavalcanti, Carlos (2005), A note on recent trends in growth and poverty reduction in Ghana. Presented at the

l3Since the CWIQ does not include a full-fledged expenditure module, expenditure levels were calculated by proxy,
using assets reported in the CWIQ. This assets-based income proxy i s described in World Bank 2000, Sahn et al.
2000, and, more concisely, in the seminal paper by Filmer and Pritchett 1998. Also, since a direct poverty line
cannot be calculated inthis case, the alternatively was to pool the two distributions and then set arbitrarily a line at a
certain percentage of the value of the ranked asset index computed. The poverty line was set at the 42" percentile,
This choice o f the 42" percentile was to match previous studies on trends inconsumption poverty using GLSS data
(Coulombe and McKay, 2001). This choice is also consistent with the World Bank's poverty line o f one PPP dollar
per day or 4 0 percentile (van der Berg et al., 2004).

children. Also, while recent government nutrition and health programs have enjoyed increasing
participation (Table 7), the participation rate in the nutrition component has been lower in the
four regions with worst malnutrition indicators, with a combined participation rate that i s half the
national average. The issue o f child malnutrition thus remains of great importance, despite
recent progress.       While poverty i s an important underlying determinant o f malnutrition,
malnutrition i s also an important underlying determinant to poverty and growth. Children who
are chronically malnourished or stunted intheir first two years o f life rarely meet their potential
for growth andbecome permanently stunted as adults. There are a number of consequences from
these effects o f malnutrition, including reduced levels o fproductivity and earned income.

29.     Povertyin Ghana remainspredominantlyrural. Rural areas account for three-quarters
o f the poor, despite representingjust short o f 60 percent o fthe population. Within the rural areas,
poverty i s deeper and more widespread among households headed by subsistence (food crop)
farmers and self-employed workers. These two same groups account also for those either living in
poverty, or at greater risk o f falling into poverty, inurbanareas. Urbanization has not meant that
the poor are necessarily moving out o f agriculture (Table 8). Between 1997 and 2003 the share
o f the urban poor engaged inagriculture rose slightly, partially offsetting the decline inthe share
of poor households engaged in agriculture inrural areas. As a result, while the overall share o f
households engaged in agriculture as their main economic activity declined between 1997 and
2003 by around 6.5 percent, the decline among poor households was o f under 3 percent. Moving
out o f poverty appears therefore to be more closely associated with moving out o f agriculture, as
agriculture remains the activity that households fall back to when no other employment option
exists.

30.      Other factors that were important determinants of poverty included the
demographic structure of the household, the level of educational attainment of its head,
and access to land. Households with young babies and infants were more likely to be poor
because o f the increased dependency ratio. The age o f the head o f the households also appears
important, with younger (< 20 years) and older (> 60 years) household heads being poorer.
Similarly, the educational attainment o f the head o f the household was an important determinant
o f poverty, with educated household heads better o f f than those with no or only preschool
education.    The positive effect o f education appears to be more important in rural areas,
especially for those with secondary education or more. The final factor that appear to contribute
to poverty reduction was land ownership, with the incidence o f poverty lower in families that
possessedland. The importance o f land ownership underscores the implications o f insecurity o f
land tenure, especially for households living on the fringes o f larger urban areas (peri-urban
areas) (Box 1).

31.      These trends in poverty reduction were matched by decreasing inequality during
the 1997-2003 period, with the Gini coefficient falling by around 2 points. Inequality

                                                        -21-


declined more quickly amongst the rural poor than the urban poor, and dropped amongst rural
households in the middle and upper income levels, while remaining unchanged among middle
and upper income urban households. These differences in poverty and inequality dynamics
amongst rural and urban households are explained by the different impacts o f changes in
employment status and in educational attainment. In rural areas, shifting employment across
sectors (usually out o f agriculture) appears to have led to reduced inequality, while similar shifts
in urban areas yielded much lower reductions in inequality. Instead, what appears to have
matteredmost inurban areas was whether householdheads became more educated.

                  Box 1. Two Tales of Land Ownership in Ghana's Peri-Urban Areas'
Kumasi, the second largest city in Ghana and capital of the Ashanti region, has grown rapidly in the past
two decades. The result o fthis urbansprawl is that landis now the most contested asset inthe peri-urban area. As
residential and urban development encroaches on agricultural land, there are opportunities and pitfalls for those
living inthese peri-urban areas. There are growing opportunities young farmers that supply urbanareas and there
is increasingly limited access to the natural resources on which the livelihoods o f the poorest depend. Since the
disposal and sale o f land is controlled through the traditional authorities, there are clear winners and losers inthe
process, highlighting the unequal impact o f urban expansion on different social groups. Whilst the range o f off-
farm income-earning opportunities has increased for young men, it appears that older women who are dependent
on food-crop farming havebeendisadvantaged by loss of land or by insecurity o f access to it.

32.       Given Ghana's pro-poor growth record, the projections suggest that real GDP growth
rates in the 5 percent range would suffice to bring poverty rates to levels consistent with
meeting the MDGgoal of halvingthe 1990 rate of poverty incidence by 2010.'4 It is important
to note that this assumes that the pace o f urbanization would continue, yielding a similar
reduction inpoverty and inequality as the one observed duringthe 1997-2003 period. As shown
in Figure 9, which depicts three projections for poverty red~ction,'~Ghana would achieve the
MDG target of halving poverty before 2015 under two of the three per capita GDP growth
scenarios (real GDP growth o f 6.0 and 5.0 percent, respectively).16 Under the third scenario
(average real GDP growth o f 3 percent), the MDG poverty target i s not a~hieved,'~indicating
that there i s a premium on preserving, and accelerating, current GDP growth rates.

l4 This projection assumes that the distribution o f income remains unchanged, and that household consumption
grows at the same rate as GDP. I t i s important to note that the assumption that household consumption i s
constrained by GDP growth may be somewhat too restrictive in the Ghanaian case. In reviewing the sources o f
income growth that fuelled the reductions in poverty during the 1990s it was clear that income from remittance
played a vitally important for poverty reduction. To the extent that this continues to apply in the future, household
income and assets may grow faster than GDP, allowing poverty to fall even more than indicated. This caveat must
be borne inmindwhen considering theseprojections.
l5The scenarios are as follows: (i)pessimistic scenario that projects long runreal GDP growth at just 3.0 percent
                                    a
per annum, meaningper capita growtho f around 1percent per annum; (ii) trend growth scenario that assumes
                                                                           recent
a annual real GDP growth rate o f 5 percent, or just over 2.0 percent in per capita t e r n ; and (iii)an accelerated
growth scenario that assumes long term average annual real GDP growth rates o f 6.0 percent, or around 3.5 to 4.0
  ercent inper capita terms.
p6Based on the UNmedium-variant projections for Ghana, we assume that population will grow at 2.1 percent per
annum over the 2003-2015 period. Also, we assume an elasticity o fpoverty incidence with respect to changes inper
capita GDP o f 1, which is similar to estimates reported by other work on Ghana. See, for instance, Christiaensen,
Demery and Patemostro (2002). Growth, Distribution and Poverty in Afiica: Messages fiom the 1990s. Poverty
Dynamics inAfrica, The World Bank, Washington D.C.
l7 Strictly speaking, the MDG poverty goal would be half the headcount for 1990, but this is not available.
Assuming that poverty fell slightly between 1990 and 1992, the MDG goal used here would be just a very few
percentage points on the low side-that  is, a marginally more ambitious goal.

33.       Reducing the significant regional differences in access to education and health services
i s critical for the realization of the poverty reduction scenario to achieve the MDG target
because of the role of access education and health services in ensuring pro-poor growth.
There continues to be significant differences in access to education and health services within
Ghana, with access to health services in the northern regions at just over one-third o f the
percentage reported in the Greater Accra region. These differences in access rates reflect both
difficulties in the physical access to these services,'* as well as the ability to pay for them. For
instance, the use of pre-natal care that was free at the time o f the survey (February-April 2003)
was uniformly high across the country. Incontrast, supervised maternal deliveries that were not
yet exempt from fees at the time o f the survey were uniformly lower throughout the country,
reachingparticularly low levels inthe northernregions (Figure 10).

         3.      THE GHANA GROWTHAND POVERTYREDUCTION
                                  STRATEGY (GPRS 11)


34.     Ghana launched the preparation of its second Ghana Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11) in September 2004, through a consultative process, leading
to the submission to Parliament in October 2005 and a Consultative Group (CG) meeting
in November. The CG meeting articulated the targets under the strategy and outlined the
expected support from Development Partners. The C G documentation included a prioritized
Result Matrix, an Aid Harmonization and Effectiveness Action Plan, and a Support Overview
indicating actual andprojected disbursements by Development Partner according to the pillars o f
the GPRS I1and sectors. A follow up C G i s scheduled to take place inAccra on June 5,2006.

35.     The full GPRS I1was submittedto the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary
FundinFebruary2006, andis expectedto be consideredby the Boardsofthese institutions
in late May-early June. The GPRS I1is guided by the stated objective o f achieving middle
income status by 2015, entailing a real GDP growth o f at least 6 percent per annum. Higher
growth rates are expected to reflect a positive social change and improvements in the quality o f
life for everyone. The growth rate targets are made therefore taking cognizance o f the targets set
out inthe NEPAD agreement and the MDGs.

36.     The GPRS I1 updates the strategy laid out in the first GPRS in 2003 with a
strengthenedfocus on growthacross threestrategicpillars:


     0   Acceleratingprivate sector led growth andpoverty reduction by assisting the private
         sector to grow and generateemployment. Achieving these objectives will be aided by
         actions aimed at consolidating the macroeconomic stability achieved during the
         implementation o f GPRS Iand at enhancing private sector competitiveness.             Special
         attention will be given to the pursuit o f prudent fiscal, monetary and exchange rate
         policies, which are recognized in the GPRS I1both for the immediate macroeconomic
         benefits, and for the longer term goals o f facilitating private access to capital,
         encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship.           Stable exchange rates, single-digit
         inflation, and lower interest rates are important for fostering a supportive investment
         climate, while sustained growth i s the thrust o f the strategy for further poverty reduction.

     0   Investing in vigorous human resource development to ensure the development of a
         knowledgeable, well-trained and disciplined labor force. Areas o f focus include: (i)
         education and skill development, (ii) to health care, malaria control, HIVIAIDS
                                                 access
         prevention and treatment, (iii) to safe water and adequate sanitation, (iv) housing
                                        access
         and slum upgrading, and (v) populationmanagement.

     0   Encouraginggood governance and civic responsibility by empoweringstate and non-
         state entities to participate in the development process and collaborate in
         promotingpeace and political stability. The overarching objectives are guaranteeing
         fundamental human rights, peace and security to all Ghanaians, and strengthening the
         decentralization and public sector reform with a view to sustaining the rule o f law.

                                               - 25 -

        Some o f the pillars for achieving these objectives are (i)  buildingan efficient and well-
        motivated public sector; (ii)improving the existing institutional and legislative
        framework; (iii) integrating traditional authorities into formal institutional structures; (iv)
        fostering civic responsibility.

37.     The GPRS I1 is explicit in stating that the envisaged funding is insufficient to
finance the entire development plan, underscoring the importance of the annual
ConsultativeGroup meetings, such as the one lastNovemberthat pledgedUS$1.2 billionin
annual support, to finance this development plan. Also, this funding already pledged by
development partners i s expected to be complemented by additional external inflows from the
capital market and debt cancellation. This i s important because, while the financing envelope
presented in the document i s consistent with maintaining macroeconomic stability, as new
resources are identified it might be desirable to revisit the macroeconomic framework, ensuring
that public and external debt do not become unsustainable inthe future.

38.     The main contributionof the GPRS I1is in articulatingthe country's renewedfocus
on growth and the priority attached to structuraltransformation, especially in agriculture
given its potentialrole in ensuringpro-poor growth. More work is still needed, however, in
translating this broad policy framework ina strategic, time bound, monitorable set o f actions and
results, Also, while the GPRS I1 seeks to ensure consistency between sector strategies, the
treatment o f different sectors and activities in the document it self i s uneven, and could better
reflect their weights in the economy, as well as the complexity o f the issues involved. More
attention could be given in the document to infrastructure and mining, as well as to important
issues in macroeconomic management and private sector access to finance, which i s understood
as one o f the main constraints to private sector-led growth.        However, as the GPRS I1 i s
considered a `living document', the agenda moving forward appears to be focused on creating an
enabling environment for private sector-led growth, clarifying the role o f Government in the
economy, and the reductiono fregional and socioeconomic disparities.



                    4.      WORLD BANK SUPPORTTO THE GPRSI1

      A.        OVERVIEW

39.     The PRSC is centralto the Bank's 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), as well
as to the proposed CAS Progress Report (CAS-PR). These documents envision a series o f
single-tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), providing continued support to
policies and reforms articulatedinthe Government's GPRS Iand 11, and complemented by major
programs in education, health, private sector development,             agriculture,   energy, roads,
telecommunications, water and other infrastructure operations. The PRSCs also represent the
Bank's contribution to the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS), accounting for around 50
percent of overall disbursements. Given the PRSCs' cross-cutting focus, it leverages the poverty
emphasis of several sector focused operations, ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation (level
and structure) and addressing some o f their financing implications o f proposed policy actions
(e.g., capitation grants and the removal o f school fees, the deployment o f teachers and health
care professional to under-servedareas, and the implementation o f an inclusive health insurance

                                               - 26 -

scheme).    Furthermore, the PRSCs encourage institutional development by centering their
support on issues related to budget design and execution, as well as on monitoring poverty
outcomes, ensuring that sector programs deliver results in terms o f human development
indicators.  By helping to internalize these monitoring functions, the expectation is that the
allocation o fresources will beginto reflect the feedback from these results.

      B.       LINKS  BETWEENTHE GPRS, THE CAS, AND THE PRSCS

40.     The Bank Group's assistancestrategy articulates the GPRS priorities aroundthree
key development results: higher growth and employment generation, improved service
provision for human development, and stronger governance and public sector
management. The Bank assistance under growth and employment aims at assisting Ghana in:
(i)managingpublicfinances formacroeconomic stabilityandpovertyreduction; (ii)          removing
constraints to private sector investment; and (iii)harnessing the sources o f growth.        The
assistance on managingpublic finances for macroeconomic stability andpoverty reduction draws
heavily on the series o f PRSCs, which provide overall support to the budget, as well as funding
for poverty reduction programs identified in the GPRS. The CAS also envisions a series o f
annual External Reviews o f Public Financial Management (ERPFM), carried out jointly with
other development partners, which aim at providing yearly assessments o f the implementation o f
the Government's Short and Medium Term Action Plan (S&MTAP)                  for Public Financial
Management.      The agenda for removing barriers to private sector investment ranges from
support to trade facilitation and infrastructure operations to small and medium enterprise and
financial sector development, as well as natural resource management.             Specific Bank
interventions include the proposed Energy Development and Access project (US$60 million;
FY07-1l),  the recently approvedMicro, Small andMediumEnterprise (MSME) project (US$ 45
million; FY06-10) focusing on catalytic interventions in some sectors through demonstration
effect, project incubation, training and handholding along with targeted enabling environment
interventions that should help trigger further private sector development. Also, the financial
sector agenda being supported through the ongoing Rural Financial Services (RFS) project
(US$5.1 million; FY00-06) and the financial sector development component o f the Economic
Management Capacity Building(EMCB) project (US$25 million; FY06-1l),           focusing on capital
marketsdevelopment, as well as bank and non-bank regulation and supervision, is embraced by
the PRSCs.       Finally, interventions aimed at ensuring environmentally and sustainable
development, such as the Agriculture Services Sub-sector Investment project (AGSSIP - US$67
million; FY00-06) and the Land Administration project (LAP - US$20.5 million; FY03-08), are
supported by the PRSC by sharpening their programmatic focus and by elevating critical policy
issues to the Cabinet level. Therefore, the PRSC supports reforms in institutions providing the
interface between the public and the private sectors in areas ranging from trade facilitation,
business registration, finance (including microfinance) and agricultural development to natural
resource management.

41.     The GPRS I1agenda for poverty reductionvalidates the ongoingefforts to meet the
MillenniumDevelopmentGoal(MDG) of halvingthe 1990 poverty headcountof 51 percent
by 2015. The Bank's support to the Government's poverty reduction agenda will be provided
though the ongoing PRSC series, as well as investment lending at the local government level.
The Community Based Rural Development (US$60 million; FY05-10) transfers technical and

                                              - 27 -

financial resources to rural populations to help reduce rural poverty, while the second phase o f
the Community Water and Sanitation APL (US$26 million; FYO1-09), the Second Urban
Environmental Sanitation (UESP 11) project (US$68 million, FY04-lo), and the Urban Water
(US$103 million grant, FY06-11) are designed to increase coverage o f improved water and
sanitation services. The LIL in support o f Promoting Partnerships with Traditional Authorities
(US$5 million grant; FY03-08) tests ways to develop partnerships with government, integrating
traditional authorities'   involvement in the social and economic development o f their
communities. Analytical work, such as the proposed FY07 CEM, will analyze policies needed to
accelerate growth, building on recently completed work on the regulations o f the electricity and
petroleum sectors, the joint WB-DFID-AFD study on natural resource management, the Bank
study on youth and employment, and ongoing work on an urban development study and on the
country environmental assessment.

42.     The GPRS I1 goals for education aim at increasing basic literacy and numeracy
skills, with a focus on basic education access in deprived districts. To help achieve these
outcomes, the series o f PRSCs provides programmatic support for educationpolicy reform. The
Bank is also financing the Education Sector Project (US$78 million; FY04-09), addressing and
promoting equitable access to, and efficient delivery of, quality education services at basic and
higher levels. An ESW on the reform of human resource management inthe education and the
health sectors i s currently plannedto give sequence to the work already begununder PRSC-3.

43.     The health outcomes that the GPRS I1 aims at achieving includes improved
nutritional status of children under-five, reduced under-five mortality associated with
malaria and other preventable diseases, and improved access to essential quality obstetric
care, with priority attachedto improvingservice delivery in deprivedregions. Insupport to
the government's efforts to achieve these key health outcomes, the Bank has inplace the second
Health Sector SWAP (US$89.6 million; FY03-08), with its objectives o f improving the health
status o f the population while reducing geographical, socio-economic and gender inequalities in
health outcomes. Since the finding from the Health Sector SWAP was exhausted ahead of time,
the Bank's support to the health sector is shifting from the SWAP to the PRSC budget support.
While this transition from the SWAP to the PRSC means that hnding to the health sector will
now be provided through general budget support, rather than sector budget support, the focus on
supporting critical actions that promote improved health outcomes will be maintained.
Furthermore, the support through the PRSC will continue the strong sector engagement by the
Bank team, with active policy dialogue and a likely technical assistance project aimed at
supporting the operations o f the National Health Insurance Scheme. To signal this transition, a
US$15 million is being added to the proposed PRSC-4, aiming at increasing government support
to the health sector and sharpening the focus of government intervention on health outcomes,
particularly on malaria control. Other ongoing interventions in the health sector include the
recently approved Multi-Sector HIV/AIDS Project (MSHAP) (US$20 million, FY06-1l),             and
actions under the PRSCs that focus on level and structure o fpublic expenditure on health.

44.     The third pillar of the GPRS I1 seeks to ensure good governance and civic
responsibilitythrough the strengtheningof the country's legal, regulatoryand institutional
frameworks. The Bank's strategy supports the government's goals o f building a transparent,
accountable, and inclusive state and improving public sector management for better service

delivery. The Bank's main lending instrument to help achieve these outcomes i s the series o f
annual PRSCs, focusing on cross-cutting issues ranging from public sector reform,
decentralization, public expenditure management, and governance. In addition, the Economic
Management Capacity Building project (US$25 million; FY06-11) aims at improving the
efficiency o fpublic sector management and enhancing the quality o f service delivery.


       C.         ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

45.      This programdocument draws on ongoingwork on social and economicanalysis, as
well as on ongoing and existingwork on public financial management. The poverty update
draws on the results o f the 2003 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ), identifying
recent trends in poverty and human de~elopment.'~The findings o f this ongoing poverty
analysis appear to validate the policy directions proposed in the GPRS, and supported by the
PRSCs, namely the importance of: (i)prudent management o f public finances to ensure
macroeconomic stability for growth and to preserve the funding for the social sectors; (ii)
investing in human capital to mitigate the situation o f chronic and persistent poverty among a
large number of households, especially in view o f the acceleration of the urbanization process;
(iii)targeting women and children in the delivery o f education and health services (including
nutrition program); and (iv) sustaining increases in agricultural productivity for maintaining the
longterm trends ingrowth, urbanization andpoverty reduction.

46.      The analytical work on economic developments includes recent Economic and
Sector Work (ESW) on natural resource management, on the electricity and petroleum
sectors, and on youth employment, as well as ongoingwork on the investment climate (Box
2), and on urban development. The work on natural resource management has received
considerable attention in the Bank's Economic and Sector Work, and includes the FY 05
Country study on Natural Resources Management and Growth Sustainability, jointly preparedby
Ghana's Institute o f Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER), the U K ' s Department
for InternationalDevelopment (DFID) and the Bank (see Box 2), as well as the ongoing Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA). The CEA i s intended to be completed by end-June 2006, and
aims at designing practical management and policy solutions to address natural resources
depletion and environment degradation in four sectors driving growth and poverty reduction in
Ghana: agriculture, mining, forestry & wildlife and urban development.

47.      The work on youth employmentexamines recent trends on how the youth in Ghana
have fared in terms of key labor market outcomes and the factors constraining the
expansion of formal sector employment. The findings in the study show that over the period
1997-2003,the youth benefited largely from the labor market transition from self employment to
informal wage employment. The youth also benefited more than the adults, from the net
increase in formal employment. The rapid urbanization led to a shift in labor resources from

self-employed rural agriculture to wage employment in the urban areas. The expansion inwage
employment however fell short o f the growth in the labor force. Urban youth unemployment
rate i s about three times the average for the country, with the secondary school graduates being
the hardest hit. Labor demand at the firm level is constrained by some rigidity inthe business
environment, including highfixed labor cost and a relatively slow pace o f growth inemployment
inthe exports sector. Promoting qualityjobs for the youth on a sustainable basis would require
boosting labor demand through policies that support: (i)                   the improvement in the business
environment including flexible labor regulations (ii)the pursuit o f labor-intensive growth
strategies, (iii)demand-driven skills training programs, especially among secondary school
graduates and (iv) mainstreaming o f youth development strategies.

48.      This program document also draws on preparatorywork for the upcoming(FY07)
 Country Economic Memorandum,buildingon the summary of the discussionsat the high
level workshop held in Accra on January 19 and 20, 2006, which focused on steps to be
 consideredin reachingthe Government's stated goal of attaining middle-incomestatus by

                                             - 3 0 -


2015. The discussions at the workshop noted that, to achieve its growth objective, the thrust o f
Government's actions should be on sustaining broad-based growth through a strategy for
expanding and diversifyingexports. This export strategy will need to be complemented, inturn,
by actions aimed at increasing the efficiency inthe use of public resources. The discussions at
the high level workshop are being followed up through a series o f sector specific workshops in
key areas that are considered essential to future growth (e.g., energy, telecommunications/ICT,
business environment, agriculture, natural resource management). These workshops would aim
at buildingconsensus around needed investments and reforms, gaining greater prominence inthe
ongoing dialogue between government, civil society and development partners, as well as
underpinning the development program supported by future PRSCs.

49.    Ongoing and existing analytical work on fiduciary arrangements set out action
plans for improvements in public financial management and public procurement,
providing important insights for the preparation of the proposed PRSC. These works
include the FY06 External Review o f Public Financial Management Update (ERPFM), and the
recently completed draft FY07 ERPFM.            The FY06 ERPFM assesses favorably recent
developments in Ghana, underscoring greater aggregate fiscal discipline and the increased
predictability o f the budget, while noting the challenges involved in implementing the new
regulatory framework for public financial management - the new Financial Administration act,
the new Public Procurement act and the new Internal Audit act - and inintegrating public sector
staffing and salary decisions into the budget process. The ongoing ERPFM work i s reviewing
recent developments, including the country's fiscal performance at end-2005 and the 2006
budget, to initiate a dialogue around a proposed common fiscal performance framework - the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework - that would be
comprehensive in nature while still allowing focus on the issues that are most important for the
Ghanaian government. This new ERPFM would build on the findings o f earlier ERPFMs, as
well as the work of the FY04 CFAA and the FY03 CPAR that have guided the agenda pursued
by the PRSCs. These earlier studies reviewed national procedures for budgeting, payroll and
expenditure control, accounting, auditing, and compliance with existingprocurement procedures.

 50.    The proposed Fy06 CAS progress report also outlines the analytical work that
would support the second round of PRSCs (PRSC4 to 6) to be implementedin support of
the government's povertyreduction strategy. Inpreparation o fthis next round o f PRSCs, the
non-lending activity infiduciary management will continue to play a major role, andwill involve
 (but will not be limited to) capacity building and dialogue, to help public officials to become
more action-oriented, and empower civil society to monitor implementation. A new series of

                                                   - 3 1 -


ERPFMs (FY06-08) will build on the agenda outlined inthe first series o f ERPFMs (FY04-05),
expanding the scope o f the work to incorporate elements o f the newly devised Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability framework. More recent poverty developments will
also be examined inthe upcoming Country Economic Memorandum, drawing on the information
o f the next household budget survey (GLSS 5). While a decision on the exact focus o f the next
C E M will be made in the upcoming FY07 CAS, so as to ensure maximum relevance for the
policy dialogue, early indications suggest attention will be given to the preconditions for growth
acceleration and its implications for poverty reduction and public expenditure management.

D.       THEDEVELOPMENTPARTNERSHIP

51.      The PRSC is part of a concerted effort with development partners groupedaround
the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS).20 The MDBS aims at reducing the
Government's transaction costs in dealing with development assistance by ensuring greater
complementarity between this assistance and the Government's own poverty reduction strategy.
Over the last three years, development partnershave followed through with this commitment by
carrying out joint MDBSPRSC missions, advancing agreements on policy actions and the
timing o f assessment reviews. Over the last two years, the development partners also agreed
with the Government o f Ghana on ajoint matrix o fpolicy actions to be supported by the PRSC-
4/MDBS-2006 and the PRSC-3/MDBS-2005, respectively, aligning almost all aspects o f their
monitoring and evaluation frameworks, except those regardingthe use o f outcome indicators as a
basis for disbursement. Moreover, building on the gains made over the last two years,
representatives o f the Government o f Ghana and its development paftners (seven bilateral donors
and three multilateral agencies, including the World Bank) agreed on February 25, 2005 to work




2o In addition to the World Bank, the following development partners participate in the MDBS: the African
Development Bank; Canada; France; Denmark; the European Union; Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and
the United Kingdom. Japan, Italy and the United States participate as observers. A copy o f the 2006 Technical
Annex to the MDBS Framework Memorandumi s attached as Annex 2.

                                                 - 32 -

together according to the principles established in the paper "Harmonization and Alignment in
Ghana for Aid Effectiveness: a common approach for Ghana and its Development Partners".

52.      Within the context of the MDBS, there is still room for further improvement,with
scope for greater alignmentof disbursementschedules with the government's budgetcycle.
To achieve this objective, in 2007 the MDBS disbursements by the bilateral and the EUwill be
underpinned once again by the actions taken during2005 and based on an assessment carried out
inApril 2006. The decision to make two disbursements on the basis of one assessment aims at
allowing a transition to a new MDBS schedule that will ensure greater predictability o f budget
support. Under this new proposed schedule, the DPs will disburse their budget support based on
triggers defined two years inadvance and assessedon the year prior to disbursing, assuming that
the assessment i s positive.       This new schedule aims at allowing the DPs to inform the
Government o f Ghana about the amount provided through their budgetary support before the
budget proposal i s submitted to Parliament.             Since the Bank cannot make two PRSC
disbursements on the basis o f one assessment, it i s executing a different transition to this new
schedule - one that entails a separate assessment in 2007, so that the Bank rejoins the MDBS
schedule in 2008.        The proposed transition requires that for 2007 the Bank agree with the
Government o f Ghana on a separate set o f triggers that entail an intermediate step toward the
triggers that will be jointly agreed between the Government o f Ghana and all the MDBS
Development Partners.

53.      In looking forward to the Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) that will
underpin the PRSC/MDBS assessment in 2007 and beyond there has been broad
agreement to sharpen its result orientation. This agreement is consistent with the results
framework agreed between the Government o f Ghana and the Development Partners at the
November 2005 Consultative Group (CG) meeting, which provided the opportunity to discuss
the set o f actions that Partners and Government would take to move towards greater
harmonization and aid effectiveness.         To coincide with GPRS 11, and to follow up on C G
discussions, Development Partnersplan to work out a Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) inthe next
twelve months, to be completed by early 2007. The Bank Group's next CAS, for FY07-10, will
emerge from the JAS, andwill be presented to the Board inearly 2007. .

 54.      The present PRSC is beingprepared in parallel and in close coordination with the
IMF's PRGF,2'followingthe agreedinstitutionaldivisionof laborwith the IMFtakingthe
 lead on macro-economicsector issues while the Bank and the other MDBS partners take
the lead on structuraland social issues. Ina number o f areas where the mandates o f the two
 institutions overlap, the work i s being coordinated to ensure that consistent advice is provided to
 the authorities. The IMFleads the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies, including overall
 fiscal and monetary policies, while the Bank leads the dialogue on economic and structural
 reforms in a number o f sectors, with operations in urban and local government development;
 agriculture and rural development; human development; private sector development and public
 sector reform, and ininfrastructure (including energy, roads, water and sanitation).




 *`Ghana's current three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on May 9,2003.

      E.        ACHIEVEMENTSAND LESSONSLEARNED

55.      There were several achievements during the implementationof the first series of
PRSCs, which are describedbelow according to the component of the program. The first
component o f the first PRSC series reflected the objectives o f the first and second pillars o f the
GPRS I,focusing on ensuring progress on macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth. Most
o f the results under this component reflected the prudent macroeconomic management duringthe
implementation o f GPRS I, increased availability o f credit to the private sector, with the
                              yielding
share o f private sector in total domestic credit rising to 55 percent by end-2005, up from around
44 percent at end-2002. This increase in credit to the private sector i s attributable to a large
degree to declining public sector deficits, which allowed further reductions inthe public debt to
GDP ratio. There was also a decline inthe time required for businessregistration, falling to 81
days in2005, down from 129 days reportedin2002. While this is a reduction o f almost 50 days
(48 days to be precise), the average time to register new business in Ghana is still among the
highest inthe region, underscoringthe importance of continuing to make progress on this front.
Lastly, progress was achieved in the implementation o f the petroleum deregulation program,
allowing the importation o f crude oil and refined products through competitive tendering under
the supervision o f an independent regulatory agency - the National Petroleum Tender Board
(NPTB). As part o f the deregulation process, there was a re-alignment o f domestic petroleum
retail prices.

56.      The second component of the first PRSC series was based on the third and fourth
pillar of the GPRS I,incorporating measure aimed at assisting Ghana reach the MDG
goals by improvingservice delivery in education, health, and social protection. Under this
component progress i s reported in increasing access to health and education services. The share
of supervised maternal deliveries rose to 53 percent by 2004, up from 49 percent in 2002, with
particularly marked increases in the deprived regions (Central, Northern, Upper East and Upper
West regions).     There was also an increase in gross primary enrollment (GPER), with the
national GPER reaching 87 percent bymid-2005, up from 81percent inmid-2003. Finally, there
was a further decline inthe HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among pregnant women, dropping to 3.1
percent inearly 2005, down from 3.6 percent in2002.

57.      The thirdcomponentwas basedon the fifthpillar ofthe GPRSI,incorporatingactions
designed to strengthen governance and public sector management. Progress under this
component was reported primarily in strengthening public financial management, with
improvements inbudget coverage, timelier external auditing o f the accounts o f the consolidated
fund, and in the implementation o f new public procurement and internal audit legislation. The
budget coverage was broadened to include more information on internally generated funds and
donor grants. External audit reports became timelier, with the annual report by the Accountant
General being submitted to Parliament within less o f 12 months o f the closing o f the accounts.
There was also progress in implementing the new public procurement law, with increased
coverage provided by the entity tender committees and the tender review boards, and, under the
auspices o f the new internal audit agency law, the number o f government ministries, departments
and agencies submitting internal audit reportsbegan rising.

58.         A summary of some of the achievements in the implementation of the GPRS Iis
illustratedin Figure 11, which compares the latest informationon outcomes for ten GPRS
indicators with the 2000 baseline data and the 2005 targets. The comparison shows that,
based on the latest information, the program was successfbl inmeeting the 2005 targets for five
o f the ten indicators: poverty headcount and the poverty headcount inthe three savannah region,
the overall and the girls' gross primary enrollment, and access to safe water in urban areas.
Furthermore, the target for real per capita agriculture growth rate was already achieved and
surpassed. Less progress i s shown for some o f the health indicators, with a slow reduction in
maternal mortality and deterioration inthe outcomes for infant and under 5 mortality, as well as
worsening o f indicators for child malnutrition.

59.     The delays in meeting these targets of GPRS I underscore the need for greater
intersectoral coordination within government to meet the challenges facing the
implementationof the GPRS 11. Strengtheningthe links betweenintervention inthe health and
water sectors would contribute to reducing the incidence o f water-born diseases, such as guinea-
worm infections. Similarly, strengtheningthe links between health and nutrition interventions
was identified as important for reducing infant and under 5 mortality rates, since child
malnutrition was reported as accounting for up to 60 percent o f the cases o f child mortality.
Stronger coordination across sectors i s expected to be achieved through ongoing improvements
inmonitoring andevaluationwithin these sectors andat the national level.

60.     Also, accelerated growth under the GPRS I1 will require greater attention to
environmentalprotectionand naturalresource management. Ghana continues experiencing
a very rapid decline in both quantity and quality o f natural resources, threatening the
sustainability o f growth. It i s estimated that the degradation o f agricultural soils, forests, coastal
fisheries, wildlife resources and Lake Volta's environment accounts for losses o f at least US$
520 million annually (around 4.9 percent o f Ghana's annual GDP).                    hprovements in
environmental protection and the management o f natural resources would benefit from: (a)
increasing the capacity o f key regulatory agencies responsible for enforcing environmental
legislation; (b) reinforcing local community organizations and their involvement in natural
resource management; (c) transferring knowledge and appropriate technologies for sustainable
agriculture, such as conservation agriculture methods; and (d) encouraging the use o f market
instruments to address overcapacity issues and providing incentives for natural resources
management, such as taxation, concessiodlicensing schemes, and payment for environmental
services.

61.      There were also positive lessons to be drawn from the implementation of the first
series of PRSCs: the importanceof `ownership' of the reformprogramfor the satisfactory
implementationof the country's poverty reduction strategy, and the very high returns to
the Government of Ghana from the harmonization among development partners around
the MDBS framework. While most o f the actions completed under the program supported by
the first PRSC focused on laying out the groundwork for legislative changes, and developing
strategies for key areas o f the reform agenda, achieving the expected policy outcomes was
contingent on follow up actions that, in most instances, would be supported by subsequent
operations. These actions helped reinforce the importance o f ensuring broad ownership o f the
program from the onset, and o f building in mechanisms for regular consultations during
implementation. This approach appears to have yielded positive results by responding to the
government's ownership o f the program and by assuring continuous involvement and support
from development partners.

62.      Government ownership of the program supportedby the MDBS/PRSC evolved in
three distinct phases. In the first phase the Government led the preparation o f the Ghana
Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), while the development partners seized on this opportunity
to draw the new instrument for development assistance in Ghana - the Multi-Donor Budgetary
support (MDBS), o f which the PRSC i s part. The second phase involved developing sector
strategies aligned with the GPRS that would provide operational guidance for the
implementation o f the GPRS, as well as focus to the dialogue with the development partners.

                                              - 36 -


Sector strategies completed during this phase include, inter alia, the Power Sector Reform
Strategy, the Private Sector Development Strategy, the Education Sector Development Strategy,
the Food and Agriculture Sector Development Strategy. The third phase is ongoing and builds
on the two earlier phases. It involved having the Ghanaian government take the full leadership
inthe dialogue, drawing onthese strategies to definethe content and focus ofthe policymatrix.

63.    A second lesson has been the acknowledgement of the very high returns from
harmonization among development partners around the MDBS framework. The returns
from harmonization are reflected in higher and timely disbursements o f budgetary support, as
well as reduced transaction cost for the government indealing with external aid as a result o f the
reduction in the number o f visiting missions and o f reporting requirements. There have also
beenhighreturns from greater knowledge dissemination among development partners, leading to
improvements inthe policy dialogue and better assistance to the Government's reform program.
A case in point is the annual External Review o f Public Financial Management that the
development partners carry out jointly as part o f the MDBS process. These external reviews
provide an important opportunity to review the government's agenda for public financial
management and assess progress outside the negotiations surrounding the budgetary support.
This arm's length distance provides scope for assessing objectively the progress inimplementing
the broader public financial management reform program and for carrying out the dialogue
around technical issues with policy makers and civil servants inpositions o f responsibility.

64.    There is still scope to deepen the dialogue around ongoing reforms initiatives aimed
at:

       0   Improving the business environment by reducing the time and cost o f registering
           new businesses andproperty, and enhancing private sector access to credit;
        0  Strengthening the links between intervention in health and nutrition, which are
           important for reducing infant and under 5 mortality rates;
        0  Achieving a better balance between new investments and expenditures on
           operations and maintenance, especially in the expansion o f the road sector and in
           improving the reliability o f energy supply; and
        0  Reversing the decline in both quantity and quality of natural resources inGhana,
           mitigating estimated losses of at least US$ 520 million annually (almost 5 percent o f
           Ghana's annual GDP).


    5.     THE PROPOSEDPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

    A.     RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

65.     The proposed poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-4) is the first in a second
series of four annual operations supporting the implementation of the Ghana Growth and
Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11), in line with the 2004 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) and the proposed CAS Progress Report (CAS PR). It will continue to focus on three
broad components o f the government's growth and poverty reduction agenda, organized under:
(i)accelerated private sector-led growth; (ii)vigorous human development; and (iii)   governance

                                                                      - 37 -

            and civic responsibility. While the PRSC-4 support would translate primarily into funding for
            the implementation o f the GPRS 11, particular attention i s given to policy dialogue and to
            monitoring resource allocation and outcomes (Table 10). PRSC-4 would also pay attention to
            welfare and poverty indicators that allow an assessment o f whether poverty reduction objectives
            (including income and non-income dimensions of poverty) are indeedbeing achieved.

            66.     The first component of the proposedPRSC-4 reflects the objectives of the first pillar
            of the GPRS 11, focusing on actions aimed at accelerating sustainable private sector-led
            growth. It includes measures to create a more diversified financial sector, opening room for
            increased credit to the private sector, and measures to strengthen the business environment
            through the expansion o f energy supply services and the removal o f administrative barriers for
            business development. The reforms in the energy sector are particularly important because a
            long term resolution o f the country's energy problems will depend on actions aimed at ensuring
            the financial viability the enterprises operating inthe sector (mostly State Owned Enterprises),
            increasing private sector participation, and securing access to cheaper sources o f energy supply.
            This first component also supports measures to improve the performance o f the rural sector
            through policy actions aimed at strengthening government's support to agriculture, and at
            improving the management o fnatural resources with a focus on forestry resources.

            67.      The second component of the proposed PRSC-4 is based on the second pillar of the
            GPRS 11, incorporating measures aimed at assisting Ghana reach the MDG goals by
            improving service delivery in education, health, social protection, water and sanitation.
            Measures to improve service delivery ineducation focus on increasing access and completion o f
            quality basic education, particularly in the three most deprived regions (Northern, Upper East
            and Upper West), and on improving the efficiency and equity o f education financing, with
            greater attention to the poverty impact. Measures to improve the delivery o f health services
            center on bridging the equity gaps in the access to health care services in deprived regions
            (Northern, Upper East, Upper West and Central), and at reducing the spread o f HIV/AIDS.
            Measures to improve social protection concentrate on actions supporting the vulnerable and the
            excluded, such as the people living with HIV/AIDS, orphans, the homeless and street children.

                                             - 38 -

Measures to expand the provision o f safe water and sanitation include the development o f a
comprehensive sector strategy that addresses issues ranging from existing coverage, sector
implementation capacity, technology choices, andthe incidence o fwater-born diseases.

68.     The thirdcomponent of the proposedPRSC-4is basedon the thirdpillarofthe GPRS
I1 and incorporated actions designed to strengthen governance and public sector
management. Action envisioned inthis component centered on moving forward with a medium
term agenda for public sector reform that includes furthering decentralization, improving public
sector performance, modernizing public expenditure management, and strengthening the
capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda.

69.     The programmatic approach embedded in the PRSC process aims at providing
greater adaptability for step-by-step institutionalreforms, capacity building that involves
significant policy content, and an economy-wide scope that goes beyond the scope of
individualprojects. This focus on programmatic lending envisioned under the PRSC process is
grounded in clear country commitment and capacity to reform, structured in a series o f
operations supporting a medium-termreform program, and disbursed on the basis o f completed
actions rather than future commitments.


      B.        EXTERNAL    EVALUATIONS

70.     The external evaluation of the poverty reduction program for PRSC support is
based on two core assessments: (i) ongoing 2006 External Review of Public Financial
                                        the
Management (ERPFM), which i s using the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) framework tojointly with the Government o f Ghana assess progress instrengthening the
country's public financial management; and `(ii) IMF's assessment, as reflected in the
                                                    the
documentation supporting Ghana's eligibility to the MDRI. The IMF documentation reviews
Ghana's recent macroeconomic performance, the implementation o f its poverty reduction
strategy, and its record on public financial management. A summary o f these evaluations i s
providedbelow:


    The ongoing work on the 2006 External ,Review of Public Financial Management
    (ERPFM) is taking stock of progress in implementing reforms to strengthen public
    financialmanagement. The preliminaryfindings of this joint assessment are positive, with
    recent reforms being reflected in the scores for the Public Expenditure and Financial
    Accountability (PEFA) assessment. This PEFA assessment has highlighted some positive
    features o f Ghana's public financial management, including the predictability o f the budget
    at the aggregate level (both expenditures and revenues), as a result from disciplined budget
    execution and low levels o f arrears. There has also been demonstrable progress in areas of
    recent reforms, such as (i) budget comprehensiveness, with the budget statement
                                  greater
    including information on retained internally generated funds (IGFs), HIPC proceeds,
    statutory funds, and donor support by MDAs alongside funding from the consolidated fund;
    (ii)closer attention to internalfiscal controls, withthe development ofarobust internal
    auditing system; (iii) enhanced transparency inpublic procurement, with the implementation
    o f the new Public Procurement act giving attention to the use o f competitive biding and the

                                               - 39 -

    preparation o fprocurement plans; and (iv) adherence to the budget calendar. The assessment
    has also identified areas that require continued attention, including the need to: (i)   reduce
    budget deviations across administrative units, which result inpart from the extensive use o f
    budget contingencies and the need for closer controls in allowing the transfers o f funds
    across budget items; (ii)strengthen the links between the medium term expenditure
    framework (MTEF) and budget execution by, inter alia, improving expenditure costing at
    budget design stage; (iii)ensure more timely updating o f payroll information; and (iv)
    broaden the comprehensiveness o f budget reports, matching the comprehensiveness of the
    budget statement and proving information on flows to front-line service units. The joint
    PEFA assessment also includes a review o f donor practices, giving high scores to the
    predictability o f yearly budget support, while noting a weaker predictability o f budget
    support within the year, as well as the limited use of national systems (procurement,
.   disbursement, financial reporting and auditing) for operations other than budgetary support.

    The IMFassessmentat the time of the Board's considerationofthe MDRI inDecember
    2005 was also positive, indicatingthat key macroeconomicobjectives under the Fund-
    supported program have generally been met, with public expenditure management
    havingimprovedsince the HIPC completionpoint, and the country continuingto make
    progressin implementingits poverty reductionpolicies. The Fund's document points out
    that Ghana has maintained steady growth and macroeconomic stability since the HIPC
     completion point, with real GDP growth averaging just under 6 percent in 2004 and 2005,
     inflation declining appreciably, and gross international reserves being maintained at a
    relatively high level, providing a cushion against external shocks. The Fund document also
     notes that the poverty headcount has declined 7 percentage points since 1997, reaching 35 in
     2003, and under current projections Ghana should reach the MDG o f halving the 1990
     poverty rate before 2015. To support this positive trend, total poverty-related spending has
     risen duringthe past several years, reaching 8.5 percent o f GDP by end-2005, and there have
     been improvements inthe delivery of human services. Lastly, public financial management
     has improved, with the country currently meeting 8 o f the 16 HIPC public expenditure
     management benchmarks, up from 7 benchmarks at the time o f the 2004 HIPC AAP
     assessment, and 1benchmark in2001. Areas o f specific progress include: (i)     broadening the
     coverage of the budget, (ii) preparingtimelier external audit reports o f the consolidated h d ,
     and(iii) reducing arrears to public sector service providers.

            E.l. PromotingGrowth,IncomeandEmployment

       74.       With real GDP growth having maintained its momentum in 2005, the main
       challenge facing the Ghanaian policymakers is sustaining further the current economic
       expansion. Achieving this objective will require actions on two fronts: broadening o f the
       country's export base and increasingthe efficiency o f investment. Inaddition, sustained effort is
       required to continue the consolidation o f the country's fiscal position. Broadening the country's
       export base i s important because it i s still very narrow, with strong dependence on the
       performance o f exports o f primary commodities, especially cocoa and gold. Increasing the
       efficiency o f investment i s important because, at the current investment to GDP ratio o f almost
       30 percent, Ghana could be growing at additional 2 to 3 percentage points if investments were
       channeled toward areas that entailed either an increase in the economy's productive assets, or
       toward activities that increased the productivity o f private sector activities.                       Finally,
       consolidating the fiscal position is essential because, as a small, open economy, Ghana i s subject
       to external shocks, such as oil price hikes and fluctuations in the prices o f primary commodities
       that tend to be magnified whenever there are either large fiscal deficits, or hidden contingent
       liabilities. While the country has made recent efforts to reduce its vulnerability to external

                                                  - 43 -

shocks through measures to diversify its export base and strengthen its fiscal management, there
i s still scope for further progress.

75.       Ensuring the private sector's ability to respond to the growth opportunities will
require removingsome of the structuralimpedimentsto sustainedgrowth. The constraints
include:


   0      The high cost business environment, limiting the entry of new business and
          competitionwithin the private sector. Some o f the factors leading to the highcosts of
          doing business inGhana include: (i)    time consuming andcostly business registration and
          licensing, with a number o f fees, fines and operating pennits involved in opening and
          operating a business; (ii) inadequate landregistration, titling and administration, creating
          bottlenecks in access to land and site development; (iii)    protracted commercial dispute
          resolution schemes, increasing the lag involved in enforcing contracts and recovering
          debt obligations; (iv) limited financial services, constraining private sector access to
          credit and capital; and (iv) delays in customs clearances due to time consuming
          procedures and official discretion.

   0      The low reliability of energy supply resulting from the deterioration of the power
          distribution system, operational inefficiencies of the power utility companies, and
          slow expansion of low-cost, high quality energy supply sources. Improving the
          operational efficiency o f the electricity distribution companies is within reach and would
          yield very high returns. The Electricity Company o f Ghana (ECG) currently has an
          aggregate system loss o f around 24 percent, split about evenly between losses of power
          purchased and commercial losses associated with uncollected energy bills. Estimates
          suggest that ECG could improve its cash flow by an additional U S $ 2 million for every
          percentage point reduction in losses. Similarly, the Volta River Authority (VRA) stands
          to benefit from ongoing investments in the West Afr-ica Gas Pipeline (WAGP) and the
          West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) that will increase the country's access to cheaper
           sources o f energy supply, while reducing dependency on more expensive oil-based
          thermal power generation. Reaping the full benefits from these investments will require
          actions on at least four fronts. Fist, there i s a need to compensate VRA for the implicit
           subsidy its providing the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO).               VRA is supplying
           energy to VALCO at 2.7 cents per kilowatt hour, compared to its marginal costs o f
           around 10 cents per kilowatt hour. While the extra electricity sales has boosted VRA's
          revenues, the need to produce more electricity from higher cost thermal generation
          sources has resulted in VRA's preliminary (un-audited) financial statement for 2005
           showing an operating loss o f about $300 billion, down from an estimated operating profit
           o f about $400 billion one year earlier. Action needs to be taken immediately because
          VRA losses will compromise its ability to meet the commitments under the WAGP and
          complete the investmentsfor the WAPP. Second, there i s a needto set up an independent
           systemoperator for the powertransmissioncompany, as Ghana will not be able to linkup
          to the WAPP before it can assure other partners that there is no conflict o f interest
          between the system operator o f the transmission system and the power generation
           companies, notably VRA. It i s important to note that the establishment o f the
           independentsystem operator does not require that the assets o fthe transmission company

                                          - 44 -

  be transferred outside VRA, since VRA is still expected to make the investments
  necessary for Ghana to participate inthe WAPP. An independent system operator i s still
  needed, however, to ensure the needed transparency in dispatching energy through the
  WAPP and avoiding the potential conflict o f interest alluded to above. Third, there i s the
  needto complete the electricity tariff review, ensuring that tariffs adjust to the increased
  cost o f energy generation and the separation o f the transmission charges from the bulk
  service tariff (BST) in the tariff structure. The former is important because the thermal
  generation today accounts for as much as 40 percent o f total power supply in Ghana, and
  tariffs need to reflect the increased cost o f imported crude oil. The latter is necessary
  because the current tariff structure makes it difficult to distinguish transparently the
  charges due to transmission and the changes due to distribution. Fourth, there i s the need
  to ensure that the gas flowing through the WAGP is used productively and immediately
  once it becomes available. Ghana's contract with the WAGP is on a take-or-pay basis,
  meaning that once the gas from WAGP becomes available VRA i s committed to pay
  US$40 million per month. This payment obligation i s the reason why VRA has set up an
  escrow account to safeguard the funds for these payments. However, with the recent
  deterioration in V U ' S finances the funds for this escrow account are now injeopardy.
  Usingthe gas suppliedthrough the WAGP will require that the country increase its use o f
  gas for power generation both by converting existing more expensive oil-based thermal
  power generation capacity, and by setting up new gas-powered generation plants. In
  addition, the country needs to establish a local gas distribution company to provide gas to
  those enterprises that will be using gas for industrial production, replacing the more
  expensive crude oil fuel.

0 The low level of Ghana's overall financial intermediation compared to other Sub-

  growth. The authorities have made some important progress over the past three years:
  updating relevant financial sector legislation, improving bank and non-bank supervision,
  overseeing the improved performance o f the Social Security National Insurance Trust
  (SSNIT), providing additional tax incentives for long term savings, and restructuring
  some o f the commercial banks' claims on the state-owned Tema Oil refinery. There
  remain various weaknesses, however, including residual inefficiencies o f the commercial
  banking system that translate into high interest rate spread and the lack o f long-term
  capital.

  include: (i)  reliance on traditional planting and harvesting techniques, with low usage o f
  pesticides and chemical fertilizers; (ii)high interest rates spreads, reducing the
  availability o f financing inrural areas; (iii) transport andmarketing costs, stemming
                                                high
  from increases in fuel costs, as well as poor road and market infrastructure. Indeed, the
  latter i s threatening to erode Ghana's comparative advantage in supplying certain crops,
  since in the case o f some staples, transport costs represent as much as half o f the urban
  retail price.

  0    Weak management of natural resources, threatening to deplete the country's
       natural resource base.      Weak institutional and enforcement capacities and policy
       failures have led to alarming rates o f depletion o f forest and savanna woodland, aquatic
       and marine, wildlife and fisheries resources, as well as farm and pasturelands. Land
       degradation and deforestation are the most pervasive natural resource and environmental
       management threats in Ghana. Savannas, which comprise about 66 percent o f Ghana's
       land area, are threatened by a number o f factors, including overgrazing, bush fires,
       firewood harvesting, expansion o f agricultural cultivation, and inappropriate crop
       management. In the high forest areas, timber production i s occurring at four times the
       sustainable rate, with an annual rate o f deforestation estimated at about 1.6 percent (about
       65,000 ha annually), putting at risk the main source o f rural energy for heating and
       cooking and threatening to eliminate off-reserve forests in 10 years. Inaddition, mining,
       inappropriate farming systems and massive encroachment by farmers have dramatically
       reduced the extent and quality o f Ghana's forest resources, threatening wildlife and
       biodiversity.

76.    Progress made under the program for private sector-led growth supported by the
MDBS-OYPRSC-4 is still in its initial stages, with only a few actions already completed.
The early stages o f implementation o f the private sector-led growth program should not detract
from underlyingimprovements inthe environment for private sector development. The prudent
management o f fiscal accounts has provided scope for debt reduction, while new government
programs for the development o f the private sector, agriculture and natural resources
management continue guidingthe implementation o f the GPRS 11. Specific actions included the
following:

    0  Reducing public domestic debt to increase the credit available to the private sector.
       The preliminary assessmento f fiscal developments in2005 indicate that the target for the
       overall fiscal deficit was surpassed, with the domestic debt to GDP ratio declining further
       to 11 percent at end-2005, down from 15 percent at end-2004, and 24 percent at end-
       2002. Lower levels o f domestic public debt and moderate inflation allowed, in turn, for
       nominal interest rates on treasury bills to ease to 11.5 percent by end-2005, down from
        16.4 percent inat end-2004 and 28.1 percent at end-2002. Increased availability o f credit
       to the private sector ensued, estimated to have increased by around 14 percent in 2005,
       reaching 55 percent o f domestic credit, up from 42 percent at end-2004.

    0  Diversifying the financial sector, with several actions completed in the
       implementation of the FINSSP. First, the drafting o f a microfinance policy document,
       which followed two stakeholders' workshops carried out in November and December
       2005. Consultations on the proposed microfinance policy document still need to be
       carried out with the Bank o f Ghana and the Development Partners prior to receiving the
       approval by the Board o f the Micro-Finance and Small Loans Centre (MASLOC),
        formerly the National Micro-Finance Centre. Second, the Legislative Instrument for the
       Rural and Community Banks (RCBs) has beendrafted by the Attorney General and will
       be sent to the Registrar o f Companies to have legal effect.                A Shareholder's
       Extraordinary General Meeting i s expected to be held before end-April to adopt the

        regulations. Third, a draft proposal for the Credit Union bill was submitted by the
        MinistryofFinance and Economic Planningto the Attorney General, who is expected to
        submit the final draft o fthe billto Parliament.

    0   Continuingthe implementation of the power sector reform, with additional efforts
        made in restructuringthe energy sector to encourage efficiency and the quality of
        service delivery. These efforts included taking steps toward: (i) progress towardmaking
        reducing ECG system losses in line with the targets envisioned inthe draft proposal for
        the Management Support Services Agreement (MSSA); (ii)settling ECG accounts
        receivable from MDAs and the Ghana Water Company within 90 days; and (iii)                         carrying
        out a comprehensive tariff review, ensuring that VRA and ECG earn an adequate return
        on capital, and including transmission service separate from the bulk service tariff (BST)
        inthe tariff structure. ECG's systemlosses22continueddeclining in2005, reaching25.47
        percent by end-year, down from 26.54 percent at end-2004. The reduction in ECG's
        system losses in 2005 was an improvement over 2004 results and placed the company
        back on the track with the lose reduction that began in 2001 (Figure 12).                               This
        improvement in efficiency i s consistent with the targets outlined in the draft Request for
        Proposal for the ECG Management Support Services Agreements (MSSAs), which
        entails management strengthening and new investments in the distribution system. The
        Request for Proposal (RfP) for the MSSA i s scheduled to be issued to qualified bidders
        by July 2006, allowing the MSSA to be signed and become effective by end-2006. Also,
        accounts payable to ECG by the MDAs and the GWCL totaled $73 billion at end-
        December 2005, or the equivalent to 90 days o f sale to these institutions. Finally, the
        technical work on the comprehensive utility's tariff review was completed earlier this
        year and i s now awaiting approval by the Public Utilities Regulatory Committee (PURC).

    0   Enhancing the competitiveness of the private sector, with progress in the
        implementation of the private sector development strategy happening in at least
         four fronts. First, action was taken to reduce the time to register new business, with the
         average period falling to 81 days in 2005, down from 85 days in 2004, as measured by



22 System losses are defined as one minus the ratio o f total revenues collected over total purchased energy purchased
times the annual average end-user tariff.

       the World Bank's 2006 Doing Business report. Actions included the completion o f the
       automation of Registrar-General's Department (RGD), with the hardware, networking
       infrastructure and software installation completed, and the conversion o f data for all
       categories o f business from manual registration files to an electronic database. At the
       Registrar-General's Department the average time for registration has been reduced to 7
       days for business names, and to 14 days for Limited Companies.          Furthermore, the
       average time for searches and retrievalo f information has beenreduced from 2 days to 30
       minutes. Second, the implementation o f the recommendations institutional review o f the
       PSD strategy began at the Forestry Commission, the Volta River Authority (VRA) and at
       the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Third, the implementation o f the Trade
       Sector Support Program (TSSP) began, with the streamlining o f import procedures and
       the reduction o f fees charged for clearing, and the review o f the mechanism o f imported
       products to reduce under-invoicing and under-valuation. Fourth, four land deed registries
       were established earlier this year (Table 12). With the inauguration o f these registries
        land deed registration became decentralized and currently no document is registered in
        Accra under the deed system. As part o f the Institutional Restructuring the established
        deed registries will become the Land Title Registry whenever title registration is
        introduced into any region. As o f September 2005 the numbers o f documents registered
        at these registries were as follows:

   0    Improvingthe performanceof the rural sector in the interestof the rural poor,with
        the Ministry o f Food and Agriculture (MOFA) having completed a first draft o f the
        revised Food and Agriculture Sector Development Plan (FASDEP) incorporating
        approaches to poverty reduction. A first stakeholders' consultation was held on January
        24, 2006, and a final draft i s expected by September 2006. Once completed, the revised
        FASDEPwill inform the MOFA's strategic plan. Inthe meantime, twenty districts have
        been selected for the piloting o f the pro-poor intervention programs, with $4.8 billion
        having been released through the budget for that purpose.

    0   Strengthening forestry resource management, with the harmonization of
        institutional arrangements for plantation development, the allocation of timber
        rights in natural forests and plantations through competitive bidding, and the
        conversion of existing timber leases into timber utilizationcontracts in accordance
        with the existing legislation. The harmonization o f plantation programs aims at
        bringing the several existing plantation schemes under a common framework,
        standardizing the costing o f these schemes and balancing the needs o f the rural poor,
        farmers and the private sector. This harmonization i s important because these plantation
        programs entail a significant investment by the country. Making these programs more
        cost effective i s important to ensure the sustainability o f the achievements in increasing
        the sources of off-reserve timber supply and employment generation.             Also, these
        programs assist in securing water catchments areas through establishment o f plantations
        along river banks and headwaters, reducing land and soil degradation and improving
        environmental quality (Table 13).

harmonization objectives, with the government's plantations development program at the
MinistryandLands, Forestry andMines beingtransferred to thePlantationDevelopmentUnitof
the Forest Services Division o f the Forestry Commission. Also, while there were 4 competitive
biddings planned for 2005, these were not carried out because o f a court injunction that blocked
new competitive biddings in natural timber forests.         Finally, the Forestry Commission has
prepared preliminary inventories for 12 pilot concessions to serve as pilots for the complete
rollout o f timber utilization contracts (TUCs). The final inventory reports are expected by end-
October, providing the necessary basis to determine the timber right fee payable by leaseholders.

78.     The monitorableactions under the programsupportedby PRSC-5 include:

    0   Implementing the 2006 tranche of the Financial Sector Strategic Plan (FINSSP),
        focusing on:      ,



        o Continuing to increase the share of SSNIT investment assets managed by
             regulated private financial institutions. The Social Security National Insurance
             Trust (SSNIT) holds about 17 percent of all financial assets in Ghana, being 50
             percent larger than the largest commercial bank. By continuing to transfer to the
             private sector the responsibility for managing a fraction o f these assets would help
             mobilize additional private sector savings for the growth agenda, serving as a catalyst
             for public-private partnerships in areas that require investments with long gestations,
             particularly ininfrastructure. Also, private sector management o f a fraction o f SSNIT

                                          - 49 -

      financial assets would lead to increased transparency and improved investment
      allocation, mitigating the risk that SSNIT funds could be used for emergency lending
      to public enterprises.

   o Further strengtheningthe regulatoryframework for the financial sector with the
      passage o f the Credit Reporting Act and the Foreign Exchange Act. The Credit
      Reporting Act aims at formalizing the procedures for reporting and sharing
      information on credit records, thus contributing to further reduce the risks o f lending
      and the cost o f borrowing. The Foreign Exchange Act aims at liberalizing balanced
      o f payments capital account transactions within the Economic Community o f West
      African States (ECOWAS).-

0 Implementingthe thirdyear of the powersector reforms, including:

   o Further reducingECG's systemlosses by makingprogress inmeetingthe end-2007
      targets agreed under the Management Support Services Agreement (MSSA).               As
      mentioned above improving the operational efficiency o f the Electricity Company of
      Ghana (ECG) i s within reach and would yield very high returns. ECG currently has
      an aggregate system loss o f around 25 percent, split about evenly between losses o f
      power purchased and commercial losses associated with uncollected energy bills.
      Estimates suggest that ECG could improve its cash flow by an additional US$ 2
      million for everypercentage point reductioninlosses. The additional cash flow could
      then help fund needed expenditures in operations and maintenance, leading to further
       savings.  The additional cash flow could also help finance investments aimed at
      broadening access to electricity within the country.

   o Earmark in the upcoming 2006 supplementary budget the funds necessary to
       compensateV U for the difference betweenthe weighted average cost o f electricity
      production in Ghana and bulk power supply agreed for the VRA interim power
       supply agreement with VALCO. Since the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO)
       came back into operation, in September 2005, the finances o f the Volta River
       Authority (VRA) have been drained. VRA is supplying energy to VALCO at 2.7
       cents per kilowatt hour, compared to its marginal costs o f around 10 cents per
       kilowatt hour. While the extra electricity sales boosted V U ' Srevenues, the need for
       V U to produce more electricity from higher cost thermal generation sources has
       resulted in V U ' Spreliminary (un-audited) financial statement for 2005 showing an
       operating loss o f about $300 billion, down from an estimated operatingprofit o f about
       $400 billion one year earlier. VRA losses will compromise its ability to meet its
       commitments under the ECOWAS energy protocol and to reduce the country's
       dependency on expensive oil-based thermal power generation.

 0 Implementing the 2005 Private Sector Development (PSD) Composite Workplan,
   including: (i) establishing 3 additional land deed registries, allowing greater security in
   land transactions and the ability to post deed certificates as collateral; and (ii)  further
   reducing the time required for registering new businesses by implementing administrative
   and legislative reforms necessary to complete the business registration reform strategy.

    0  Implementing the Food and Agriculture            Sector Development Program by: (i)
       finalizing the irrigation policy document transferring the management o f delivery systems
       to water user groups; (ii)    taking steps to increase the uptake o f improved seeds and
       planting materials for export and food crops; and (iii) executing programs to reduce post-
       harvest losses andincrease agro-processing.

    0   Continue strengthening the management of forestry resources by increasing the
       budget execution o f the Forestry Commission, allowing it to carryout: (i)   the allocation o f
       new Timber Utilization Contracts (TUCs), (ii) conversion o f existing timber leases

        accordance with the Financial Administration Regulations. Ensuring predictable hnding
        for the Forestry Commission i s essential for carrying out the activities that will allow the
        transition to this new contracting system.         These activities include the survey,
        demarcation and inventory o f trees in the areas eligible for new TUCs, and the
        calculation o f the timer right fees (TRF) that will be used for to determine the value o f
        the TUCs.

79.     Expectedoutcomes. It is expected that, as a result o f the reforms, barring unfavorable
exogenous events, real GDP growth rate would remain at least in the current 6 percent range
through end-2008. This growth outcome would result largely from improvements inthe general
policy environment, assisted by the removal o f bottlenecks for the development o f the private
sector and by a greater efficiency inmanagement o f the public sector. This outcome is expected
fiom several intermediate results: (i)reduced interest rates, creating room for increased private
sector access to credit; (ii) improved financial and operational results at the Electricity Company
o f Ghana (ECG) and at the Volta River Authority (VRA), opening scope for new efficiency
enhancing investments and the expansion inelectricity supply at affordable costs; (iii)     improved
provision o f broad-based access of a wide range o f competitive financial products and services;
(iv) increased international competitiveness due to declining transaction costs o f doing business;
(v) increased productivity o f export and food crops, helping sustain export growth and increase
the income o f food crop farmers, who make up the majority o f the rural poor; and (vi) better
management o f forestry resources, leading to increased natural and plantation forest cover in
Ghana.

Education

80.   The main challenge facing the education sector in Ghana is sustaining and
accelerating the recent progress in increasing enrollment rates, and raising the quality of
education. Meeting these challenges will require action aimed at:

      Broadening access to all levels of education. While school enrollment has been rising
      throughout the country, gross primary enrollment inthe Northern, Upper East and Upper
      West regions are, on the average, about 12 percentage points lower than the national'
      average. In addition, the gross enrollment rate for girls i s still lagging behind that for
      boys by about 6 percentage points.

   0  Raising the quality of education. As access to education broadens, additional efforts
      will need to be made to ensure that education standards continue rising. The expansion
       o f education, measured in increased enrollment and educational attainment, requires
       deepening ongoing efforts to recruit qualified teachers, assigning them to areas with high
      teacher-pupil ratios, and renewed attention to post-basic education, especially in areas
      with limited access to quality secondary education programs.

   0   Reaching a better balance in the distribution of resources available to the education
       sector. While, on the average, government provides 91 percent o f education financing,
       most o f this i s absorbed by teachers' salaries, leaving very little funds for non-salary
       expenditure.    This has adversely affected the provision o f textbooks, teaching and
       learning materials, and infrastructure. There i s also the need to invest in teacher training
       and development. The most deprived areas lack teachers while at the same time there are
       instances o f over-concentration o f teachers inthe urban areas. The procedures for teacher
       deployment have, therefore, become critical to successful education delivery in the
       country. To ensure effective and optimum utilization o f teachers, it is also important to
       have accurate data and statistics on teacher availability and deployment.

81.    To address these challenges, the Education Sector program endeavors to:

   0   Remove financial barriers in access to education, promoting enrollment and retention
       and achieving greater gender equality by providing capitation grants for girls attending
       primary schools in deprived communities, as well as in public primary schools for the
       disabled.

   0   Improve the efficiency and equity of financing education, raising the resource
       allocation to the sector, especially for non-salary expenditures, and consolidating all
       sources o f fundingto the education sector. This consolidation i s expected to be done by
       the Ministry o f Education, and will include information from the government's budget,
       the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund), the District Assembly Common Fund
       (DACF) and HIPC funds.

   0   Ensure the quality of basic education, deploying teachers in a more equitable and
       rational manner, by providing incentives and strengthening school supervision, and by
       distributingschool textbooks.

   0   Decentralize to the district level the responsibility for the delivery of basic
       education. This decentralization has a critical impact on the division o f responsibilities
       between national and sub-national levels o f government, requiring strengthening of local
       and school level capacities, and delegating to the national level the responsibility for
       ensuringpedagogicalorientation and overall quality o fthe educationprovided.

82.    The educationprogramsupportedby the MDBS-O5/PRSC-4is focused on ensuring
the provision of public education services in the deprived areas, based on two overarching
objectives: (i) increasing access, completion and quality in basic education, particularly in
the three most deprivedregions(Northern, Upper East and Upper West), and (ii)ensuring
sustainable financing arrangements that protect the delivery of education to the poor.
Specific actions include the following:

   0   Eliminating all government-controlledfees and introduce capitation grants for all
       students attending public primary schools and junior secondary schools. This
       measure aims at increasing access to education across the entire country. The results o f
       the 2003 CWIQ indicated that almost one-quarter o f school-aged children were not
       attending school because o f school fees and levies. There i s an increased recognition
       therefore that authorized and unauthorized leviedfees paid by pupils are a key barrier to
       increasing access to education. Once these levies and fees are removed, and schools are
       provided the incentive o f capitation grants for every student attending public primary
       schools, access i s expected to continue increasing sharply. Capitation grants aim also at
       providing needed funds for schools to improve quality by implementing their school
       improvement plans (e.g., repair a broken window, provide a chair for a teacher or buy
       wooden slates for primary one pupils).

    0  Implementing the district sponsorship scheme for teacher trainees based on a
       teachers' needs assessment. These district sponsorship schemes aim at complementing
       ongoing efforts to motivate teachers into accepting posting to rural areas by enabling
       districts to directly sponsor teacher trainees that agree to work in their districts upon
       completion o ftraining. The needs assessmentwill allow around 9,000 new teachers to be
       assigned to areas o f greatest need each year.

    0  Ensuringtimely delivery of core textbooks to all primary school, so that the increase
       in enrollment can be met with textbooks and teacher manuals that are essential for
       ensuring education quality.

    0  Delivering increased 'resources to 53 deprived districts on the basis of district
       education plans, to ensure that the most deprived districts are provided the necessary
       financial resources to implement the actions aimed at improving education access and
       quality.

    0  Increasingthe execution rate of budgetednon-salary expenditures to not less than
       85 percent in 2005, up from 80 percent in 2004, to ensure that resource necessary for
       ensuring effective teaching and learning is sustained.

83.     Progressin completingactions envisionedunderthe programhas been as follows:

        Government-controlledfees have been eliminatedand capitation grants introduced
        for all students attending public basic education (kindergarten, primary & junior
        secondary), reaching 3.7 million pupils at a total cost o f $111 billion (US$12 million).
        According to the Ghana Education Service (GES), 70 percent o f all capitation grants for
        the 2005-06 academic year had already been paid by end-February 2006, providing
        around $30,000 per pupil, irrespective o f gender. The proportion o f capitation grants
        paid on time i s expected to increase for the academic year 2006-07, as the GES i s no
        longer planning to making these transfers to School Board through the District
        Assemblies (DAs), choosing instead to set up individual bankingaccounts for the School
        Boards at the Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB), which has graciously waived the banking
        fees for these transactions      Also, given the positive impact o f capitation grants on
        enrollment, the government has updated its targets for gross entry rates for primary 1and
        primary 6 completion rates. Gross entry rates for primary 1 are expected to reach 100
        percent already in 2006-07, rather than only in 2010 as originally planned. Similarly,
        primary 6 completion rates are expected to reach 100 percent in2012, three years earlier
        than the original target date o f 2015.

84.     These initiatives appear to be yielding positive results. Prelimind3data from the
Ghana Education Service indicates a substantial increase in enrolments numbers across public
schools in the country. Whereas the increase in Gross Primary Enrolments over the past few
years have been an average of 1.73 percent per annum, preliminary figures received from the
districts have recorded the following estimated results

85.     This preliminaryinformation suggests that the governmentis on target to meet its
goals for gross primary enrollment rates at the nationallevel, meeting also the targets for
female primary enrollment and in the overall enrollment in the three deprived regions.
Female primary enrollment rates are expected to reach the national overall enrollment rate
already in the academic year 2005-06, up from much lower levels in 2004-05, while primary
school enrollment inthe deprivedregions are forecast to increase by at least 5 percent on average
over the 2004-05 rates (Table 15).

    0   District sponsorship schemes for teacher are being implemented, with an estimated
        8,640 trainee teachers sponsored by district assemblies in the 2004-05 academic year.
        After training, these trainees are expected to be postedback inthe districts that sponsored
        them, contributing a decrease inprimarypupil-teacher ratios (PTRs) inpoorer districts o f
        the deprived regions. This program i s important because the trends in primary pupil-
        teacher ratios have been mixed (Table 16). While there was a decline in the primary
        pupil-teacher ratios in the Upper East region in the academic year 2004-05, this ratio
        increased in the other two northern regions as a result, in part, o f the increase in gross
        primary enrollment reported above (see Table 15). Thus, to complement these efforts,
        the National Service Secretariat has posted 1,200 volunteer teachers to schools in rural
        areas.

86.     The anticipatedincrease in textbook-primary pupil ratios have been achieved with
the delivery of core primary school textbooks in early academic year 2005-06 (Table 17).
The government has procured textbooks for primary andjunior secondary schools inthe amount
o f $395.0 billion, with the first batch o f textbooks (70 percent) already delivered and distributed.
Under this program the government estimates that a 1:3.0 textbook-pupil ratio inall subjects and
all districts will be achieved already inthe 2005-06 academic year, exceeding the original target
o fthree core subject areas only inthe 53 deprived districts.

    0  The increase in the budget execution rate for non-salary expenditures in education
       i s on track to being met, with the execution rate reaching 78 percent in the first 9
       months o f the 2005-06 academic year, up from 80 percent for the entire 2004-05
       academic year, and i s expected to reach 85 percent by the end o f the 2005-06 academic
       year.

    0  The commitment to improve the equity of financing education with attention to
       greater poverty impact is being maintained, with an increased delivery o f budget
       resources to the 53 deprived districts on basis o f their district education plans, with the
       amounts rising from $25.7 billion in 2004 to $126 billion 2005, representing 21.4 percent
       o f the non-salary education budget in2005-06, compared to 13.4 percent in2004.

87.    The proposed monitorable actions under the program supported by PRSC-5
includes the following:

    0  The reduction of teachers' vacancies in deprived districts by allocating additional
       funds for teacher recruitment and retention inthese areas. It is estimated that there are
       3,800 unfilled teacher vacancies in deprived districts, which partially explains the high
       teacher-pupil ratios in these areas. These positions need to be staffed if the country i s
       going to reap the benefits o f increased enrollment that has resulted from the
       implementation o f capitation grants. The additional cost o f filling these teacher positions
       is estimated at $33.2 billion (US$3.7 million), which i s a fraction o f the investment
       already being madethrough capitation grants.

    0  The construction and rehabilitation of basic school infrastructure to accomodate the
       increase inenrollment that has resulted from the introduction o f capitation grants.

    0  The introduction of incentive programs aimed at achieving gender equity in areas
       with low gender parity index (GPI). While the increase inprimary school enrollment
       has been matched by an increase in female enrollment, more still needs to be done to
       ensure that the country meets gender parity inprimary education.

    0  Implementthe district sponsorship scheme for teacher trainees based on a teachers'
       needs assessment. The district sponsorship schemes aim at complementing ongoing
        efforts to increase the share o f trained teachers posted inrural areas by enabling districts
       to directly sponsor teacher trainees that agree to work in their districts upon completion
        o f training. The needs assessment will allow around 9,000 new teachers to be assigned to
        areas o f greatest need each year.

    0  Ensuretimely delivery of core textbooks to all primary school, so that the increase in
        enrollment can be met with textbooks and teacher manuals that are essential for ensuring
        education quality.

    0   Further develop regular testing of learning achievements at the basic school level, to
        ensure adequate monitoring o f the results from the efforts to match the increase in
        enrollment with more teachers andmore timely delivery o f textbooks.

    0   Increase execution rate of budgeted non-salary expenditures to not less than 90
        percent in 2006, up from 85 percent in 2005, to ensure that resource necessary for
        ensuringeffective teaching and learningis sustained.

Health


89.     While the health status of the Ghanaian population has significantly improved
duringthe lastdecade, reflectingprogressin several areas, recentindicatorsshow increases
in infant and under 5 mortality rates, as well as slow progress in reducing maternal
mortality rates (Table 19). These health indicators raise concerns because, if trends recorded
during the fist half o f the 1990s were to be maintained, Ghana would be on track to achieving
most health-related MDGs by 2015, except for the target o f reducing maternal mortality ratio
(MMR). Getting back on track with meeting the MDGs will require the country to face the
following challenges:

    0    Stemming the `brain drain' and rebalancing the unequal distribution of staff.
         Despite an "additional duty hour allowance" that i s paid to health workers to top up their
         salaries, which provides an incentive to remain in the public sector, Ghana continues to
         lose doctors and nurses to the UK, U S and neighboring African countries. As a result,
         the country's overall ratio o f health professionals per population ratio is 2.1 per 1,000,
         slightly lower that the 2.5 per 1,000 that is considered a global average for adequate
        provision o f certain priority health services.         Furthermore, there is substantial
         geographical variation within the country, with the lowest ratio o f 0.36 per 1,000 found in
         Juabeso-Bia district inthe Western region. There are a total o f 34 districts that have staff
         per population ratios below 1.0 per 1,000 population (World Bank, 2004), with majority
         o f these districts (65 percent) classified inthe GPRS as socio-economically deprived.

    0    Increasing funding for the health sector. To reach the MDGs, it has been estimated
         that Ghana would need to raise per capita health expenditures to 16 USD in 2005, to 25
         USD in 2010 and to 31 U S D in2015 (figures in2000 U S dollars). Inaddition, there will
         still be a demand for other health services, such as new more expensive HIV/AIDS
         treatment strategies (ARV) that Ghana is now embarking. While these figures represent
         rough estimates, it does underscore the need to ensure growth in available resources to
         the health sector. Incomparison, the total expenditures inthe health sector (all sources)

90.    To assist in meeting these challenges, the program for improving human service
delivery for health supported by PRSC-4 centered on (i)bridging the equity gaps in the
access to health care services in deprived regions (Northern, Upper East, Upper West and
Central) and (ii) ensuring sustainable financing arrangements for the health sector that
protectthe poor. Specific actions include:

   0   Establishing the HR monitoring and evaluation system, piloting agreed
       recommendations o f the options paper for the decentralization o f personnel emoluments,
       and developing a draft revisedhuman resource policy.

   0   Registeringthe eligible poor at the District-wide Mutual HealthInsurance Schemes
       (DMHIS), while, inparallel, the National Health Insurance Council (NHIC) transfers the
       insurance subsidy to these district schemes, and the 2006 budget keeps the funding for
       exemptions at the same levels as in2004.

   0   Increasingthe utilizationof healthservices.

91.    Progress in completing the actions envisioned under the health sector program
supported by the MDBS-OS/PRSC-4 has been broadly satisfactory, with a more detailed
description o fthese actions as follows:


0  An HR monitoring and evaluation system for health care professionals has been
   established following the Cabinet's approval o f the decentralization o f human resource
   management to teaching hospitals and to the regional levels o f the Ghana Health Services
   (GHS) in October 2005 and further work on the HR strategy. The estimated cost o f the
   program i s # 11.2 billion, covering infrastructure and system development, as well as training
   and orientation o f staff.       A system for routine HR data collection is already in place,
   providing a service availability mapping, and involving health staff head counting.            The
   operations o f the system were recently assessedby ajoint MoH-Bank mission carried out in



24Estimates from the 2004 External Review o fthe Health Sector Programo f Work.

   December 2005, with a follow up mission in mid-March 2006. The preliminary figures for
   mid-2005 that are available appear to be encouraging, with the population-doctor ratio
   declining to 9,174: 1, down from 16,500: 1 in 2002, and the nurse-population ratio falling to
   1,450: 1, compared to 2,000: 1 in 2001. These results have given further impetus to reform
   the ADHA, adding incentive elements to wage allowances for health care professionals.


0  The registration of the eligible poor at the District-wide Mutual Health Insurance
   Schemes (DMHIS) is proceeding as scheduled, while, additional funding is being
   provide for exemptions. As o f end-2005, a total o f 123 district mutual health insurance
   schemes were set up and managing claims throughout the country. There were 3.6 million
   people enrolled as members, representing 17.9 percent o f the population and exceeding the
   target o f 10 percent coverage set for last year. Within the population covered, 2.5 million
   people (70.2 percent) were inthe exempt category (i.e., children less than 18, pensioners and
   indigents). Among those in the exemptions category 735 thousand, or 2.1 percent, were
   indigents, well above the 0.5 percent target. Also, funding for exemptions has increased.
   The N H I S provided $139 billion in funding for the exemption o f fees charged from
   indigents, while the 2006 budget provided $43 billion for general exemptions and
    exemptions from fees for maternal delivery, with H P C fbnds proving $30 billion for
   maternal delivery exemptions, and the MoH budget providing $13 billion for general
    exemptions. These combined allocations exceeds therefore the $26 billion allocated in2004.

0   There continues to be an increase in the utilization of health services, as measuredby
    the trend in supervised deliveries. The results at the regional level are very uneven,
    though. There was a modest increase inthe rate o f supervised deliveries at the national level
    that reflect improvements primarily in the deprived regions (Central, Northern, Upper East
    andUpper West), where the programs for exceptions o f fees for maternal delivery were first
    implemented.     The Brong Ahafo and the Volta regions follow next, with measured
    improvements. The improvements in the deprived regions contrast sharply, however, with
    declines inthe rate of supervised maternal deliveries in some o f the most affluent regions o f
    the country, such as the Western, Greater Accra and Ashanti regions (Table 20).

92.     The monitorableactions under the healthprogramsupported by PRSC-5 include the
following:

                                        - 59 -

 Scaling up health spending to accelerate progress toward the MDGs by ensuring
 that: (i)the Government of Ghana allocation to the health sector is increased to
  compensate for the reduction in donor contribution to the health fund; (ii) the
  increase in the budget execution rate raises (a) the total non-salary health budget,
  and (b) the district level allocations. The purpose o f these actions are to ensure that
  Ghana continues increasing public expenditure on health toward the Abuja target o f 15
  percent o f GDP, and that the transition o f health funding from the budget o f the Ministry
  o f Health to the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) entails neither a reduction in
  the overall fimdingo fthe health sector, nor the a re-prioritization away from basic health
  services. The increase in the budget execution rate, especially at the level o f service
  delivery units in districts and sub-districts, should also guarantee greater alignment
  between budgetcommitments and actual spending.

0 Sustaining coverage and increasingthe quality of health services by (i)providing
  incentive packages to health workers; (ii)scaling up the training of middle level
  health personnel (Le. medical assistants, midwives and health assistants); and (iii)
  implementing the decentralizationof human resource management. These actions
  build on the work on human resource reforms initiated under the program supported by
  the MDBS-OSPRSC-4 and MDBS-04PRSC-3, with the objective o f increasing the
  qualification o f health care professionals and o f improving the human resource
  management in the health sector. Ultimately, these actions should lead to increase
  quality and access to health services in the deprived regions by raising the number of
  staff in deprived areas and ensuring the retention o f existing staff. The ratio of nurses
  and doctors per population i s significantly lower inthe deprived regions because o f lack
  o f adequate financial resources to pay incentives for staff to remain or move to these
  areas. The lack o f staff means that, at times, health facilities cannot operate at full
  capacity, reducing access to health services.

0 Accelerating and sustaining the implementationof the National Health Insurance
  Scheme (NHIS), with an aim of further raising the registration rate of the
  population by end-2006. These actions aim at continuing to broaden the access to
  health services by further extending population coverage under the National Health
  Insurance Scheme, which should lead to improved health outcomes. The experience o f
  2003-04 provides confidence that actions aimed at removing financial barriers in the
  access to health services can yield the positive results. While the results o f the 2003
  CWIQ survey showed that only 16 to 32 percent o f maternal deliveries in the three
  northern regions were conducted at either a hospital or maternity, recent information
  indicates that the proportion o f supervised deliveries i s rising, especially in the Upper
  West region, reaching rates averaging just over 50 percent.

0 Increasing the access to reproductive health services with an aim of further
  broadeningthe coverage of supervisedmaternaldeliveriesby end-2006.

  Promotinghealth and nutritionby (i)        strengtheningthe health promotion andnutrition
  components o f the in the curricula o f health training institutions; and (ii)  targeting the
  health o f mothers and infants as part o f the free anti-natal care provided through the
  national health system.

93.    Expected Outcomes. By the end o f the o f the four year program, it is expected that
Ghana will have made some progress toward reaching the health-related MDGsby 2015 (Table
21). Measuring progress will need to be balanced, however, against the slow improvement, and,
insome cases worsening, inhealthindicators reportedbetweenthe 1997 and 2003 Demographic
and Health Surveys (DHS).

94.     In the absence of resultsfromthe nextDemographic and Health Survey (DHS), the
expected outcomes will be measured by several intermediate indicators linked to the
increase utilization of health services in deprivedregions. These include: (i)    the increase in
supervised deliveries from 49 percent in2002 to 65 percent by 2009; (ii) decrease inthe ratio
                                                                          the
o fpopulation per nurse inthe four deprived regions from 2,000: 1in2002 to 1,500: 1in2006; and
(iii) decreaseintheratioofpopulationperdoctorinthefourdeprivedregionsdecreasedfrom
     the
20,000: 1in 2002 to 16,500: 1 in2006. Inaddition, it is expected that there would be an increase
inthe percent of budget allocations for goods, services and investment (items 2, 3 and 4 inthe
budget) to deprived districts.

Malaria

95.     Malaria remains the leadingcause of morbidity in Ghana, accountingfor about 40
percent of outpatient attendance, and a leading cause of death, especially among children
under five years of age and pregnant women. Malaria is also more than a health problem
because it adversely affects productivity throughout the economy, leading to lost workdays due
to illness and taxing households and medical facilities with the cost o f treatment. To address
these problems, the GPRS I1revisited the ongoing Roll Back Malaria (RBM)strategy outlined in
2000 by the Ministry o f Health, amplifying its concerns and strengthening its interventions
through: :

     0  Improved Case Management. Primary interventions include ensuring early case
        recognition, delivering appropriate response and improving access to services.

     0  EnhancedMultiplePreventions. Preventative strategies include: promoting the use o f
        insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs), especially by children and pregnant women;
        encouraging drainage, mosquito proofing and general sanitation; promoting limited
         application o f indoor and outdoor residual spraying; andpromoting chemoprophylaxis.

                                               - 61 -



      0   Improved Partnerships. The strategy to achieve this objective is to create and sustain
          partnerships for malaria control through close collaboration between departments and
          programs in the health sector; partnership between government sectors and NGOs, the
          private sector, communities andprivate healers.

      0   FocusedResearch. The objective of this component is to ensure that efforts to roll back
          malaria are supported and well informed by research information to guide policy
          decisions and monitor progress and outcomes o f key interventions. The objective will be
          achieve by increasing the availability o f h d s for research; a focusing the research
          agenda, with improved dissemination and utilization o f results; and enhancing the
          capacity for research.

  96.     These interventions are already yielding positiveresults, with a measurable decline
  since 2002 inunder-fivemortalitydue to malaria(Figure 13). The fatality rate due to malaria
  for children under-five has declined from around 3.7 percent in 2002 to 2.4 percent in 2005.
  These results appear due to actions on several fronts, including the increase inthe percentage of
  children sleeping under insecticidetreated bednets, which rose from below 10percent in2002 to
  just under 25 percent in2005 (Figure 14).

97.    To sustain this progress, the program for malaria control supported by PRSC-5
focuses on raising the share of children under five and pregnant women sleeping under
insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs).

98.    Expected Outcomes. Bythe end o f the four-year second PRSC series, Ghana expects to
have further increased the share o f children under-five and pregnant women sleeping under
ITNs.

HIWAIDS

99.     The main challenge facing the Ghanaian authorities in dealing with the spread of
the HIV/AIDS pandemic is keeping the country's relatively low prevalence rate, giving
attention to prevention, as well as care and support to persons living with and affected by
HIV/AIDS. The issues to be considered are as follows:

    0   Prevalence. Ghana has currently one of the lowest prevalence rates for HIV/AIDS
        in Africa, with the prevalence remaining relatively stable over the past decade at
        around 3 percent.       The 2005 sentinel survey estimates prevalence among pregnant
        women attending antenatal clinics at 3.1 percent, down from 3.6 percent in 2003, with
        prevalence ranging from 0.4 percent to 7.4 percent. This median prevalence o f 3.1
        percent recorded for 2005 does not necessarily represent an overall decline o f HIV
        infection, although it may be an early sign o f an epidemic slowdown.            There are,
        however, six cities where the infection rate i s greater than five percent, with the city o f
        Koforidua now having a prevalence rate o f 8.5 percent - a cause for much concern. As a
        result, the Ghana A D S Commission (GAC) estimates that nationally, sero-prevalence
        could rise from current rates to somewhere in the range o f 4 to 9 percent by 2014,
        depending on the efficiency o f control measures. The potential impact on the economy
        and society makes HIV/AIDS, therefore, an important issue the Government o f Ghana
        will face inimplementingits poverty reduction strategy.

                                                - 63 -

   0    Prevention. Ghana's number one challenge in keeping low levels of HIV/AIDS
        prevalence is ensuringeffective preventive campaigns. Although the evidence points
        to a moderateddecline inHIV-prevalence inGhana duringthe past few years, most o f the
        neighboring countries have experienced an increase and this increase could spillover to
        Ghana. Assessing the effectiveness o f the current preventive effort will require constant
        monitoring, measuring whether high-risk groups are being targeted, and whether the
        public campaigns and counseling are being effective inchanging sexual behavior.

100.    To meet these challenges, the program for reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS has
focused on acceleratingthe implementationof interventionsaimed at high-riskgroups and
areas with highprevalence,scalingupthe providingof anti-retroviralcombinationtherapy
(ART) for people with advanced HIV, and strengthening the monitoring framework to
guide implementation. Progress has been satisfactory, with ART available at five hospitals
(Korle-buyKomfo-hokye, Atua, Koforidua, and St. Martin), and training conducted in all the
regions.    Meanwhile, the National M&E indicators have been developed, assisting in the
implementation o f the government's strategy. Continuous DP support is envisioned for these
activities, with a HIV/AIDS partnership forum having reviewed and proposed changes to the
Ghana AIDS Commission's Program o f Work (POW) for the remainder o f 2006 and 2007 on
April 14 and 15.

101.     The monitorable actions under the HIV/AIDS program supported by PRSC-5 are
centered on continuing scaling up the provision o f antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) for
people with advanced HIV, aiming at broadening treatment coverage, and the availability o f
ART.

102.     ExpectedOutcomes. Bythe end o fthe four-year second PRSC series, Ghana expects to
maintain the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women, aged 15-24, below the five percent
benchmark.


Social protection

 103.    The Ghanaian social protectionstructureremainshighly fragmented, spread across
multiple governmentprograms and centeredon ethnic, religious and occupational groups.
Also, while there i s a strong sense o f solidarity at the local level, the communal social safety nets
are being tested by increased urbanization and the problems that result from that, such as: (i)
open unemployment, including high rates o f youth unemployment; (ii)HIV/AIDS; (iii)              street
children; and (iv) child malnutrition.

 104.    The Government of Ghana social protection program supported by MDBS-
05/PRSC-4 centers on the integrationof the social protectionstrategy in the GPRS 11,and
the development of a NationalYouth Policy. These steps aim at guidinggovernment inbetter
targeting interventions. The social protection strategy was completed in 2005 and integrated in
the GPRS 11. It places emphasis on: (i) expansion o f health insurance and preventive health
                                            the
programs; (ii)  the continuation o f capitation grants in education; and (iii) up school
                                                                                   scaling
 feeding and child nutrition programs. These elements o f the strategy are now being costed and
 are expected to be validated by the relevant MDAs. Inthe meantime, the National Youth Study

                                               - 64 -

has been drafted and i s beingprepared to be submitted to Cabinet. The attention given to youth
development reflects the authorities understanding that the youth represent a valuable asset for
economic growth and poverty reduction. Adolescence, defined as the transition period between
childhood and adulthood, i s the stage at which the individual develops physically and acquires
skills that enhances his or her productivity during adulthood. Increased risks to social vices
during the formative years may lead to behaviors that impede human and social capital
investments that are critical for producing individuals who are well prepared for the challenges
o f adulthood.

105.     Expected outcome. Ghana is expected to have improved the targeting of resources

106.     Broadening access to water and sanitation is the most important infrastructure
investmentfor achievingthe millenniumdevelopmentgoals (MDGs). There is a direct link
between access to safe water and safe sanitation and health outcomes. The MDGs call, therefore,
for halving the world's population without access to improved water by the year 2015, and
without sanitation by 2020, using 1990 as the base year. In the case o f Ghana, this means that
about 6 million more people need to gain access to water and 9 million to sanitation. The
challenges in reaching the MDG targets are three fold: (i)    increasing the financing available to
the water and sanitation sector, so as to make possible the eight-fold increase in current annual
investments; (ii) scaling up the institutional capacity inthe sector, rangingfrom greater clarity in
institutional responsibility to more ordinary issues such as contractor's response to the
availability o f technical staff at the district level; and (iii) tackling issues o f sustainability,
including the approval and implementation of the National Water policy, especially in rural
areas. Inaddition, there i s the need to resolve the solvency problems o f the utility companies,
which are currently unable to reach solvency levels because of their inability to set tariffs at cost
recovery levels.

 107.    T o address these challenges, the programto increase access to safe and sustainable
water and sanitation coverage supported by MDBS-OYPRSC-4 centers on strengthening
planning and coordination, aiming at increasinginvestment that will allow broadeningof
 access. Action included: (i) preparation o f the Community Water and Sanitation Agency
                                the
 (CWSA) Strategic Investment plan (SIP) for the 2005-2015 period; and (ii)    the preparationo f the
medium term implementation plan for rural water. Progress thus far is limited to the Strategic
 InvestmentPlan (SIP), which was completed inAugust 2005. The SIP sets a target o f reaching
 85 percent nation-wide coverage in access to water by 2015, and to achieve this target attempts
 to identify the neededsources o f funding. The breakdown of funding sources inthe document i s
 as follows: development partners, 60 percent; central government, 30 percent; local governments
 and communities, 5 percent each. The mediumterm implementation plan for rural water is still
 under elaboration, however, and i s expected to include a monitoring and evaluation framework
 that sets out results and identifies accountability for reaching these results. The completion o f
 the mediumterm implementationplani s expected by the end o f the second quarter o f 2006.

 new investments during the first two years of implementationof the GPRS I(Table 22).
 For instance, the construction o f new boreholes and the completion o f small town pipe systems
 were, respectively, 21 and 50 percent lower in2005, markinga slowdown ininvestments.

 109.    The monitorable actions under the water and sanitation program supported by

IPRSC-5 center on:

         Completingthe mediumterm implementationplan for ruralwater, and updating the
         medium term implementation plan for urban water, with a view to clarify roles and
         responsibilities for the delivery o f water and sanitation.        These actions are important
         because scaling up access to safe water and sanitation can only be done effectively once
         implementation plans are completed and a framework o f decentralized water and
         sanitation delivery is defined. The District Assemblies understand better the emerging
         needs of the population and should be allowed to plan adequately for the needed
         investments using the District Water and Sanitation Plan mechanism (which i s part o f
         their overall District Development Plans). These actions, coupledwith the strengthening
         o f strong fiduciary arrangements and the enhancement o f the accountability for results
         framework, should allow greater clarity in investment plans, ensure clear and transparent
         rules for funding the water and sanitation sector, and mobilize additional external
         funding.

         Ensuringthe financial sustainability of the water sector by implementation the 2005
         tariffreview andincreasing controls over borrowing for urbanwater facilities.


     0   Clarifying the institutional,legal and policy framework for sanitation. The delivery
         of sanitation services continues to lag behindwater supply inboth urban and rural areas.
         As more water supply infrastructure is financed, a clear strategy to keep pace with the
         sanitation requirements i s also needed. This i s important to maximize the healthbenefits
         of water interventions (including meeting the obvious demand for safe disposal of ever
         increasing volumes o fwastewater).

  110.   Expected outcomes. By the end of the proposed four-year PRSC program, Ghana is
  expected to have a more robust policy framework for water resource management andutilization,

                                                      - 66 -

contributing to enabling the Government o f Ghana to rationalize sector investments to achieve
accelerated and sustainable coverage for water supply and sanitation. Also, it i s expected that
the policy framework will result in improved donor coordination and sector planning, further
deepening the decentralization of service delivery.


    E.3.      ImprovingGovernance andPublic Sector Management

111. The GPRS I1 underscores the importance of improving governance and public
sector managementfor the achievement of the government's growthand poverty reduction
objectives.       It identifies actions aimed at improving the efficiency, transparency and
accountability o f government operations, and at refocusing public sector reforms by
strengthening       governance,        deepening decentralization,            modernizing       public      financial
management, and improving public sector management.                         While these reforms should yield
considerable results within the next few years, sustained efforts are needed in four main areas:

    0    Improvingpublicsector performance. Most o fthe progress inthe public sector reform
         agenda in 2005 consisted o f preparing and setting up the institutional arrangements for
         the new public sector reform strategy. These steps included the creation o f the Ministry
         for Public Sector Reform, the submission o f the Subvented Agencies Reform Act to
         Parliament, and the launching o f a broad reach out program to communicate and ensure
         the buy in o f stakeholders.             Although the progress so far reflects government's
          commitment to move ahead with an agenda for improved public sector performance, the
         next stage needs to build on these steps to deliver the expected policy outcomes. Areas
         that need to receive particular attention include: (i)           revising the incentive system within
          the public sector to enable government to attract and retain skilled staff;" (ii)               improving
          service delivery, particularly at decentralized level; and (iii)              strengthening wage bill
          management and control. Indeed, with wages and salaries accounting for 8.9 percent o f
          GDP -the equivalent to more than one third o f government revenues (excluding grants),
          this is the fastest growing expenditure iteminthe budget.

     0    Modernizingpublic financial management. Over the last three years, the government
          o f Ghana has revamped its public financial management structure, with the strengthening
          o f the Controller and Accountant General Department (CAGD) at the Ministryo f Finance
          and Economic Planning, and the establishment o f new institutions envisioned inthe law
          with responsibility for implementing legislation approved in 2003 and 2004 - the
          Financial Administration Act (FAA), and the Financial Administration Regulations
          (FAR), the Public Procurement Act (PPA), and the Internal Audit Agency Act (IAAA).
          The challenges for 2006 are completing ongoing reforms in the CAGD, such as the



 25 The public sector promotion criteria reflects primarily service tenure rather than merit, meaning that newly hired,
 qualified staff may earn a fraction o f the wages paid to much less qualified staff with longer service tenure.
 Although changes were made in 2003 to allow recruitment of professionals outside the civil service for top public
 administration positions, increasing the weight given the professional competency in the selection process, only 7
 top civil service positions were filled using this new system. While pay adequacy is low, the wage bill continues
 accounting for a large share o f public expenditure (29%), with problems in managing the wage bill reflecting
 weaknesses inthe current payroll control systems and significant overstaffing.

                                            - 67 -

      operationalizing the Budget and Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS) and
      the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database (IPPD II), well as ensuring that the
                                                                    as
      Public Procurement Board (PPB) and the Internal Audit Agency (IAA) operate as
      planned. Key steps inmeeting these challenges are: (i)    ensuring fimding for the PPB and
      the IAA, recruiting and re-assigning staff, and building the capacity within these
      institutions. In addition, attention needs to be given to: (i)  continuing to broaden the
      comprehensiveness o f public accounts, with better accounting o f flows from internally
      generated funds (IGF) and donor funded project funding; (ii)assisting the Public
      Accounts Committee in Parliament to fulfill its functions and to ensure its
      recommendations are implemented; and (iii)    strengthening the accountability regime for
      State Owned Enterprises and other parastatal entities.

   0  Strengthening governance institutions. Notwithstanding Ghana's favorable ranking in
      Transparency's International Corruption Perception Index (behind only Mauritius,
      Botswana and Namibia), the government continues attaching importance to further
      progress in strengthening governance institutions.      The challenges ahead include (i)
      buildingthe capacity and adequately funding the existing government institutions (e.g.,
      Serious Fraud Office, Office o f Accountability, the Commission on HumanRights and
      the Administration o f Justice), so that they can fulfill their mandates; (ii)strengthening
      the performance and accountability o f the judicial system; and (iii)broadening the
      instances o f accountability by institutionalizing the access to government-related
      information with the passing and implementation o f the Freedom o f Information and
      Whistle Blower bills.

   0  Enhancing the capacity to monitor and evaluate the policy agenda. The work o f the
      Central Management Agencies, including the National Development PlanningCommittee
      (NDPC), as well as the activities o f the regional and district planning departments have
      provided Ghana with the main elements to carry out monitoring and evaluation o f the
      GPRS 11. The challenges ahead include strengthening the statistical and administrative
      database, continuing work towards establishing credible baseline data for targets and
      monitorable indicators. It also includes continuing andbroadening NDPC's current work
      program with the preparation o f annual progress reports, and the strengthening o f the
      links between regional and district planning programs and the GPRS. The latter would
      contribute towards enhancing the feedback provided by M&E initiatives to policy
      makers.

E.3.1 Governance,Decentralization and Public Sector Reform

Governance

112.  The program for strengthening governance supported under MDBS-OWPRSC-4
centers on continuing ongoing efforts aimed at strengthening the anti-corruption
framework. Specific actions included:

   0  Indexing all anti-corruption legislation, providing a single source of legal reference
       on relevant laws, and ratifying international anti-corruption conventions.            The
      Attorney-General's Office completed the indexation of all anti-corruption legislation

                                                      - 68 -

        on April 18, 2006. Parliament ratified the African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption
        Conventions and UNAnti-Corruption Convention on December 14,2005, taking the
        first step toward ensuring a definition o f corruption to be reflected in the law that i s
        consistent with international conventions; and

        Submittingthe Freedom of Information Billto Parliament, with the Billbeingcurrently
        beingreviewedby Cabinet.

113.    Another important action aimed at strengthening the governance - the Africa Peer
Review Mechanism (APRM)26- was also completed during this time. The Ghana Country
Review report finalized and submitted in2005, with Ghana becoming one o f the first countries to
adopt this instrument o f voluntarily self-monitoring mechanism for member countries o f the
African Union. The primary purpose o f the APRM i s to foster the adoption o fpolicies, standards
and practices that lead to political stability, economic growth, sustainable development and
accelerated sub-regional and continental integration through sharing o f experiences and
reinforcement o f successful andbest practice.


Decentralization

114.    The program for implementing the government's framework for decentralized delivery
of local public services supported by MDBS-OS/PRSC-4 centers on: (i)                    designing a framework
detailing the mechanisms for District Development Funding (DDF), so that all funds for local
government investments, including donor funds, follow harmonized guidelines; (ii)                      designing a
framework for a harmonized capacity building program for local governments, rationalizing
the multiplicity of capacity building projects/programs and ensuring better targeting o f these
funds; (iii) preparing composite budget guidelines for the 2007 Budget, so as to facilitate the
preparation o f composite budgets by district assemblies; (iv) agreeing on modalities and
initiating development o f framework governing intergovernmentalfiscal relations, clarifying
expenditure responsibilities and revenue assignments; and (v) designing and validating
organizational structure detailing institutional relationships and core functions of the Local
Government Service at the Local Service Secretariat, the Regional Coordinating Council
(RCC) and MMDA levels.

115.    The implementing the decentralizationprogram is proceeding as scheduled:

        The review of the local government investment funding was completed in mid-2005,
        andthe DDF design is now inprogress27-the framework is expected to be completedby
        mid-2006;




26Thisbody set up in2004 and is comprised o f independent eminent persons and will lay the foundation for opening
u Ghana's governance mechanisms to scrutiny at the highest levels within the context o fNEPAD.
"The terms o freference for this work identifies the following activities: (i)review o fthe existing investment
                                                                            a
funding modalities to DAs, including internalrevenue mobilization; (ii) subsequent design o f a DDF modality;

          The review o f the local government capacity building was completed in September
          2005, with proposed performance indicators covering areas ranging from budgeting and
          accounting to organizational           structure      and management.            A Functional and
          Organizational Assessment Tool (FOAT) i s currently at final field-testing stage and
          should provide elements to monitor progress inthese areas;

    0     The draft composite budget guidelines were preparedjointly by MoFEP and MLGRD,
          with a meetingto discuss the draft among central, regional and district administrations
          staff involved in the implementation o f the guidelines held in November 2005. These
          guidelines are expected to be included in the 2007 budget circular to be issued in June
          2005;28

          The work on developing a framework governing intergovernmental fiscal relations
          began already, with the preparation o f .three technical working papers for a seminar held
          inDecember 2005, andthe seminarproceedings expectedto bepublishedsoon.

          The core functions o f the Local Government Service at the Secretariat, the Regional
          Coordinating Council (RCC) and the Metropolitan, Municipal and District
          Assembly levels are being further defined, with a three year strategic plan finalized,
          leading, inter alia, to the piloting o f the consolidation o f three MLGRD departments
          (Community Development, Births & Death Registry, and Parks & Gardens), and further
          work on the preparation o f schemes and conditions for Local Government Services.

Public Sector Reform

116.      The program for implementing a refocused a public sector reform aims at
improving the service delivery capacity o f the civil and public service. The policy actions o f
the program that are supported by MDBS-OYPRSC-4 include: (i)                    beginning implementation o f a
workplan for appointment and remuneration o f senior civil servants (Chief Directors and
Directors); (ii)    initiating the implementation o f proposals for restructuring selected Central
Management Agencies; (iii)         re-launching service delivery improvement charters in20 selected
MDAs and in 10 districts; and (iv) beginning implementations of reforms for selected
subvented agencies preparing the re-categorizationo f subvented agencies.

117.      The implementation of the agenda for refocused public sector is in its initial stages,
with the Subvented Agencies Reform Act having recently been approved by Parliament,
and several reforms identified. Actions already completed include the following:

     0    The comprehensive workplan for the remuneration o f senior civil servants was
          completed at end-2005, and is now awaiting funding definition;




28This work complements work begun already with the 2006 budget circular, which had requested that all
decentralized ministries disaggregate their budget proposals into the various levels of administration (regional and
district), allowing the Government to identify the fiscal resources fiom the central government that are utilizedat the
district level.

                                             - 70 -

       The reforms in the Central Management Agencies, such as the State Enterprise
       Commission and the Public Service Commission have also been outlined and are
       awaiting finding definition;

   0   Inthe meantime, twenty Client Service Units (CSU) had already been re-vitalized,
       with 16 delivery improvement charters updated, and 3 more under review for re-printing.
       There has been a noticeable improvement in services, measured by shorter turnaround
       times, at the Passport Office, the Driver Vehicle Licensing Authority, and the Business
       Registration Office at the Register General Department;

   0   The Subvented Agencies Reform Act was approved by Parliament on March 3,
       2006. The reforms o f Subvented agencies that have been identified include: (i)  moving
       the Du Bois Centre towards self financing; (ii)   assisting GRATIS with the transfer o f
       assets and registration o f title to enable commercialization; (iii)   beginning the re-
       engineering o f the Ghana News Agency (GNA), MDPI, and the Ghana Broadcasting
       Corporation (GBC); (iv) conducting an assessment o f the reform initiatives at GIMPA
       and GUP to determine whether objectives have beenmet; and (v) completing the reforms
       at the Forestry Commission with an agreement on retrenchment o f staff. The reforms in
       GCB are among the most advanced with the upgrading o f equipment and the sourcing o f
       fimdingfor firther reforms, including retrenchment o f staff.

E.3.2 Public Financial Management

118.   The programfor strengtheningpublicfinancialmanagementfocuses on: (i)             revising
and updatingthe PFMreformframework;(ii)            expandingthe debt register to cover all loans
and grant agreements, with information updated quarterly; (iii)   including HIPC funds in the
budget formulation process,with allocations by MDAs inthe budget proposal; (iv) ensuring
that the Internal Audit Agency and Internal Audit Units of key MDAs (Finance and
Economic Planning, Education,Health, Roads and Transport, and Local Government and
Rural Development) is fully operational, as provided in the IAA act; (v) establishing the
Public Procurement Entities in MDAs, Subvented Agencies, Statutory Funds, and all
Municipalities, Metropolitan areas and 50% of the Districts Assemblies, with operational
Entity Tender Committees; (v) ensuring that the provisions of the Public ProcurementAct
are fully implementedand appliedto headquarters and regional offices o f key M D A s (Finance
and Economic Planning, Education, Health, Roads and Transport, and Local Government and
Rural Development), deepening the scope o f application o f the new procurement law; (vi)
improving, compared to 2004, the budget deviation index for the 2005 poverty related
expenditures, weighted by the budget share of each main area; (vii) deepening payroll
management and control by having the computerized payroll system online and fully
operational, by giving MDAs access to salary payment reports on a monthly basis, and using
MDA responses to progressively improve accuracy o f pay records; (viii) ensuring that the
government's computerizedfinancial and accountingsystem(BPEMS) is operationalinthe
headquarter offices of the ministries of Finance and Economic Planning, Education,
Health, Roads and Transport, and Local Government and Rural Development, with
BPEMS core finctionalities (general ledger, purchase order and accounts payable) being utilized
on-line, meaning that all the financial transactions for these entities are processed on-line and

                                                    - 71 -

reports are regularly produced for monitoring purposes; (ix) ensuringthat the Auditor-General
submits 2004 auditedaccounts for the ConsolidatedFundandMDAsto Parliament.

119.   Progress in implementing the program for strengthening public financial
management has been broadly satisfactory, with the following actions having been taken
toward implementingthe program supported by MDBS-OYPRSC-4:


   0   An updated Short and Medium Term Action Plan (SMTAP) for Public Financial
       Management (PFM) was completed, with a draft presented and discussed with the
       Development Partners on January 27,2006. The short term focus o f the action plan i s on
       the strengthening o f CAGD, with the implementation o f BPEMS and IPPD 11, as well as
        the decentralization o f treasuries to MDAs. The SMTAP is a valuable document,
       providing an overview o f the multifaceted PFM reforms underway. There i s a full listing
        o f steps to be taken to fully implement the reforms, as well as a clear assignment of
       primaryresponsibilities and supporting roles;


   0    The debt register has been expanded to include information on all loans and grant
        agreements. This information was presented in the 2006 budget proposal, and will be
        reported inthe quarterly budgetprogress reports to Cabinet.

   0    The HIPC funds were included in the 2006 budget submission, with allocation by
        MDAs, allowing Parliament to vote on H P C allocation simultaneously with funding
        from the consolidated funds.

   0    The Internal Audit Agency (IAA) is operational, with Internal Audit Units (IAUs)
        establishedandfunctioningin23 out of the 27 MDAs,~'as well as in6 MMDAs. The
        Director General o f the Internal Audit Agency was appointedby the President on October
        2005, with his appointment followed by the appointment o f 9 Audit manager^.^' At the
        end o f the third quarter o f 2005, audit reports were completed for 9 Ministries, 9
        Department and Agencies, and 2 MMDAs, and a new and more complete set o f audit
        reports i s expected at end-March.            Also, the IAA 2006 budget was approved and
        consultants engaged to develop internal audit regulations, standards, manuals and
        programs, as requiredunder the IAA act.

   0    Good progress has been made in establishing public procurement entities inMDAs,
        Subvented Agencies, Statutory Bodies, and MDDAs. The overall coverage o f Entity
        Tender Committees.(ETCs) stood at 56 percent at February 20, 2006, with almost 100
        percent coverage at the MDA level, and over 50 percent coverage at the MMDA level.
        The apparent delays insettingup the public procurement entities at the level o f subvented



29The four MDAs that have not yet established IAUs are the Ministry o f Public Sector Reform, the Ministry o f
Women and Children's Affairs, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, and the Ministry for Government Machinery,
which are recently established M D A s and in the meantime relying o n the support from IAUs in more established
MDAs.

        agencies and statutory bodies were due to misunderstandings about which entities were
        classified as budget originators and, therefore, were required to set up these entities.
        Examples were correction o f this misunderstanding should yield a quick turn around o f
        the situation include the tertiary institutions and the hospitals & health institutions. A
        detailed breakdown o f progress in setting up Entity Tender Committees and Tender
        Review Boards i s provided inTable 23 below.

        Progress has also been made in meeting the provisions of the Public Procurement
        Act in the headquarters and regional offices of key MDAs (Finance and Economic
        Planning, Education, Health, Roads and Transport, and Local Government and
        RuralDevelopment). A joint assessmentby teams from the Government o f Ghana and
        Government o f Switzerland measured favourably the institutional framework and
        capacity o f public procurement in Ghana, scoring a 49 percent achievement based on a
        sample of 100procurement entities. This assessment also estimated that about 40 percent
        of contracts above the threshold are currently awarded on the basis of competitive
        bidding, with entities using less competitive procurement methods following the
        requirementso f the new act by seekingauthorization from the Public ProcurementBoard
        (PPB) for these requests. The decisions by the PPB were found to be made on the basis
        o f the criteria defined in the new act. The Public Procurement Board i s developing a
        software program (to be completed by end-March 2006) that will assist entities in
        preparing and updating procurement plans, and a contract has been awarded for
        consultants to produced a draft procurement regulations, with manuals and standard
        tender documents. Inthe meantime, the Ministries o f Finance and Economic Planning,
        Education, Health, and Road Transport have either finalized, or are about to finalize their
        procurementplans.

   0    The budget deviation index for poverty related expenditures, weighted by main
        expenditure area, improved further in 2005, declining to 16.2 percent, down from 19
        percent in2004 and 21 percent in2003.


    0   A new computerizedIntegratedPersonneland PayrollDatabase(IPPD-2) system is
        currently being established, allowing MDAs to make changes to personnel and
        payroll records. This new system is gradually replacing the existing Integrated Payroll
        and Personnel Database (IPPD-l), providing a more reliable system with upgraded
        software and supporting hard~are.~'The two systems are currently running in parallel,
        with the data from IPPD-1having been replicated in IPPD-2. The government has also
        taken steps to develop a computerized personnel and payroll database for all subvented
        agencies, totaling 57.5 thousand employees, with data for the 18 largest subvented
        agencies having already been uploaded onto IPPD-2. The transition from IPPD-1 to
        IPPD-2 i s providing an opportunity to check personnel records for the around 350
        thousand public employees on the payroll, and there are about 24,000 public employees

and control, focusing initially on stabilizing the existing payroll and personnel database system (IPPD-1) by
beginning the migration o f the software for the payroll database system to new hardware, capable o f better
supporting the system set up. IPPD-1, i s old andunreliable, however, leading to delays inprocessing the payroll.

     0    The operationalizationof the government's computerizedfinancial and accounting
          system (BPEMS) has been completed at the Ministry of Finance and Economic
          Planning/Controller and Accountant General Department and the Ministry of
          Health, with core fbnctionalities (general ledger, purchase order and accounts payable)
          available for processing and reporting transactions o f personnel and administrative
          expenditures. While the coverage o f the system was expected to also encompass the
          ministrieso fEducation, Road Transport, and Local Government and Rural Development,
          there were delays in connecting these ministries to the fiber optic network. Nevertheless
          since the 2006 budget ceilings for personnel and administrative expenditures have already
          beenuploadedonto the system, these ministriesare expected to be processing these same
          transactions (warrants, purchasing orders and accounts payable) for personnel and
          administrative expenditureby mid-2006.


     0    The 2004 audited accounts for the MDAs were completed and submitted to

E.3.3. Monitoring and Evaluation

120.   The monitoring and evaluation program supported by MDBS-OSIPRSC-4 focused
on continuingto strengthenM&E capacityandM&E coordinationat the national,regional
and district levels and at improving access to information on M&E. The former is being
achieved through: (i) establishment o fthe M&Etechnical committees; (ii) approval o f the
                      the                                                     the
Action Plans for NDPC, GSS and MoFEP; and (iii)        the establishment o f district-based M&E
systems and the adoption o f common M&E tools, while the latter will be reflected by having the
GPRS 11,the 2004 APR, the 2003 CWIQ and the completedPSIAs on the websites o fNDPC and
GSS. Progress has beenmoderately satisfactory andis reported as follows:

    0  The M&E policy level committeefor the NDPC, GSS, MoFEP and the Office of the

   A.   PRIORACTIONSAND TRIGGERS

132.   Prior actions for PRSC-4. The Government of Ghana has completedthe following
actionsin implementingitsreformagenda.

133.   Topromote growth, incomes, and employment:

     0   Ensured that ECG accounts receivable from MDAs and the GWCL are settled
         within90 days; and
         Furtherreducedthe time requiredfor registeringbusinesses.

134.   To enable the disadvantaged to access basic educational and health services:

     0   Extended capitation grants to all pupils attending public primary and junior
         secondary schools and eliminate all government and district controlled fees for
          all publicprimaryandjunior secondary schools; and

     0   Registeredthe indigents at the District-wide Mutual Health Insurance Schemes
          (DMHIS) and have the NationalHealth InsuranceCouncil (NHIC) transfer the
         premiumsubsidy to districtschemes.

135.   Toimprove governance andpublic expenditure management:


     0    Ratified the United Nations' and the African Union's conventions on anti-
          corruption andcompletedthe indexationof all anti-corruptionlegislation;

     0    Included HIPC funds in the budget formulation process, with allocations by
          MDAsinthe budgetproposal;

      0   Ensuredthat the provisionsof the PublicProcurementAct are fully implemented
          and applied to headquarters and regional offices of key MDAs (MoFEP, MoE,
          MoH,MLGRD, andMRT);and

      0   Made operational government's computerized financial and accounting system
          (BPEMS) at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning/Controller and
          Accountant General Department and at the Ministry of Health, with the core
          functionalities (general ledger, purchase order and accounts payable) available
          for processing and reporting transactions for personnel and administrative
          expenditures.


136.   PRSC-5 triggers.      As indicated in section IV E above, in 2007, the MDBS
disbursements by the bilateral and the EU will be underpinned once again by the actions taken
during 2005 and based on an assessment carried out in April 2006. The decision to make two
disbursements on the basis of one assessment aims at allowing a transition to a new MDBS
schedule that will ensure greater predictability of budget support. Under this new proposed
schedule, the DPs will disburse their budget support based on triggers defined two years in

                                            - 79 -

advance and assessed on the year prior to disbursing, assuming that the assessment is positive.
This new schedule aims at allowing the DPs to inform the Government of Ghana about the
amount provided through their budgetary support before the budget proposal is submitted to
Parliament.

137. The alignment with the new MDBS schedule requires that the Bank's PRSC-4
define a separate set of triggers to underpinthe PRSC-5 disbursement and, as a result, a
separate assessment, likely in late 2006-early 2007. In case the assessment is positive, it
would leadto a PRSC-5 Boardand a disbursementsometime duringthe first 4 months of 2007.
Inthe meantime,the Bank andthe other MDBSpartnerswill duringthe course of 2006 jointly
identify and agree with the Government on the triggers that will underpin the MDBS

will then be jointly assessed later in 2007, informing a decision on the MDBS disbursements
supportingGhana's 2008 budget, includinga Boarddecisionon a proposedPRSC-6.

138. The Bank-only triggers (identified in bold letter in the PAF) that will inform the
decisionas to whether IDA will proceedwith the preparationof PRSC-5 are the following:

139. Toaccelerateprivate sector-led growth:

   a   Continue to increase the share of SSNIT investment assets managedby regulated
       privatefinancialinstitutions.

    a  Earmark in the upcoming 2006 supplementary budget the funds necessary to

    a  Scale up health spending to accelerate progress toward the MDGs by ensuring: (i)
       that the Government of Ghana allocation to the health sector is increased to
       compensate for the reduction in donor contribution to the health fund; (ii) the
       increase in the budget execution rate of (a) total non-salaryhealth budget, and (b)

141.    To improve governance andpublic expenditure management:


     0   Broaden the coverage of the CAGD reports to include, in addition to information
         on the execution of the Consolidated Fund, revenue and expenditure information
         on externally-financed projects and retained IGFs.

         Strengthen payroll management and control by having the new computerized
         payroll systemonline and fully operational, giving MDAs access to salary payment
         reports on a monthly basis, with MDA responses to be used to progressively
         improve accuracy of pay records.

         Continue to ensure that the provisions of the Public Procurement Act are fully
          implemented and applied by having public procurement plans for key MDAs
          submittedto the Public Procurement Board (PPB) soon after the approval of the
          budget and by ensuring the publication of the PPB monthly bulletin containing
          detailed information on upcoming tenders, contract awards, and the resolution of
          complaints.

    B.    CONSULTATIONSAND PARTICIPATION


142.    The Government of Ghana developed the GPRS 11, on the basis of which this
operation was prepared, through broad consultations on issues and challenges of
promoting growth and poverty reduction. Several workshops were carried out during the
preparation period, aiming at: (i)reviewing the draft document for each thematic area,
examining the policy actions needed to achieve the GPRS I1goals; (ii)     ranking and prioritizing
the proposed set o f policy actions according to agreed criteria; and (iii)   strengthening policy
synergies between and across sectors by identifying complementarities and overlaps.           The
ultimate objective o f these workshops was to prioritize and ensure policy coherence throughout
the document.       To achieve these objectives several workshops organized, including: (i)
preliminary stakeholder consultations at Regional and Districts levels; (ii) review and
                                                                                policy
hearings with the budget divisions o f each MDAs; (iii)number o f meetings to agree on budget
                                                        a
estimates and costing; and (v) a National Stakeholders Forum on the final draft o f the GPRS 11.

143.    The proposed operation buildson the multi-sector policy dialogue carried out in the
context of the MDBS policy dialogue. The MDBS is organized across several sector groups,
focused on both carrying out the sector dialogue and providing the MDBS the with the
opportunity to elevate policy issues deemed important by these sector groups to the level o f the
Minister o f Finance and Economic Planning and, ultimately, the Cabinet. To ensure that these
instances when policy actions are elevated to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
and the Cabinet are clearly defined, the MDBS endeavors to increasingly focus on the cross-
cutting issues, as well as policy actions that either have economy-wide implications or require
collaboration between agencies. This sectoral organization is consistent with how the M D B S
dialogue with the Ghanaian authorities has evolved, and reflects a common understanding o f
priorities for continuous budget support and for the progress across all sectors.

    B.    POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS

144.    It is expected that the reformprogramsupportedby MDBS-OS/PRSC-4would assist
in improving the living conditions of the poorest segments of the Ghanaian population.
Indeed, drawing on preliminary findings from the analysis o f the 2003 CWIQ surveyY3*the
MDBS-OSPRSC-4 places emphasis on broadening access to education and health services,
especially in the deprived regions. The MDBS-OSPRSC-4 also includes the development o f a
water sector investment program and o f a social protection strategy in the performance
assessment framework (PAF).           The former is a key area to ensure improvements in health
indicators, while the latter can help address the emerging problem with child welfare in urban
and peri-urban areas. Finally, the 2004 PSIA on power sector reform informs the operation on
the potential impact o f adjustments in electricity tariffs.              Electricity access has increased
significantly in Ghana, reaching almost half o f the population in 2003. Although electricity
prices in Ghana are lower than in neighbouring countries, the country will face more constraints
in the next five years in keepingprices affordable for poorer and more rural consumers. The
study also finds that the current tariff structure implies a higher unit tariff for consumers with the
lowest consumption, and that metering problems probably lead to an overestimation o f the
number o f consumers being charged lifeline tariffs. Unsurprisingly, it is estimated that, at a
minimum, about halfthe lifeline `leaks' to the non-poor.

145.    The resultsof the 2003 CWIQ survey also informthe agenda for MDBS-OS/PRSC-4
and beyond, in particular the importance of sustaininggrowth to ensure the continuation
of povertyreduction. Indeed, underreal GDPgrowth rates inthe 5 to 6 percent range, poverty is
projected to decline firther, meeting the MDG goal o f halving the 1990 rate o f poverty incidence
before 2015. Inthis context, the proposed MDBS-OSPRSC-4 places emphasis on actions aimed
at facilitating private sector development and increasing in agricultural productivity, especially
among the poorest farmers. Specifically, MDBS-OSPRSC-4 supports government actions aimed
at (i)creating a more diversified financial sector, opening room for increase credit to the private
sector, (ii)strengthening the business environment through the expansion o f energy supply
services and the removal o f administrative barriers for business development; and (iii)
encouraging the development o f extension services, especially for the poorer farmers. The latter
component also supports measures to improve the performance o f the rural sector through policy
actions aimed at strengthening government's support to agriculture, and at improving the
management o fnatural resources.

146.     To informthe policymakingprocess, the Governmentof Ghana, with support from
its development partners, carried out a series of poverty and social impact analysis
(PSIAs). These studies aimed at ensuring that, over time, sufficient analysis o f the poverty and
social impact o f policies was completed, providing a contribution to the discussions o f each
subsequent round o f PRSCs.           The PSIAs focused on four key areas, namely, (i)tackling
vulnerability and exclusion; (ii)    the economic transformation o f the agriculture sector; (iii)         power

sector reforms and setting electricity tariffs; and (iv) decentralization and pro-poor service
delivery. The preparation o f these PSIAs involved key stakeholders in the elaboration o f terms
of reference and the review o f findings and recommendations. Also, the preparation of PSIAs
was conducted in partnership with local research teams. Table 24 provides a summary o f the
methods and data used, the principal conclusions andthe policy options under each PSIA.

     C.    FIDUCIARY      ASPECTS

147.     The government's ongoing public financial management reforms address the
fiduciary issues identified in the latest External Review of Public Financial Management
(FY 05 ERPFM), as well as in the FY04 CFAA and the FY03 CPAR. Cash and commitment
controls have been strengthened, minimizing the risk of budget slippages and the accumulation
o f arrears. There i s now prompter reconciliation of budgetary and banking accounts, increasing
the frequency and timeliness of reporting on budget execution; as well as enhanced oversight
from the Auditor General's Department, with external audit reports submitted to Parliament
within less of 12 months of the closing of the accounts, ensuring that the legal deadline is met
and, as a result, more judicious use o f public resources. The budget coverage has also been

                                                    - 84 -

broadened to include more information on internally generated funds and donor grants. The
enforcement o f procurement rules, now with the approval o f the new law, i s receiving increasing
attention to ensure the efficient use o f public hnds, as well as greater transparency and
accountability. Further efforts should deliver the expected outcomes o f better value for money,
and greater transparency and accountability inthe management o f public expenditure. Another
important step i s continuing to make progress in broadening the coverage o f fiscal reports,
incorporating detailed spending by statutory funds in the in-year reporting cycle. The overall
assessment, therefore, i s that, while still requiring further upgrade, Ghana's fiduciary framework
i s adequate for the implementation o f the proposedcredit.


     D. DISBURSEMENTSAUDITING   AND

148.     Credit Amount. The Credit amount of SDR 97.4 (US$140 million equivalent) will
be disbursedin a single tranche uponeffectiveness,anticipatedfor June 2006. It is expected
that this will be the first o f a series o f four PRSCs

149.     Disbursements.         The proposed credit will follow the Bank's disbursement
procedures for development policy credits.33The credit proceeds will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and not tied to any specific
purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the credit i s approved by the Board
and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the credit will be disbursed at the request o f the Borrower
by IDA inan account designated by the Borrower at the Bank o f Ghana and which forms part o f
the country's official foreign exchange reserves.           The Borrower shall ensure that upon the
deposit o f the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount i s credited in local currency to an
account that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures. The Borrower will provide a written
confirmation to the Bank within 30 days o f the receipt o f the proceeds o f the Credit into the
account that i s available to finance budgeted expenditures. Ifthe proceeds o f the credit are used
for ineligible purposes (Le. to finance goods or services on the standard negative list), as defined
inthe Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to promptly uponnotice from IDA,
refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank
upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration o f this credit will be the responsibility
o f the Ministryo f Finance and Economic Planning.

 150.    The following arrangements support the requirements related to fiduciary
 assurance:

     0   Foreign reserve account. The Government o f Ghana will acknowledge receipt to IDA o f
         the money into the foreign reserve account and the crediting o f this amount in local
         currency to the Ghana Government Main Cash Account. While no external audit will be
         required, it is expected that the confirmation o f receipt will be countersigned by the
         Accountant General and the Controller andAuditor General.

151.    Auditing. The Association reserves right to request, at any time, an audit of the
receipt and accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the
Borrower. Upon the Association's request, the Borrower shall: (i)           have the account and the
recording o f amounts o f the Credit into the Borrower's budget management system audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association, in accordance with consistently applied
auditing standards acceptable to the Association; (ii)furnish to the Association as soon as
available, but in any case not later than four months after the date o f the Association's request for
such audit, a certified copy o f the report o f such audit by said auditors, o f such scope and in such
detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested; and (iii)       furnish to the Association
such other information concerning the said account and recording o f Credit amounts into the
budget management system, and the audit thereof, as the Association shall have reasonably
requested.

152.    The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) will be responsible for
the overall implementation of the proposed MDBS-OS/PRSC-4. Bank supervision will be
aligned with the activities o f other donors, focusing on the year-long verification process that
monitors the implementation o f the policies being supported by the PRSCMDBS and identifies
how to best measure the completion o f agreed policy actions. Bank supervision would also be
aligned with the government's monitoring and evaluation o f the GPRS. Indeed, the policy
actions to be monitored under the MDBS-O5PRSC-4 are extracted from government policy
documents (e.g., GPRS 11, sector strategy documents, the 2005 budget statement), ensuring this
alignment andreducing the transaction costs o f managing budgetary support for the government.

153.    Duringthe periodof implementationof the programsupportedbyMDBS-OS/PRSC-
4 a series of reports (Table 26) will also assist in monitoringprogress:(i)         quarterly reports by
development partners on disbursements and disbursement projections; (ii) reports on   yearly
macro-economic developments at the time o f the mini-CGs, assessing progress on the
implementation o f the framework agreed between the Govemment, the IMF and the Bank; (iii)
monthly reports on budget expenditures with breakdown by Ministry, Department and Agency
with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end o f each month, and with the breakdown for
Items 1-4 o f the Ghanaianbudget (personnel, administration, services, investment); (iv) monthly
reports on domestically financed poverty-related (including HIPC financed expenditures), with a
lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end o f each month. These reports would include a
breakdown along main poverty-related expenditure programs (education, health, etc.), and a
breakdown for Items 1-4 o f the Ghanaian budget (personnel, administration, services,
investment); (v) joint aide memoires at the time o f joint review missions on the performance
assessment framework, including in a possible mid-termassessment on progress on the PRSC-5

in the Autumn of 2006; and (vi) a report on progress on the PRSC-5 policy matrix and prior
actions in early 2007. In addition, the completion o f PRSC-5 actions will be assessed in the
context o f the GPRS annual progress report that will document implementation and outcomes o f
its reforms.

     F. ENVIRONMENTAL         ASPECTS

 154.    The proposedoperation has been rated a developmentpolicy credit, requiring that
the program document identify possible environmental outcomes arising from activities
supported by the lending operation. There are no negative outcomes arising from the
activities supported by this lending operation, and there are beneficial effects arising from
 actions aimed at strengthening the management o f forestry resources. These actions include the
 allocation o f commercial timber rights in natural forests and harvest plantations through
competitive bidding, the conversion o f existing timber leases into timber utilization contracts,
 and the harmonization of the institutional arrangements for forest plantations.                    The
 implementation o f competitive bidding inthe allocation o f logging rights will allow the country
to increase the transparency and revenue generation.              The harmonization o f institutional
 arrangements for forest plantation would aim at bringingthe several existing plantation schemes
under a common framework, standardizing the costing o fthese schemes andbalancingthe needs
 o fthe rural poor, farmers and the private sector.

 155.    It is important to underscore that Ghana is aware of the importance for poverty
 reduction of meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of ensuring
 environmentalsustainability. The GPRS builds on Ghana's robust environmental institutional
 framework and considerable capacities to set environmental management standards. The main
 frameworks are the 1991 National Environmental Policy, the 1992 National Environmental
 Action Plan, and the 1994 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Act. This framework laws
 give an adequate reflection o f the national environmental policy objectives, seeking to reconcile

                                              - 87 -

economic development and natural resource conservation. Indeed, the EPA has since the late
1980s adopted environmental impact assessment as a management tool to screen undertakings
likely to pose adverse impact on the environment. Environmental screening and assessment
became legal in 1999 with the promulgation o f the Environmental Assessment Regulations
(Legislative Instrument 1652) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are recognized and
applied to most development projects. Procedures have been established to screen and evaluate
all development projects and programs that have the potential to give rise to significant social
and environmental impacts. Under the country's Environmental Assessment Regulations of
(Legislative Instrument 1652), an EIA is mandatory for seventeen types o f activities classified as
critical. These activities include: (i)mining, (ii)    petroleum and gas field development and
exploration, (iii) construction o f dams, harbors and roads, and (iv) logging and disposal o f
timber .
156.    Also, the Government of Ghana recognizes the need to better comprehend the
potentialand likely risks, impact and opportunitiesof the GPRS on the social and physical
environment, so as to develop correspondingpreventive and mitigationhemediationplans.
The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was designed in 2004, and introduced as a
process tool to evaluate the potential environmental (natural resources management linkage),
social (poverty indicators, livelihoods and health impacts and vulnerability impacts on the poor)
and institutional (institutional targeted impacts) effects o f the GPRS and any plans or programs
that may be from there derived. Consultations were carried out with MDAs, CSOs, NGOs and
DPs, leading to recommendations aimed at refining policies, and giving greater focus to
environmental issues in articulating strategies for sustainable development.               Specific
recommendations included proposed actions on the rural environment, natural resource
management, disaster prevention, and `green' taxes and accounting. The findings from the SEA
are now being used for revisions, prioritization and decision-making for the GPRS update at the
national, regional and district levels. Inthe context, the SEAShave been applied in discussing
the GPRS and its poverty reduction-environment linkages with 25 sector MDAs, and at the
district level to appraise the sustainability o f District Medium-Term Development Plans
(DMTDPs). This has resulted in greater number o f district assemblies initiating revisions o f
their plans or planning decisions to reflect and include pro-poor and pro-environment activities.
These revisions will include incorporating interventions that are likely to contribute to improving
people's livelihoods, health and vulnerability levels, institutional performance; supporting
sustainable natural resources management options and enforcing environmental regulations and
standards.


     G. RISKSAND RISKMITIGATION

 157.    There are six risks to the success of the program. First, the large size of the public
sector, which might compromise the sustainability of the current economic expansion by
limiting private sector growth and by reducing the scope for fiscal management. The latter is
particularly important because a large fraction o f public expenditures is incompressible in the
 short run, such as the payroll andpension obligations, creating the appeal o f meeting expenditure
obligations through borrowing. Second, the continued appreciation of the cedi, which has
increased about 20 percent in trade-weighted terms over the last two years. This appreciation
would lead to a slowdown in export growth and, as a result, a slowdown in real GDP growth.

                                             - 88 -

Third, an increase in quasi-fiscaldeficits stemming from losses in the energy sector due to
delays in adjustingelectricitytariffs and from continuedsales of power at subsidizedrates
to the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO).                  While the Public Utilities Regulatory
Commission (PURC) has been undertaking quarterly reviews o f tariffs as part o f the automatic
tariff adjustment mechanism, the latest review undertaken in February 2006 i s yet to be
announced. Also, since the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO) came back into operation, in
September 2005, an imbalance has emergedinthe finances o f the Volta River Authority (VRA).
VRA is supplying energy to VALCO at 2.7 cents per kilowatt hour, although its marginal costs
of generation is around 10 cents per kilowatt hour. While the extra electricity sales boosted
VRA revenues, the need for VRA to produce more electricity from higher cost thermal
generation sources has resulted in V U ' Spreliminary (un-audited) financial statement for 2005
showing an operating loss-of about $300.00 billion, down from an estimated operating profit o f
about $400.00billion one year earlier. Fourth, a possibledisconnectbetweenincreasedhealth
spending and improved health outcomes. While it is expected that increased spending only
leads to better health services with a lag, these lags can widen whenever there are either
weaknesses in the health administration, or the underlying health problems are multifaceted.
Fifth, delays in structural reforms aimed at raising productivity throughout the economy,
which could compromise long term growth prospects. These reforms include (i)the power
sector reform that would entail greater efficiency, more reliability and lower costs o f energy
supply, (ii) land administration reform that aims at increasing transparency and at ensuring
            the
greater security o f land tenure, and (iii)natural resource management reform that aim at
increasing transparency in the allocation o f these resources and ensuring the long term
sustainability o f natural resource assets. Sixth, remaining fiduciary weaknesses that might
limit the impact o fthe program and leadto only partial fundingfrom developmentpartners.


158.    The risks stemmingfrom the large size of the public sector are mitigatedby a track
record of aggregate fiscal discipline and by the renewed attention to public sector
management and reform. Ghana's track on aggregate fiscal discipline i s commendable, with
the overall fiscal deficit having shrunk by almost three-quarters since 2000. The fiscal effort
entailed in achieving this track record needs to be mitigated however by the substantial increase
in government revenues, lower interest payments and reduced arrears during this period,
meaning that expenditure containment accounted for a smaller fraction o f the overall effort. The
government has, nevertheless, underscored this commitment to aggregate fiscal discipline with
greater attention to commitment and expenditure controls, more transparent procurement
procedures, and timelier budget reporting and auditing. The renewed attention to public sector
management and reform includes the ongoing upgrading o f integrated personnel and payroll
database, with broader coverage o f subvented agencies, and improved software and supporting
hardware. It also includes the recent launch o f public sector reforms, with the passing o f the
subvented agencies reform bill on March 3, 2006, outlining reforms that would allow subvented
agencies to move toward commercialization and self-financing, as well as the rightsizing of
agencies through retrenchment o f staff.

 159.   The risk of continuedappreciationof the cedi is mitigatedby the fact that the cedi
has recentlybeen undervalued,by two rounds of external debt relief, and by the prospects
of lower energy import bill once the investments on the West Africa Gas Pipeline are
completed. Indeed, over a ten year perspective, the recent appreciation is only bringing the

                                                - 89 -

currency back to the levels prevailing at end-1999, and still below the levels existing from 1996
to 1998 (Figure 13). The recent appreciation can be seen therefore as partially undoing the
undervaluation that followed the devaluations in 1999 and 2000. Also, in the meantime, the
economy has seen a significant improvement in its fiscal stance, and has benefited from two
rounds o f external debt relief, reducing fiscal pressures on the exchange rate. Lastly, the ongoing
projects inthe energy sector are expected to reduce the cost o f imported energy, especially once
the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) comes into operation inJanuary 2007. Power generation
using gas from the WAGP i s expected to decrease the marginal cost o f power generation by
around 30 to 40 percent, with the marginal cost of one kilowatt hour declining to 6 to 7 cents,
down from around 10 cents. Reaping the benefits o f lower energy costs from access to the
WAGP requires however completing ongoing power sector reforms, such as completing these
energy sector investments, implementing the 2005 tariff review, with the separation o f
transmission charges from the bulk service tariff (BST) and the inclusion o f capacity charges in
the tariff structure, and the establishment o f an independent system operator for the new
transmission company.

160.    Increasing access to sustainable, low cost energy supply is one of Ghana's best
options for sustaining the current economic expansion, boosting competitiveness and
ensuing productivitygains -which are usually pro-cyclical. Increased productivity is critical,
inturn, to allow the country to weather the expected appreciation ofthe currency resulting from
sustained growth.

161.    The risk that the government's strong fiscal stance is weakened by quasi-fiscal
deficits stemming from losses in the energy sectors are mitigated by the anticipated
completion of the utilitiestariff review, which is expected to leadto an adjustmentin electricity
tariffs, and by the initiative from the ministries of Energy and of Finance and Economic
Planningto table to Cabinet a positionpaper proposingto earmark funds in the budgetto
cover the tariff subsidy to VALCO. In making this proposal to Cabinet, the ministries o f
Energy and o f Finance and Economic Planning acknowledge both the consequences associated
with the subsidy to VALCO, as well as the importance of keepingVRA finances sound, as VRA

                                             - 90 -

represents the country the consortium undertaking the construction and operations o f the WAGP,
as well as responsible for the investments underpinningGhana's participation inthe West Africa
Power Pool (WAPP).

162.    The risk of possible disconnect between increased health spending and
improvements in health outcomes are mitigated by ongoing improvements in health
administration, including the establishment of the health insurance scheme, and the
government's more integrated approach to the delivery of human development services.
The government envisions two important roles for the National Health Insurance Scheme:
broadening access by the population to health services and eliciting better services from health
care providers by enforcing quality standards, as well as greater cost control. Also, the GPRS I1
places renewed attention to health service delivery, bolstering efforts in addressing perennial
problems with malaria control and the links betweenmaternal and infant health, and nutrition.

163.    The risks of delays in structural reforms that could undermine long term growth
prospectsare mitigatedby stronger coordinationwithin government, more frequent use of
evidence-baseddecision making, andthe moreeffectiveharmonizationof aid efforts inthe
context of the MDBS. Also, there has been enhanced coordination between government and
business leaders that ensures the momentum is kept inthe implementation o f reforms related to e
energy, land administration and natural resource management, allowing pending issues to be
addressed without delay. This coordination i s reflected in the annual meetings of the Ghana
Investor's Advisory Committee, as well as in the meetings o f the oversight committee for the
implementation o f the private sector development strategy.            Members o f the Oversight
Committee include the Chief Directors o f the Ministries o f Finance and Economic Planning,
Trade and Industry, Private Sector Development and PSI, Justice and Attorney General, Food
and Agriculture and the Coordinator o f the Public Sector Reform Secretariat. Representatives
from the private sector and civil society include the Private Enterprise Foundation, the
Federation o f Association o f Ghanaian Exporters, the Ghana Union Traders Association and the
Trades Union Congress.

164.    The risk stemming from residual fiduciary weaknesses is steadily decreasing, with
progress made on strengthening the regulatory framework for public expenditure
management (e.g., the Public Procurement Act, the Financial Administration Act, the
Internal Audit Agency Act), and in strengthening budget management itself. The
government continues to operate cash and commitment controls, with prompt reconciliation o f
budgetary and banking accounts, and frequent and timely reporting on budget execution. Also,
risks are mitigated by the elevation to national attention o f fiscal transparency communications,
budgetaccount disclosures, andParliamentary oversight o f resource use and development results

         FOURTH POVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC-4)


Mr. Paul D. Wolfowitz
President
The World Bank

Dear Mr. Wolfowitz

                       LElTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

 1. Iam writing to request, on behalf of the Government of Ghana, a fourth Poverty
    Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) from the International Development Association
    (IDA) to support the programmes and policy measures outlined in the Ghana
    Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11). This letter sets out the actions
    that Government will undertake over the medium term to implement its
    development agenda. The attached policy matrix, developed in collaboration with
    the World Bank team and other development partners from the Multi-Donor
    Budget Support (MDBS) group, sets out the contents of this letter in a summary.

 2. Ghana has over the period 2003 - 2005, implemented the Ghana Poverty
    Reduction Strategy (GPRS I)as its medium term development policy agenda. The
    GPRS Iaimed at stabilising the economy, improving on production, investing in
    human resource development, promoting more equitable development and
    protecting the poor and vulnerable. Indeed, GPRS Ioutlined reforms to transform
    the lives of Ghanaians and reduce poverty. Over the past four years, the nation,
    pulling together has turned a very difficult situation around and made good
    progress in executing our development agenda, as evidenced by the positive shifts
    in our socio-economic indicators.

 3. The macro economic targets we set ourselves over the period have been attained
    and almost all the objectives of GPRS Ihave been achieved. The strengthening of

                                                                          Schedule 1
                                                                         Page2 o f 38

   macro-economic and structural policies, governance institutions and business
   regulations has led to a marked improvement in Ghana's economic performance.

4. The accomplishments we have made during the past few years are a result of, on
   the one hand commitment to good policies by Government and on the other to the
   sacrifice, understanding and support of the people of Ghana who have supported
   government efforts on the sometimes difficult measures we have had to
   implement as a springboard for accelerated growth.

5. In pursuit of our aim of achieving middle income status with a per capita Gross
   Domestic Product of $1,000 by 2015, Ghana with its stakeholders, developed in
   2005, the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11). GPRS 11, whose
   implementation period is from years 2006 to 2009, emphasizes the growth
   elements of our development agenda and revolves around the three pillars
   outlined by the President in his "State of the Nation Address"- Private sector-led
   Growth, Human Resource Development, Good Governance & Civic Responsibility.

6. Ghana continues to make progress with the achievement of the Millennium
   Development Goals (MDGs).        With the current growth levels the country is
   experiencing, Ghana can meet a good proportion of the set goals with the
   requisite investments in the needed infrastructure. Our performance in achieving
   some of the goals, particularly the health-related MDGs is somewhat mixed and we
   have been seriously challenged by the issue of the "brain drain" as we continue to
   lose our health professionals to the more developed West. We believe however
   that with the planned reforms in the public sector, we have the strategy to turn
   this situation round. Progress with the MDGs however requires the scaling up of
   investments, increased levels of aid and improved efficiency in the use of current
   aid.

7. During the past year, Ghana participated in meetings to improve aid effectiveness.
   Of significance was the Paris Workshopon Aid Effectiveness,which led to the Paris
   Declaration. A positive effect of the above global initiative to improve aid
   effectiveness was the improved collaboration at national level, through a New
   Partnership Strategy to align donors support to our development agenda at the
   12th Consultative Group Meeting of Ghana and its Development Partners in
   November 2005.

8. Our President, His Excellency John Agyekum Kufuor presented a development
   scorecard that highlighted the gains across all sectors of the economy and society.
   He recalled a goal set at the last Consultative Group meeting in 2002, "to make
   sure that by the end of the 4-year term, not only would we have achieved relative
   stability, but also we would have made Ghana an attractive place for investment,
   and positioned it for accelerated growth". This, we have achieved. Ghana is
   inarguably well-positioned for a take-off.

                                                                                     Schedule 1
                                                                                    Page 3 of 38


 9. Democracy continues to provide the enabling environment for growth. Freedom of
     speech is alive in Ghana today and Government continues to listen to the concerns
     raised by Ghanaians and where required takes appropriate action. Indeed, the
     2006 budget labelled, the "Good News Budget" encouraged all factions of
     Ghanaian society to voice their concerns for development and to make positive
     inputs on the way forward.

  1O.The clear message from respondents was that the key to sustainable progress in
     attacking poverty and improving living standards would be by creating
     opportunities for employment and providing incentives for investment by the
     private sector to create jobs. Allied to this was the concern of the need for
     payment of realistic wages. Government also in dialogue highlighted the corollary
     to this, which was the need for increased productivity of the Ghanaian worker to
     enable Government and private sector pay realistic wages. The dialogue with
     organised labour goes on.

  11.As we negotiate with our development partners on the ways of transforming
     Ghana into a middle income country within the next ten years, this Government
     re-iterates its pledge made to Ghanaians to continue to reduce poverty, create an
     enabling environmentfor wealth creation and maintain a sound economy.
  12.The attached policy matrix (Appendix 1) is a harmonised one, outlining the
     development program supported by both the MDBS and the PRSC. The program
     covers the medium term and includes policy actions for reform. The targets set
     therein are drawn from the goals of GPRS I1and NEPAD as well as the Millennium
     Development Goals. The ensuing sections provide detailed insights into the
     progress made and indicate the areas of investment required to achieve
     acceleratedgrowth and equitable development in the medium term.


1.0     Backgroundand Recent Developments

  13.Year 2005, the last year of implementation of the first Ghana Poverty Reduction
     Strategy was a year of completing specific reform measures, taking stock of
      progress made and redirection of efforts where required. Consultations which had
     started in 2004 provided inputs to guide the development of the second
     framework, the Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11), which
     covers the four year-period from 2006 to 2009.

  14.As happens each year, the Annual Progress Report34(APR) which providesa status
      report on implementation progress of GPRS programmes and projects has been
      prepared. It also includes information on progress made with achieving GPRS-

                                                                             Page4 o f 38
    based triggers and targets for assessing performance in the Donor supported
    programmes such as the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC), the Multi-
    Donor Budget Support (MDBS) and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
    (PRGF).

 15.This section of the letter provides an overview of the progress made with more
    details provided in the three pillars and in the APR 2005 itself.


1.1 TheMacroEconomy

 16.In 2005 the Ghanaian economy remained resilient despite the volatility of world
    crude oil prices, with the key economic indicators remaining stable.

Outturns for the key macro economic indicatorswere as follows:

  a   Real GDP grew at about 6 percent continuing its upward trend since 2001;
  a   Year on year inflation was 14.8 percent at end December 2005 but declined to
      9.9 percent by end March 2006. The sustained level of inflation was in spite of
      the signficant deterioration in the terms of trade, the Iiberalization of domestic
      petroleum prices and the spike in world oil prices;

  a   The Cedi remained relatively stable against all the major currencies;
  a   The domestic primary balance registered a surplus equivalent to 3.4 percent of
      GDP better than the target of 2.6 percent, while the overall budget was in a
      deficit equivalent to 2.3 percent of GDP;
  a   Net domestic financing of the budget registered a repayment of $1,574 billion
      (equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP), against the target of a net repayment of
      $996.2 billion (equivalent to 1.0 percent of GDP)
  a   Gross foreign reserves were equivalent to 3.7 months of imports at the end of
      2005;
  a   Interest rates generally declined with the benchmark 91-day treasury bill rate
      falling from about 17 percent at the end of 2004 to about 11percent in 2005;
  a   Total revenues were below expectations as a result of lower than expected
      indirect tax collections, but the shortfalls were compensated by holding back on
      some non essential capital expenditures.


1.2 Debt Cancellation

 17.Ghana was selected as one of the 18 post-HIPC countries to benefit from the
    Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) which is a 100 percent irrevocable stock

                                                                                                                        Schedule 1
                                                                                                                      Page 5 of 38
       of debt cancellation of outstanding obligations to the IMF, World Bank and African
       Development Bank, amounting to over US$4 billion. These additional resources will
       four key poverty sectors - rehabilitation of essential highways and feeder roads in
       mainly be used to augment the current level of public investment and provide for

       agricultural areas, education, health and water and help us to partially meet our
       resource requirementsfor meeting the MDGs in these areas.


1.3 PoveitySpending

  18.During the past year, which was the last year of implementation of GPRS I,
       Government increased poverty spending significantly to acceleratethe attainments
       of its growth and poverty reduction targets and to help Ghana progress towards
       the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs).

  19.In 2005, planned poverty reduction expenditures included $525 billion for National
        Health Insurance, $350 billion as lifeline payments for consumers of electricity and
        as a safety net for the protection of the poor against the negative effects of
        petroleum price deregulation.

  20.By the end of the year, total Government expenditure on direct actions for the
        development related services - primary health care, basic education and safe
        poor amounted to $8,256 billion. About 70 percent of this was on human

        drinking water while 23 percent of total poverty expenditures by Government was
        utilised on private sector development activities including agriculture, skills training
        for employment and provision of infrastructure (feeder roads, rural energy, rural
        housing etc). The rest, around 7 percent, was utilised on activities in support of
        good governance such as human rights and public safety.

  21.Ghana continues to benefit from HIPC debt relief. In 2005, total estimated debt
        relief was $1,992.9 billion out of which $398.6 billion, representing 20% was used
        for repayment of domestic debt.                         The remainder of $1,606.2735 billion was
        disbursed to MDAs and MMDAs for the implementation of priority poverty and
        growth-enhancing programmes and projects. The distribution is shown in the
        table below:




''The  80% remainingafter paying down domestic debt was $1,594.4billion. The extra funds of almost 12billion represents HIPC funds carried
over from 2004.

 22.The outcomes of the increasing amounts of resources spent on poverty reducing
     programmes will be known when the results of the fifth round of the Ghana Living
     Standards Survey (GLSS 5) are published next year.                   In the interim, results
     gathered from the Annual Progress Report of GPRS implementation show evidence
     of the progress being made in various areas.

 23.This year, as we begin implementation of GPRS 11, Government has allocated a
     total of $9,646.72 billion representing 35% of total Governmenf6 expenditure to
     implement poverty reduction programmes and projects in the three priority
     development areas of the nation. These expenditures include $598 billion from
     the National Health Insurance Fund, and $350 billion as lifeline payments for the
     consumers of electricity and as a safety net for the protection of the poor against
     the negative effects of petroleum price deregulation.

  24,Estimated relief from HIPC for 2006 is a total of $2,277.5 billion out of which
      $455.5 billion representing 20 percent of the expected amount is being used to
      reduce domestic debt. The rest, amounting to $1,822 billion has been allocated by
      Parliament to MDAs and MMDAs to implement poverty reduction programmes and
      projects. The programmesand projects will be consistent with the GPRS I1priority
      areas.

Human Development

25.Our human development indicators continue to show an upward trend for most
    areas, while some health-related ones show a levelling off. Spending on human
    development is up and deprived areas are receiving increasingly higher spending.
    A number of our human development indicators in deprived areas similarly are
    showing evidence of gaps being closed.

 26.The education sector continues to record good progress, though Ghana did not
    achieve the MDGs of gender parity for primary and secondary education by 2005.
    Nevertheless, policy initiatives of the past couple of years, such as the introduction
    of capitation grants, have contributed to significant increases in both female and
    male enrolments, but particularly so for girls.

 27.For health, considerable progress has been made to date in the health status of
    Ghanaians. We acknowledgethe extra efforts we will have to put in to move out of
    this phase, where some indicators are stagnant. As has been noted in the just-
    completed review of the sector, we need to "Pause, Get it Right, and Move On".
    This we are doing with full commitment. Government is committed to ensuring
    that progress doesn't get stalled due to lack of resources. In this regard, more
    resources are being provided from the Multi Lateral Debt Relief Initiative funds to
    support the health sector's programme of work. We are also emphasizing health
    promotion and nutrition as key elements of our strategy.

 28.Ghana continues to give priority to HIV/AIDS and aims to keep prevalence down.
    For guineaworm disease, though we recorded a 45 percent reduction in cases in
    2005 over the previous year, we continue to face challenges. Government is of
    the view that even a single case of guinea worm, is one case too many. More
    concerted efforts therefore are being made to contain and ultimately eradicate the
    disease. Malaria remains and priority and progress is being made as shown by the
    reduction in case fatality rates, especially for the under-fives.

 29.The social protection strategy is integrated into GPRS I1and emphasizes expansion
    of health insurance, continuation of capitation grants in education and support for
    nutrition programmes.


GoodGovernance

 30.Ghana continues to make good progress with governance.                 As multi party
    democracy takes root, the demands for more inclusive good governance are being
    met. We are continuing with efforts to strengthen the anti-corruption framework.

                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                           Page 8 of 38
31.In the area of improving public financial management, significant progress has
    been made in public expenditure management to ensure an efficient and effective
    financial management.

32.The creation of a Ministry of Public Sector Reforms further underscores
    Government's commitment to deepen the reform process to assure the delivery of
    enhanced public services.

33. We continue to face challenges in the area of decentralisation but the passage of
    the National Decentralisation Act (NDA) and the consequential creation of the
    Local Government Service Council (LGSC) to spearhead the process demonstrate
    our commitment to progressin this area.

34.Further details on all the key developmental indicators are provided in the relevant
    pillars below.


      The Reform Programme Progress Report and Measuresfor 2006
                                  -
 35.In GPRS 11, Ghana has prioritised four areas as the focus of our development
    dialogue over the next four years - Macroeconomic Stability, Human Resource
    Development, Private Sector Development and Good Governance. These four
    areas form the basis of the three pillars of the continuing dialogue with our
    development partners which are: - Promoting Growth, Incomes and Employment;
    Improving Service Delivery for Human Development; and Improving Governance
    and Public Sector Management.

 36.This Letter of Development Policy covers the first year of implementation of GPRS
    I1 and gives indicative direction of the medium term programme. The reform
    measures we have prioritized continue to be structural and institutional in nature.
    The policy reforms under each of the three main pillars are detailed below:


2.0   Promoting Growth, Incomesand Employment

 37.This pillar focuses on the following strategic areas to promote growth, incomes
    and employment to enable Ghana achieve its medium term growth objectives
    detailed in GPRS I1and also achieve the medium term target of a per capita GDP
     of $1,000. These are:
   -    Increasing the scope of financing development;
   -    Improving the environment for businesswhile protecting the poor;

                                                                                 Schedule 1
                                                                                Page 9 of 38
  -     Improving the performance of the rural sector in the interest of the poor.

 38,The planned programmes for PRSC-5, as envisaged under the GPRS 11, are
    described below.


2.1IncreasingScopeforFinancingDevelopment

 39.Measures being implemented by Government to increase the scope for financing
    development include the reduction of the public domestic debt to increase the
    availability of capital to the private sector, diversification of the financial sector to
    improve access to financial services for long-term investments and the
    implementation of the Financial Sector Strategic Programme (FINSSP) to improve
    the businessenvironment and deepen financial intermediation.


2.1.1 Reducing Public Domestic Debt

 40.As you are aware, it is Government's policy to reduce the domestic debt and free
     more resources to the private sector. The thrust of Government's domestic debt
     strategy in 2005 was to reduce the rate of growth of the domestic debt stock by
     operating within the context of programmed borrowings only, re-organise
     domestic debt stock towards longer term instruments, and improve the pricing
     mechanism for the issuance of debt in order to lower borrowing costs. It also
     sought to diversifythe choice of debt instruments availableto the market.

 41,Government was successful in reducing the borrowing of costs of the various debt
     instruments and reducing the level of outstanding short term instruments. As at
     end December 2005, the balance outstanding stood at $10,460 billion down from
     $12,133 billion at the end of December 2004. The domestic debt to GDP ratio
     declined from 15.2 percent in 2004 to 10.8 percent at the end of 2005.

  42.Interest rates on the 91-Day Treasury Bill declined from 17.1 percent at end
     December 2004 to 11.4 percent at the end December 2005. Interest rates in the
     Inter-bank market also dropped from 16.22 percent at end December 2004 to
     10.23 percent at end December 2005. All these developments led to an increase
     of the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector from 13 percent of GDP at
     end 2004 to 15 percent by end 2005.

  43.For 2006 government has projected to achieve a net domestic repayment of 0.5
     percent of GDP to further reduce the domestic debt and free more financial
     resources to the private sector for economic development.

                                                                               Schedule 1
                                                                            Page 10 of 38
2.1.2 Creating a more Diversified Financial Sector and Improving Access to
FinancialServices

44.Ghana continues to implement the Financial Sector Strategic Programme (FINSSP)
    to improve the regulatory environment and deepen the operations of the financial
    sector, facilitate private sector access to long term finance and to reduce the
    bottlenecks that constrain the development of the private sector.

 45.As part of measures to achieve the above objectives, the Regulations of the APEX
    Bank have been approved by Cabinet and are to be laid before Parliament. These
    Regulations define the scope of operations of the bank and facilitates collaboration
    with local partners and external bodies.       When implemented, these Regulations
    will facilitate the extension of credit to clients of the Rural Banks, mostly farmers,
    artisans and small scale producers for their mainline businesses or additional
    income generating activities. Governmentwill continue the training programme for
    APEX and Rural and Community Banks (RCBs) to improve their capacity in credit
    delivery and management. Special purpose programmes to increase the flow of
    funds to RCBs will be given special attention this year.

 46.As indicated last year, an Office of Micro Credit and Small Loans Scheme
    (MASLOC) has been set up under the Office of the President to oversee all
    government micro-credit schemes in the country.            Guidelines to govern the
    operation of all micro-credit schemes have been established and the Office is
    awaiting the appointment of a substantive Board to operationalisethe Guidelines.

 47.To increase confidence in the financial system and also to raise the savings levels
    in the country for development and as part of the legislative reforms, the Long
    Term Savings Bill was passed by Parliament. The board as well as the Chief
    Executive Officer for the Venture Capital Trust Fund have been appointed. The
    Credit Reporting Bill has also been submitted to Cabinet and is to be presented to
    Parliament. Cabinet has commissioned an expert to review the defects in the Long
    Term Savings Bill to assure its consistency with the existing laws.

 48,Government remains committed to deepen the reforms we have began in the
    financial sector. Actions we aim to undertake this year under FINSSP include
    passing the Credit ReportingAct and the Foreign ExchangeAct. We also intend to
    continue to increase the share of SSNIT investments managed by the
    regulated private financial institutions.

2.2 ImprovingtheEnvironmentforBusinesswhileProtectingthePoor

Expand supply of energy serviceswhile promotingthe poor

                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                           Page 11of 38

 49.The expansion of the supply of energy services and enhancement of private sector
    competitiveness continues to be part of the strategies for improving the
    environment for business.


2.2.1 Power Sector Reforms

 50.The Cabinet-approved Power Sector Reforms is on-going. As part of measures to
    ensure the viability of the utility companies, the Public Utilities Regulatory
    Commission (PURC) has been undertaking quarterly reviews of tariffs and been
     implementing the tariff adjustment mechanism. The latest review was undertaken
    in February 2006 and will be announced following on-going consultations with
    stakeholders.

 51. In addition, the Cross-Debt arrangement instituted to settle inter-agency
     indebtedness within 90 days has seen remarkable progress with its
     implementation. Quarterly reports are issued after reconciliation of accounts
     among the relevant agencies and the amounts involved settled.

 52.As part of the Energy Sector Reforms, measures to reduce ECG commercial and
     system losses continue to be implemented, in spite of challenges faced in this
     area. A decision has been made to separate the studies element of the reforms
     from the Management Contract. In this regard, the Request for Proposals for the
     Network Improvement Study and the Investment Study in Revenue have been
     issued. These studies are expected to indicate the gaps in the system to be fed
     into the ManagementContract. We will continue to implement measures to further
     reduce ECG system losses in line with the Management Services Support
     Agreement.

 53.To meet Ghana's commitments under the ECOWAS energy protocol, we
     will earmark in the upcoming 2006 Supplementary Budget, the funds
     necessary to compensate VRA for the difference between the weighted
     average cost of electricity production in Ghana and bulk power supply
     agreed for the VRA interim power supply agreement with VALCO.


2.2.2 Accelerated Deregulationof Petroleum Industry

  54.Government is committed to pursuing the deregulation process with the key
     objective of ensuring uninterruptible supplies of petroleum products throughout
     the country.   It also seeks to attain maximum efficiency in investments and
     operational performance and to ultimately meet adequate standards on quality and
     safety at equitable prices in the supply of petroleum products to consumers.

                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                           Page 12 of 38
55.In 2005, the National Petroleum Act (Act 691) was passed and the governing
    board of the National PetroleumAgency (NPA) was constituted and inauguratedby
    the President. The NPA oversees the participation of the private sector in the
    importation of petroleum products. Ex-refinery prices for petroleum products were
    adjusted quarterly and passed through the ex-pump price accordingly. These
    adjustments are now to be made monthly.


2.3PrivateSectorDevelopmentStrategy

 56,Ghana's priority in this area is strengthening private sector capacity to effectively
    perform as the engine of growth and poverty reduction.

Enhance Private Sector Competitiveness

 57.Implementation of the National Medium-Term Private Sector Development (PSD)
    Strategy continues and Government's focus on the competitiveness of the private
    sector remains a priority.     An Institutional Review of 42 key PSD-related MDAs
    to assess their capacity to deliver on the PSD Strategy activities and outputs has
    been undertaken and the Institutional Review recommendations validated by the
    MDAs. The PSD Strategy Oversight Committee approved MDAs in the following
    components as the highest priority for reform. These were those in business
    regulation, licensing and taxation; finance and investment. Technical support is
    being provided to implementation teams in each of the MDAs carrying out the
    detailed reforms identified from the review and system-wide and strategic issues
    will be submitted to Cabinet for approval.

 58.Implementation of quick-win priority activities from the institutional review
     recommendations has begun and Customer Charters for 16 MDAs have been
     reviewed and revised. In addition, 20 Client Service Units have been established
    to enhance public sector service delivery to the private sector, ICT needs of key
     MDAs has been assessed and procurement is underway.

 59.Various other initiatives have been introduced over the past three years to reduce
    the cost of doing business in Ghana and have begun impacting positively on the
     business environment.      These improvements include the simplification of
     procedures for the acquisition of relevant environmental and tax certificates.
     According to the World Bank's 2006 Doing Business Report, the average time to
     register new businessfell to 81days in 2005, down from 85 days in 2004.

 6O.The modernisation and decentralisation of the operations of the Registrar-
     General's Department is currently being completed. At the Registrar-General's
     Department, the average time for registration has been reduced to 7 days for sole

                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                           Page 13 o f 38

   proprietorships and 14 days for limited companies. The average time for searches
   and retrieval of information has been reduced from 2 days to 30 minutes.

61.To further improve on the business registration, a fundamental review of the
   Business Registration and Licensing regime has been undertakenand documented.
   A feasibility study for the provision of Business Registration services by a self-
   financing executive agency has also been undertaken.         In addition, a business
   reform strategy and costed implementation plan has been developed.

62.A number of activities have been undertaken as follows: Conversion of data in
   manual registration files to an electronic database has been completed for all
   categories of business registrations. Hardware and networking infrastructure
   installation have been completed and the network infrastructure is in use;
   Registration software has been developed and installed on RGD's production
   machine and testing completed. New computers have been procured, installed
   and staff have been trained. We expect to go live by June 12006.

63.Government has also enacted a new Labour Law designed to amend and
   consolidate the laws relating to labour, employment, trades unions and industrial
   relations and has established a National Labour Commission to oversee the reform
   process.

64.The GCMS/GCNFT and other supporting automated systems continue to be the
   driving force in customs clearance at the Kotoka International Airport, and the
   Tema and Takoradi Ports. Average clearance time at the airport still remains at
   three days, while that for Tema and Takoradi ports have gone down from several
   weeks to 2 days.

65.The National Trade Policy was launched in February 2006. It has been widely
   disseminated through hard copies, media interviews and national road shows. The
   policy provides a framework to guide Government's decisions on domestic trade
   issues as well as international discussions relating to the WTO and ECOWAS. The
    policy also provides guidelines to the private sector for investment decisions. It is
   expected that the recently initiated Industry Policy development effort will equally
    help create the necessary enabling environment for business.

66.Trade Sector Support Programme (TSSP): Developed to operationalise the National
   Trade Policy, the TSSP was approved by Cabinet in August 2005, with key
    performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation established. Prioritizationof
   the TSSP activities has been undertaken and 3 key targets have been agreed -
    Export Round-Table, Tariff Advisory Board and Industrial Policy. Implementation of
    priority activities has begun. These are: assignment of clear responsibilities for
   TSSP project management and coordination; commencement of baseline surveys;
    and the convening of an industry forum in preparation for the formulation of the

                                                                                                   Schedule 1
                                                                                                Page 14 o f 38

    Industrial Policy. The Export Development Investment Fund Act will be reviewed
    and amended to allow for expanded assistance for export-oriented forms and non-
    export oriented forms in strategic sectors as well as support for distressed but
     potentially viable firms.

 67.Land Administration: Cabinet approved the institutional and legislative reforms of
    'One-Stop-Shop' registries. Four (4) out of eight (8) Land Title/Deed Registries
     have been established alongside the appointment of four (4) Registrars to handle
     land issues. This increases coverage to six regions to facilitate deed registration as
     a prelude to systematictitling.

 68.The 2006 tranche of the Private Sector Development Action Plan will be
     implementedthis year, including establishing 3 additional land deed registries and
     taking actions to further reducing time for registering businesses.

2.4 Improving Performanceof Rural Sector

Improve ruralsector farm and non-farmgrowth

  69.Ghana's population is mainly rural with over 60 percent of the population either
     directly in agriculture or agriculture related activities. Agriculture also constitutes
     about 36 percent of our GDP. Government therefore believes that a vigorous
     improvement of the methods of production and processing of agricultural produce
     can enhance the productivity in the sector thereby accelerating the growth of our
     economy in a way that will have significant impact on the lives of the majority of
     Ghanaians, especially the rural communities.

2.4.1 Agriculture Sector Development

  70,Additional steps taken by Government to improve growth in the rural sector
      include the development of the Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy
      (FASDEP) which is intended to promote rural development through modernised
     agriculture. The preparation process has been participatory in approach and
      seven thematic stakeholder groups formed to undertake the consultations. The
     final document is expected to be ready by the end of August 2006.

  71.A rolling three-year draft strategic plan, currently covering 2006-2008 has been
      developed with well-defined poverty reduction approaches. The strategic plan was
      developed based on the recommendations of the Poverty and Social Impact
      assess men^' (PSIA) carried out for the Economic transformation                     of the Agricultural



37The PSIAs was one o f five studies carried out in 2004 as part o f the Government's aim o f generating feedback
from experiences emanating from the implementation o f the GPRS policy reforms into the planning and policy
formulation framework.

                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 15 of 38

    sector. Once the FASDEP is completed, it will also inform the Strategic plan. The
    current Plan has been costed and the budgetary gaps identified will funded by the
    Agricultural Services Sub-sector Investment Project (AgSSIP), TIPCEE and DFID.
    The two poorest districts in each of the 10 regions in Ghana have been selected as
    pilots for pro-poor interventions.

72.We intend, as part of reform measures this year, to implement the FASDEP.
    Measures we will undertake include finalisation of irrigation policy document
    consistent with the FASDEP, transferring the management of delivery systems to
    water user groups. We also intend to increase the uptake of improved seeds and
    planting materials for food crops and fro export. We will continue to focus on
    reducing post harvest losses and increasingagro-processing activities.

 73.All these initiatives in the sector are being undertaken in the context of
    achievement of the overall goal of GPRS I1which requires agriculture to continue
    to grow at the rate of 6 percent per annum over the next four years. This is
    crucial if we are to make the kind of development progressthat we desire and also
    achieve the MDGs. Indeed the importance of agriculture has led to Ghana's focus
    on agriculture in its use of the funds from the MillenniumChallengeAccount.


2.4.2. Improved Managementof Natural Resources

 74.In 2005, Government made good its pledge to undertake the implementation of
    the management of the forest resources strategy which included the allocation of
    commercial timber rights in natural forests and plantations through a competitive
    bidding process. Six (6) Timber Utilization Contracts (TUCs) areas were allocated
    through competitive bidding process.         In a further action, government also
    approved the replacement of timber concessions lost by 36 timber companies.

 75.Government has also converted existing Timber leases into TUCs in accordance
    with the existing legislation.      A pilot forest yield assessment programme
    undertaken in these 12 forest reserve areas are to help determine a scientific basis
    for conversion of all exiting timber leases. Preliminary inventory reports of these
    12 pilot concessionsto be converted to TUCs have been prepared by the Resource
    Management Support Centre (RMSC) of the Forestry Commission (FC). The final
    inventory is expected this year as input for the determination of the timber rights
    fee to be paid by leaseholders.

 76.To facilitate the competitive bidding process, a          harmonized institutional
    arrangement for plantations development was pursued by the Department of
    Plantations of FC. Much of the information on these activities of the FC are
    available on the Commission's web site; http://www.fcahana.com.        In addition,
    discussions and sensitisation workshops have been held with major stakeholders

                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 16of 38

    including chiefs and industry captains to inform, educate and seek the cooperation
    of these groups.      Vigorous monitoring is being done to reduce the illegal
    harvesting of timber trees and trade malpractices

77.The on-going plantation development programme had by mid 2005 cleared 8,231
    hectares of degraded forests for planting and about 6,475 hectares of new
    plantation had been developed. Other measures to improve the management of
    our timber resources include awareness creation of the economic potential of
    bamboo and rattan as alternatives to timber. About 300 people were trained in
    bamboo furniture, crafts and construction during the year. Two Made-in-Ghana
    Bamboo products fairs were organised during the past year to expose the resource
    to target groups.

 78.Governmentwill continue to implement its strategy for the management
    of forestry resources by increasing the budget execution of the Forestry
    Commission to enable itto carry out the following measures:            - allocation
    of new Timber Utilisation Contracts (TUCs); the conversion of existing
    leases into TUCs; and design and implement a log tracking system. All
    these will be done in accordance with the Financial Administration
    Regulations.

2.4.3 President'sSpecial Initiatives (PSIS)

 79.The President's Special Initiative (PSI), established to expand and add value to
    non-traditional exports to help diversify the economy, create employment and
    improve local livelihoods continues to be operational in four areas - Cassava
    starch, Oil palm, Salt, Textiles and Garments.      A policy framework has been
    developed to articulate Government's facilitating and handholding role and the
    private sector's role in implementation.

 80.Over the past three years, the Cassava Starch Initiative has established a pilot
    commerciaI agricuIturaI production and processing faciIity that produces
    international quality starch and positioned Ghana as a quality starch producer for
    the food and beverage industry worldwide. The PSI Starch has facilitated orders
    from international and local companies amounting to 10,000 metric tonnes,
    representing about 50 percent of the installed capacity of the pilot plant. The PSI
    Starch has also facilitated the signing of an MOU with a consortium to set up three
    20,000 metric tonne capacity cassava starch processing factories in Ghana and a
    further 20 such plants to process cassava into food grade starch and into ethanol
    for the petroleum industry.

 81.The strategy under the Garments and Textiles initiative, set up to develop
     production and human capacity while addressing the problem of peri-urban
     poverty, is also to entice established foreign large-scale market suppliers to

                                                                               Schedule 1
                                                                            Page 17 o f 38

   relocate production facilities in Ghana. Thus far, its success stories include
   supporting 10 Ghanaian companies to gain access to production facilities that
   Technology Training Centre which trains between 300 - 400 machine operators
   enable them to meet international quality standards, setting up a Clothing

   each month. Similar facilities are being established in the two other large cities,
    Kumasi (which is 90 percentcomplete) and Takoradi.

82. The thrust of the Oil Palm initiative is to produce to take advantage of the huge
    existing market opportunity in the ECOWAS sub-region. To date, nurseries
    producing two million seedlings per year have been developed in 12 locations and
    seed nut capacity has been boosted from 250,000 (pre-PSI) to over 4 million as at
    end-2005. Contract extension services delivery has been established and 12
    outgrower support units formed to provide technical and corporate decision-
    making support to farmer groups. The use of land as equity based on the
    traditional "abusa" system has been initiated and 300,000 hectares so far has been
    pledged around the 31 nurseries. A prospectus for private placement has been
    prepared to attract private sector strategic investment.

83.The Salt initiative has a target of raising national raw salt output from the existing
    150,000 tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes by 2010 to form the basis of a viable Chlor-
    Alkali industry in the long-term. To date, industry structure and capacity review
    studies have been undertaken. Technical assistance and training have been
    delivered to enhance the productivity of artisanal and medium-scale operators.
    Credit extension to the industry through EDIF has been established and export
    contracts for high-grade salt to La Cote d'Ivoire have been secured for industry
    leaders. Fifteen companies have been assisted to re-design salt works and new
    brine management techniques have been introduced. Other support includes
    business plans for extensions of salt works for 14 small companies and soil tests
    and survey at selected sites.


3.0   Improving Service Deliveryfor Human Development

 84,GPRS I1 emphasizes human development as a priority. It indicates that the main
    aim in this area is to ensure the development of a knowledgeable, well trained and
    disciplined labour force. Such a labour force will possess the capacity to drive and
    sustain private sector-led growth, have the right to basic social services such as
    education, health care, safe drinking water, sanitation, decent housing. It is
    expected that investing in these areas will improve the well-being of Ghanaians
    and ensure the protection of the vulnerable. With these objectives in mind,
     improving on service delivery in this area requires in addition to increasing
     investments in the social sectors, a focus of improving on efficiency in spending.

3.1 Education

                                                                              Schedule 1
                                                                           Page 18 of 38


 85.In 2005, the main focus of activities was on increasing access to education,
    improving the quality of education delivery, and ensuring gender parity in schools.
    The intensification of efforts in implementing the Education Strategic Plan (ESP)
    was among other things to facilitate the attainment of the targets of Universal
    Primary completion earlier than the target year of 2015, and gender parity in
    schools by the end of 2005.

3.1.1Increaseaccess, completionandqualityinbasiceducation, particularly
in the3most deprivedregions(Northern, UpperEastand Upper West)

 86.Access to education showed positive trends as a result of policy actions and
    increased resources being invested in the sector. As a result, though Ghana
    missed the achievement in the gender parity goal of the MDG in 2005, there are
    strong indicationsthat the gap in enrolmentswill soon be closed. In this regard we
    will pursue with greater vigour, the implementation of girls education programmes
    with special emphasis on areas with low Gender Parity Index GPI).

 87.Following on from the 2004 policy action of the introduction of Capitation Grants
    for 53 deprived districts, Government, in the 2005/2006 academic year, extended
    the Capitation grants scheme to pupils in all public basic schools in the country.
    This meant that in addition to fee-free tuition in public basic schools, no levies or
    fess of any sort were to be charged by District Assemblies or schools. Government
    paid an amount of $30,000 for every pupil enrolled. The total cost of this initiative
    was about $130 billion for the 2005/06 academic year.

 88.The Capitation Grant Scheme was implemented in response to studies which had
    shown that one of the main barriers to attendance at school was that of levies
    charged by schools to raise funds for repairs, cultural and sporting activities. This
    had the effect of deterring many families, particularly the poorest, from sending
    their children to school. With the payment of the Capitation Grant by Government
    to all public basic schools, an important financial barrier has been removed and
    schools are being compensated for the loss of revenue they face as a result of
    abolition of these fees and levies.

 89.The utilisation of the Capitation Grant has been designed to empower schools to
    effectively use financial resources to plan and carry out school quality
    improvement activities. The process of planning these school-level activities is
    required to be participatory and transparent and School Management Committees
    and ParentTeacher Associations are being actively involved in the formulation and
    implementation of these plans.

                                                                                                 Schedule 1
                                                                                             Page 19 of 38
  90.Preliminary3* data from the Ghana Education Service indicates a substantial
     increase in enrolments numbers across public schools in the country. Whereas the
     increase in Gross Primary Enrolments over the past few years have been an
     average of 1.73 percent per annum, preliminary figures received from the districts
     have recordedthe following estimated results:




    Pre-school                       25.5                       30.8                           5.3
    Primary                          83.3                       92.7                          9.4
    Junior Secondary                 70.2                       76.1                           5.9



  91.Today, we are looking increases in enrolment of at least 9 percent for primary
     level and around 6 percentfor Junior Secondary level.

  92.With the introduction of capitation grants, enrolment of girls at all levels of basic
     education has also been given a strong boost as shown in the table below:


           Level/Year           2004/2005 (Yo)         I  2005/2006    (O/O)         Increase in female
                                                                                       enrolments (%)
    Pre-school                       25.1                       30.6                           5.5
    Primary                          80.3                       90.2                           9.9
    Junior Secondaty                 65.6                       71.8                           6.2
    School

  93.Deprived districts, which are in their second year of implementation of the
     Capitation Grant Scheme, are recording increasing enrolments around 80 percent,
     up from 76 percent for the previous academic year. The Northern, Upper East and
     Upper West regions each registered Gross Primary Enrolments of 92.8, 90.5 and
     84.6 percent respectively.

  94.While it is too early to talk about the impact of capitation, anecdotal evidence
     obtained through visits to selected schools in deprived districts indicate a major
     change in enrolments resulting from this measure. Pupils that had previously
     dropped out of school are returning as a result of this initiative and in some cases,
     as many as 33 percent of pupils had returned to school. But, the rise in enrolments
     resulting from implementation of the Capitation Grant Scheme has direct
     implicationsfor classrooms, teachers, teaching and learning equipment.



38EducationManagement InformationSystems data to confirm these results will only be available inMay 2006.

                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                         Page 20 o f 38

95.There is an extra demand for 15,410 classrooms given the national norm of 40
   pupils per classroom. Also in view of the national Pupil: Teacher Ratio (PTR) norm
   of 35 pupils to one teacher, 17,612 more teachers are needed. Both of these
   shortfalls are without taking into account the number of classrooms and teachers
   needed prior to the introduction of capitation. There is also the need for an
   increase in the supply of textbooks and other teaching and learning materials. We
   intend to ensure timely delivery of core textbooks to all primary schools.
   Payments towards examinations will also increase appreciably and factored into
   the resource requirements of the sector.

96,Government is however poised to meet the challenges we face as a result of
   capitation.    Measures include the introduction of the shift system where
   practicable, and use of other buildings as temporary classrooms. We intend to
   expand basic school infrastructure to meet the high enrolments we are
   experiencing currently. A strategy is therefore being drawn up for the provision of
   infrastructure and more teachers are being recruited. In the interim, the services
   of volunteer teachers are being engaged.

97.Although at the start of the school year, the national target PTR of 35:l at primary
   level had been achieved, there were variations in PTR between districts. While PTR
   for Upper East region was 40:1, there were districts within that region registering
   PRRs of 72:l. In other areas very low PTRs of 24:l were being recorded. There
   was thus a clear need for more effective deployment of teachers. With the
   substantial jump in enrolments we are recording, there is an urgent need to
   improve on pupil: teacher ratios.

98.The District Assemblies Sponsorship Scheme for teacher Trainees introduced to
   address the issue of lack of teachers in remote areas and deprived districts,
   continues to receive strong support. District Assemblies sponsored4,163 (48%) of
   the 8,640 trainee teachers in 2004/05 academic year. Total enrolment in 2005/06
   academic was 8,989 and 98 percent of these were sponsored by districts. The
   programme for training untrained teachers also continues, with 6,255 untrained
   teachers so far enrolled. Through new recruitment and expansion of current
   training programme, it is our aim to reduce teacher vacancies especially in
   deprived districts.

99.Actions are also being taken to improve the supply of textbooks, teaching and
   learning materials. Government's target of every child having access to a textbook
   in each of the three core subjects has been met for the three core textbooks of
    English, Mathematics and Science for basic schools. Other actions being taken to
   improve education quality include further development and implementation of
   education assessment mechanisms such as the National and School Education
   Assessments, and ContinuousAssessments (NEA, SEA, CA).

                                                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                                                         Page 21 o f 38

  100.         For the 2005/06 academic year, the Education Management Information
       System (EMIS) has been expanded to include all levels of education - from basic
       to tertiary. Data collected is currently being processed. It is expected that draft
        reports will be available by end April 2006.


3.1.2Improve efficiencyandequityoffinancingeducation withattentionto
greaterpoverty impact

  101. If in previousyears, there was the need to improve on efficiency in management
        and resource use, with the current policy actions being implemented, the need is
        even greater. The strategy of decentralising administration and management
        functions to schools is progressing under the new policy environment. School
        Management Committees have been established in all basic schools, and Annual
        School Performance Improvement Plans whose preparation is participatory are
        contributing to increased decentralisedfinancial management and reporting.

  102. To further decentralise administration, we are introducing school operating
        budgets through the capitation grant scheme.                            District Education Offices and
        schools are setting up special accounts3' into which funds for capitation are being
        deposited. Ghana EducationService internal auditors will monitor school accounts
        and will conduct at least one audit of the utilisation of capitation grants half-yearly
        and submit reports to the School Management Committees, District and Regional
        Directorsof Education.

  103. Parents and communities continue to engage with schools and forging
        partnerships which will ultimately strengthen system efficiency in the education
        sector and also improve local governance and accountability.

  104. Budget execution of non-salary expenditures has improved significantly over the
        years. We intend to increase budget execution of non-salary expenditures to not
        less than 90 percent in 2006. We also intend to increase the proportion of public
        recurrent education expenditure spent on basic education.

  105. Spending in deprived districts continues to improve. Government funds for non-
        salary expenditures improved from 13.5 percent in 2004 to 21.5 percent in 2005 in
        53 deprived districts. Budget execution for non-salary expenditures for 2005 was
        125 percent of the planned expenditure for administrative, services and
        investment expenditures combined.




39In support of capitation, Ghana Commercial Bank is waiving all service charges on Capitation Grant Accounts operated within
their branches as their contribution towards the success of the programme.

                                                                            Page22 of 38

 106. The Education Bill is currently in the process of being finalised and submitted to
    Cabinet for its review and approval.

 107. The expected outcomes for the education sector by end of the medium term
    include an increase in access with national GPER improving to 98.0 percent in
    2008/09.   Gender parity is expected to improve especially with the capitation
    grants and girl's GPER is expected to increase to 98.0 percent in 2008/09, thus
    achieving gender parity.


3.2 Health

 108. The key objectives in health care are to increase geographical and financial
    access to basic health services and provide better quality of care in the provision
    of health services. As the health Sector implements its last year of its Second
    Programme of work, the objective of bridging inequality gaps in health outcomes
    therefore remains as relevant as ever.

 109. Health indicators in 2005 continued to register mixed progress, and the current
    review of the 2005 programme of work for the sector suggests the sector has
    witnessed many changes and more change is on the way. There are strong
    indicationsthat there is a clear need for consolidation within the sector, a need for
    increasedclarity and an increasedfocus of getting things right.


3.2.1 Bridge equity gaps in access to quality health care services (Northern,
UpperEasf, Upper Westand Central)

 110.The focus of health sector programmes in 2005 was on service provision with
    emphasis on tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, guineaworm eradication, the
    Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), Buruli Ulcer and reproductive and
    child health. Health outcomes continued to show mixed results. And in some
    cases deprived areas continued to show greater improvements in outcomes than
    the better endowed ones.

 111.As part of measuresfor improving health care delivery, efforts are being madeto
    improve human resource management. In 2005, following on from the policy
    measure of exploring options for decentralising Personal Emoluments, Cabinet
    approved the proposal to decentralise human resource management on a pilot
    basis to the Teaching Hospitals and the regional levels of the Ghana Health
    Service. A task team, led by the Ministry of Public Sector Reforms and comprising
    representativesfrom the Ministries of Health, Finance and Economic Planning and
    Controller and Accountant-General's Department was established to prepare a
    proposal for implementation. The task team has finalised and costed its proposal,

                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 23 of 38
    estimated at $11.2 billion to cover infrastructure and systems development as well
    as training and orientation of staff. We intend to begin actual implementation of
    the proposal in 2006.

 112. To allow for regular assessment of the various human resources for health
    reforms being implemented and to guide the development of future policy, a
    system for routine data collection on human resources is in place. A service
    availability mapping involving a headcount of health workers has been completed
    and is awaiting data entry and analysis. A joint World Bank and Ministry of Health
    mission has been organised on this and follow-up mission is expected shortly.

 113. As a complement to this, the human resource policy and strategy document is in
    the process of being revised. The draft document is being synchronised with the
    next health policy and 5-Year Programme of Work for the health sector. A series
    of stakeholder consultations is planned and the human resource policy document
    is expectedto be competed by end June 2006.

 114. To sustain coverage and increase the quality of health services, Government
    intends, starting from this year, to scale up the training of middle level health
    personnel, that is, medical assistants, midwives and health assistants. Health
    promotion and nutrition will also be emphasised as part of broad Government
    strategy to promote good health among Ghanaians to enable us achieve the
    majority of the health-related MDGs.

 115. To increase utilisation of health services and improve maternal health, the policy
    of exempting payments for maternal deliveries has been extended to all regions.
    Deliveries in all district health centres are exempt from payments. Supervised
    delivery coverage nationwide improved to 54.2 percent in 2005 as compared with
    53.4 percent in 2004, regionally disaggregated data showed mixed results for the
    year. While for some regions there was an increase, other regions showed
    evidence of a slight decline. Some of this has been attributed to the bottlenecks in
    the flow of funds for maternal exemptions but the sector review is exploring the
    underlying reasons for the trends so far.


3.2 2 EnsuringSustainable FinancingArrangements thatProtect thePoor
   I




 116. In furtherance of Government's promise to improve the population's access to
     health services in a more humane manner than under the "Cash and Carry''
    system, the National Health Insurance System continues to receive the full support
    of government.

                                                                              Schedule 1
                                                                           Page24 of 38

117. The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was set up to provide affordable
  access to health care for all citizens especially the poor and vulnerable. Activities
  in 2005 focused on management set up, awareness creation, infrastructure
  development, implementationpolicy streamlining and the actual implementation of
  the scheme, among others.

118. By the end of 2005, 123 District Mutual Health Schemes had been established
  and 111were managing claims. As at the end of the year, 3,573,231 people had
  been enrolled as members of the District/Municipal/Sub-metro Mutual Health
  Insurance Schemes.        This represents 17.8 percent registration coverage
  nationwide compared to the 10 percent target set for the year.               Members
  registered who were in the exempt category (Le. the aged, children less than 18
  years whose parents have fully paid up their contributions and indigents) were
  about 70 percent.    The indigents made up 2.1 percent of total registrants. We
  will endeavour to accelerate and sustain the implementation of the National Health
  Insurance Scheme with a view to increasing the share of population registered.

119. The object of the National Health Insurance Fund is to provide finance to
  subsidise the cost of healthcare services to members of District Mutual Health
  Insurance Schemes licensed by the National Health Insurance Council. On the

  billion in 2006 from its two major sources of funds - namely the National Health
  basis of projections made, the NHIF is assumed to realise an amount of $1,513.7

  Insurance Levy and the 2% percent of personal contributions Social Security and
  National Insurance Trust (SNIT) Pension Fund.        The formula for the distribution
  of the National Health Insurance Fund for 2006 will be presently shortly to
  Parliament in accordancewith the national Health InsuranceAct.

120. To ensure that the poor do not lose out during the transition to full
  implementation of the National Health Insurance Programme, Government
  continues to fund the exemptions payments in the health sector.              A total of
  4139.2 billion cedis was provided in the National Health Insurance Fund for
  indigents. A provision of $13 billion was also made in the health Ministry's budget
  for 2006 for general exemptions and $50 billion cedis was provided for from HIPC
  to fund exemptionsfor maternal delivery.

121. Government intends to increase health spending to accelerate progress
  towards the MDGs and ensure that its budget allocations to the health
  sector increases to compensate for the reduction in donor contribution
  to the health fund. Government will also increase the execution rate of
  the non-salary health budget and district level allocations.

122. The ultimate aim for these actions in the health sector is that utilisation of health
  services in deprived areas will increase, the health status of the population

                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 25 of 38

    improved and the inequities between regions especially for the deprived regions
    reduced.


3.3 Reducingthe spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic

 123. Ghana continues to focus on HIV/AIDS prevention as a key element in its aim of
    achieving sustainable poverty reduction. Also, given the low costs of prevention
    relative to treatment it makes sense to pay attention to it. Programmes for safer
    sex particularly among the most vulnerable, reducing mother-to-child transmission
    and promoting voluntary counselling and testing continue to receive attention, as
    does increasing Anti-retroviral Treatment (ART) for Persons Living with HIV/AIDS
    (PWLHAs).

 124.The ART programme started in May 2003 and five Treatment sites had been
    established as at December 2005 to supply ARTs to HIV/AIDS patients. These
    sites are: - Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Atua
    Government Hospital, St. Martins Hospital in Agomanya and Koforidua Regional
    Hospital.

 125. Currently only about 4,000 out of the recorded 71,000 of PWLHAs who needed
    ARTs are on drugs and there are efforts to ensure that this increases to 15,000
    persons by the end of 2006. In support of this, by the end of April 2006, all ten
    regional hospitals will begin administration of the therapy to patients to further
    make accessibility to ARTs easier for PLWHAs.       The regional hospitals have all
    been given the necessary training in addition to the supply of drugs and the
    Cluster of Differentiation (CD4) equipment for testing and monitoring of patients.

  126. In addition to the 10 regional hospitals which will soon start treatment, some
    selected districts which have higher prevalence rates of the pandemic and are
     highly populated will be included in the exercise to expand ARTs administration.
    At the moment sufficient drugs have been imported into the country to forestall
    shortages. Through these measures, we aim to scale up the provision of ART for
     people with advanced HIV.

  127. A National Monitoring and Evaluation Framework based on the Strategic
     Framework and Five-Year Plan of work was finalised. National M&E indicators
     have been developed in consultation with key partners. The expected outcome for
     HIV/AIDS is a national prevalence below 5 percent by end 2008.


3.4    Malaria

                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                         Page 26 o f38
128. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity in Ghana and is the single most
  important cause of mortality among children under five years and pregnant
  women and is responsible for a substantial number of miscarriages and low birth
  weight among pregnant women. Apart from the health consequences of malaria,
  it puts a heavy burden on economic development. It accounts for a significant
  portion of the disease burden, causing about 10.6 percent of lost Disability
  Adjusted Life Years (DALY) and costing an equivalent of about 3 percent of GDP
  annually in economic burden. It is for these reasons that GPRS I1prioritizes the
  control of malaria as part of interventions in the health sector.          Ghana is
  implementing a Roll Back Malaria Strategic Plan in 2000 which it is implementing.

129. The areas of focus in 2005 were both in curative and in preventive care.
  Activities focused on improving case management of uncomplicated and severe
  malaria in all health facilities and household levels; and improving malaria
  prevention - focusing on promoting the use of Insecticide Treated (bed) Nets
  (ITNs), especially by children and pregnant women, Intermittent Preventive
  Treatment (IPT) and advice on environmental management. During the year

  are creating and trying to sustain partnerships for malaria control - partnership
  malaria control activities implemented in all districts in Ghana were scaled up. We

  between Government and NGOs, between the private sector and communities and
  private healers.

130. As a result of all these interventions, progress is being made in various areas.
  OPD cases attributed to malaria have been dropping since 2003, and the national
  under-five case malaria fatality rate has improved from 3.7 percent in 2002 to 2.4
  percent in 2005. For ITNs, reports from the 20 global fund districts indicate that
  the share of children under-five years sleeping in ITNs has increased from below
   10 percent in 2002 to almost 25 percent in 2005. Similarly, pregnant women
  sleeping under ITNs have also increased from around 5 percent in 2002 to about
   25 percent in 2005 in the same pilot districts.

131. To sustain the progress being made, the malaria programme will focus among
   others, on increasing the share of children under-five and pregnant women
   sleeping under ITNs. Efforts to roll back malaria will be supported by increasing
   funding and capacity for research, and focusing the research agenda while
   improving the dissemination and utilization of results.

                                                                                                  Schedule 1
                                                                                              Page27 of 38

3.5 Special Programmesfor the Vulnerable and Excluded


  132. A significant proportion of Ghanaians including children, unemployed youth,
      women, persons with disabilities and the elderly either do not reach their full
      human potential or cannot contribute effectively to economic growth and
      sustainable social development due to their vulnerability or their exclusion. Their
      needs cut across many sectors and their human resource development can only be
      addressed through an overarching Social Protection Strategy, a draft of which has
      been prepared and along with its costing. It is to be validated by stakeholders.
      In addition, the National Youth Policy is expected to receive Cabinet approval this
      year.

3.6 Water and Sanitation


3.6.1 Increase access to safe water and sanitation coverage for rural and small town
populations

  133. Coverage for rural water has been increasing steadily for the past five years.
      From a base of 41 percent in 2000, it increasedto 43 percent in 2001, 46 percent
      in 2003 and 51.7 percent at the end of 2004.                        In 2005, it increased to 52
       percent4'. During the period January to December 2005, there was construction of
       1,268 new boreholes, 7 new piped systems and the rehabilitation of 14 existing
       boreholes facilitated by the Community Water and Sanitation Agency.

  134. Government continues to fully subsidise the provision of safe water in
      guineaworm endemic areas. HIPC funds have so far provided for 382 boreholes
       (the majority fitted with handpumps) in guineaworm endemic areas between 2002
       and 2004. From January to December 2005, Ghana reported 3,981 cases of
       guineaworm disease, a 45 percent reduction in cases compared to 7,275 cases for
       the same period in 2004. The number of districts reporting cases dropped from 57
      to 48, with the Northern region reporting about 75 percent of the total number of
       cases. There were significant reductions in nearly all the top 20 most endemic
       districts, with the exception of 4 districts.

  135. However, we continue to face challenges with eradication of guinea worm in
       Ghana today. 21 villages from nine districts reported significant increases during
      July and December 2005. The inability of our community-based volunteers to
       detect many cases within 24 hours of worm emergence appears to be the single



40This is a marginal increase but it must be noted that the 2005 figures on achievements in facility delivery are
provisional.

                                                                              Schedule 1
                                                                            Page28 o f 38
    most important factor impeding improving containment of the disease. The
    challenge of poor attitudinal change continues to slow down the pace of
    eradication. The need for more security for field staff, improved motivation for
    volunteers and the lack of a more comprehensive and sensitive community-based
    surveillancecontinue to impede progress.

 136. Actions being taken to improve coverage for both urban and rural water include
    preparation of the National Water Policy which will shortly be submitted to
    Cabinet. The policy has benefited from extensive consultation with stakeholders.
    Implementation of the policy will ensure improved coordination, efficiency in
    funding and better management of interventions. The approved sector policy will
    drive the investment plans currently being prepared.

 137. In addition, the Community Water and Sanitation Agency's Strategic Investment
    Plan covering a ten-year period from 2005-2015 has been approved. It reflects
    the requirements on Ghana's meeting the MDG for water, The accompanying
     medium term implementation plan for rural water is also expected to be completed
     by the middle of 2006. Work is on-going to disaggregate the ten-year investment
     programme by region and district and this will form the basis of the District Water
    and Sanitation Plans.

 138. Sufficient investments for the provision of safe water have been lacking for the
     past 30 to 40 years. The preparation of investment plans is therefore critical for
     both urban and rural water. For rural water, part of the problem is a lack of
    absorptive capacity while for urban water, the issue is that much of the
     infrastructure is old, requires rehabilitation or needs to be replaced.

 139. On sanitation, a National Sanitation Policy is being developed under the
     leadership of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development.

 140.To further enhance the efficiency and sustainability of systems already in place,
     attention will be given to improving and regular monitoring investments already in
     place and strengthening routine maintenance.


4.0 Improving Governanceand PublicSector Management

 141. Ghana's broad objective in the area of good governance is to empower state and
     non-state entities to participate in the development process and to contribute to
     promoting peace and stability. Government's commitment to good governance is
     reflected in the continued efforts in strengthening administrative and managerial
     capacity of the public sector.

                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 29 of 38

4,l Public Financialand Expenditure Management

 142. Government has made appreciable progress with improving Public Expenditure
    Management and the requisite legal and institutional framework is being
    implemented. Detailsare provided in the sections below:

4.1.1 Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Financial
ManagementLaws

 143. To ensure effective and efficient financial management as required by the
    Financial Administration Act, the Controller and Accountant-General's Department
    has aligned the treasuries, that is, treasuries are being made Ministry-specific and
    integrated with the accounting or finance departments of the MDAs.             Sub-
    Consolidated Funds Bank accounts have also been opened for each Ministry,
    District Assembly, and Regional Co-ordinating Council. Releases of funds to MDAs
    in Accra are lodged in the Ministerial sub-consolidated funds account but releases
    for MDAs in the Regions and Districts are lodged directly into the Regional or
    District Sub-consolidated Fund bank accounts respectively.        A draft of the
    accounting manual has been developed as part of implementation of the Financial
    Administration Act and is being finalised.

 144. In the area of procurement, good progress has been made. The Board of
    Directors and the Chief Executive of the Public Procurement Board have been
    appointed and senior staff appointments are expected to be completed by end
    May 2006. Coverage of Entity Tender Committees (ETCs) is at nearly 100 percent
    at MDA level and about 50 percent at MMDA level.

 145. The Public Procurement Board (PPB) has prepared draft Procurement Guidelines
    and Procurement Regulations which are being reviewed for final approval by
    Parliament. Training Programmes have been developed and ETCs and Tender
    Review Boards are currently being trained. Other target groups for training such as
    Suppliers and constitutionally mandated institutions like Parliament, Judiciary and
    the media will receive training shortly. A software programme to assist entities in
    preparingand updating procurement plans is being developed.

 146. Other measures are being taken to with the aim of improving on the
    professionalism of procurement within the public sector. Planning Committees
    have also been inaugurated in MDAs to ensure proper procurement programming.
    There has been a successful trial test of benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating
    tools. The sample size of the trial test was an assessment of 100 entities, made up
    of small, medium and large spending institutions. An assessment of an additional
    100 entities will be undertaken by end September 2006.

                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 30 o f 38

 147. Government will continue to ensure that the provisions of the Public
    Procurement Act are fully implemented and applied including the
    submission to the PPB of procurement plans by key MDAs soon after the
    approval of the Consolidate Fund budget and the publicationof the PPB's
    monthly bulletin containing detailed information on upcoming tenders,
    contract awards and resolution of complaints.

 148. We also intend to submit to Parliament, the PPB's annual progress report on the
    implementation of the Public Procurement Act, measuring the effect of the law on
    ensuring value for money in government purchases and on the business
    community, such as suppliers, contractorsetc.

 149. Progress is also being made in the area of auditing. The Internal Audit Agency
    has been staffed and is operational. Internal Audit Agency Units have been
    established and functioning in 23 out 27 MDAs and in 6 MMDAs. A Director-
    General has been appointed as well as 9 Audit managers. The IAA has submitted
    its first Annual Report to Parliament. Draft Internal Audit Regulations, Standards,
    Audit Programmes and an Internal Audit Manual to guide auditing in MDAs and
    MMDAs as required under the IAA Act have been prepared and are under review.
    The establishment of Internal Audit Units as provided in the IAA Act, will be
    completedthis year for the remaining MDAs.

 150. This year, the Auditor-General will submit the 2005 audited accounts for the
    Consolidated Fund and MDAsto Parliament as required under the law.


4.1.2 Budget and Public Expenditure Management System

 151. Government is fully committed to the implementation of the Budget and Public
    Expenditure Management Systems (BPEMS). Eight MDAs are already connected to
    BPEMS at 14 Sites and have been ready to use the system since January 2006.
    The Oracle Application Reporting System (General Ledger Module) is running
    parallel with the current ACCPAC and NITS for the production of the accounts for
    the Consolidated Fund.

 152. As a follow up to developing the budget formulation based on a medium term
    framework, the Public Sector Budgeting (PSB) Module under the Oracle Financial
    Management System is currently completed. The 2006 - 2008 Budget is being
    captured as a parallel system to Activate. The aim is to adopt the PSB Module to
    prepare the Budget from 2007 onwards.

 153. Eight key MDAs are fully set up, and are on on-line operations. These include
    the Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning (including CAGD), Health
    (including Ghana Health Service), Education and Sports, Local Government and

                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 31of 38

  Rural Development, Water Resources Works and Housing, Communicationand the
  Audit Service, are currently running the system for their operations. These MDAs
  are systems ready, the staff are trained and are now operational. In addition, the
  Office of the President (Government Machinery) is fully set up, and ready for
  operation when the network connectivity is made active.

154. Interim measures have been implemented to address the delay in the online
  operations of the non-connected MDAs. These are Commitment Control Systems,
  Cash Management System and Reporting using Budget Management System
  (BMS), Accounting System (ACCPAC) and National Expenditure Tracking System
  (NETS).

155. An Application Desktop Integrator (ADI) has been installed and configured to
  capture the approved budget from ACTIVATE and Transaction Data from off-line
  MDAs into General Ledger Module of the Oracle Financials for comprehensive
  reporting. The Core Application Support Team is collaborating with the Oracle
  Experts to continue to provide support to MOFEP HQ, MOH, GHS, MLGRD, and the
  Audit Servicewhich are currently operating online.

156.The current rollout Plan for BPEMS is to complete 9 MDAs and then follow up
  with other MDAs in Accra. At non-connected MDAs and cost centres, the accounts
  will continue to be done offline and the information subsequently entered using
  the AD1 at the central or regional locations and uploaded into BPEMS. The User
  Hands-on Training Sessions started in January 2006 and will go on through to
  December 2006.

157. The bottleneck caused by the slow and unstable Wide Area Network has been
  resolved. Fibre Optic technology has been adopted to link up the 8 pilot MDAs, at
  18 sites.

158. The Support and Maintenance agreement of the Network provider, Siemens
  ATEA, was signed in March 2006 and support and maintenance resumed. Siemens
  has reviewed its contract with GoG to further expand the wide area network to the
  ten (10) regional capitals. It is expected that connectivity to the Regions would be
  completed by end December 2006.

159. In March 2006 the HP Servers were relocated to the new Financial Information
  Centre (FIC) and connected to the Fibre Optic WAN.

160. Sensitisation and Hands on Training have vigorously started for all the Users in
  the 8 Pilot MDAs. For comprehensive reporting using of BPEMS, the Application
  Desktop Integrator Software has been introduced to capture Cash Transcripts on
  Revenue and Expenditure transactions for all off line MDAs. Training on the AD1
  Software for Treasury Officers is scheduledto start April 2006.

                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 32 of 38


161. Upon resumption of maintenance services and extension of the network, all
    major Ministries would be able to conduct their financial transactions utilizing
    BPEMS. It is intended that a computerized financial and accounting system would
    be fully operational at the headquarters offices of the Ministry of Finance and
    Economic Planning and eight pilot line Ministrieswithin Accra and Tema. The core
    functionalities of the BPEMS would be utilized online for processing and reporting
    transactions.


4.1.3 Integrated Payroll and Personnel Database

162. The first quarter of 2006 registered significant progress in some of the transition
    and deployment activities. Test run was done on IPPD 2 on the October,
    November and December Payrolls. "Live Parallel" runs with IPPD 1commenced in
    January 2006 and is expected to continue to June 2006. We have successfully
    iterated January, February and March 2006 payrolls for pension.        Payroll and
    Pensions reports have been produced for almost all MDAs for validation by the
    Personnel and Payroll Section of CAGD.

163. Government will take actions to deepen payroll management and
    control, including by: having the new computerised payroll system
    online and fully operational, giving MDAs access to salary payment
    reports, on a monthly basis.

164. Between December, 2005 and March 2006, training sessions were organized for
    50 data entry clerks for IPPD 2 and a change management workshop will be
    organised for relevant stakeholders. Ghana Education Service will update key
    management personnel with current project and some key changes being
    introduced by IPPD 2.

165. Human Resource workshops have been organized for some of the key MDAs.
    These working sessions have proved useful in briefing the MDAs with the HR
    systems developed so far, and particularly to engage them on how to utilize the
    IPPD2 Human Resources module to improve their HRMS.

166. Data collection and collation of Subvented Agencies payroll have been completed
    for 135 subvented agencies and have been submitted in March 2006 for full
    loading and integration onto Oracle HRMS. This has been reviewed for
    convergence of pay structures and pay elements.         Shortcomings in the data
    collected have been highlighted in a written report has been submitted. It is
    expected that an Oracle database of the emoluments of subvented agencies would
    be part of the database of IPPD2 upon completion. All the measures are designed
    to improve the managementof our payroll and eliminate the abuses in the system.

                                                                              Schedule 1
                                                                            Page 33 of 38


 167. A short term action plan for the continued implementation of the Public Financial
    Management Reforms covering the years 2006 - 2009 is completed for
    implementation, with minimal changes on the costing and prioritization of the
    entire action plan. The short-term action plan will be updated this year.

4.1.4 Budget Formulation, Comprehensiveness and Reporting

 168. The funds from the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative have been
    reflected in the 2006 Budget with allocation by MDA. This has meant that
    Parliament has been able to approve HIPC expenditure concurrently with its
    approval of the expenditures under the consolidated fund. We intend to continue
    to broaden the comprehensivenessof the budget proposal.

 169.The register of loans and grants has been expanded to cover all loan and grant
    agreements and disbursements and has been published as part of the budget. In
    the 2007 budget, we will expand this to include information on technical assistance
    agreements in addition to that on loans and grants agreements and
    disbursements.

 170. CAGD has prepared final accounts of 2005 accounts of MDAs for Auditor General
    to review and prepare its report to Parliament. The CAGD reports will be
    broadened to include revenue and expenditure information on externally-funded
    projects and retained internally-generatedfunds.

  171. The 2005 weighted average of the budget deviation index for poverty related
    expenditures improved to 15.8 percent compared to 19 percent in 2004 and 21
    percent in 2003.


4.2 PublicSector Reforms

4.2.1 Implement Refocused Public Sector Reform

  172. When Government created a Ministry of Public Sector Reforms in May 2005, it
    was an acknowledgement that the implementation of fundamental public sector
     reforms was critical to the achievement of its vision.         During the year, a
     comprehensive work programme for the reforms in the public sector was
     developed with stakeholders, the objectives of which are to deliver efficient, cost
     effective public services that would improve the living conditions of the population
     and to make public organisations responsiveto the needs of the private sector.

  173. Based on lessons drawn from the past, the approach of the re-launched
     programme is to create sustainable momentum that can be built upon. Though

                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 34 of 38

   the work programme appears ambitious, we recognise the need to break down the
   programme into a number of step changes that are realistic, that will gradually
   build change and create a sense of positive gain with clear benefits at each step or
   phase. These phases have been selected because they support each other to
   bring a concrete step in the way public sector performs.

174. Government will focus on a few achievable, very publicly visible reforms to
   sustain the momentum and support of key stakeholders. Through advocacy and
   public education, Government will provide planning, resource management and
   implementation support to sector Ministries for the implementation of reform
   initiatives identified in the comprehensive work programme using a phased
   approach.

175. Five areas for implementation are proposed with a focus in 2006 on the first
   phase. Our view is that while we need to have a clear vision of the programme as
   a whole. Detailed work planning needs to focus for now on the first phase. Based
   on this, Government intends to implement quick and specific activities to gain buy-
   in and support from key stakeholders. We also intend to establish basic conditions
   for reform such as improved human resource management and a regulatory
   framework for SubventedAgencies.

176. Government will continue implementation of a sequenced and prioritised public
   sector reform strategy by:

         0   Monetising non-cash allowances at the senior Civil Service Leadership
             level (Chief Directorsand Directors);
         0   Restructuring selected Central managementAgencies; and
         0   Continue reforming subvented agencies.


GovernanceInstitutions

177. Government's commitment to good governance remains firm. In pursuance of
   that, Parliament ratified the African Union (AU) and the United Nations Anti
   Corruption Laws Conventions on 14th December 2005. The Attorney-General is
    undertaking an indexation of all anti corruption Laws and the corresponding
   sanctions and enforcement regimes. Indeed the exercise is expected to be
   completed by end April 2006. The report has been sent for publication and will be
   disseminated as a single source for accessing information on all anti corruption
    laws.

 178.The Freedom of Information Bill is still under consideration at Cabinet.
    Government believes that further public dialogue and discussion will be required
    before it is laid before Parliament.

                                                                               Schedule 1
                                                                            Page35 of 38


179. Government believes good governance underpins economic development and
   therefore attaches great importance to further strengthening of governance
   institutions Government therefore completed the Africa Peer Review Mechanism
   (APRM) during 2005.        Through this action, Ghana became one of the first
   countries to adopt this mechanism of voluntary self-monitoring for member
   countries of the African Union.

180.This year, we intend to "domesticate" the UN and AU Anti Corruption
   Conventions to fit the Ghanaian context. As envisioned in Ghana's ratification of
   the conventions, we intend to present anti corruption reports to the UN and the
   AU.

181. As part of measuresto ensure that our commitment to improve good governance
   does not get thwarted by lack of resources, we intend to adopt best practice
   mechanisms for improving Government of Ghana funding of autonomous
   constitutionaI institutions.
Decentralisation

182. As part of government commitment and resolve to strengthen the District
   Assemblies and make them the main vehicle for the development activities at the
   local level, Government continued with the implementation of the National
   Decentralization Plan  .
183. A review of local government investmentfunding was completed in August 2005.
   A framework for decentralising the delivery of local public services focused on
   working out mechanisms for District Development Funding (DDF) which would
   allow all funds for local government investments including donor funding to follow
   harmonised guidelines is in progress. We will continue to take actions to
   implement this.

 184. A harmonised capacity building programme for local governmentswas developed
   following a review of the various capacity building initiatives.             Proposed
   performance indicators for MMDAs are available and functional and organizational
   Assessment Tool (FOAT) has been designed and is undergoing field testing. The
   FOPAT will provide elements to monitor progress in areas ranging from budgeting
   and accountingto organisational structure and management.

 185. Draft guidelines for district composite budgeting have been prepared by the
   Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning and Local Government and Rural
   Development. Twenty-five District Assemblies were selected to pilot the composite
   budgeting in 2006. The draft guidelines will be validated this year and the number
   of districts piloting the composite budget initiative is expected to be increasedto at
    least 50 MMDAs in 2007.

                                                                              Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 36 o f 38


186. Work on a framework to govern intergovernmental fiscal relations, clarifying
  expenditure responsibilities and revenue assignments has began with the
  preparationof three technical papers in December 2005.

187. The task we set ourselves of designing and validating the organisational
  structure including detailing out institutional relationshipsand core functions of the
   Local Government Service, the Regional Coordinating Council and MMDA levels is
   progressing well. A three-year Strategic Plan for the Local Government Service has
   been prepared including organisational set-ups for the Local Government Service
  Secretariat. Schemes and conditions of service have been prepared and the
  consolidation of three departments (Community Development, Births and Deaths
   Registry, Parks and Gardens) is being piloted. We will validate the organisational
  structure and core functions of the Local Government Service at the Secretariat,
   RGG and MMDA levels.


Monitoring and Evaluationof GPRS

188.Two main areas of progress are recorded in the area of monitoring and
   evaluation (M&E) - Institutional structures for M&E are being set up and
   operationalised and a database for monitoring and evaluation, GhanaInfo has been
   also developed. Detailsof these developments are as follows:

189. The M&E institutional arrangements have been designed to facilitate active
   participation of stakeholders to ensure that policy recommendations are relevant
   and actually contribute to policy formulation and resource allocation that are
   geared toward the reduction of poverty and wealth creation.

190. In this regard, the Project Oversight Committee and the Technical Committee
   have been inauguratedand a new PresidentialAdvisor for National Monitoring and
   Evaluation of Government Programmes has been appointed. Work at the technical
   committee level has started. Actions Plans for the operationalisation of monitoring
   and evaluation for the National Development Planning Commission and the Ghana
   Statistical Service have been completed and budgets are being prepared.

191. Regional Monitoring Groups set up in 2005 to collect and collate information at
   the regional level have been holding periodic meetings. However, guidance from
   the national level, as well as technical and financial resources, is yet to be
   provided to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of their role. Institutional
   arrangements to guide the operations of District Monitoring Groups (DMGs) have
   been defined and their roles and responsibilities have been communicated to the
   districts. However, the DMGs are yet to be inaugurated due to financial and
   logistical constraints.

                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                          Page 37 o f 38


192. GhanaInfo, a comprehensive national socio-economic database made up of a
  compilation of indicators relevant for planning development has been launched by
  the NDPC and the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS). GhanaInfo provides a unique
  opportunity of having a strong and coherent national system to disseminate a set
  of consistent data for effective monitoring and evaluation of national and
  international policies, programmesand targets.

193. Key indicators have been defined and GhanaInfo has been populatedwith these.
  As the official database for M&E in Ghana, GhanaInfo will enable the compilation
  and dissemination of indicators required for the monitoring of the GPRS, MDGs,
  Sector and Project Goals as well as development partner frameworks. We plan to
  make GhanaInfo available on the Internet.

194. MDAs in Accra, all ten Regional Monitoring Groups have been trained on the
  GhanaInfo. Training of the United Nations Development Group has also been
  undertaken. Plans have been drawn to cover all the 138 Districts but due to
  budgetary constraints, this is likely to begin with a pilot of three to six selected
  Districts in each Region between mid-May to end- June 2006.

195. It is expected that the use of the GhanaInfo database will provide availability of
  harmornised data, easy access to data, wide dissemination, and a user-friendly
  tool for presentation of information. In addition, it will greatly strengthen M&E,
  support inter-sectoral collaborationand promote evidence-based planning.

196. Next steps with GhanaInfo include pilot training in selected districts and training
  on the administrative model. Other actions include identification of new indicators
  fro inclusion in the database, sensitization of the media, Members of Parliament,
  Organized Labour and Civil Society Organisations.

197. Website development has been completed and is operational. The address is
  http://www: ndpc.aov.ah

198. Various reports on implementation progress, GPRS Iand I1and GPRS I1costing
  are available on the website. The 2004 Annual Progress Report (APR) is also
  available. We will publish the report on the 2003 Core Welfare Indicators
  Questionnaire (CWIQ) and intend to complete the fifth round of the Ghana Living
  Standards Survey (GLSS 5).

199.The challenges faced in M&E remain those of human and funding capacity
  constraints. The accuracy and timeliness of data, data quality and the challenge of
  reporting on several indicators remain challengeswe are grappling with.

CONCLUSION

200. Mr. President with the assistance of IDA, Government under GPRS I,ha5 been able to
  consolidate macro economic stability, with all key economic indicators pointing in the right
  direction. During this period, we have made appreciable progress towards laying the
  foundation for achievingthe MDGs.

201. We acknowledge the great imperative required to accelerate our development Morts if
  Ghana is to achieve the MDGs and the objectives of NEPAD and above all those of GPRS 11.
  To do this would requirethe accelerationof growth rates to 8 percentand above. It is for
  this reason that the GPRS I1focuses on the appropriate policy measures and actions that
  will help Ghana achieve the status of a middle income country. The goal of poverty
  reduction in our opinlon, can only be achieved with higher and sustainable levels of
  growth. We recognizehowever that high levels of growth can only come with higher and
  more efficientlevelsof investment.

202. As you are fully aware, our commitmentto fighting corruption is epitomized among other
  things by our having been the first country under the AU to complete the Africa Peer
  Review Mechanism process. Ghana ranks highest among IDA countries in the recent
  assessment of the Bank's CPIA (full). We have a new commitment to further deepen our
  efforts to fight corruption.

203. We wish to acknowledge with deep gratitude your recent decision to provide Ghana with
  additional resources from the MDRI. But even with post HIPC, post MDRI relief, severe
  financlng gaps still exist. We are seeking your assistance through the IDA and its afiliates
  as well as other development partnersto find additional resourcesto fill this financing gap.

204. On behalf of the Government of Ghana, Iwish to thank IDA for the programme
  assistance provided undervarious projects approvedthis year. We trust that this requestto
  support implementation of GPRS I1through the fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit
  wilt receive your favourable consideration,

ANNEX 1:           TECHNICAL ANNEX 2006              -  2008 TO THE FRAMEWORK
MEMORANDUM ON THE MULTI-DONORBUDGETARY SUPPORT PROGRAMME4'


       Arrangement betweenGovernment of Ghana and Bilateral MDBS DPs
                                 and European Commission


1. With reference to sections 2.3 and 2.5 of the Multi Donor Budgetary Support
   (MDBS)- Framework Memorandum (hereafter: FM), this additional arrangement lays
   down the procedures through which the Government of Ghana (GoG), seven
   Bilateral MDBS Development Partners4*and the European Commission (hereafter:
   DPs) carry out:
       (i) the joint assessment of Ghana's performance;
       (ii) dialogue between DPs and GoG;
       (iii) how commitmentsare formulated and how disbursementsare scheduled and
       aligned with GoG's budget cycle.

                    A. MDBS ProgressAssessment Framework (PAF)


2. The Progress Assessment Framework is the set of poverty reduction objectives,
   development indicators and policy reform measures that will be used to assess
   progress of GPRS implementation. These policy reform measures are referred to in
   this document as `targets'. Targets will be time-bound, specific, measurable actions
   and result-oriented. The GoG and DPs will use the Progress Assessment
   Framework (PAF) and Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) review
   process as tools for dialogue on progress on GPRS implementation. Through a
   continuous process, the agreed policy reform measures will allow the GoG and the
   DPs to assess progress towards agreed medium term objectives and the
   implementation status of specific measures. Progress will help to determine
   appropriate levels of future funding for the budget. A subset of the targets, hereafter
   called `triggers' is agreed by GoG and DPs to determine the size of the performance
   component of MDBS.
3. Previously the Progress Assessment Framework was named by the year in which
   the DP-GoG performance review took place. However, from henceforth, and in this
   document, the Progress Assessment Framework is named by the year in which
   policy actions that are the subject of assessment in the subsequent year are
   undertaken. For example, if policy actions are to be undertaken in `Year n', the PAF
   will be called `PAF n'. This applies retrospectively. `PAF 2006' as referred to in

                                                                                  Page 2 of 10

  documents that predate this Technical Annex is now called PAF 2005. The PAF will
  also contain actions and indicators for the two years subsequent to `Year n'.


                                    B. MDBS Schedule


4. The MDBS schedule of activities in 2006 will be unusual because changes will be
   made to allow DP's to give GoG one year's advance notice of MDBS funding - Le. to
   give greater predictability. In order to facilitate the transition, DPs that are signatories
   of this technical annex will use the PAF 2005 as a basis for giving budget support in
   2006 and 2007.
5. This arrangement will enable DPs to announce and commit expected disbursements
   in time for the preparation of the coming year's budget. DPs and GoG agree to move
   to the development of a 3-year rolling Progress Assessment Framework that is
   results oriented and uses outcome indicators. Each year the PAF actions for the
   following year will be agreed in draft in March and finalised in December. PAF
   actions for the outer two years will be drafted and reviewed at both meetings - but
   will remain draft until the year preceding implementation.


6. The following describes the ideal schedule of activities in relation to PAF 2005,
   2006,2007 and 2008:

   PAF 2005 cycle:

                                                                           Page 3 of 10

                          C. DISBURSEMENTMECHANISM


7. The DPs' contribution consists of two components each year: a base and a
   performance component.
8. Disbursement of the base component will take place after an assessment of
   satisfactory macro-economic performance, carried out through an IMF-instrumentor
   arrangement. Neither the base nor the performance components will be disbursed if
   macro-economic policy implementationis deemed unsatisfactory.The disbursement
   of both components will ideally be made in the first quarter of the fiscal year if
   conditions are satisfactory.
9. At all times, underlying the consideration to release funds is the expectation that
   there is a genuine commitment of the government to improve financial management
   and accountability. Evidence of this commitment will be a decreasing risk of funds
   being misused as a result of weak administration or corruption. Audits, evaluations,
   reviews and assessments that show persistent inadequacies in financial
   management and a failure to take remedial action will be grounds for donor partners
   to consider reducing commitments underthe MDBS-mechanism.
10.Although DPs may have some variations in their respective approaches to
   disbursement, it is intended that the split between the performance and the base
   component will be on a 50/50 basis although in the future the ratio betweenthe base
   and performance components may be changed.
11.For releases against PAF 2005, there will be five subsets to the performance
   component (outlined in Appendix A): (a) growth, income and employment; (b)
   governance and public sector management; (c) public expenditure management (d)
   social sectors - process triggers and (e) social sectors - outcome triggers. All

                                                                                  Annex 1
                                                                               Page 4 of 10

  subsets contain 2 triggers. The size of the performance component will be
  determined once the triggers are satisfactorilyfulfilled within that subset. Appendix A
   (to be revised according to the proposed arrangements)will be amended every time
   DPs and GoG agree a new PAF. The same sequencing of PAF agreement and
  Appendix A amendmentwill be followed in subsequentyears.
12.Deviations from the mechanism outlined in paragraphs 9 11 by individual donors
                                                                -
   must be defined by their bilateral agreements and made known to all signatories to
   the Technical Annex of the FrameworkMemorandum.
13.A joint Government-Development Partner technical team will work on the
   development of outcome indicators for the PAF 2006 and on the identification,
   selection and measurement of outcome indicators for subsequent PAF's, including
   indicatorsthat cut across sectors.
14.Government and development partners will agree to the means of verification of the
   targets while finalising the PAF. When assessing progress against the triggers,
   development partners and government will take account of Government's effort to
   achieve the trigger and any developments outside the control of Government that
   may have affected progress. If substantial progress has been made against specific
   triggers and there are extenuating circumstances which prevent the Government
   from reaching them, donors may consider partial or complete releases of funding
   associated with those triggers. With respect to outcome indicators, it is specifically
   agreed that when a joint assessment reveals that outside factors are mainly
   responsible for a negative trend, the indicator could be suspended as an
   assessment criterion. In thet case, the percentage associated with that outcome may
   be reallocated equally among the remainingtriggers.


15.lnstalments will be deposited in a foreign exchange account - USD 0225660058004,
   EUR 1825660058001 and GBP 0325660058002 in the name of the Government

   held at the Bank of Ghana. Within 48 hours the Bank of Ghana will credit the Cedi
   equivalent (usingthe Central Bank (buying) exchange rate on the date of `purchase')
   to the Central Treasury Account and will be used as budget revenue. GoG should
   provide to individual donors documentary evidence of the amount and date of the
   foreign exchange payment receivedfor each disbursement, and of the amount and
   date of receipt of each transfer from the MDBS account into the Central Treasury
   Account.


16.The Bank of Ghana will immediately acknowledge receipt of the foreign exchange
   funds, in writing, to the respective DP and the Ministry of Finance and Economic
    Planning (MoFEP). The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning will
   acknowledge receipt of the Cedi equivalent on its Central Treasury Account, in
   writing, to the respective DP and to the Cochairs of the MDBS group.

                                                                          Page 5 o f 10

                            D. DIALOGUE AND REPORTING


17.The World Bank, African Development Bank, European Commission and
   participating Bilateral Development Partners have committed to coordinate reporting,
   dialogue and review, and appraisal missions as articulated in the underlying
   principles of the Framework Memorandum signed on June 30, 2003.


18.Regular dialogue among the signatories to the Program is essential for continued
   DP commitment to the MDBS. The joint review meetings and the regular
   Consultative Group meetings serve as a platform to inform all DPs about progress
   made in economic and monetary terms and for policy dialogue.


19.The most important events in the MDBS calendar will be the annual assessment
   meeting and the GPRS annual progress review meeting. Timing of these events will
   be linked to the Ghanaian budgetary and policy cycle but will normally take place
   during the first and second quarter. It will examine progress towards the targets of
   the previous year (year n). The decision on the disbursement of the performance
   component in `year n+2' will be based on this assessment.
20.The review will be guided by the Annual Progress Report (APR) on the
   implementation of the GPRS (see the table below); the quarterly reports on
   expenditures (see table below); a selected-flows audit; the annual budget statement,
   and the agreed documentary evidence for progress achieved in the PAF. In order to
   ensure a fully informed dialogue, the Government of Ghana will submit the above-
   mentioned documentation to the DPs, through the MDBS co-chairs, at least 3 weeks
   prior to the reviews.
21.The review will be chaired by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, and
   include representatives of the Government and the MDBS DPs (including
   observers). Representatives from Parliament may be invited by the Government to
   participate or observe the review. Results of the joint assessment will be
   disseminated to a broader group of stakeholders through the annual Consultative
   Group and other possible mechanisms.


22.The GoG and DPs will produce regular monitoring reports to inform the policy
   dialogue. The reports will include the following:

                                                                             Annex 1
                                                                         Page 6 of 10

                                       E. AUDIT


The following audit arrangements will be established:


23.The Ghana Audit Service (GAS) carries out an independent annual external audit of
    the Government Accounts. The annual audit report by the GAS shall be presented to
    MDBS DPs as soon as it becomes available. The audit reports will be discussed in
    the annual assessment meeting.

                                                                                 Annex 1
                                                                              Page 7 of 10

24. In addition, an audit of selected flows in the government accounts will be undertaken
   annually at an early stage to assess general progress in Public Finance
   Management in Ghana.


25. For the audit of selected flows GAS will contract assistance from an internationally
   recognized audit company. The MDBS DPs will finance this audit. The terms of
   reference for this selected external audit and a shortlist of audit companies will be
   jointly prepared and agreed upon by the GoG, GAS and the MDBS DPs. The GoG
   and the MDBS DPswould endorsethe selection of auditors.




                            F. CO-ORDINATION STRUCTURE


26. The non-permanent co-chair of the DP/MDBS group rotates on an annual basis. In
addition, certain DPs will act as MDBS Sector Focal Points to liaise with sector groups
and GoG on MDBS issues and advise the MDBS Core Group on consolidated sector
positions on the areas covered in the PAF. This arrangement should preferably reflect
the structure of the existing sector and thematic groups in Ghana.


27. Further harmonization of both the MDBS structure and the interlinked sector
processes is envisaged in line with the common approach on harmonisation and
alignment for aid effectiveness signed in February 2005 with the objective of ensuring
that MDBS in the future will be the pivotal point in a network of sector dialogues, guided
by the Government of Ghana, where cross cutting issues and issues with significant
budgetary implications can be raised. The MDBS structure should add value to and be
informed by sector processes. The MDBS-dialogue will not repeat discussions that
have been handledadequatelyat the sector level.


28.The Ghanaian budgetary and policy cycle remains the most important determining
factor in timing of the annual GoG-DP MDBS review. By 2006 all DPs should be able to
follow these cycles as far as programmatic support is concerned. In addition, MDBS
bilateral and multilateralpartners endeavour to carry out their review in linkage with the
 IMF mission calendar.


29. This technical annex or an amended version of this annex will accompany all PAF's
agreed upon between July 2005 and December 2008. It may be revised at any time
during this period if DP's and GoG agree that it is necessary

The MDBS Progress Assessment Framework for 2005 (PAF 2005) highlights 10
indicators that will be linked to decisions on disbursement in 2006 and 200743.For the
MDBS group44 these indicators will be used to recommend disbursement of the
performance component for 2006 and 2007. The 10 triggers are grouped into five
`subsets', as follows:

All triggers will carry equal weight (l/lO), and each subset therefore has a weight of 1/5
 of the total performance component.

     3. Assessment of progress


Subsets 1-4 will be assessed in the standard MDBS manner, i.e. a trigger will have
been achieved or not. In making the assessment, article 14 of the Technical Annex will
be taken into account. When triggers are met, a positive recommendation for
disbursement of that part of the performance component will follow. All triggers will be
assessed during the MDBS assessment mission of 2006.
Subset 5 covers outcome indicators and assessment will follow a separate
methodology. For the outcome indicators (9 & IO)                         a score of 0 (no
progress/achievement),          0.5     (moderate      progress/achievement)      or    1    (full
progress/achievement)will be awarded. For the two outcome indicators, achievement
targets have been set at sectoral level, in referenceto a base.

When an achievement target has been attained a score of 1.0 will be awarded. When
 there is no progress compared to the base, a score of 0 will be awarded. Cases in-
 between will result in a score of 0.5.


 All scores for the three education achievement targets, which will carry equal weight,
 will be added (maximum of 3.0) and expressed as a percentage of the maximum
 achievement for education. That figure will be added to the health figure and the total
 divided by two. This percentage will be the recommended percentage of disbursement
 for subset 5 of the performancecomponent.

 IMFExecutiveBoardCompletesThirdReviewUnderGhana'sPRGFArrangementand
                            ApprovesUS$38.7 MillionDisbursement

The Executive Board o fthe International Monetary Fund(IMF) has completed the thirdreview
o f Ghana's economic performance under a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. The completion o f the review makes immediately available to Ghana an amount
equivalent to SDR 26.4 million (about US$38.7 million) under the arrangement.

Ghana's three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on May 9,2003 (See Press Release No.
03/66) for SDR 184.5 million (about US$271.3 million). So far, Ghana has drawn SDR 79.1
million (about US$116.2 million) under the arrangement.

Incompletingthe review, the ExecutiveBoardalso decided to extendthe current PRGF
arrangement to October 31,2006 so that the sixth and final review and all disbursementsunder
the arrangement could be completed. It also decided to waive the nonobservance o fthree
quantitative and one structural performance criteria, as the authorities have since reviewed the
factors that contributed to their nonobservance, and have put measures inplace to ensure that
they achieve the original program objectives.

Followingthe Executive Board's discussion on Ghana's request, on June 20,2005, Mr.Takatoshi
Kato, DeputyManaging Director and Acting Chair, stated:

"Economic performance continued to strengtheninGhana during 2004, with growth exceeding
earlier projections and a further buildupingross international reserves. Strengthened policy
implementationhelped consolidate macroeconomic stability, supported by favorable external
factors including higher-than-expected inflows from donors. Inflationdeclined by half at the end
o f 2004, but the recent deregulation o fpetroleum product prices has ledto ajump duringthe first
quarter o f this year.

"The execution o f fiscal policy improved in2004, although there were some slippages. Total
revenuerelative to GDP reached its highest level yet, although this was not enoughto offset
unanticipatedcapital outlays, the increased subsidy for petroleum products as world oil prices
rose, and an overrun ingovernment wages. Consequently, the overall budget deficit narrowed
butwas still above the target for the year. Faster GDP growth helpedreduce the ratio of
domestic debt to GDP, which i s the anchor o f the fiscal strategy.

"Monetary policy has remained firm, contributing to the decline o f inflation during2004. The
central bank is to be commended for managing significant inflows ina manner that balances

                                                                                        Page 2 o f 2

monetary expansion and competitiveness. Also, the recent rapid buildup o f gross international
reserves provides an important cushion against shocks.

"Structural reform has progressed, thereby enhancing the environment for private sector-led
growth. Efforts to strengthen public expenditure and financial management are helpingto
improve the transparency, accountability, and efficiency o f the use o fpublic resources.
Regulatory and legislative changes andmacroeconomic stability have helped strengthen the
financial sector. The reform o fpublic enterprises is ongoing, with full cost recovery for public
utilities.

"The government's decision to deregulate the petroleum sector andthe adoption o f a new
petroleum product pricing mechanism earlier this year were important achievements. The
establishment o f an oversight body to monitor the application o fthe mechanism i s also welcome,
as this will ensure fair pricing andprovide safeguards against anti-competitive behavior. These
measures will remove government involvement inproduct pricing, reduce the vulnerability of
the budgetto world oil prices, and free up resources for growth enhancing and poverty reducing
expenditures. It will be important to ensure the automatic adjustment o f petroleumprices under
the new mechanism.

 "The reform o fthe civil service is also welcome. While this initiative is primarily aimed at
 improving the delivery ofpublic services, it should also lead to prospective fiscal savings, in
 particular, through a reduction o f civil service wages relative to GDP. The demand for these
 savings to fundpriority expenditures i s very high.

 "Debtreliefunder the enhanced Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative has ledto a
 substantial improvement inGhana's debt-service indicators. Ghanak long-term debt
 sustainability is vulnerable, however, to a sustained deterioration inkey economic variables, and
 most importantly, to a significant reductioningrants as a source o f financing. Untilconditions
 are more favorable and a longer track record o f good macroeconomic performance i s established,
 Ghana should continue to rely on concessional borrowing to finance development," Mr.Kato
 said.

 The PRGFis the IMF'sconcessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
 programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted ina participatory
 process involving civil society and development .partners, and articulated ina Poverty Reduction
  Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intendedto ensure that each PRGF-supportedprogram i s
  consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to
  foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate o f 0.5 percent, and
  are repayable over 10 years with a 5 %-year grace period on principal payments.
