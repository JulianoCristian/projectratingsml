         under: (i) accelerated private sector-led growth, (ii)\n            vigorous human resource development, and (iii) good\n            governance and civic responsibility. While the PRSC-4\n            support will translate primarily into funding for the\n            implementation of the GPRS II, particular attention is given\n            leveraging the poverty emphasis of several sector focused\n            operations by ensuring appropriate expenditure allocation\n            (level and structure) and by addressing some of the\n            financing implications of proposed policy actions. The\n            PRSC-4 also focuses on cross-cutting issues related to\n            private sector development and the strengthening of\n            institutions, ranging from issues related to governance,\n            public sector reform, decentralization and public financial management."}, "docdt": "2006-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
