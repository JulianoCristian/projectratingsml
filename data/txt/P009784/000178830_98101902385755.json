"The purpose of the project is to help\n            India increase agricultural production and to strengthen\n            agricultural credit institutions by supporting a two-year\n            ARDC program of refinancing loans for investments in\n            agriculture and an intensive training program for the staff\n            of participating banks. Lending under the project would be\n            for minor irrigation (including land development),\n            plantation and horticulture, livestock and fisheries, market\n            yards and storage. The only serious project risk would be\n            the continuation of high loan overdues of the participating\n            banks. Special measures are included in the project to deal\n            with this situation."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
