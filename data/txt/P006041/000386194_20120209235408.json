{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Small Farmer Development\n            Project for Argentina were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank Performance was moderately satisfactory;\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: Use of the Additional Financing\n            (AF) instrument, with its maximum three year period, in\n            countries with generic delays in loan effectiveness may need\n            reconsideration. Even with a well-staffed coordinating unit\n            in place, and a pipeline of approved subprojects, an AF with\n            no possibility of extension faces difficulties maintaining\n            the momentum established by the original project and\n            achieving impact, more so when delays curtail that period\n            further. The logistical challenge and cost of providing\n            effective oversight of projects with national scope can be\n            substantial. This may be non-controversial for country\n            counterparts, since most appropriate/candidate executing\n            agencies in Argentina have the budget and the provincial\n            presence/representation to provide adequate oversight\n            nationwide. Mid-Term reviews and AF should be used to\n            address project design weaknesses and ensure that Monitoring\n            and Evaluation (M and E) arrangements are adequate. M and E\n            systems should be designed organized to permit management by\n            results. Vulnerable populations require differentiated\n            strategies and forms of 'affirmative action' to\n            ensure access to project benefits. Despite the likely\n            procedural difficulties, mechanisms need to be developed for\n            linking the federal and provincial governments in Argentina\n            on rural poverty reduction efforts and more fundamentally,\n            to engage provincial authorities and build their commitment.\n            Greater coordination and cooperation between field teams and\n            provincial and municipal institutions and authorities can\n            benefit efforts to develop decentralized rural policy and\n            strategic frameworks. Market insertion should be seen as a\n            process involving a logical sequence of first, second and\n            third level priority investments which position a small\n            farmer to engage with markets. Occasionally, the best\n            attainable outcomes require allowing a project to become overage."}, "docdt": "2011-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
