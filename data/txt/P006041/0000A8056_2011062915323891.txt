                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is coming to an orderly close on June 30, 2011. The Additional Financing (AF) became effective in January 2009, after a hiatus of more than two years since the closure
                         of the original Loan. Implementation started for real only in the second half of 2009 and has progressively accelerated during 2010 and 2011. As of May 30, 2011, 90 percent of the
                         AF (i.e. 96 percent of the total amount of the Project, including the fully disbursed Original Loan) is disbursed. The number of beneficiary families has exceeded the target of 72,000
                         set for the entire Project (22,000 under the AF and 50,0000 under the original Loan).

                         The recently concluded impact evaluation report, focused mainly on the original Loan, shows positive project effects on producers' organization and income. The evaluation will be

                         completed with another study, focused particularly on the Additional Financing.

                         The project will close on June 30, 2011 and no extension has been sought because: a) the Project is overage; and b) its Additional Financing has already reached its three-year
                         maximum duration.
