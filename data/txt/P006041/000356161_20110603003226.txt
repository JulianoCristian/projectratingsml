2.     Project implementation has progressed steadily during 2010 and 2011. The
number of beneficiary families has exceeded the target of 72,000 set for the entire Project
(22,000 under the AF and 50,000 under the original Loan). The Project is very close to its
closing date.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to: (i) allocate funds that are currently
unallocated; (ii) adjust expenditures categories to actual projected disbursements; and (iii)
allow financing of technically approved subprojects ready for completion before the
closing date.

4.      The reallocation does not imply any significant change in project objectives,
results and activities.
