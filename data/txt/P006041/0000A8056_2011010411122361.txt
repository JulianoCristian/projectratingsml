                         The Additional Financing (AF) became effective in January 09, after a hiatus of more than two years since the closure of the original Loan. In the last year implementation has
                         considerably progressed. The number of beneficiary families has exceeded the target of 72,000 set for the entire Project (22,000 under the AF and 50,0000 under the original Loan)
