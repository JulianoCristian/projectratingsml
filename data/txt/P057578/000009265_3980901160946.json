"The EGAT (Electricity Generating\n            Authority of Thailand) Investment Program Support Project\n            will finance investments for power generation and\n            transmission facilities. These environmental impact\n            assessments cover the subprojects -- a) Ractchaburi Power\n            Plant; b) Krabi Thermal Power Plant; c) Wang Noi Combined\n            Cycle Power Plant Project; and d) the transmission systems.\n            A resettlement plan has been prepared for the households\n            affected. In terms of air quality, the impact of dust during\n            construction will be mitigated by water sprays. Emissions\n            from construction equipment and vehicular transportation\n            will be controlled by reducing vehicular speed. Sulfur\n            Dioxide will be controlled by an 80 percent efficient Flue\n            Gas Desulfurization System (FGD). Major construction\n            activities will be conducted in dry seasons to reduce\n            siltation to the nearby rivers. Water quality affected by\n            suspended solid in the nearby river will be improved by\n            constructing temporary weir to trap sediment. Salt water\n            intrusion into the groundwater will be mitigated by\n            controlling the discharge rate and exploring other water\n            resources. Noise pollution will be minimized by using noise\n            control equipment, creating noise barriers, and publicizing\n            the time for blasting. The threat of thermal pollution to\n            aquatic life will be mitigated by building a water reservoir\n            to reduce water temperature before it is discharged into the\n            river. Wastewater will be pretreated before it is discharged\n            into the water way. A screening structure will be placed at\n            the inlet of the intake pipe at the water intake pump\n            station so that young fish, fish eggs, and floating weeds\n            will not be pumped into the intake."}, "docdt": "1998-07-02T00:00:00Z"}
