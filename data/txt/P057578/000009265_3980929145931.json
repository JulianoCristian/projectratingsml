        EGAT - Investment Program Support Project are to: a) help\n            the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) meet\n            its essential investment commitments on generation and\n            transmission projects whose implementation has already been\n            under way; b) help EGAT not lose ground in accomplishing its\n            organizational restructuring and corporatization, and\n            implementing its privatization strategy and c) help improve\n            the regulatory framework for the energy sector. The project\n            includes four generation projects and four transmission\n            systems as follows: a) Krabi Thermal Power Plant Unit 1; b)\n            Ratchaburi Power Plant Project; c) Wang Noi Combined Cycle\n            Power Station, Stage II; d) 500KV Transmission System for\n            Independent Power Producers and Hong Sa Project in Laos; e)\n            bulk power supply for greater Bangkok; f) EGAT-TNB Stage II\n            interconnection; g) Transmission System Expansion Project\n            no. 9; and h) restructuring, corporatization, and\n            privatization of EGAT. The project will also reform the\n            regulatory system for the energy sector including a)\n            formulation of corporate policy for environmental and social\n            management; and b) strengthening EGAT's environmental\n            management function."}, "docdt": "1998-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
