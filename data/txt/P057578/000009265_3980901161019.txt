CHAPTER 1                 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
1.1          BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
1.    This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project (TGRP)
was prepared by the Land Division of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT).
2.    This RAP's overall objectives are established to assure that all TGRP affected institutions, persons
and properties will be compensated and assisted in such a way as to warrant the improvement, or at least
the maintenance of pre-project conditions. Since the land acquisition impact of the project is not substantial
(none of the project affected persons losses more than 25% of their total land holding) and consultations
with the PAPs have revealed strong preference for cash compensation, cash will be the main form of
compensation employed for the project. The land based rehabilitation policy is described in chapter 2
1.2          STANDING VALIDITY OF RAP PROVISIONS
3.    This RAP will have standing validity alter RTG and WB approval.
4.    In order to insure that this RAP's objectives are met, the compensation prices published by
district authorities may have been increased so that compensation at market rates or replacement costs is
warranted. According to the EGAT Act, EGAT has the right to modify compensation prices in order
to provide "fair" compensation. "Fair" compensation signifies compensation level at least equal to the
market/replacement cost of affected land and other assets. Therefore, even if compensation rates may
be higher than those fixed by local administrations' tariffs, the compensation provided by this RAP
should be considered acceptable in terms of law.
5.    So far ,except for affected houses, the quantitative dimension of project impact has been
ascertained on the basis of map projections estimates. After EGAT's approval, when implementation
begins, more precise data will be gathered by means of field surveys. The detailed inventory survey
'DIS) of project affected families (PAFs) and properties, including the precise calculation of
zompensation costs will be carried out as the first implementation task of this RAP.
1.3           APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
More specifically, this RAP aims at:
a.    Defining a policy; a legal/institutional framework; and implementation schemes for
compensation programs. This topic will be addressed in chapter 3.
b.    Providing, in chapter 4, complete inventory of persons and properties affected by all project
components;



2
c.    Proposing the organizational and procedural framework of compensation including
complaints and grievances functions, This topic will be treated in chapter 6.
d.    Defining implementation phases of the compensation programs, including a coordinated
schedule of the above mentioned programs and construction activities. Such aspects of the
project will be outlined in chapter 8.
e.    Estimating costs and compensation. This will be presented in chapter 9.
7.    The methodology for the preparation of this RAP entailed:
a.    Data collection which was obtained both through in-depth interviews with farmers and
village officers and through censuses and questionnaires. Further information was obtained
from available publications and papers.
b.    Data analysis and processing.
c.    Visits and meetings with concerned agencies in order to identify the potential impact of
Resettlement and Land acquisition and to study organizational and implementation
schemes for the project.
e.    Preparation of the RAP.
8.    In the preparation of this RAP's implementation schemes, current practice has been maintained as
much as possible. RAP preparation was carried out in close communication with local admniistrations and
government agencies, and entailed consultation with the PAFs. All concerned institutions in the affected
provinces in whose territory the project area lies, were approached at each given stage of the preparation of
this document to jointly evaluate the quality of information, and propose suggestions. Consultations and
review meetings with local Provincial, District and Village administrations regularly took place to achieve
general consensus on the findings and proposed recommendations. Consultation with various groups have
revealed strong preference for cash compensation. This seems to be due to the fact that land loss as
percentage of total land to holdings of affected persons is very small, and less than 25% in all cases.
1.4          LEGAL AND INSUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
9.    The principles, modes of compensation, regulations and implementation schemes outlined in this
RAP were defined and prepared in accordance with Thailand law (Land Code of 1954; to the Act of
Expropriation of Immovable Property of 1987); the 1996-2000 Announcements of Prices for Land
Evaluation of the Provinces affected by the TGRP; The EGAT Act, The EGAT Compensation Policy, and
IBRD policy on involuntary resettlement (O.D. 4.30).
1.4.1 Resettlement and Compensation Policy
10.   The basic principles regulating resettlement and compensation programs (see box 1, next page
have been defined taking into account the IBRD O.D. 4.30 and in accordance with Thailand Law.



3
RAP: RESETTLEMENT CR:ITERIA
I.   Both resettlement and land acquisition must be minimized as much as possible.
2.   PAFs subject to resettlement and land loss should at least maintain their current
living standards.
3.   All PAFs residing or cultivating land within project boundaries before the
electric line laying zone announcements are launched are entitled to
compensation for their losses. This provision stands both for PAFs with and
without land title.
:4 .:  Compensation should be Iprovided to the PAFsl ]no later than 30 days prior to
the scheduled start-up 'date of construction. In case of houses, the
compensation willbe. paid at least:90 days.prior .to that construction start-up

1.5          ENTITLEMENT POLICY
11.   All PAFs are entitled to full compensation at. market prices for land and crop losses and full
compensationi at replacement cost for losses of houses, buildings and movable assets. In addition, all PAFs
are entuitled to receive allowances as provided by this RAP (see chapter 2)
12.   Compensation subsidies and allowances will be provided to all PAFs with or without legal title
on the properties lost.
1.6           MODES OF COMPENSATION
1.6.1 Land Holdings
13.   Since very few, if any, affected households are expected to lose more than 25% of their agricultural
land holdings, compensation will be paid primarily in cash at the market price of affected land. However,
for those losing more than 25%of their land, due to acquisition for construction of T/L tower, replacement
land equivalent to the area covered by the base of the TIL tower will be offered as an option.
14.   The same provisions as above would also apply to those losing residential land.
15.   PAFs loosing agricultural produce will be compensated at market prices for the harvests lost.
1.6.2  Houses, Buildings and Private Infrastructure
16.   All houses, public and private infrastructures or buildings, including any fixed asset such as animal
barns, storages, wells, fishponds, tombs or others, will be compensated in cash at full replacement cost as
provided in chapter 2. All houses and buildings affected for less than 25% of their area will be compensated
in cash at substitution cost free of demolition expenses and salvage materials. To this basic, compensation
shall be added also for whatever damage has been caused to the part of building that will remain standing.
17.    Houses or buildings affected for more than 25% of their area will totally be compensated that is
for the entire houses and not only for the part directly affected by the project. In case of houses and
buildings affected less than 25% but that for project reasons have suffered damages beyond repair to the
part of houses left standing shall also be compensated totally.
1.7          PAFs PARTICIPATION IN PROJECT SCHEMES
18.   According to the law of Thailand, the PAFs may participate in resettlement and land acquisition
;chemes and may be consulted by the competent authorities and may be requested to pCaUticipate in public
neetings held by the PMT. These meeting may be an occasion to discuss resettlement and land
2ompensation issues and may provide a forum in which the affected population may express its opinions
md offer suggestions.



19.   The affected populations will be publicly informed by pertinent authorities of the details of
resettlement and land compensation schemes. Project start-up dates, entitlements, definition of eligibility,
modes of compensation, complaints and grievances procedures may be made public by means of pamphlets
distributed in project areas, by means of billboards in public offices, and by means of radio and newspapers
announcements according to EGAT rules and regulations.
1.8         BASELINE INFORMATION
20.   In accordance with EGAT rules and regulations together with IBRD O.D. 4.30 this RAP may
provide an inventory of the losses incurred by each PAF and private/public institution. This inventory
which for the moment is based on estimates on map will be completed by the DIS following RAP approval.
The baseline information provided in this RAP may includes:
i.)  number, type, and dimension of houses lost;
ii.) number, quantity and area of all residential plots lost;
iii.) quantity, category, and dimension of all other fixed assets affected by project;
iv.)  amount of perennial crops harvests and trees to be compensated.

21.   The TGRP is an integral element of the EGAT Power Development Plan (PDP 95-01). The PDP
95-01 aims at increasing Thailand's electricity production and distribution to satisfy a forecasted annual
increase in the rate of power and energy demand for the fiscal years 1995-2011 of 6.70% and 6.94%
respectively.
22.   The TGRP is composed of two major subprojects:
a)    the 500kV Transmission System Subproject for IPPs (TSIPP) along the west and
east coast of the Gulf of Thailand;
b)    the Bulk Power Supply System for Greater Bangkok Area (GBA) phase I (1995-
2000).
1.9.1 TSIPP
23.   Following RTG privatisation policies EGAT is actively involved in the promotion and
implementation of IPPs. The invitation announcement to the private sector for participation in the build-
own-operate (BOO) scheme of the IPPs which are scheduled for commissioning during
1996-2002 was made in 1995. The current EGAT PDP 95-01 has included about 13,100 MW total
power purchase from IPPs up to the year 2011, representing 30% of the total installed capacity at
that time.
1.9.1.1 Components in Western Area
24.   In this area the TGRP will entail the following construction.



6
a)    Transmission lines:
- A 300 km long 500 kV transmission line (TLI) from Bang Saphan to Chom
Bung
- A 278 km iong 500 kV transmission line (TL2) from Bang Saphan to Chom
Bung.
b)    Substations:
- Expansion of Bang Saphan 500 kV substation with installation of 500/230 kV of
1000 MVA transformer, line shunt reactors, and additional communication system;
- Expansion of Chom Bung 500kV substation with installation of line shunt reactors
and additional communication systern;
- Expansion of Sai Noi 500kV substation and additional communication system.
1.9.1.2 Components in Eastern Area
25.   In this area the TGRP will entail the following construction:
a)    Transmission lines:
* A 126 km long 500 kV transmission line (TLI) from Rayong 4 to T Junction;
- A 144 km long 500 kV transmission Line (TL2) from Rayong 4 to T Junction.
- A 25 km long 230kV transmission line from Rayong 4 to Rayong 2.
b)    Substations:
- Construction of the 500/230kV Rayong 4 substation with installation of line
shunt reactors at 500kV Rayong 4 - Nong Chok and Rayong 4 - Wong Noi lines and
additional communication system;
- Expansion of the 230 kV Rayong 2 substation with addition of communication system;
1.9.2 GBA
26.    The goal of this subproject is to expand the power facilities in the Greater Bangkok Area
in order to satisfy increasing power and energy demands brought about by the rapid development of
Bangkok metropolitan area. The first phase of the plan aims at reinforcing the existing 230kV lines for
higher transfer capacity by the year 2000.
27.   The subproject will entail the following construction:
a)    Transmission Liies
- Construction or reconstruction of 246.5 circuit-kms of 230/500 kV line in various areas
of Bangkok metropolitan area. The lines to be constructed are the following
* 500 kV Sai Noi - Bangkok Noi
* 500 kV Nong Chok - On Nuch
* 500 kV Sai Noi - Rangsit
* 500 kV Rangsit - Chaeng Wattana



7
28.   Since the GBA subproject will use the existing right-of-way (ROW), EGAT will pay
compensation only for the land that is used for constructing transmission towers in the 99.2 rais of
land. The transmission system for IPPs, EGAT, however, will be based on new routes and therefore
EGAT will pay compensation for all the 32,266.3 rais of land needed for the lines.
b)    Substation:
- Expansion of 500 kV Lad Phrao and North Bangkok substations in the land that was
purchased through an open market transaction.

1.10         LOSSES REDUCTION
29.   Particular efforts were devoted to the task of reducing the project's impact. The primary concem of
T/L route design was to avoid heavily populated areas such as the immediate hinterlands of the western
and the eastern ccasts of thc Gulfof 'T' l'nd. in consequence to this impact limitation policy the eastern
T/L I route will be slightly modified and lengthened in order to avoid impact on the foDlowing items in
Chonburi Province:
I.    A glove factory of about 2,000 m2 (value about 10.9 MiNlion Baht)
2.    A bus body work factory of 1,106 m2 (value about 3.4 Million Baht)
3,    A big swine factory of 2,500 M2 (value about 5.1 Million Baht)
and the construction material warehouse of 1,100 m2 (value about 3.9 Million Baht) in Nong Chok
(Bangkok).
30.   This T/L route change will require lengthening of the line of 4.0 km and will require an expense of
35.6 million Baht more for compensation.
1.11         MAGNlTUDE OF LAND ACQUISMTION
1.11.1 Losses in TSIPP
31.   The number of PAFs affected by T/L construction is 8,438. None of them belongs to ethnic
minorities. The number of PAFs losing houses is 249 (83 in Eastem area and 166 in Western area).
32.   The total land area affected is 33,903.1 rai (32,266.3 affected by TL construction and 816.9 rais
affected by substation construction). Of the land directly affected by T/L construction, 10,608.2 rais are in
Eastem Area and 21,658.1 rais are in Western Area. The 32,266.3 rais are directly affected by Ti
construction, 23,267,28 rais are paddy land; 8,803.35 rais are plantation land; and 195.7 rais are residential
land. All 816.9 rais affiected by substation construction are plantation land.
33.   The subproject will not cause infrastructure losses.
1.11.2 Losses in GRA
34.   The number of PAFs losing idle land are 305 (297 affected by TfL construction and 8 by
Substation construction). No house or building losses occurs in this area.
1.12         RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATION COSTS
35.   Detailed costs for resettlement and compensation programs are provided in chapter 9. The total
cost of these progms is estimated to be 5,846.6 million Baht or US$ 146.2 m. (at 40 Baht/US$)
36.   The compensation costs of the land, trees and crops are 4,166.6 million Balht or US$ 104.2 m. and
607.9 rnillion Baht or US$ 15.2 m. respectively while the value of houses to be compensated is 72.7 million
Baht or US$ 1.8 m.

properties wiii be described in chapter 4
(b) Substations
39.   Five substations are involved in the project. Three of them use the old substations' facilities
while the land for only two following substations was purchased according to the project:
* Bang Saphan 500 kV Substation
- Rayong 4 500 kV Substation
40.   The land for the substations at Bang Saphan and Rayong 4 has already been purchased by EGAT
through an open market transaction. The 15 land owners at Bang Saphan and 6 land owners at Rayong 4 have
been paid market price and there are no secondary claims (tenants or encroachers) on the purchased land. The
detail of the compensation for these two substations is as follow:

RAP for the Transmission System for GBA
(a) Transmission Lines
41.   The scope of work under the transmission lines for the Greater Bangkok Area do not require
land acquisition since the transmission lines upgrading is within the existing right-of-way. However,
new transmission line towers would need to be erected requiring additional land compensation.
42.   The compensation policies for transrnission line towers applied to land acquisition around
Bangkok would be the same as those for transmission line towers for the coastal transmission lines.
The compensation rate, being equal to the replacement cost of affected land, would obviously be
different
(b) Substations
43.   The scope of work under most of the substations for the Greater Bangkok Area do not
require land acquisition since the required for the substation construction has been in EGAT's
possession for years. However, the additional land for only following two substations was
purchased under the project:
d Lad Phrao 230 kV Substation
* North Bangkok 230 kV Substation
44.   The land for the substations at Lad Phrao and North Bangkok has already been purchased by EGAT
through an open mark-et transaction and there are no secondary claims (tenants or encroachers) on the purchased
land. The details ofthe compensation for these two (2) substations is as follows:

house/structure left standing. Compensation shall correspond to the type and quality of the partly
demolished building.
56.   If the demolition of the part of the house/structure affected by the project should cause
damages to the point that repair is impossible, the house shall totally be compensated as the houses
losing more than 25%.
2.4.4 Compensation for Residential/premises Land Losses
57.   Residential/premises land losses will be compensated along the same line as the losses for

t,



2.5.1 Land Comnpensatioi
59.   PAPs whose holdings are affected will be compensated in cash at the market value of affected
land, to be established by the compensation committees. The rates represent a variable scale
reflectin, the arnount of disturbance to land use caused by different components and aspects of the
transmission system (see section 2.2, above). According to EGAT regulations in fact compensation
rates for transmission lines ROW are:
100 %  of valuation paid for land used for siting a transmission tower
90 %  of valuation paid for residential land
70 %  of valuation paid for perennial crop and tree areas
50 %  of valuation paid for annual crop or the other areas
60.   The rate of land compensation is based on unit prices established in reference to the rate of the
assessment values estimated for fees to register ownership and juristic act and adjusted to meet
current market prices at the time the electric line laying zone announcement is made.
2.5.2 iHouses and Building Compensation
61.   Compensation for housing and other buildings and structures will be based on the
Expropriation of Immovable Property Act (1987) which value the property on the basis of:

buildings combining the features of different building types will be adjusted during the compensation
negotiations to fit the actual substitution cost. The types of building affected by the TGRP are:
a) TYPE 1   High Quality buildings of one or more storeys, combining cement
foundation, reinforced cement structure, high quality wood or
brick walls, and high quality corrugated metal or tiled roofs.
b) TYPE 2   Medium quality buildings with no reinforced cement structure.

2.5.3 Crop Losses Compensation and Rehabilitation
63.   PAFs affected by crop losses shall be entitled to cash compensation corresponding to the full
market value of harvests affected by project. In case of loss of fruit or industrial trees these will be
compensated in cash at full replacement costs.
2.6            ALLOWANCES AND BENEFITS
64.   Included in the compensation for the houses lost, the PAFs will be entitled to the following
allowances in cash as they apply to individual situations according to eligibility categories defined above:
i.)    A "Resettlement Allowance" to cover secondary resettlement expenses (operation

ii.)    A "Demolition Allowance"corresponding to the 30% of the value of lost buildings.
iii)    A "Transportation Allowance" corresponding to-the 5% of the value of
lost buildings.
2.6.1 Secondary Benefits
65.   This RAP also provides the following:
a)     That the PAFs affected by home or other building loss will have the right to keep any
material salvaged after the demolition of the old house. Such a right should not entail any
cost or any detraction from the compensation received for the new house construction.
However, such a right is annulled when the demolition of the old house is not carried out

I               1'7
(b)   That in case the PAFs residential land or house is only partially affected by the project
and the remaining part of the structure remains habitable they will have the option to
choose between partial or total compensation.
c)    That PAFs will also be provided with full replacement costs for any other fixed asset
affected by the project. These would include animal barns, wells, grain storages, fishponds,
ancestral or family tombs and any other kind of building or fixed asset. Entitlements for the
above buildings and assets are the same as those defined for the houses.
2.7          EGAT POLICY ON POST-PROJECT LAND USE
66.   According to EGAT regulations the PAFs' post-project rights on land use will vary according
to the degree of impact of the different components of a project.
67.   Land used as premises land for substations and other fixed structures will be definitely bought
from the owners directly.
68.   Land used as bases for T/L towers (28 x 28 m squares including 20 m of T/L tower base plus
4 m. of clearance are on each side of the towers) will remain property of the PAFs but will have to be
permanently cleared of any crop and tree. Although these areas will remain property of the PAFs
these latter will lose all cultivation rights on them. Also in this case these areas will be compensated in
flull to their original owners or users.
69.   Land included in the right of way of T/L (a 40 m. wide corridor for 230 kV TIL and a 60 m.
wide corridor for 500 kV TIL) instead, will be given back to their previous owners before
construction. After construction the PAFs will retain annual crops cultivation rights on these lands.
However, the right to cultivate perenrial crops and trees will be subjected to a number of limnitations.
For 500 kV T/L these are:
a)    All trees within a 6 m. wide corridor (3 plus 3 m. on both sides from the
center of thie corridor) will have to be permanently cut.
b)    All trees growing between the above corridor and a distance of 18 m. from the
center of the TIL should not exceed 3 m. in height.
c)    All trees growing at the distance between 18 and 22 m. from the center of
T/L should not exceed 5 m. in height.
d)    All trees growing between 22 and 27 m. from the center of TIL should not
exceed 7 m. in height.
e)    All trees growing between 27 and 30 m. from the center of T/L should not
exceed 10 m. in height.
70.   Since the original owners nr users of these plots will retain a large degree of cultivation rights
on their land compensation will be given in proportion to the degree of right losses.
71.   Finally, EGAT regulations require the dismantlement of all houses, buildings and other fixed
constructions layilg within the right of way of TAL. Although the PAFs will retain rights over their
old residential plots. These plots will lose their residential status.

CIHAPTER 3               INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
3.1         INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
3.1.1 EGAT's Role
72.   EGAT, the TGRP owner, has overall responsibility for every aspect of the TGRP including
planning, implementing and financing resettlement programs according to the provisions specified in
this RAP. EGAT will also be responsible for coordinating the necessary action with appropriate local
government agencies and with the PAFs' representatives.
73.   EGAT will exercise its functions through two of its subsidiary agencies; namely the Land
Division and the Transmission Construction Division. Though most of the activities will be carried
out in close coordination with the PAFs and the local authorities at various levels, the officials of
EGAT andi its two subsidiaries w"ilave rcsponslblit, to ensure that, wimpntit;rn wi cmnomp  xxyith
the provisions of this RAP.
74.   In addition, EGAT will be responsible for coordinating the disbursement of funds and for
assuring the proper implementation of resettlement and compensation procedures, the proper
functioning of complaints and grievances mechanisms and proper monitoring tasks.
3.1.2 The PMT's (Project Management Team) Role
75.   TGRP preparation and implementation will entail close cooperation between EGAT's various
departments and offices and will be coordinated by the Project Management Team (PMT), consisting
of staffs from the Transmission System Construction Division; Treasury Division; and Transmission
System Engineering Division. The PMT will be headed by a Project Manager (PM) and by an
Assistant Project Manager (APM) respective taken from the Transmission System Planning and
Project Division and from the Transmission System Engineering Division.
76.   The implement responsibility to this RAP will fall on EGAT's Land Division (LD) and
Transmission System Construction Division (TSCD). These two divisions will be responsible for
organizing and supervising resettlement tasks on the ground in coordination with local Provincial and
District authorities.



19
3.1.3 The Compenisation Committees' (CCs) Role
77.   The execution of resettlement tasks on the ground will be supervised by a Compensation
Committee (CC) for each province affected by the TGRP. CCs will include members from a cross-
section of regional and provincial level government agencies. The CCs will be chaired by the
Provincial Governor or his representative who usually is Vice-Provincial Governor of each province,
and will include senior officers from major local government interests (Land, Agriculture, Forestry,
Civil Work, District Director) and from EGAT.
78.   CCs will have their sub-units at District level (DCC) which will organize and supervise the
execution of RAP action at the lower administrative levels.
79.   Under the Compensation Committee, a number of task forces (TF) and sub-committees (SC)
will be formed to respectively carry out and supervise specific aspects of the resettlement and
compensation program. Composition of these TFs and SCs will reflect the assigned tasks and will
include both EGAT staffs and provincial government and land related regional officers, community
representatives.
80.   The activities carried out by these ground level units will also involve by village heads who are
the truly representatives of the people's interests. Moreover, each of the affected person signs the
survey record if he is satisfied with the details of his property recorded on the survey form. Land and
property can only be acquired if the affected person signs the compensation form. In Thailand,
especially for EGAT, there is time respected tradition of consultations with and participation of the
people in all matters which affect them. Most of the activities mentioned in the RAP were and will be
carried out with the involvement of the village heads, which are truly representatives of the people's
interest.
3.1.4 Task Forces Roles
81.   The first task force organized in close collaboration by LD were the Survey Teams (ST)
composed by EGAT staffs and advised by village heads. The activity assigned to the STs was to
gather the information necessary for the inventory of affected persons and properties presented in
chapter 4. The survey record, prepared by EGAT surveyors, was inspected and approved by the
ad hoc sub-committees and was finalized in the presence of the affected person, village head or his
representative.
r.
82.   Other TFs and SCs that will be formed in the future will be:
i.    Detailed Inventory Survey Teams (DIST) which will be carrying out the
definitive base-line information gathering, including the DIS and the
socio-economic census.



20
ii.   Inspection Teams and Inspection SCs. (IT and ISC). The goal of
these will be to carry out and supervise the final negotiations between
EGAT and PAFs that will be allowed to fix the final compensation to be
given to each PAF. These units will be also responsible for assistance in
post-compensation tasks such as monitoring and complaints and grievances
issues.
iii    Compensation Teams and Compensation SCs (CT and CSC). The goal of
these will be to carry out and supervise actual compensation and
implementation processes.
3.2         LEGAL FRAMEWORK
83.   The principles, modes of compensation, regulations and implementation schemes outlined in this
RAP were defined and prepared in accordance with Thailand law (Land Code of 1954; the Expropriation
of Immovable Property Act of 1987 and the 1996 Announcements of Prices for Land Evaluation of
TGRP affected provinces). The overall objective of this RAP is also guided by Government policy
(Cabinet resolution of 10/10/1963) and is regulated by Section 30 of the EGAT Act.
84.  According to the EGAT Act. EGAT has the power of compulsory acciuisition of land and
properties and/or of sanctioning activities in the following cases:
* when land is needed to place or set up posts for transmission or
distribution lines;
* when land is needed to place or set up substations or other accessories;
* when land which is declared as electric line laying tone is needed;
* when crops, trees, houses and any other fixed asset stands on the right of way
of a transmission line. (see EGAT Act Section 29(3))
85.   Simultaneously, however, the EGAT Act (Section 30) requires fair compensation for land,
housing, structures, crops, and trees affected by T/L and other construction. Section 30 of EGAT Act
provides that EGAT shall pay fair compensation to the owner/ possessor or holder of any other right
of property needed as specified above.
86.   By mean of fair compensation, if needed, EGAT may compensate properties and assets at
that the rates published by the Announcements of Prices for Land Evaluation published by Provincial
Qovernments.

CHAPTER 4                 BASELINE INFORMATION
4.1          INTRODUCTION
87.   Baseline information gathering aimed at estimating the impact of resettlement and land acquisition
programs in their quantitative dimension. This effort produced a complete inventory of all households and
properties affected by the project and allowed to identify the number of people to be relocated.
4.2           DATA GATHERING: ORGANIZATION AND METHODOLOGY
88.   Data gathering by the Land Division of EGAT occurred after the physical survey of the
selected route of the transmission line that was carried out by the Survey Division . The number of
houses and other properties affected, and the area of annual and perennial crops affected by the
project was determined according to a map providing physical description of transmission line route.

Survey Team. The EGAT Survey Team was composed by EGAT staffs from the Land Division and was
advised by local village heads. Data gathering activities for the inventory of affected properties and families
lasted from October 1997 to July 1998. Data-processing was carried out in December 1998 at EGAT.
90.   This baseline information of affected properties and families provides a reliable inventory of
the number of PAFs and properties affected by the TGRP. The data bank which this information is
available at EGAT and, if necessary, may be used for further data-processing. At the conclusion of
the house to house survey of affected land and properties all data concerning this baseline information
will be checked and, if necessary, updated for a final confirmation by the CCs.
4.3          PAF IDENTIFICATION
91.   The PAFs is the people who, at the electric line laying zone announcement date, residing or
cultivating within project boundaries.

CHAPTER 8  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
8.1         IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
8.1.1   DIS and Socio-Economic Census
124.  A fundamental condition for the starting of implementation activities will be the completion of
the DIS and the Socio-Economic Census.
125. Information for the DIS will include the production of 1 :50,000,or any ratio that is suitable,
maps. Moreover, all PAFs shall carefully listed detail about the following information:
-Number of households
-Amount of agricultural land available to each PAF before project.
This figure shall also provide secondary data on relative amounts
of agricultural land per land type, type of crop cultivated, and
location type
-List of house(s) and buildings owned by the PAFs before the
project. This information shall detail type of house/building and
house/building area.
-List of houses/buildings affected by the project. In addition this
information shall clearly detail the area and the proportion of the
house directly affected by project.
8.1.2  Public Announcement
126.  The PAFs may be informed of their right and the specific policies of this RAP at least nine
iionths before construction begins. The announcements to the PAFs may include eligibility
provisions; entitlement policy; modes and rates of compensation, schedules and complaint and
grievance rights. According to EGAT's rules and regulations and Thailand law, such information may
be delivered to the PAFs by the PMT through meetings in city ward offices, through posters hung in
local administration quarters and in major public places such as markets, railway stations or hospitals,
through pamphlet to be distributed to each PAH and through announcement in local newspapers and
through radio broadcasts.



31
127.  Public announcement tasks will be implemented immediately after RTG and WB approval of
project is obtained. The announcements and pamphlets may clearly describe RAP policies, including
in particular:
i)   electric line laying zone announcement date (legally damage occurring
date)
ii)  the principle that households who have occupied affected land
afler the damage occurring date (i) are not legitimate PAHs and therefore will
not be compensated;
iii)  that all households owning, leasing or using affected land at the
time of the announcement shall be considered legitimate PAHs and
therefore shall be compensated;
iv)   That legitimate PAHs are both households with or without land
title or lease receipt.
v.)   Public announcement may also detail implementation rights and
duties of the PAHs including compensation and resettlement
deadlines.
8.1.3 Compensation and Resettlement Deadlines( PAHs rights)
128.  Compensation for building losses whether total or partial shall be provided at least 90 days
before the beginning of construction work.
129. Resettlement allowances shall be provided together with compensation for buildings losses 90
days before the beginning of construction work. The resettlement allowances shall be given
accordingly but shall be paid in one installment only.
130.  Cash compensation for perennial crop losses shall be given at least 30 days before
construction work. Seasonal crops which are allowed to grow in the ROW shall be compensated after
construction work.
8.2.4 Compensation and Resettlement Deadlines( PAHs obligations)
131.  PAHs affected by resettlement or loss of residential land shall' vacate the old houses and plots
completely at least 30 days before the beginning of construction works.
132.  PAHIs affected by resettlement shall have demolished the reclaimed buildings or portions of
buildings at least 30 days before beglnning of construction. In case this has not occurred, the
appropriate authorities shall carrying out the demolition work with their own means while the old
owners have to be responsible for the all the costs occued.



32
8.2         RAP IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS
133. Action for the implementation of this RAP will begin immediately after RTG and WB
approval.
134. Since construction will last about two years and not all PAHs will be affected in the same
moment (various components of the project will be constructed in different times), some of the RAP
activities will have to be repeated for each project component. In addition, some types of action will
be continuous and will last from the beginning of implementation to six months after implementation
conclusion.
135. RAP action is thus divided in three categories: a) General Action: action performed only once
at the beginning of RAP implementation; b) Component Specific Action: action performed several
times once for each project component; and c) Continuous Action: action performed continuously for
all the period of RAP and construction implementation plus six months.
8.2.1 General Action
ACTION I   The task forces on the ground begin action.
ACTION 2 The STs carry out the definitive inventory and the
socio-economic survey and CC simultaneously fixes the already
adjusted prices, or if necessary readjusts them again so that
compensation at market and substitution rates is warranted.
ACTION3    Immediately at the end of the final inventory survey EGAT will
take care of installing sign posts declaring the unavailability
of the reclaimed land shall be planted along the perimeters
of the affected areas.
ACTION 4   EGAT may arrange for public announcements specifying
areas reclaimed and RAP policy, eligibility, entitlements and
schedules to be carried out by means of posters hung in
public offices and important civil places such as
marketplaces, railways station, hospitafs and through
newspapers and radio announcement. This action may be done
according to EGAT rules and regulations and Thailand law.
ACTION 5   A meeting between the EGAT, CC and the PAH is organized.
During the meeting all aspects having to do with eligibility,
entitlements, compensation and implementation action may be
discussed with the PAHs.



33
8.2.2 Component Specification
ACTION 6   All PAHis are notified of the specific time frame of their
compensation. This will include when their property will
have to be vacated, when, how, and how much they will
be compensated. In addition, this document will also specify
the amount of allowances. This document shall
be signed by the PAHs' heads and countersigned by a CC
member and by a local community representative.
ACTION 7   Compensation delivery. The CC will deliver all the
compensation and allowances for land, trees and houses is given to
PAH.
ACTION 8   A month before the beginning of construction all plots within
areas reclaimed by the project shall be vacated and all
buildings within those areas shall have been demolished. In
case some building is still standing in whole or in part it shall
be demolished by the PMT.
ACTION 9   At the conclusion of construction the PAHs who occupied
areas only temporarily affected by project will be allowed to
return to their old plots to continue their previous activities.
8.2.3 Continuous Action
ACTION 10 Complaints and grievances emerging at any point of RAP
implementation until six months after conclusion of project
will be handled as specified in chapter 6 .
ACTION 1I All along the execution of RAP programs the set unit vill carry
out internal monitoring activities.
8.3          CORRELATION OF RAP AND CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE
136. It is one of the provisions of this RAP that its implementation should be carried in such a way
as to respect the basic RAP principles and objectives. This means that construction programs would
reasonably follow and not precede the execution of RAP programs. In other words, in case of retards
in RAP execution, the delay may be reflected in construction programs.
137. Necessary time allowances may be enacted for RAP programs that require the beginning of
construction work after the end of the harvest.



34
138.  Since this RAP will be approved by the RTG and WB by the October 1998, the
implementation of RAP programs will have to begin before the approval according to the following
