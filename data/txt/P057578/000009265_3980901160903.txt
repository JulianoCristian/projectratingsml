Executive Summary
Ratchaburi Power Plant Project
Environmental Impact Assessment
1.   Introduction: The Ratchaburi Power Plant Project will be located in subdistrict
Tambon Ban Rai, approximately 7 km northeast of Ratchaburi Province about 5 km. north of
Mae Khlong River. The project will incorporate four 700 MW  (nominal) supercritical,
conventional heavv oil fired units and three 600 MW (nominal) combined cycle blocks, for a
total site development of 4,600 MW. The thermal units will bum residual fuel oil (2% sulfur)
and/or natural gas and the combined cycle will bum natural gas as the primary fuel or
distillate oil as the back-up fuel. The area of the site is approximately 2,000 rai, and current
land use is rice cultivation and fishponds.
2.    Fuel: Sources of naturai gas for Ratchaburi Power Plant are developing production
regions located in the Gulf of Martaban, Union of Myanmar. Estimates of natural gas reserves
and production are 5,700 billion cubic feet and 525 cubic feet per day respectively. Natural
gas pipelines will be extended from production wells across peninsular Myanmar and enter
Thailand at the border (Kanchanaburi Province), then continue to the Ratchaburi Power Plant.
3.    Delivery of the residual (No. 6) fuel oil will be via a seaberth, fuel oil terminal and a
dedicated pipeline. The EIA for this pipeline to the power station has been finished. If
altemative fuel delivery schemes are contemplated for the project, an additional EIA would
be required, and would have to pass review by OEPP and the World Bank.
4.    Water Supply: The raw water supply (75.03 M.m3/year) will be provided from Mae
Khlong River at Ban Bang Li via pipeline to an onsite raw water reservoir. The water will be
pretreated and will serve for all plant needs, including cooling water makeup (69.60 M.
m3/year), potable water, general service water and demineralized water. The project will not
cause any change in the hydrology of the river basin.
5.    Condenser Cooling: Wastewater from the closed cycle condenser cooling system at
a maximum summertime temperature about 36 °C will be discharged into a holding pond
before being relayed to a wastewater retention pond.
6.    Baseline Ambient Air Quality:  An eight month sampling program  before
construction found maximum background concentrations of SO2 and NOx were less than 7
percent of the 1 hour and 24 hour national standards. TSP concentrations were higher,
especially in the dry season, at about half the national standard.
7.    Water Quality: Water quality in the Mae Khlong River is high in total and fecal
coliform counts. This may be due to the Ratchaburi Municipality and Lak Muang Sanitary
District wastewater discharges. Khlong Bang Pa irrigation drainage canal water quality is
poor (BOD5 4 - 23 mg/l) in the dry season, when the sluice is shut and the water stagnates.
Khlong Bang Pa receives effluent from poultry and prawvn farms.
8.    Air Pollution Control for Thermal Units:     Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions
from the thermal unit will be controlled by a wet limestone FGD system, of 90% efficiency.
The limestone source for the FGD is at Khao Ta Krao, Tambon Hin Kong, Amphoe Muang
ratc h.i.d,oc



Ratchaburi Province. Limiestonie (1,056 tons/day) would be crushed at the power plant site;
the EIA for the limestone quarry is currently unllCel OEPP review.
9.    Air Pollution Control for Combined Cycle: To control NOx, low NOx bumers
would bc Lused. ECh s.ack wVVould be equipped with continuous on-iine emissions monitoring
systems.
10.   Wastewvater: The wastewater sources to be recycled through an irrigation pond
include: sewage treatment plant (activate sludge and extended aeration); and plant drainage
through the oil/water separator. Water from the irrigation pond will be reused for gardening
and green area maintenance inside the plant boundary. Storm drainage from the power plant
area will be collected in a 100,000 cubic meter retention pond and pumped back to the
reservoir for reuse.
11.   Chemical wastewater and cooling tower blowdown would be discharged to the
Khlong Bang Pa irrigation drainage canal, via an onsite holding pond. Air heater washwater
will be routed to a lined pond for detention and treatment (pH adjustment, metals and
suspended solids reduction). Demineralization plant effluent would be neutralized. The
effluent would have higher total dissolved solids (TDS) than the irrigation system drain;
however, the effluent would meet the Royal Irrigation Department standard. The quality of
the water discharged into Khlong Bang Pa would be better with respect to all other
parameters than the water currently in Khlong Bang Pa, furthermore, the discharge would
increase flow in the Khlong Bang Pa, which is stagnant during the dry season.
12.   Solid Waste Disposal: The wastewater from the treatment system for circulating
water makeup consists of an alkaline slurry which will be dewatered using a thickener and
then a filter press. The sludge will be landfilled, and an impermeable liner of clay or synthetic
material will be used to contain leachate. A groundwater monitoring program similar to the
one for the plant site will be used for the gypsum landfill. The landfill area will be
approximately 600 rai (625 rai = 1 km2) and will also be used to collect discharge from the
FGD system, sludge from sewage treatment plant and solids from the air heater wastewater
treatment system. Gypsum by product from the FGD system is approximately 2,000 tons per
day or 350,000 m3 per year will be dumped in the landfill area of 600 rai at approximate heap
height of 10 meter. The estimated volume about 9.6 mnillion m3 will serve for the 25 year
power plant life. Alternative uses of gypsum are being evaluated.
13.   Hazardous Chemical Containment and Storage:  All chemical storage tanks,
solution tanks, and chemical feed pumps will be located on curbed concrete containment
areas drained through separate chemical waste collection piping to a neutralization basin or a
chemical waste collection sump. A curbed concrete area will be provided with a chemical-
resistant coating suitable for the particular service. As a minimum, the combined volume of
the curbed area and the associated neutralization basin or waste sump will be adequate to
contain the entire volume of the largest single tank served. A spill prevention, control and
response plan will be added to the site Emergency Plan, and added to the emergency response
drill routine.
14.   Chlorine: The chlorination station for the condenser cooling water will be equipped
with a leak detection and alarm svstem, wind sock-, leak stemming gear and personnel
protective equipment, includinlg self contained breathing apparatus.  A chlorine leakage



response scenario will be added to tlle plant Emergency Plan, and leak response drills
undertaken as pait of the emergency response drill routine.
15.   Fuel Oil Storage: Fuel oil will be stored in four tanks of 32 million liters capacity
each; a supply that would last for seven days of generation. The combined cycle units wvill
have three 17 million liter diesel oil tanks, a supply that would also last for seven days of
generation. The area surTounding the fuel oil storage tanks will be designed to contain oil
spills resulting from equipment failure or leaks occurring during normal operations. The oil
containment will be berms constructed of compacted earth with liner or retaining walls built
of reinforced concrete. Design and performance must conform with the concemed Ministry
Announcement and Act concerning oil storage B.E. 2474. (Modify no. 1-5 B.C. 2474-2530):
Fuel oil piping will be routed above grade on pipe racks in order to facilitate detection and
repair of leaks. If for any reason the pipe must be located underground, it will be placed in a
concrete trench wvhich will be drained to the oil/water separator. The facility Emergency Plan
covers fire and explosion. A spill prevention, control and response plan will be added to the
site Emergency Plan, and added to the emergency response drill routine.
16.   Analysis of Alternatives: Analyses of alternatives with respect to environrmental
aspects included site selection, fuel delivery systems (separate EIA for pipelines, sea berth,
undersea pipeline), FGD technology and wastewater discharge point. Two alternatives, Mae
Khlong River or Khlong Bang Pa irrigation drainage canal, were considered for discharge
from the onsite wastewater holding pond (cooling tower blowdown and pH adjusted
demineralization plant effluent). The preferred alternative is to discharge to the irrigation
drainage ditch.
17.     Environmental Management and Monitoring: An environmental management
unit will be instituted at the power station, responsible for carrying out the monitoring plan,
reporting performance, and follow up with management. The environmental unit would report
directly to the plant manager. The environmental monitoring plan covers the construction period
as well as ongoing operations, and includes: effluent and surface water quality; noise;
groundwater hydrology and quality; aquatic ecology; solid waste management; transportation;
socio-economic indicators; public health; and occupational health and safety. The monitoring
plan includes continuous air emissions and ambient air quality monitoring during operations.
18.     Public Consultation: Public consultation activities were undertaken from Deceriber,
1995, until November, 1997. Meetings included heads of local and provincial administratives,
Pikulthong Subdistrict Women's Group, Ban Choa Rai Nua Subdistrict wvomen's Group, Sam
Ruen Subdistrict Women's Group, and a Ratchaburi teacher's meeting.
