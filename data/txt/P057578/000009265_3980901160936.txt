Krabi Environmental Impact Assessmient
Addendum and Update
June 22, 1998
The Krabi Thermal Power Plant Project Environmental Impact Assessment was
approved by OEPP in April, 1997. This attachrment includes updates, clarifications and
additional information concerning the project. The information below reflects the as built
project, in which there were several changes made since the original Environmental
Impact Assessment was written.
Fuel Transportation: The Krabi Power Plant will use domestic or imported oil.
The barge transport EIA has been submitted to the Thailand Office of Environmental
Policy and Planning (OEPP). Oil would be transferred from ships to 1,000 ton barges,
through an estuary (24 krn) to a dock near the power station, and then via pipeline to the
power station. Preliminary analysis indicates an alternative for cost and environmental
reasons may be a pipeline from an offshore ship loading facility, to an underground
pipeline (16 kmn) along an existing road right of way to the power station. If this
alternative is preferred, the Pipeline EIA would be subject to review by the bank after
OEPP approval.
Fuel Storage: Backup fuel (diesel and heavy stock) would be stored in
aboveground tanks with environmental safeguards including: impermeable diked storage
areas; grounding; high and low level alarms: and fire fightin2 systems. Emergency spill and
firefighting plans have been developed and an accident prevention program would be
instituted. Fire protection systems within the power plant area and vicinity will be designed
according to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards. The facility
Emergency Plan covers fire and explosion. A spill prevention, control and response plan
will be added to the site Emergency Plan, and added to the emergency response drill
routine.
Hazardous Chemical Containment and Storage: All chemical storage tanks,
solution tanks, and chemical feed pumps will be located on curbed concrete containment
areas drained through separate chemical waste collection piping to a neutralization basin
or a chemical waste collection sump. A curbed concrete area will be provided with a
chemical-resistant coating suitable for the particular service. As a minimum, the
combined volume of the curbed area and the associated neutralization basin or waste
sump will be adequate to contain the entire volume of the largest single tank served. A
spill prevention, control and response plan will be added to the site Emergency Plan, and
added to the emergency response drill routine.
Chlorine: The chlorination station for the condenser cooling water will be
equipped with a leak detection and alarm system, wind sock, leak stemming gear and
personnel protective equipment, including self contained breathing apparatus. A chlorine



leakage response sceniario will be added to the plant em,ergencv plan, and  lea-k iesponise
drills uncdertakern as part of thie emergency response clrill roLtille.
Environment:al Ivlanagement and Monitoring: An environmental malagemeient
unit will be instituted at the power station, responsible for carrying out the monitoring plan,
reporting performance, and follow up with managemiient. The environinental unit woould
report directly to the plant manager. The enviromnental monitoring plan covers thle
construction period as well as ongoing operations, and incIldes: effluent and surface water
quality; noise; groundwater hydrology and quality; aquatic ecology; solid waste
management; transportation; socio-economic indicators; public health; occupational health
and safety and public relations. The monitoring plan includes continuous air ermissions and 
ambient air quality monitoring during operations.
Cooling Tower Blowdown: Cooling tower blowdown will be discharged to a
holding pond with retention time of one day prior to discharge to Khlong Pakasai. The
actual design specifications of the cooling tower have been used in conjunction with
meteorological records to estimate the temperature of the blowdown at the point of
discharge. The estimates have been compared to Thailand standards (3°C temperature
rise) and World Bank guidelines for thermal effluent (see Table 1, Krabi Cooling Tower
Blowdown). It can be seen that the blowdown would have exceeded 30C temperature rise
over surface water only once in 5 years. Furthermore, Thailand standards for thermal
effluent allow for a 500 meter mixing zone in the receiving water. Therefore, cooling
tower blowdoNvn would rarely, if ever, exceed thermal effluent standards.
Public Consultation: Public consultation has been an ongoing program, since
publication of the environmental impact assessernt.  An update of the public
consultation that has taken place since the finalization of the EIA is attached as
Addendum Annex 1.
Effluent, Emissions and Ambient Air Quality:      Estimates and design
specifications for effluent, stack emissions and ambient air quality are compared to
Thailand standards and World Bank guidelines in the following three tables (Tables 2, 3
and 4).

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) plan to construct
new 600 MW thermal power plant within the decommissioned Krabi Power Plant
complex at Tambon Khlong Khanan, King Amphoe Nua Khlong, Changwat Krabi. The
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is required for the project approval according
to the National Environmental Quality Act B.E.2535 and the related Ministerial
Declaration which stated that the Thermal Power Plant project larger than 10 MW need
to submit EIA to the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP) for review
in the process of project approval.
The scope of the environmental impact assessment are listed below:
(1) To define the study area which would be directly and indirectly affected
by Krabi Thermal Power Plant.
(2) To describe existing characteristics and quality of all environmental
resources within 5 km radius of the project site.
(3) To identify physical, ecological, human use and quality of life aspects
that would directly and indirectly affect or alter by the project development.
(4) To identify major changes of the environment that may be reasonably
expected as the results of the development.
(5) To evaluate and predict the positive and adverse impacts, short and long
term impacts of the proposed project upon the environmental resources and values, and
to define the degree of significance and magnitude of the predicted impacts.
(6) To make recommendations for short and long term measures to prevent
or mitigate the impact of the proposed project including appropriate short and long term
enviromnental monitoring programs for the proposed project and the evaluation of
expenses for the proposed environmental monitoring programs.

(3) Krabi Weather Station
The meteorological data recorded in 1994 showed that the monthly
maximum temperature were in the ranges of 30.3-33.5°C. Concerning the prevailing
wind, during April to October and November to March were west and northeast
direction respectively. The annual rainfall was 1,986 mm and the maxiInum value of
rainfall was in September.
3.5.2    Air Ouality
Results of air quality monitoring program at EGAT's power plant and its
vicinity during B.E. 2531-2536, showed that the 24-hr concentrations of TSP, NO2 and
SO2 were in the ranges of 3-927, 0-125 and 0-804 g/nm3 respectively.
The study team measured air quality for 3 consecutive days in January and
March 1996 at 5 stations at Ban Ko Phot, EGAT Power Plant, Ban Khlong Wai Lek,
Wat Pakasai, and Rongrian Thung Sakhon (see Figure 3.5-1). The results of the study
are described below.
(1) The First Measurement (January 1996)
The major of wind speed ranged from 4 to 16 knots. The percentage of
wind direction was at 39.3 for northeast and 12.9 for north directions.
The average concentration of PM10 at Ban Ko Phot and Ban Khlong
Wai Lek were 40.33 and 29.33 ,ug/m3 respectively. At Rongrian Thung Sakhon, EGAT
Power Plant, and Wat Pakasai the concentration were 46.33, 25.67 and 51.00 Jtg/m3
respectively. The maximum value was found at Wat Pakasai 58 gg/m3. The result
found were low about 50% of the standard value at Notification of National
Environmental Board (120 Jig/M3).

average concentration7 the maximum value was found at Wat Pakasai at 63 pg/m3.
The concentration of SO2 at Ban Ko Phot and Rongrian Ban Thung
Sakhon stations were not detectable for 3 days. At EGAT power plant and Ban Khlong
Wai Lek stations, the 24-hr value ranged from 11.6 to 32.8 p.g/m3 which are well
below than standard value (300 pjg/m3).
The 1-hr concentration of NO2 were found less than 10 to 21.04 4g/m3
which are within than Lhe standard value (320 pg/mr3).
The 24-hr concentration of TSP were 43.11 to 112.55 gg/mr3, the
maximum value was found at Ban Ko Phot station. However, this value was well below
the standard values of 330 pg/m3.

First Period, the results of noise level were in ranges of 50-59 dB(A), the
maximum value was experienced at EGAT power plant area. This noise level value is
acceptable comparing to the standard value of 70 dB(A) recommenced by US.EPA and
World Bank concerning to Ldn, the ranges of Ldn were found at 54-61 dB(A).
Second Period, Leq(24) and Ldn were found in the ranges of 46.69-60.20
and 54.47-66.38 dB(A) respectively, the maximum value was at Ban Ko Phot.
However, Leq(24) value is acceptable comparing to the standard.
3.7      SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
3.7.1    Natural Water Source
In general, the natural water source are small, short streams. The main water
sources are Khlong Pakasai and Khlong Phela. Khlong Pakasai is about 70 km long,
10-200 meters wide and 2-7 meters deep. From the measurement done by Ban Hua
Sapan Water Measurement Station during B.E. 2529-2532, the average runoff all year
round was about 38.91 million cu.m. At the water pumping station of Krabi power
plant, the annual average water flow rate was 93.3 cu.m./second. Khlong Paela is about
60 km in length, 2-200 m wide and 2-15 m deep. However, in some part of it the width
could be around 1,000 meters. The highest flow rate is 2,451 cu.m./second and the
lowest flow rate was 88 cu.m./second.
3.7.2    Developed Water Sources
There are two reservoirs in the project area:
The first reservoir covers an area of 0.75 km2 with the highest containing
capacity of 3.2 million cu.m. at the level of 17 m.MSL. The total catchment area is
5.08 km2; the amount of water flow into the reservoir is about 2.4 million cu.m. per
year.
3-7
ENVIO18/96191/CHAP3 SUMMARY



The second reservoir covers an area of 0.075 km2 with the highest water
containing capacity around 0.4 million cu.m. at the level of 9 m.MSL. The total
catchment area is 2.05 kM2; the amount of water flowing into the reservoir is 1.0
million cu.m./year.
3.8      SURFACE WATER QUALITY
The operation of Krabi Power Plant will require water supplies and the water
discharged from power plant may cause impact on the water quality of the natural water
bodies. The objectives of the study is to investigate the existing conditions of water
quality, to assess the impact of the project and to set up the mitigation plans and
monitoring measures for surface water quality.
Besides the secondary data reviews, field survey and water sampling were
conducted during 2 periods, 19-20 January 1996 and 13-14 March 1996. The samplings
stations were Khlong Pakasai (water source of power plant and discharge area), Khlong
Phela and 2 EGAT's reservoirs (see Figure 3.8-1).
Arsenic was not included for water quality parameter, since it will not be
used in the process of power plant. In addition, according to the public health survey,
the arsenic infected people were not found.
Results of the study show that in general the water quality in Khlong Pakasai
and Khlong Phela are good. There are only some heavy metals i.e. mercury and lead
concentrations being higher than normal standard level of coastal sea water. Lead
concentration in Khlong Phela (connect to the sea) was in range 0.001-0.009 mg/l
which are higher than the standard coastal sea water (<0.0001 mg/l).
Water quality in the EGAT's reservoirs was good with low alkalinity normal
hardness, low level of mercury. Phenol concentration was a little bit higher than the
standard but contamination with coliform bacteria was hardly found. During the 2
period of study it was found that the water was very clear and quantity of dissolved
oxygen varied according to photosynthesis algae.

3.9      GROUNDWATER HYDROLOGY AND GROUNDWATER QUALITY
In 5 km radius of the study area, there are of three types of aquifers
comprising Chao Phraya Aquifer, Colluvial Aquifer, and Krabi Aquifer. 60 piezometer
were installed around the project site in 1985 and it was found that piezometric level
ranged from -36.30 m.MSL to 25.50 m.MSL. The flow direction of groundwater was
in ENE direction.
In January 1996 the study team collected groundwater samples from the 4
stations (Figure 3.9-1) comprising Ban Ko Phot, Ban Huai Sok, Ban Huai Nam Yen
and Ban Khlong Wai Lek. Comparing to the standard of groundwater for consumption
it was found that the level of Manganese in groundwater sample from Ban Ko Phot and
the level of Iron found in groundwater sample from Ban Huai Sok are higher than the
highest allowance standard.
3.10     AQUATIC ECOLOGY
Reestablishment of Thermal Power Plant on the former expired power plant
area may cause some adverse effects both during construction and operating periods,
therefore, studying of aquatic ecology/fisheries and aquaculture are necessary. The
results obtained can be used to formulate and propose mitigation measure in reducing
the impacts, and set up monitoring programme.
Studies were made by literature review and field samples collection.
Collection of samples was made during 2 periods, one during 19-20 January and the
other during 13-14 March 1996; standard method by APHA-AWWA-WPCF (1992)
was employed. Altogether 7 sampling stations were selected, 5 in Khlong Pela-Pakasai
and 2 in freshwater reservoirs (Figure 3.10-1).
According to literature reviewed, at least 40 species of fish and other aquatic
animals were found in the project area. Both phytoplankton and zooplankton, 5 phyla
each and altogether 89 species were found in January 1996. 6 phyla of phytoplankton,
and 5 phyla of zooplankton with totally 69 species were found in samples collected in
March 1996. The most abundant was Diatom. Three groups and 9 groups of benthic
invertebrate animals were found in January and March 1996, respectively. The most

3.11     TERRESTRIAL ECOLOGY
3.11.1   Forestry
(1) For the inner zone (0-2 km radius), the presence of mangrove forest was
found to cover the southwestern to northeastern part of the area on the 30° direction. It
was evident that all the terrestrial forests were converted to other land uses, including
pararubber, oil palm, paddy and shrimp pond.
The mangrove forests are still under concession and will be terminated
in October 2001, after that the status of mangrove forest will be changed to
conservation forest. There are 22 trees and undergrowth species found in this mangrove
area. Some dominant species are; Kong kaang bailek (Rhizophora apiculata Koen.),
Kong kaang baiyai (R. Mucronata Poir), Ta buun kaao (Xylocarpus granatum Koen.),
Manaao phee (Atalantia monophylla Correa), and Chaak (Nypafruticans Wurmb).
The average tree density is 26.50 trees/rai, Ta buun kaao (Xylocarpus
granatum Koen.) has the highest density of 227.69 trees/rai follow by Kong kaang
bailek (Rhizophora apiculata Koen.) and Sainae kaao (Avicennia alba Roxb.) 54.15
trees/rai. The average sapling density is 11.3 trees/rai. Ta buun kaao (Xylocarpus
granatum Koen.) has the highest density (56.62 trees/rai) follow by Kong kaang bailek
(Rhizophora apiculata Bi.) 25.85 trees/rai and Samae kaao (Avicennia alba) 14.77
trees/rai.
The seedling density is averaged at 107.64 seedlings/rai. Ngueak plaa
mo (Acanthus volubilis Wall.) shows the highest density of 519.38 seedlings/rai follow
by Manaao phee (Atalantia monophylla Correa) 291.69 seedlings/rai; Ta buun khaao
(Xylocarpus granatum Koen.) 221.54 seedlings/rai.
(2) For the outer zone (2-5 km radius) the landuses are similar to the inner
zone, but some small plantation of Eucalyptus camaldulensis are present. This
plantation was partly substituted by oil palm plantation. No terrestrial forest is left
over. The tree and undergrowth species found in this zone are about 18 species.
The average tree density is 20.92 trees/rai. Kong kaang bailek has
highest density of 145.33 trees/rai follow by Faat khaao (Lumnitzera racemosa Willd.)
33.23 trees/rai and Pung ka hua sum (Bruguiera conjugata Merr.) 13.54 trees/rai.
ENVIO18/96191/CHAP3 SUMMARY         3 14



The average sapling density is 12.43 trees/rai which is almost the same
as in the inner zone area. Kong kaang bailek has the highest density of 65.33 trees/rai.
The average seedling density is 56.75 seedlings/rai. Ngueak pla mo still
shows the highest of 231.38 seedlings/rai. Sampling plot in the study area is shown in
Figure 3.11-1.
(3) Fuelwood Volumes & Values
From the survey, there are no merchantable size timber except the
fuelwood size. In the inner zone the average volume is 0.228 m3/rai. The outer zone
has the average fuelwood volume of 0.272 m3/rai.
The total fuelwood volume in the irner zone which cover an area of 760
rai is 173.28 m3, value 25,992 Baht.
The total mangrove area within 5 km. radius is 4,907 rai with average
fuelwood volume of 0.5 m3/rai, total present volume of 1,301.26 m3, total present
value 195,189 baht.
(4) Future Management
The mangrove forest in Changwat Krabi, especially in Klong Pakasai
and Klong Phela has been under concession No.40/2514 dated 8 October 1971 for 30
years. The second phase of the concession will be terminated on 7 October 2001. The
clear-felling in alternate strip of 40 m is employed.
After the termination of the concession, the mangrove area will be
assigned as conservation forest for environmental protection and spawning ground for
marine animals/aquatic organisms and fishes.
3.11.2   Wildlife
Direct and indirect surveys were carried out during the forest ecological
studies for the whole area of 5 km radius around the proposed plant site. The survey
results are classified into 3 categories with rating scales:

The results of the wildlife census reflected that there are at least 15
s.necies of mammals, 56 species of birds, 22 species of reptiles and 5 species of
amphibians existed in the area of 5 km radius around the power plant.
The very common mamnmals are Crab-eating macaque (Macaca
fascicularis) and Grey-bellied squirrel (Callosciurus caniceps).
The very common birds found in this area are about 11 species such as
Brown-headed gull (Larus brunnicephalus); Common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis); Indian
roller (Coracias benghalensis) etc.
The only reptile very common to this area is the Common house gecko
(Hemidactylusfrenatus). No amphibian found to be very common.
The present wildlife animals status are found in the 5 km radius around
the proposed project area, as the 15 indeterminated mammal species, the 51
indeterminated bird species, the 21 indeterminated reptile species and the 5
indeterminated amphibian species. The only one wildlife animal is threatened species as
Marble monitor lizard (Varanus nebulosus).
ENVIO18/96191/CHAP3 SUMMARY          3-17



According to the WARPA status, the wildlife animals are on two
component, as Protected and non-protected species and they are not found on reserved
animal species. The protected wildlife animals are the 7 mammnal species, 50 bird
species, 8 reptile species and the amphibians are not found. The non-protected wildlife
animals are 8 mammal species, 6 bird species, 14 reptile species and 5 amphibian
species.
It is envisaged that the birds are more diversified in this area but most of
them are the common species of the country and have high adaptive ability. They are
free to migrate when the environment is not preferrable.
(4) Evaluation of the Existing Environment
The wildlife habitats in this area is low in values for wildlife uses due to
many factors. The dry evergreen forests are now changed to other landuses such as
pararubber plantation, oil palm plantation, orchards, paddy field, shrimp ponds,
housing area, etc. The discontinuity of forest cover prevents many wildlife species to
survive. Only some wildlife species can adapt to the man-made plantations.
The mangrove forest by nature can support only few wildlife species
such as otters, silver langur, crab-eating macaque, some reptiles, amphibians, and
birds. The existence of mangrove forest is the only natural ecosystem in this area which
can be conserve for the future.
3.12     LAND USES/AGRICULTURES
Twelve land use types have been recognized. Description of each types and
distributions were described in the report.
Three important crops are para rubber (39%), oil palm (19%) and paddy rice
(6%). Other crops are fruit crops which cover only 0.6% of the total studied area. Para
rubber and oil palm will continue to be dominant crops of the area. Introducing fruit
crops to the area is limited by unsuitable soil condition.

(9) Idle land                                        1,932  rai
3.13     SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
Nua Khlong Sanitary district have 2 trucks for solid waste collecting for 2
times/day. The solid waste will be taken to be dumped into sanitary landfill site. For
solid waste management at out of sanitary area, each of household burn and bury to
waste themselves.
3.14     WATER USE
Water uses in the study area consist of domestic and aquaculture uses. Water
for domestic uses in EGAT's and major communities from water supply system. Raw
water for community water supply system is from shallow and deep wells. In EGAT's
premise, is raw water is pumped from 2 reservoirs, with total capacity of 3.6 MCM. At
present only 100 m3 of raw water are pumped up to produce water supply.
In other areas, there is no system of water resource management, there are
only self-supplied patterns. During the time of water shortage in some areas, EGAT
help the local people by supplying them with water in tank trucks.
ENV1018/96191/CHAP3 SUMMARY           3-19



In the study area there are aquaculture farms of jumbo tiger prawns and
groupers (Epinephelus sextasciatus). For groupers, they are kept in floating cages in
canals, need not water pumping. On the other hand, jumbo tiger prawns activities need
pumped up water about 243,000 m3/month. The total area of tiger prawn aquaculture is
about 135 rai.
3.15     POWER AND ELECTRICITY USE
During 1994-1995, King Amphoe Nua Khlong electricity use was
approximately 15,311,651 kW/hr. In addition, the percentage of people who use
electricity in the vicinity the project site; Ban Pakasai, Ban Thung Sakhon, Ban Huai
Sok, Ban Khlong Mak, and Ban Khlong Wai Lek; are about 66.22, 42.98, 87.63,
97.42, and 34.78 respectively.
3.16     DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL
Draining of water in the study area has so far been naturally via natural
waterways such as canals, reservoirs and running down to the Andaman sea finally.
However, about 3.1-3.87 million cu.m. of water is contained at the 2 EGAT's
reservoirs as water reserved for uses in various activities of EGAT and adjacent
villagers' supplementary water in times of drought.
3.17     TRANSPORTATION
(1) Land Transportation
Road network system in the proposed project vicinity consist of
Highway No.4 and No.4036. Recorded data by Department of Highway during 1990 to
1994 indicated that the traffic volume of highway No.4 and No.4036 were 4253 and
ENVIO18/96191/CHAP3 SUMMARY         3-20



1009 vehicles/day respectively. The increment rate of traffic volume per year of
highway No.4 and 4036 were 24.24% and 31.62% respectively.
(2) Navigation
Navigation consists of local and international transport from the project
site. Laem Kruat port in the nearest port to proposed project, located about 18 km.
According to the result of field survey in March 1996 it was found that the traffic
volume of fishing boat and passenger boat were 25 to 30 and 20 to 30 vessels/day
respectively at Laem Kruat port. EGAT oil receiving jetty will be nearby constructed
and approximately 11 km. from the power plant.
3.18     SOCIO-ECONOMIC
In this study, secondary data were collected and set up the population and
sampling from 5 villages (Figure 3.18-1); 22.3 percentage of household in each village
were randomly picked which equivalent to 90 samples. Results of the study indicates
that most of population are Buddhist and Muslin and their main occupation is
agriculturalist. The supplementary occupation is factory worker.
Shallow wells is the major source of water for consumption. In case of water
shortage the community were supported by Amphoe and EGAT power plant. General
problems of the villagers concern water and road condition. However, most of the
population are satisfied with living condition.
For awareness and attitude on the project, most of the villagers are willing
and need to have the new power plant because in the past, the last power plant
supported public development. It was the work place for local people, and there used to
be morning market in front of the power plant. Concerning attitude on the project, thus
expected that the project would provide them work place, community development,
electricity and transport convenience. Most of samples did not worry about negative
impacts from this project.

3.19     PUBLIC HEALTH
3.19.1   Public Health Resources and Problems
In the project area there is a general (provincial) hospital, and a community
(district) hospital under construction, 12 health centers and one community health
station. In 1995 the rates of birth, death and natural increase in King Amphoe Nua
Khlong were 12.03, 3.60 and 0.84 respectively which were relatively lower than those
of Changwat Krabi. The age structure of King Amphoe Nua Khlong were 32.7% under
14 years and 7.6% sixty years and over. Five leading diseases and rates per 100,000
population were diseases of the respiratory system (22,789.9), diseases of the digestive
system (9,368.1), infectious and parasitic diseases (7,757.3), diseases of skin and
subcutaneous tissue (4,338.4) and diseases of the endocrine and nutrition (2,377.6).
The top mortality were accident (51.5), fainting (46.6), gun shot (22.1), cancer (19.6)
and high fever (12.3) comparing to those of Changwat Krabi; transport accident (30.7),
heart disease (26.5), cancer (22.3), respiratory disease (22.0) and other accident (16.4).
The averaged annual parasite incidence during the past 5 years was higher than the
ministry's target indicating that malaria still prevails.
3.19.2   Health Problems Possibly Relating to the Project Development
Rates per 100,000 population of respiratory diseases in 1995 of Ban Laem
Kruad health center, Ban Tungprasan health center, Ban Khlong Siad health center and
Ban Khlong Khanan health center were 49,441.2, 31,334.6, 28,645.8, and 17,668.7
and rates of skin disease were 4,364.0, 4,738.9, 5,237.2 and 4,738.9 comparing to
Changwat Krabi 34,432.0 and 6,789.6 revealing that the project's rates of respiratory
disease was higher and skin disease's rate was lower.
Results from interviewing local health center personnel along the prevailing
wind's direction showed that common diseases among outpatients were diseases of the
respiratory system, disease of the digestive system, skin diseases, accident and
infectious and parasitic disease.
ENVIO18/96191/CHAP3 SUMMARY          3-23



Interviewing local people disclosed that there were many respiratory
diseases, asthma, skin disease, exhaust, loud noise and rotten smell. They believed that
the diseases were not caused by the operationr of the plant alone.
Reviewing of Krabi power plant's 1985 record revealed that the number of
respiratory infection cases were high especially among plant's workers. Some believed
that the diseases were induced by plant's operation and other- factors.
The analysis of outpatient records of the plant's medical unit for fiscal year
1995 showed that the common diseases were respiratory disease, digestive disease,
unknown origin, infectious and parasitic disease and diseases of the musculoskeletal
system. For occupational problems, they were accidents, diseases of the eyes and ears
and hazardous effects of toxic substances.
3.20     ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL VALUES
In the studied area, there are 4 archaeological and historical sites at Ko Mo,
Ko Lak, Ban Phela and Kuari Luk Pad; these sites are about 5.5-13 km from Krabi
power plant site (Figure 3.20-1). Archaeological materials found comprise potteries,
fossils, vases, pre-historical mould, Chinese and Indian art objects and others.
3.21     AESTHETICS AND TOURISM
Changwat Krabi is welknown for many attractive tourist sites including
natural or eco-tourism, historical/archaeological and religious remains, cultural
activities and others. However, within the project area, there is not any other
significant tourist sites except for Ko Daeng which is an aquaculture site and a local
resort located about 12 km to the south of the project site. It is noticeable that areas
around the thermal power plant can be developed into tourist attraction spots, for
example, the old mine area, residues dumping site (from lignite mine), and reservoir
area, can be developed for water sports, fishing, and sport activities for EGAT's
employees as well as for local people living nearby.

3.22     PUBLIC RELATION
The Public Relation activities for project sustainability essentially rely on
people participation as an important factor in the PR procedure. Hence, stimulating and
openning for people to participate with the project, using primary data as a tool for
communication is necessary. At the same time, channels for listening to peoples'
opinion, worriness, problems and needs should be implemented under friendly
atmosphere.
The objectives of PR work focus mainly on providing the
people/communities with correct information and at the same time listening to their
opinions and complaints as well. All PR activities should be going on until it was
accepted by the people, signifying by their good co-operations with the project which
fimlly lead to the success of the project.
The methods used to achieve for the above purposes was mainly the direct
two-way communication to open dialogues and discussion with explanations for better
understanding of both parties, informal and formal meetings were held for project
introduction, explanation and presentation of project progress. In addition, spreading
information through media, e.g., newspapers and TV was also used to reach the
general public.
The results of the PR activities indicated that people, government agencies
and related organizations understood the proposed project quite well. They expressed
their good attitudes toward both the project and EGAT, and said that they needed this
project and could foresee it's advantages very clear including strongly promising their
co-operation with the project both participation in the meeting and information
providing for the success of the project, be concluded that the project were advantage
point that people understand the project with good attitude and impress. There were
some weak points, however, and the community though that deriving from EGAT's
past actions which had not yet been solved. There were: using of dynamite in lignite
mining result in cracking of the mosque's (sacred place) wall, destroying fruit trees
during the field survey and poor health/illness in their respiratory system. Though some
affects have already been solved the people were not informed. Other incident was
some thin oil film on Khlong Pakasai water surface that occured particular in dry
season. Furthermore, the project has some potential risk that might affect them during
ENVIO18/96191fCHAP3 SUMMARY           3-26



the project operation. These are decrease of district executive body's income (tax) due
to EGAT housing being torn down, expectation on manpower recruitment opportunity
and their worries on future adverse effects from using of crude low grade fuel oil. They
understood that this might generate high pollution if leaking or unexpected accident
occured. In case of fuel transportation by water way, they were afraid that pollution
might reduce water, this people did not want it to happen because Krabi river tour is
the one of most distinct business nowadays.

CHAPTER 4
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
4.1      INTRODUCTION
The activities relating to the construction and operation of the Krabi Thermal
Power Plant Project may generate both positive and negative impacts to the surrounding
environment. Therefore, it is essential to assess the potential impacts at the early stage
of the development in order to be able to effectively minimize the adverse effects by
appropriate mitigation measures. The summarize level environmental impact assessment
are shown in Table 4.1-1.
4.2      TOPOGRAPHY
4.2.1    Construction Period
There will be only at little change in topography because the construction site
is the area which is now being used as EGAT building and power plant equipment.
There will be only filling up some areas of the new thermal power plant the impact
warehouses would be insignificant.
4.2.2    Operation Period
There will be no activity that would cause a radical change in topography;
there would be no impact.

4.3      GEOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY
The power plant site is situated on the Tertiary sediment. From bore log
data, clay and clay stone is underlying the project site, 40 m. depth. So, pile foundation
with a shallow depth may be need to support.
No impact of earthquake is expected to cause any dynamic effect on the
structures of the power plant because the project area is located on a low seismic risk
area (Zone 0) in which there will be no earthquake disaster and the standard for "Zone
1" is used in detailed design of the basement and buildings of the project.
4.3.1    Mineral Resources
There is no evidence to indicate that economic mineral or lignite resources
occur under the power plant site with area of about 150 rai. Mineral potential is
considered to be very low, mining development at the power plant site is not feasible.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the impact on mineral resources is nil.
4.3.2    Raw Material
Source of raw material for activities at Krabi power plant at Khao Kaew with
distance of approximately 10 km. from the project site. It activities are not proper
managed, especially the blasting, it will probably cause the negative impact on the
Khao Kaew community, approximately 200 m. of distance (east in the direction) from
the raw material source.

4.4      SOIL AND SOIL QUALITY
4.4.1    Construction Period
The impact would mostly occur in the construction site due to transportation
of construction materials and equipments. There would be no impact on soil quality in
general.
4.4.2    Operation Period
The thermal power plant is equipped with desulfurization technologies that is
capable to reduce SO2 as much as 80%. So, SO2 from emission can be expected at low
level. The effects on crops depend on their tolerance for acid soil. Most of plants such
as para rubber, palm oil, pine apple can grow on acid soil. It can be concluded that
effects of S02 on soils and plants would be minimal or nil.
4.5      AIR QUALITY
4.5.1    Construction Period
Construction of the power plant itself will generate mainly particulate matter
(dust) and gaseous emissions from engines and vehicles. This is not going to be a major
source of air pollutants as compared to the operation of the plant.
The imnpact during construction will be mainly from the transport of
materials. The erection of the power plant structure will not cause much dust as most
are steel parts and equipments, so the dust generating activities will be the
infrastructures such as roads and housing, offices, etc.
ENV1018/96191/CHAP4 SUMMARY           4-6



4.5.2    Operation Period
(1) Effect from Sulfur Dioxide
2% of Sulfur Content
(a) Normal Condition
The power plants thus can operate on the following conditions;
Using fuel oil with 2% S will need to operate FGD (eff. 80%)
which will reduce 1 hr concentration to 90 jig/m3, 24-hr concentration to 30 jtg/M3 and
annual average to 3 jig/m3 and emission level at 224 ppm which meet all ambient and
emission standards of Thailand (Figure 4.5-1 to 4.5-5).
(b) Abnormal Condition when with FGD
(1) In the case of using 2% S fuel without FGD the emission level
will be 1,120 ppmvd which is not in compliance with emission standard (320 ppmvd).
The ambient standards will just be met at 600-720 jig/m3 (1-hr) 180 jig/m3 (24-hr) and
24 pg/mr3 (annual).
(2) Simulation using fuel oil for 600 MW plants indicate that if 2%
S oil is to be used without FGD the maximum 1 hr concentration of S02 will be as high
as 450 jig/m3 in the worst hour of the year at NE direction near Ban Thung Sakorn and
SW direction with the distance of 1-2 kIn, 150 jig/m3 for the worst day of the year and
15 jig/m3 at annual average. The hourly and daily ambient air quality value will not
exceed the ambient standard of Thailand of 780 and 300 pg/mr3 respectively.
In summary the plant should operate with FGD but in the case of
failure of FGD, air pollution control measures for the emergency cases should be
operated.
(2) The Effect from the Other Pollutants
Other pollutants such as NOx. 1-hr maximum concentration is only 33
jig/m3 and dust is only 4 pg/m3 for 24 hour period and less than 1 jg/mr3 for annual
average. They are much lower than ambient air quality standards (Figure 4.5-6 and
4.5-7).

(3) Effect from Acid Rain
The chance of having incidents of acid rain from the project is minimal
as acid rain formation requires large SO2 emission and other precursors such as 03 and
photochemical oxidants (i.e. OH radical) which are more prevalent in urban areas. The
direct, non-catalyzed oxidation of S02 to sulfate is very slow.
The dominance of limestone in the area also acts as buffering for the
acids, if any. The rain also comes from both directions of the coast. In conclusion, the
chance of having acid rain is very remote.
4.6      NOISE
4.6.1    Construction Period
Concerning to the sensitive receptors adjacent to project site, the prediction
of noise level to EGAT community is predicted to be about 75 and 65 dB(A) at 500 m
and 1,000 m respectively. However, the construction activities will be limited on the
day time, in addition the natural noise barrier such as tree around the site are also used
to absorb noise which can be reduced about 5 dB. In summary the impact due to noise
from construction activities will be minor.
4.6.2    Operation Period
The power plant will generated noise level not exceed 85 and 54 dB(A) at 1
and 122 m. respectively. So, this noise level will not disturb to offices and workshops
area and the impact on noise level is negligible to the adjacent communities.

ENVIO18/961911CHAP4 SUMMARY



4.7      SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
4.7.1    Construction Period
The project site is not namtural drainage area, in addition for construction
period water use for there activities are from EGAT reservoir. Therefore, it will not
induce negative impact on surface hydrology.
4.7.2    Operation Period
The cooling system of the project will use water from Khlong Pakasai by
pumping at the rate of 98,496 m3/day and the treated water from cooling system will be
discharged back to Khlong Pakasai with the rate of 68,418 m3/day. In summary, net
water use is at the rate of 30,078 m3/day (0.44% of minimum flow). Therefore, the
impact on surface water hydrology is low.
4.8      SURFACE WATER QUALITY
4.8.1    Construction Period
In construction period might cause the high turbidity and suspended solids
followed by sedimentation especially during rainy season. This impact will be created
only short term effect.
4.8.2    Operation Period
Normally the problem of water discharge from the power plant is the high
water temperature which would cause impact only at discharge site. However,
wastewater is treated until the quality of effluent is in compliance with Industrial
4-16
ENV1018/96191/CHAP4 SUMMARY



effluent standard. Then the treated wastewater will be discharged into the drainage
system and out to Khlong Pakasai.
4.9      GROUNDWATER HYDROLOGY AND QUALITY
4.9.1    Construction Period
The foundation excavation will temporarily lower the groundwater level
within the project site and vicinity. However, the water level will recover to original
level soon after the excavations are backfilled.
4.9.2    Operation Period
During this phase of the project, groundwater will not be used as water
source, thus, no impact on groundwater hydrology will occur.
The wastewater, domestic and process types, will be treated to meet MOI
standard prior to discharge into common channel and drained to Khlong Pakasai. In
addition leachate from gypsum disposed should has impact only on hardness of the
water. Therefore, the impact on groundwater is not significant.
4.10     AQUATIC ECOLOGY
4.10.1   Construction Period
During construction period, surface runoff water may become turbid due to
earth work. Some low degrees impact on bottom fauna may occur particulary at turbid
water receiving areas but there may be very less impact on plankton organisms due to
their short life cycle. Fish are mobile so they can avoid such condition.
ENV1018/96191/CHAP4 SUMMARY             7



4.10.2   Operation Period
During operating period, some 98,496 cu.m./day was pumped up. Some
plankton organisms and aquatic animal larvae (during breeding season) may be sucked
by water pump and warmer water in cooling system may kill parts of them but plankton
has a very short life cycle, the impact may be low. As for aquatic animal larvae, since
power plant location is rather far away from river mouth where larvae feeding ground
is, therefore, low level of negative impact can be expected. As for warm water of 350C
discharged from plant cooling system may have low negative impact on fish and other
aquatic animals including plankton because the warm water will be kept in holding
pond and retention pond to reduce its temperature to normnal level prior to discharge
into Khlong Pakasai.
4.11     TERRESTRIAL ECOLOGY
4.11.1   Construction Period
(1) Mangrove Forest
The construction area will be in the existing power plant area, not in the
mangrove forest area, the direct impact are not found and there were no report of
damages to the plants or mangrove forest by the pollutants from previous Krabi power
plant.
(2) Wildlife
The impact on wildlife resource during the construction phase are
insignificant.
ENVIo18/96191/CHAP4 SUMMARY          4 18



4.11.2   Operation Period
(1) Mangrove Forest
The impact from the air pollution on mangrove forest are not expected
(insignificant). During the past 30 years of Lignite Power Plant project, there has been
no report of injury to forest plants by pollutions.
(2) Wildlife
The wildlife animals can live in their unchanging habitats which they
have been living before. The impacts are not found.
4.12     LAND USES/AGRICULTURE
4.12.1   Construction Period
During construction period, there is clear direct impact on the loss of plant
production. However, there may be indirect impact caused by shifting of labour from
agricultural sector to construction work.
Dust created by transportation and movement of construction equipments
may effect plant photosynthesis system which will in turn effect the production of plant.
4.12.2   Operation Period
The Krabi Thermal Power Plants use low sulphur content (2%) oil which is
estimated to consume about 2.628 million litres/day. The power plants emit S02, NOx,
CO and suspended particulate. The power plant will be equipped with Flue Gas
Desulfurization system by using limestone (CaCO3) with 80% efficiency. Besides 20%
of SO2 is emitted into the air. Then will be also low level of CO and NOx which will
subsequently deteriorate plant product.
Gypsum will be got as by-product which will generate about 390-670
tonnes/day (moisture 25 %) and will be collected at the Khlong Ban Mark pits.
4-19
ENVIOIS/96191/CHAP4 SUMMARY



It can be concluded that overall impact from power plant project will be
insignificant on quality of soil and agricultural product around the project area.
4.12.3   Recommendation for Improvement of Land Use Pattern of the Power
Plant
To improve land use pattern of the area, it is recommended that the following
changes should be made:
(1) The old ash pit adjacent to Khlong Pakasai should be used for office
building site and area for expansion of office building.
(2) The botanic garden should be rehabilitated as recreation area for the
project staffs and local people.
(3) Fast growing trees such as Acacia mangium etc, should be planted
around the water body.
(4) Weeding, manuring, etc should be given to para rubber plantation in
order to obtain beneficial or at least to improve the scenery of the project area.
(5) Recreation area needs better management to attract more players.
(6) Reservoir is already in good condition. Khlong Wai Lek pit should be
used as an additional reservoir for future demand.
(7) Vacant area should be planted with fast growing trees and local plants to
prevent land encroachment.
4.13     SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
4.13.1   Construction Period
During construction period, a rate of domestic waste will be generated from
workers, approximately 724 kg/day. However, these wastes will be generated for only
short period and properly managed by contractors. Moreover waste of construction
material can be used for land reclamation.
4-20
ENVIO18/96191/CHAP4 SUMMARY



4.13.2   Operation Period
Staff, of the project, will generate domestic waste at a rate of 125 kg/day, the
waste will be appropriately disposed by EGAT. Gypsum will be generated at the rate of
390-670 tons/day and will be transported to mine sump which capacity of 10 MCM.
The capacity of this mine sump is adequate for 25 years disposal throughout the
operating life of the power plant. Therefore, the impact on waste management to
community will none.
The waste from water production and wastewater treatment system will be
dumped into the old pit within the power plant area. The waste dumping should be
conducted according to the regulations of Ministry of Industrys on waste sanitary
landfill.
For expired resin, it would be prescribed in the contract that the seller must
take the expired resin back. If it is necessary, the resin would be buried within the old
pit which has enough capacity for the whole operating life of the power plant.
4.14     WATER USE
4.14.1   Construction Period
For construction activities, total volume of water needed would be 265 cu.m.
/day. Adding up with existing water consumption of EGAT of 100 cu.m./day, volume
of water uses would be about 115,500 cu.m./year. The total storage capacity of the 2
EGAT's reservoirs is about 2.2 MCM/year. It can be concluded that there would be
adequate water for project's activities and no impact in this aspect.
4.14.2   Operation Period
The total volume of water consumption is about 1,686,600-2,086,000 cu.m./
year, less than the capacity of EGAT's reservoirs, so, there would be no impact in
water use. Although there is adequate amount of water, EGAT should plan for
4-21
ENVI018/96191/CHAP4 SUMMARY



additional source of water for the future such as planning to use Khlong Wai Lek old
pit and Bang Pu Dam old pit as additional reservoirs to keep reserved water and to
make the landscape more beautiful.
4.15     POWER AND ELECTRICITY USE
4.15.1   Construction Period
For this project, electricity use will increase 0.82%. In addition, the
construction activities are only in short period of 35 month, so the impact would be
minor.
4.15.2   Operation Period
EGAT will use electricity from Krabi thermal power plant, so the impact will
be nil.
4.16     DRAINAGE AND FILOOD CONTROL
4.16.1   Construction Period
The wastewater generated from the workers will be approximately 138
m3/day. These wastewater will be treated by septic tank. Wastewater from construction
activities will be naturally infiltrated on the ground. There will be high sediment from
silt or sand in the surface runoff. The surface runoff will be drained through sewer into
the holding pond for sediment precipitation, after that the clear water will be discharged

m3/day. This wastewater will be drained into holding pond and retention pond for
treatment until the quality of effluent is in compliance with Industrial Department
Standard then drained out to Khlong Pakasai. The maximum drainage rate of about
0.79 m3/sec or about 0.98 percentage of flow rate in Khlong Pakasai.
(2) The domestic wastewater, approximately 95 m3/day will be drained into
the package treatment plant.
(3) The surface runoff within the power plant will be drained into the
holding pond and then drained into Khlong Pakasai.
In summary, this project has planned for wastewater treatment before
draining into natural water bodies so the impact is minimal.
4.17     TRANSPORTATION
4.17.1   Construction Period
During the construction period, this project will use only land transportation
via Highway No.4. The increased traffic volume will be due to the transport of
construction material and machineries about 20 trips/day via highway No.4. In
addition, most of the workers will live close to the power plant site, therefore the traffic
generated from the workers is not consider as major impact.
In summary, the percentage of traffic volume will increase on the highway
No. 4 at 0.47. However, construction activities will create short-term effect (35
months).

(a) Reduce the weight, size, or height of fall of the impacting mass.
(b) Cushion the impact by inserting a layer of shock-absorbing material
between the impacting surfaces. The object for this is to reduce the transmission of
impact energy to other parts of the machine.
(c) Whenever practical, one of the impact surfaces should be made of
non-metallic material to reduce resonance.
(d) Substitute the application of a small impact force over a long time
period for a large force over a short period to achieve the same result.
(e) Fans, impellers, turbines should be operated at the lowest blade tip
speeds that will still meet job needs. Use large-diameter, low-speed fans rather than
small-diameter, high-speed units for quiet operation.
(f) Centrifugal squirrel-cage type fans are less noisy than vane axial or
propeller type fans, all other factors being equal.
(g) In air ventilation systems, a 50 percent reduction in the speed of the
air flow may lower the noise output by 10 to 20 dB.
(h) Reducing friction between rotating, sliding, or moving parts in
mechanical systems frequently results in smoother operation and lower noise output.
(2) The mitigation measures of the limestone quarry are as follow:
(a) Personal ear-muffs should be provided for the staffs who work in

MONITORING PROGRAMS
6.1     INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 5, the mitigation measures were issued to alleviate the possible
impacts from the project. The monitoring program to be proposed in this chapter is the
follow-up tool to ensure the effectiveness of the recommended measures. In addition,
the data obtained from the monitoring program will be a very useful indicator of the
Krabi Thermal Power Plant's pollution control system. EGAT need to strictly
implement these monitoring program and issue the monitoring report to OEPP every 6
months (Table 6.1-1, Figures 6.1-1 and 6.1-2).
