The lessons learned indicate that complex\n            projects could be formulated and approved within a short\n            time frame when there is full cooperation between the Bank\n            and the Borrower. The Bank's Partial Credit Guarantee\n            could be a useful tool in securing favorable terms for the\n            Borrower, provided it is selectively applied, i.e., when\n            market conditions are appropriate and the Borrower's\n            own credit rating is sound. Sudden economic/financial crisis\n            in a country, especially following a prolonged period of\n            growth, could severely impact power demand and void power\n            development plans. Introduction of complex power pool\n            operations in a developing country needs to be thought\n            through with care. Active support rather than reluctant\n            acquiescence of the utilities is necessary to push through a\n            complex reform agenda."}, "docdt": "2004-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
