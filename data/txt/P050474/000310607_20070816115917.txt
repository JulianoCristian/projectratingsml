(incl. %        and that the enrolment rates were already high before the start of the project

achievement)    there is not enough basis to judge the achievement of this project based on this

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
During the time of appraisal, though enrolment rates had declined slightly, nearly all
children attended general school through the final year (grade11), and nearly all adults
were literate. In the best of Russian schools, learning achievements were on a par with
the best found anywhere in the world. Some of the other characteristics of the
development context of the Russian Federation (RF) were political instability,
decentralization from the Federal Government to Regional Governments, tight budgetary
environment including the fiscal crisis of 1998, and population decline. Social services
were decentralized in 1992. While the Government continued to make fiscal transfers to
the regions, especially to deficit areas, these had declined substantially as a fraction of
GDP and were not linked to specific reforms or the establishment of minimum
access/care standards. As a result, the quality of publicly financed and provided education
services had deteriorated in many areas.

Public expenditures on education, fluctuating between 3.4 percent and 4.5 percent of
GDP had fallen during 1990s at the rate of 6 percent per year in real terms. In 1998,
consolidated public education expenditures amounted to 3.6 percent of GDP, which were
in line with those observed in countries with comparable income levels. However, this
was less than 5.4 percent of GDP on an average in OECD countries. These expenditure
levels were grossly inadequate to finance the same level of education services historically
provided by the public sector.

Decentralization in the education sector began in 1992 with general education. The
decentralization of initial vocational education followed much later and was to continue
during project implementation. Decentralization coincided with growing regional
inequity and emerging inequality of access to education. Decline in school age population
added an additional dimension to the problem of the education sector by making
sustainability of a large number of schools with low utilization factor, especially in rural
areas, impractical. In this context, the Commission for Economic Reform of the Russian
Federation requested the Ministry of Education (MOE) to prepare proposals to increase
efficiency and reduce unit costs of education while improving relevance to the needs of a
changing market economy. Reform of education financing, including new systems to
make fiscal flows to schools more transparent and the use of funds more efficient, was an
immediate objective. The 2000-01 Economic Program of the Government of Federation
articulated the priority of the government strategy in the education sector as "the creation
of the institutional, economic and legal framework to ensure the implementation of the
per capita financing scheme".

The main sector issues to be addressed were: (a) poor teaching methods and shortage of
teaching materials; (b) inadequately trained teachers and administrators; (c) lack of
national system of student assessment and other indicators of educational quality; (d)



                                              1

 inefficient governance and financing structure; (e) low utilization of schools' capacity; (f)
  poor flexibility and market relevance of skills acquired in the education system; and (g)
  lack of public participation.

  The Bank was the only international organization with sufficient resources to assist in the
  sector-wide policy reform in the education sector. The Bank also had the capacity to
  mobilize and consolidate other donor support. European Training Foundation (ETF)
 together with a contribution from the Finnish Government complemented Bank inputs in
 the area of initial vocational training.

 The CAS of 1999 identified the need to reform service delivery paradigms and financing
  arrangements to ensure access to quality basic services in education. The CAS Progress
  Report of 2001 articulated the key challenge of the Bank's strategy in the education
  sector as "to improve and modernize service delivery, primarily through major but
 attainable increases in efficiency". The project contributes to the CAS objectives of
 improving public sector administration and financial management, and basic social
 services by improving the delivery of basic education services, and the transparency and
 accountability of the public sector.

 1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
 The development objective of the project was to provide assistance to MOE and
 competitively selected regions of Russia to reform general and initial vocational
 education in order to: a. improve quality and standards; b. promote the efficient and
 equitable use of scarce public resources for education; c. modernize the education system
 (structure of network and institutions); and d. improve the flexibility and market
 relevance of initial vocational education.

 The key performance indicators were: a. improved standard education indicators; b.
  quality monitoring and educational statistics guidelines developed, implemented and
  disseminated; c. education policy capacity developed; d. improved access for rural
  students in three pilot regions; and e. improved market relevance of initial vocational
  education system in three pilot regions.

  The above objectives and indicators are as described in the main text of the PAD and in
  the Loan Agreement. The objectives presented in ISRs are the same as the above. But the
  objectives described in Annex 1: Project Design Summary of PAD and the Supplemental
  Letter are formulated differently as follows:
· Improve efficiency and access to good quality education in Russian Federation.
  o Support education policy development, evaluation and dissemination at the Federal
      level.
  o Improve the quality, efficiency, relevance, equity and access of the educational
      system in three regions of the Russian Federation.

  The differences between the two above formulations of objectives from the point of view
  of evaluation of the outcomes are as follows:




                                               2

· The second formulation focuses primarily on higher level objectives of improving
  efficiency of the education system and access to good quality education, and as such,
  regards the promotion of the efficient and equitable use of scarce public resources for
  education or implementation of per capita funding (PCF), and restructuring of school
  networks as indicators of achievement of the higher level objectives.
· The first formulation focuses on the promotion of the efficient and equitable use of scarce
  public resources for education or implementation of per capita funding (PCF), and
  restructuring of school networks as objectives in their own rights in addition to the
  objective of improving quality and standards.

  The use of the first formulation is more meaningful for the following reasons:
· Improving efficiency and access to good quality education is an ultimate objective of any
  education project. This aspect is captured by both formulations.
· Introduction of PCF and restructuring of school networks are major reforms in the
  education sector, which has their own independent significance. The first formulation
  assigns greater significance for success of these reforms than the second.
· Implementation of PCF, restructuring of school networks, and improvement of the
  flexibility and market-relevance of initial vocational education have been the center of
  focus through out the project implementation.

  Based on the above, the evaluation of project outcomes will be made based on the first
  formulation of development objectives contained in the Loan Agreement.


  1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
  reasons/justification
  Not revised.

  1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
  (original and revised briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
  and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
  to benefit from the project)
  The primary target groups were MOE of the Russian Federation, and the regional
  Departments of Education (DOE), municipalities, general schools and initial vocational
  schools of the three pilot regions. The ultimate beneficiaries of the project were students,
  teachers and employers. Secondary beneficiaries of the project were to be other regions
  of the Russian Federation, who were eligible for accessing project grants to replicate
  reforms in pilot regions. The Russian education system as a whole was expected to
  benefit from improved public resources management, with clearer governance and a more
  effective information system.

  1.5 Original Components (as approved)
  The project included Federal, Regional and Project Management components.

  Component 1, Federal component was designed to build the capacity of MOE to support
  reforms aimed at improving quality and standards of education, increasing efficiency of



                                               3

the use of public resources, modernizing the education system structure and network, and
improving market relevance of initial vocational education. This component included
four sub-components:

The Education Policy Reform sub-component was designed to assist MOE: in building its
capacity to implement reforms in general and initial vocational education in the pilot
regions; in setting up monitoring and evaluation system which would monitor project
outcomes and evaluate impact of the project on federal and regional education systems;
in implementing and disseminating throughout the Russian Federation, successful reform
models for general and initial vocational education; and in effecting appropriate changes
in the regulatory framework.

The Quality Monitoring and Statistics sub-component was aimed at developing the
capacity at the federal level to establish a quality monitoring and assessment system, and
develop performance indicators, and collects and analyzes educational statistics.

The Training and Retraining sub-component was to equip school directors and personnel
of local government offices with the skills needed for administrating new functions
related with devolution of authorities to schools and the local government.

The sub-component "Courses for New Professions and Teaching and Learning Materials
to Develop Work-related Core Skills" was to develop initial vocational education
programs for new professions and training materials for them. This component was to
help achieving the objectives of improving quality and standards, promoting efficient and
equitable use of public resources, modernizing the education system, and improving
market relevance of initial vocational education through building capacity of the MOE.

Component 2, Regional component was to improve efficiency of general education
through introduction of per-capita funding and the restructuring of the school network;
and to improve the efficiency of initial vocational education through its restructuring and
rationalization, and improvement of its market relevance. This component had three sub-
components as follows:

Efficient and Equitable Public Resources Management sub-component was to: assist the
pilot regions in introduction of per-capita funding, and building general and financial
management capacity at the regional, municipal and school levels; and help strengthening
the capacity of regional administration in quality assurance including student
achievement tests, and educational statistics.

Modernization and Restructuring of the General Schools Network sub-component was
designed to help to consolidate rural schools offering grades 5-11 with a view to offer
better facilities to rural students, and to establish educational districts to provide a range
of educational services to both urban and rural schools.

Modernization of Initial Vocational Schools and Improvement in the Market Relevance of
Vocational Education sub-component was to assist the regions in rationalization of



                                               4

school profiles, some horizontal and vertical amalgamation, closures of non-viable
schools and the creation of clusters of vocational schools accessing multi-function and
well equipped resource centers. In addition, it was to assist in modernization of curricula
for new programs, piloting of competency-based modular courses, the establishment of
independent mechanisms to monitor quality, in-service training of vocational teachers,
and the establishment of labor market linkages.

This component was to help achieving the objectives of improving quality and standards,
promoting efficient and equitable use of public resources, modernizing the education
system, and improving market relevance of initial vocational education through: building
capacity of the regions, municipalities and schools; upgrading of physical facilities of
general and vocational schools; establishing resource centers; introduction of per-capita
budgetary allocation system; strengthening quality assurance, statistics and monitoring
system; consolidating general schools; establishing education districts; restructuring
initial vocational schools network and rationalizing school education profiles; and
modernizing initial vocational education curricula and strengthening linkages with the
labor market.

Component 3, Project Management was to provide resources for the operation of
federal and regional PIUs.

1.6 Revised Components
Devolution of responsibility for IVE to regions in January 2005 necessitated a minor
revision of IVE related sub-component of the Federal component. This revision was to
incorporate development of regulatory framework for management of IVE schools in
decentralized environment. No other changes were made in the project components.


1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)
There were no significant changes in the design, scope, scale and implementation
arrangements of the project, but there were changes in the implementation schedule and
funding allocations. The project faced significant delays at the start up stage. While the
project was approved by the Board on May 24, 2001, it became effective on July 19,
2002. The sub-loans for Chuvash Republic and Samara Region became effective on April
4, 2003 and April 28, 2003 respectively. Yaroslavl, the third pilot region ­ had to be
replaced by Voronezh, as an agreement between Yaroslavl and the Russian Federation on
rescheduling the debts of the region could not be reached. As result of these delays only
about two years were left for implementation of the Voronezh sub-loan. The
consequences of these delays were that the project staff had to put a lot of efforts to
complete all planned activities within the compressed schedule. This created an
unfavorable situation for implementation of reforms, which is time consuming.

In December 2002, unallocated funds equal to US$ 150,000 were cancelled, and US$ 1
million was reallocated from the category Operating Expenditures under the Federal
component to the category of Dissemination Grants under the Regional component.


                                            5

Following the replacement of Yaroslavl region by Voronezh region in March 2004,
US$2.85 million were cancelled from the Regional component. This cancellation was
based on the assessment of the needs of Voronezh. On April 30, 2007, on the expiry of
the grace period, undisbursed funds of US$800,000 were cancelled.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
Soundness of background analysis. The policy content of the project was drawn from
the sector study "Reforming Education in the Regions of Russia"1. The overwhelming
response of the pilot regions as well as other regions to the reform agenda of the project
was an indication of the soundness of the background analysis made in course of the
preparation of the project. For example, the challenging introduction of per capita budget
allocation and restructuring of school networks in three pilot regions and in a further 22
regions would not have been possible if appropriate conditions did not exist. Similarly,
the assessment that there was a favorable environment for introducing public
participation in school management have been proved to be correct based on its
acceptance both by the state and the public.

The two lessons learned from previous projects and incorporated in the project that
significantly benefited the project were: "coordination and communication with major
stakeholders is critical for success of reforms" and "some regional PIUs are beginning to
manage more efficiently than those at the federal level". In spite of the fact that the
implementation of the per capita funding is one of the most politically sensitive reforms,
it faced surprisingly little resistance. This could be attributed to the good communication
on reform issues that the project was able to organize. In spite of the significant delay in
effectiveness of the Regional component of the project, the project was completed within
the original timeframe largely due to the pragmatic implementation arrangements that
relied heavily on the capacity of regional PIUs.

Assessment of the project design. The PDO was focused on outcomes that were clear.
While the outcomes related to promoting efficient and equitable use of resources, and
modernizing the education system were achievable, the outcome related to improving
quality and standards of education was highly ambitious given that improvement in
quality of education is difficult to be achieved within the short project period, and that
Russia was going through a transition period. Similarly, the outcome related to improving
the flexibility and market relevance of initial vocational education was also an ambitious
one. The Russian Federation was in need of serious reforms in the education sector owing
to the shift from the planned economy to the market economy, the economic crisis of the
late nineties, and the decrease in enrolment. In this context, the reforms supported by the
project were very responsive to the need of the country. The project objectives


1 World Bank Technical Paper No. 457, 1999



                                                6

correspond to the two priority areas for bank engagement ­ public sector administration
and financial management.

The components were generally well designed to ensure the achievement of project
objectives except that it was not realistic to expect to see immediate improvement of
learning achievements of pupils considering the extent of project inputs and the short
duration of the project. The project design was realistic from the perspective of the
capacity of the implementing agency, and the ability of the regions to co-fund the
program. Lessons learned in previous projects were skillfully used in the design of the
project. The following were the lessons that contributed significantly to the success of the
project: (a) communication and coordination with major stakeholders is essential for
success in education reforms; and (b) the success of per capita financing also depends
upon a good dissemination strategy.

The project preparation also benefited from the strong PIU at the federal level ­ National
Training Foundation (NTF) ­ which had the experience of implementing the Bank
supported Education Innovation Project. Project preparation was greatly facilitated by the
Portfolio Development Loan and the PHRD Grant, which helped to achieve high quality
project preparation. Project preparation also benefited from professionalism and Russian
experience of international consultants as well as from the availability of high quality
university faculties and consultants in Russia.

Adequacy of government's commitment. Pursuing the reform agenda of the project
required a strong commitment from the Government and strong capacity of the
implementing agencies. During the project preparation stage, there was a good reform
environment, and the commitment to reform was strong both at the federal as well as
regional levels. It was remarkable that the reforms started well before the approval of the
project, and that they were in many instances already at the advanced stages by the time
of effectiveness of the regional components.

Assessment of risks. Identification of risks and mitigation measures were generally
adequate except that the risk that the project period could be of short duration in order to
implement fully significant reforms, and make their impacts felt was not realized. During
the implementation risks that were difficult to foresee at the preparation stage surfaced,
which were delays in effectiveness of sub-loans, administrative reform of the government
and devolution of IVE sector to regions.


2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Factors that contributed to the success of the project. It was admirable that the project
was completed within the original Closing Date in spite of serious start up delays and
other problems discussed below. The credit for this major achievement goes to the strong
capacity, commitment and determination of the NTF, and to the very proactive Bank task



                                               7

team. The use of PDL helped to complete substantially preparatory activities that helped
to gather momentum immediately after its effectiveness of the loan and sub-loans.

A major factor contributing to the success was the deep commitment of the federal as
well as regional governments to the reforms underpinning the project. The President's
Directive to implement of per capita funding across the country contained in his Message
to the Duma (Parliament) is an indication of this commitment. The commitment to
reforms was especially strong in the pilot regions. ERP supported reforms became the
major regional agenda for improvement of the education sector. These reforms started
well ahead of the project effectiveness and did not slowed down due to the delays in
project effectiveness. The pilot regions were also able to mobilize considerable resources
­ well above the originally committed amount - in support of these reforms. For example,
the Borrower was able to mobilize US$124 million against the appraisal estimates of
US$71 million.

The high quality of expertise, available in the professional community of the country, and
social acceptance of the reforms supported by the project have also contributed to the
success of the project.

Factors that gave rise to problems. As a result of coordination problems associated
with the reorganization of MOE as a result of the civil service reform, the task of
transition into a new statistical monitoring system (EMIS) for the general secondary and
initial vocational education was not accomplished. Decentralization of initial vocational
education in January 2005, and the resulting preoccupation of regions in managing this
transition slowed down implementation of the IVE related activities. The introduction of
the treasury control of school accounts did not allow the concept of financial autonomy of
schools to materialize fully.

The most significant factor negatively affecting the project was start up delays resulting
from delays in project agreement signing, effectiveness of the sub-loans, particularly that
of Voronezh, which became effective just over two years ahead of the Closing Date. Start
up delays combined with devolution of IVE in the middle of the project compounded the
difficulties for implementation of IVE reforms. IVE reforms are not as deep as general
education reforms. For example, impacts of IVE reforms are not as visible as that of
general education reforms. There was not enough time for testing the operation of
resource centers - the major intervention in the area of IVE. Similarly, Voronezh could
not make the same degree of achievements, as other pilot regions due to the extremely
compressed period of project implementation.

Other aspects of implementation. The decision to transfer funds from operating costs to
dissemination grants had favorable impact for expansion of successful reform experience
from pilot regions to other regions, though there was some fear that this might have an
adverse impact on project management. But in reality it did not have any significant
adverse impact on the project outcomes.

The IP and Regional Component ratings were downgraded to unsatisfactory in August
2002 due to the impending delay in making sub-loan agreements effective, and the
concern about the proposed reduction of operating costs. Both ratings were upgraded to
satisfactory in May 2003 following the effectiveness of sub-loan agreements for
Chuvashia and Samara. ERP became a problem project in July 2002, and it came out of
that status in May 2003.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The project was monitored using Key Performance indicators (KPI) agreed upon during
October 2004 mission. KPI were designed to operationalize monitoring indicators in
PAD and the Supplemental Letter. KPI broadly capture the outcomes and outputs to be
measured. KPI were monitored regularly, and reported in status reports prepared for
missions and Financial Monitoring Reports. Strengths and weaknesses of the monitoring
and evaluation system are elaborated below.
· Output and outcome indicators in the Supplemental Letter and PAD did not have
    baseline and target values2.
· Some of the indicators like "education policy development capacity built within MOE
    and within professional community" and "MOE and Goscomstat cooperates
    effectively" were formulated vaguely.
· The indicators were too many and some of them like "standard education indicators
    improve yearly in the life of the project starting from 2004" was unrealistic given that
    quality improvements take a longer time frame and there were not enough
    interventions for quality improvement built into the project.
· Monitoring indicators include an access indicator "increased enrolment in secondary
    education" though project does not envisage targeted intervention to improve the
    participation rate. Given that the participation rate was already very high before the
    project (92 to 100%) this indicator was not critical.
· The indicator "improving student teacher ratio" is some what vague, as the challenge
    was to arrest its decrease as enrolment decreases, and to increase it if possible. This
    indicator is a poor measure of the success in arresting student teacher ratio decline, as
    it does not relate to the decrease in enrolment.
· The number of regions introducing PCF as a measure of efficient use of public
    resources does give an indication of the effort, but does not capture its impact. The
    percentage of schools closed or restructured, and percentage of teachers reduced
    could have been used as the measure of the impact.
· The outcome related to modernization of education system (structure of network and
    institutions) has been adequately captured through output indicators.
· Due to the delays in implementation of the IVE component, the indicators envisaged
    for measuring improved market relevance of IVE ­ "greater number of students finds
    employment", and "greater number of graduates from improved retraining courses for
    unemployed finds employment" ­ were not measured as agreed during the MTR.



2This was not mandatory at the time of preparation of PAD.



                                               9

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
No safeguards were triggered. The project was classified as environmental category C.

Financial management arrangements were satisfactory throughout the implementation of
the project. Audit reports were received for NTF and the project by their due dates.
Procurement under the project was conducted by the NTF and by local PIUs in the pilot
regions under the close supervision of NTF. The procurement division of the NTF was
staffed with well trained highly qualified and experienced specialists. Procurement has
generally been satisfactory. Prior review as well as several ex-post reviews of
procurement conducted by the Procurement Accredited Staff showed general compliance
with the provisions of the Guidelines, Loan Agreement and other agreed arrangements.
Minor deviations revealed during supervision were duly considered and corrected by the
NTF procurement staff.

Although the project was assessed as a project not triggering socials safeguards, it did
contribute to social development outcomes by improving access for rural students to
better schools. Like wise it did affect livelihood of staff made redundant as a result of
implementation of project supported reforms. Efforts were made to minimize the negative
impact of redundancies by helping to find alternate jobs, and by targeting staff eligible
for a pension. To assess social acceptance of project outcomes, an assessment of the
social impact of the project was made in 2005. The assessment revealed that the
stakeholders have accepted the consequences of the reforms.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
The introduction of PCF and restructuring of school networks are the most significant
and politically sensitive reforms supported by the project. The need to undertake these
reforms was dictated by the population dip, the financial crisis of 1990s, and the need for
improving quality of education in general, and in rural schools in particular. The intention
to implement PCF was first articulated in the Education Law in 1992, much ahead of the
project. The project helped to implement these reforms in 25 out of 88 regions in the
country. Some regions have implemented these reforms on their own. The RF is also
supporting implementation of these reforms through the National Priority Project
Education (NPPE) by making introduction of these reforms a prerequisite for accessing
the grants from the NPPE. The RF plans to expand these reforms to 50 regions by the end
of 2007, and to the rest of the country by the end of 2009. A good capacity for supporting
reforms has been built through preparation of guidelines for implementation of reforms as
well as their impact monitoring, suitably amending the legal framework and building
capacities at the NTF, MOES, participating regions and universities and consulting firms.
Therefore, the sustainability of these reforms seems to be assured.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The project by virtue of being focused on quality of general education and market
relevance of initial vocational education is highly relevant to the current needs of the
country. Improving delivery of public services including education is the third pillar of
the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2006. This pillar closely corresponds to the one
of the pillars of the previous CAS, 2002 ­ strengthening public sector management. The
CPS first pillar underlines the need for qualified labor supply to support the sustained
rapid growth of economy. CPS also mentions that development of effective education
services is lagging behind the economic growth. Further, it states that the public
education system in Russia is in need of modernization and greater orientation toward the
needs of a modern market economy to improve the quality of school education and
students' learning outcomes in Russia. The design approach of relying on PCF and
restructuring of school networks as an instrument for improving efficiency and access to
good quality education, and implementation arrangements relying heavily on regional
PIUs was highly relevant to the current country priorities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)
The four objectives of in order of importance were: (i) promoting the efficient and
equitable use of scarce public resources for education, (ii) modernizing the education
system (structure of network and institutions), (iii) improving quality and standards, and
(iv) improving the flexibility and market relevance of initial vocational education.
Because of the intricate relationship between the first two objectives their achievement
will be assessed together. The tool used for achieving the first objective was allocation of
budget to schools and municipalities based on number of students ­ per capita funding
(PCF). The introduction of PCF is a radical measure with serious political consequences,
as it may lead to redundancies of teachers and closure of schools or their restructuring.
The introduction of PCF to be effective it needs to be backed by strategies for
restructuring of school networks. Serious work on restructuring strategies contributed to
maximizing the gains from PCF.

The combined aims of introduction of PCF and restructuring of schools are to increase
access to quality education and to ensure more effective use of public resources. The tool
for achievement of these aims is to rationalize school networks by closing down small
and poor quality schools that are not viable, and enlarging the larger and good quality
schools. Rationalization of schools leads to closure of schools, and teacher and staff
redundancies. The intermediate indicators of the rationalization are arresting, and if
possible, increasing class occupancy rates and student teacher ratios in the back drop of
falling enrolment. The output and outcome indicators envisaged for the monitoring of
project outcomes have been supplemented by other indicators like class occupancy rate,
number of schools closed, and number of teachers made redundant for the purpose of
evaluation of project objectives.



                                                11

Objective 1: Introduction of PCF. The project was designed to help introducing PCF in
the three pilot regions and replicate it in 7 other regions. Best practice dissemination
grants were provided to other regions ­ known as "grants regions" ­ to implement PCF.
The project succeeded in introduction of PCF in three pilot regions as planned, and in 22
"grant" regions against 7 planned. In all pilot regions, all municipalities and all schools
receive resource allocations according to PCF norms. Legal framework required for
implementation of PCF has been adopted, and guidelines prepared. To maximize the
impact of PCF, substantial actions were taken to enhance autonomy of schools and their
accountability before stakeholders. Independent bank accounts were opened by all
schools in Samara, 61% of schools in Chuvashia against the target of 55%, and 70% of
schools in Voronezh against the target of 70%. The schools without independent bank
accounts, which are small schools, are served by group accounts with sub-accounts for
individual schools controlled by the respective school. School Boards have been
established in 90% of schools in Samara as planned, 84% of the schools in Chuvashia
against the target of 70%, and 100% in Voronezh against the target of 65%. School
directors and administrators have been trained to take up challenges in managing more
autonomous schools. Pilot regions provided valuable experience for implementing PCF
in other regions. For example, personnel from 14 regions planning to implement PCF
underwent training in Chuvashia.

Objective 2: Restructuring of general school networks. PCF reduces funding for small
schools making difficult for them to sustain. Like wise PCF increases resources to
schools delivering good quality education at the costs of schools delivering poor quality
education because of the "money follows student principle" underpinning PCF. Therefore,
restructuring of schools is the consequence of the implementation of PCF. To maximize
the gains from PCF, its implementation needs to be supported by formulation of
strategies for restructuring of school networks appropriate for the target area. Each pilot
region worked out its own strategy for restructuring of school networks taking into
account its specificities. Rationalization of the school network took place within school
clusters. The number of school clusters formed in Samara, Chuvashia and Voronezh were
equal to 70, 178 and 134 respectively. Within each cluster some schools were closed and
some schools were restructured3. In many cases higher levels of school ­ basic and
secondary levels ­ were closed and in some lower levels ­ primary and basic levels.
Subsequently, in all three pilot regions rural schools were reequipped, urban schools
restructured, and rural schools were converted into community centers as planned. The
restructuring led to a large scale movement of students from one school to another. This
process was facilitated by the school bus program. School network restructuring forced
by PCF resulted in the following gains: (a) rural students studying in small schools
offering relatively poor quality education got access to larger schools offering better
quality education; (b) rural schools became able to offer specialization (profiling) at the
secondary level as they grew in size; (c) in spite of the drop in enrolment across regions,



3School restructuring is increasing or decreasing sizes of schools through closure of
some levels, increasing size of some levels by adding sections/classes.



                                             12

they were able to reasonably maintain the classroom occupancy level (average number of
students. The design size is 25), and the student teacher ratio indicating the efficiency
gains; (d) the variation between per capita costs of schools has narrowed or resource
allocation has become more equitable; and (e) increased mobilization of non-budget
resources. For example, in Samara while the total enrolment of schools decreased by 40%
between 1997/98 to 2005/06, the occupancy of classroom decreased only by 7% within
the same period. In Chuvash Republic in spite of the serious decline in school enrolment
(in the range of 15-20%), the classroom occupancy decreased from 20.2 to 19.8 only
between 2002 and 2006, and the student teacher ratio from 11.1 to 11.0. Between 2001
and 2005, number of teachers decreased by 930, and savings were about 50 million
Rubles. The share of non-budget resources in the school budget increased from 10.7% in
2001 to 17% in 2005 as a result of increased autonomy of schools and their enhanced
ability to deliver educational services. In Tver region, one of the grant regions, number of
schools decreased from 1,025 to 831 between 2000/01 to 2006/07.

In spite of the fact that the restructuring of school networks was dictated by the acute
needs, the pace of restructuring of school networks, which began before the project, was
slow due to the lack of adequate know how and institutional back up. The project helped
restructuring of school networks to gather a momentum by making available international
experience, mobilizing in-country expertise, and adopting a holistic approach in
undertaking educational reforms. The fact that President' message to the Duma in 2006
mentioned introduction of PCF as one of the priorities, and that this reform is being
supported by the Priority National Project Education (NPPE) indicates that ERP has been
able to help securing a strong political commitment from the government for this reform.
The results on the ground indicate that the reform has helped to trigger changes in the
education sector that the country was in need of for a long time. Based on the above the
objectives of promoting the efficient and equitable use of scarce public resources for
education and modernizing the education system are rated satisfactory.

Objective 3: Improving quality and standards. Indicators proposed for evaluating the
achievement of the objective were improved standard education indicators, and quality
monitoring and educational statistics guidelines developed, implemented and
disseminated. The standard education indicators monitored by the project were enrolment
in secondary level of education, results in USE, and student per teacher ratio. In terms of
improvement of access to secondary education and improvement of results in Unified
State Examination (USE) the results do not show a clear trend. It is unrealistic to expect
improvement in USE results with the short project period of less than four years
particularly, when the start up delays are considered. It is also not realistic to expect an
increase in participation rate for secondary education considering that the participation
rates were already very high and there were no specific interventions for increasing them.

The project was able to make substantial achievements in the direction of establishing a
quality monitoring system at the regional and federal levels. The project assisted in
establishment of the Center for Monitoring of Human Resources at the federal level. In
Samara, Regional Center for Assessment of Quality of Education was established. In
Chuvashia, a format for annual report containing database for analysis of education



                                             13

system of the region was prepared, and an annual report for 2004 according to this format
was published. The project helped to develop formats for annual public reports on the
status of the education system at the regional, municipal and school levels. These annual
reports have generated high demand. These reports have provided incentives to managers
to address the issues in the education sector, and helped schools to mobilize resources
from stakeholders. Ministry of Education and Science (MOES) has made publication of
annual reports a prerequisite for accessing grants from NPPE by academic institutions.
The format for federal statistical monitoring of education system prepared by the project
has been agreed with MOES, which is now being reviewed by the Federal Bureau of
Statistics.

The project facilitated the participation of RF in PISA, 2003 and TIMMs, 2003, which
helped to compare quality of education in RF with that of other countries. The project
developed a training program and learning materials for the preparation of regional cadre
for quality monitoring. In addition, tools for various monitoring and evaluation studies
such as access to quality general and initial vocational education, assessing consequences
of reforms on teachers, and tracer studies of graduates were developed and tested.
Considering the substantial contribution in setting up a system for quality monitoring,
developing knowledge and human resource base for quality monitoring, and the fact that
expectations on improvement of quality within the project period was not realistic, this
objective is rated satisfactory.

Objective 4: Improving the flexibility and market relevance of initial vocational
education. The indicators envisaged for assessing the achievement of the objective of
were the number of graduates from IVE schools housed in resource centers, and number
of resource centers established. All planned resource centers have been established.
Chuvashia was able to meet the target on the number of graduates, whereas other regions
were not. There was not enough time to assess the effectiveness of resource centers in
terms of employability of graduates as they were fully equipped only towards the end of
the project.

The impact of IVE reforms supported by the project goes beyond the impact of
employability of gradates of resource centers. And it was not realistic to expect any
significant increase in employability of graduates from resource centers within the life of
the project. Therefore, other indicators such as restructuring of IVE schools, sponsorship
of students by industries, and rationalization of IVE programs have been used for
evaluation of this objective. In spite of the fact that resource centers, the major
intervention of the project, were completed only towards the end of the project, the
project was able to make the following major achievements: restructuring of IVE schools;
commissioning of labor market surveys; establishment of new IVE programs; paradigm
shift in training approach from one focused on providing students with a set of
knowledge to one providing them skills for and practice of acquiring the required
knowledge on their own; retraining of teachers; establishment of skill certification
centers; improvement in partnership with employers; and establishment of regional
centers for vocational education. In Chuvashia, restructuring of IVE led to closure of 2
out of a total of 29 schools, discontinuation of 27 out of 69 specializations, and



                                             14

shortening of 7 specializations. Similarly, the share of students sponsored by industries
increased from 43% in 2003 to 70% in 2006, and the share of students employed
according to the agreements with employers has increased, between 2003 and 2006, from
11% to 25%. Based on the fact that the project in spite of the delay in commissioning of
resource centers has been able to make a significant impact on improving flexibility and
market relevance of IVE this objective is rated satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
PAD does not contain analysis of financial or economic rate of return for the project. It
has estimated savings from introduction of PCF and restructuring of school networks for
general education and initial vocational education. It is too early to make an estimate of
savings from introduction of PCF and restructuring of initial vocational school networks,
as these activities are not yet complete. The annual savings from introduction of PCF and
restructuring of general school networks for Chuvash Republic ranges from 0.13% (2001)
to 0.6% (2003) of the total education budget. These savings come mainly from
redundancies. These savings are less than savings of 1.2% estimated in the PAD for
Samara Region. It should also be noted that during implementation maximum efforts had
to be made to minimize redundancies by adjusting the staff to be made redundant in other
jobs within the education system. Therefore, it would be impractical to expect savings of
the level projected in PAD within the project period. But this in no way reduces the
importance of achievements made by the project. The fact that it was possible to make
some teachers redundant and to move others to different jobs is a significant achievement.

The purpose of restructuring of school networks and introduction of PCF is more to
increase efficiency of the use of public resources in the education sector than saving
resources. In practice, savings from these initiatives were put back into the education
system. In this context, the assessment of savings alone will not capture the impact of the
reforms. Therefore, the impact of introduction of PCF and restructuring of school
networks has been assessed in Annex 5 through analyses of proxies such as the reduction
in number of teachers, decrease in number of schools, increase in allocations for teaching
materials, maintenance of student teacher ratio and class occupancy levels. For the
purpose of these analyses, case studies of the impact of introduction of PCF were
conducted in Chuvash Republic and Tver Municipality.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory
The project has met its objective of assisting the MOE to reform the general and initial
vocational education. The importance of this project lies more in helping to initiate
reforms and then set the stage for continuing them than delivering specified outputs. In
this context, the most important achievements of the project are: (a) introduction of per
capita funding; (b) restructuring of general and initial vocational education; (c)
strengthening the monitoring system; (d) building partnership between schools and
stakeholders introducing the concept of social accountability of educational institutions;
(e) creating a significant knowledge base related to the reform themes (altogether 66


                                            15

publications were made), which not only provide a solid basis for sustaining reforms but
also contribute to enriching the international knowledge base; and (f) ability of small
dissemination grants to leverage regional funds to trigger reforms in areas not funded by
the grants. Based on the above the overall outcome is rated satisfactory.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Traditionally in RF students attend neighborhood schools. This tradition disadvantages
students from rural and poor neighborhoods. The implementation of the principle of
"money follows students" through introduction of per capita allocation of resources to
schools has provided students with opportunities to choose schools. This has improved
access of rural students to quality education in larger schools in urban areas or larger
rural settlements. The impact of these reforms also extends beyond the boundaries of RF.
Policy makers from neighboring countries have been frequently visiting Russia to learn
from initiatives supported by the project, especially introduction of per capita funding
and restructuring of school networks.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
The project has significantly helped to build capacity in the Federal MOES, regional
ministries/departments of education, academia and professionals in supporting
educational reforms aimed at improving quality and market relevance of education.
Enhancement of the capacity of NTF, which is a non-governmental organization that will
continue to operate even after the project ends, is especially noteworthy. It is increasingly
being used by the Government for promoting reforms including the implementation of
some components of the Priority National Project Education.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Grants for dissemination of best practices under the Regional component were designed
to encourage non-pilot regions to replicate successful reforms in pilot regions. Such
grants were awarded to non-pilot regions on a competitive basis for replicating one of the
reform areas of the project. Many regions getting these grants also implemented reforms
in areas for which they did not receive grants. For example, Republic of Tatarstan, which
won a contract for implementation of PCF also implemented the reform of restructuring
of school networks. The ability of dissemination grants to leverage reforms in regions in
areas not related to grants was an unintended out come of the project. The project has
been able to publish a large pool of documentation (over 66) consisting of legal
frameworks, procedures and guidelines for implementation of various reforms, impact
assessments, monitoring reports, training materials etc. Such documentation was
produced not only by NTF but also by pilot and grant regions. The project has
contributed to enriching the knowledge base for educational reforms. This is also a
noteworthy unintended impact of the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
Stakeholder workshops were conducted by NTF, during which beneficiary surveys were
conducted. Beneficiaries included teachers, directors of general and initial vocational
schools, and chiefs of general and vocational education departments of municipalities and
regions ­ both pilot and grant. The key finding of the survey was that the consequences
of the reforms were accepted by the society and that the acceptance of reforms is
increasing over time. For example, in Samara Region the proportion of people who
claimed that a village would die if there will be no school in it declined from 42% in
2001 to 7% in 2005. Similarly, the share of people who did not want to see their children
transported to schools by bus was reduced from 38% in 2001 to 4% in 2005. In Chuvash
Republic the share of people who think that schools need to enlarge increased from 28%
in 2003 to 57% in 2006.

Eight stakeholder workshops were held in various parts of the country to assess the
outcomes of the project. The Deputy Minister for Education and Science participated in
one of the workshops. Some of the key achievements of PCF according to the
participants from pilot regions are:
    · Real implementation of "money follows student" principle
    · Optimization of classroom occupancy, school enrolment and student-teacher ratio
    · Possibility of increasing salaries
    · Mobilization of non-budget resources

Some of the key indicators of the changes that have taken place as a result of the
restructuring of the network of general schools in opinion of the workshop participants
were:
    · Growth in number of base schools (a school with good facilities that provides
        support to other schools)
    · Growth in graduates from rural areas completing base schools
    · Better equipped schools ­ equipment and computers

The following were some of the key achievements in the area of monitoring and
educational statistics reported by workshop participants:
    · Introduction of the practice of publication of public reports in regions
    · Development of a system of indicators for inter municipal and inter regional
        comparisons

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to low
The main physical infrastructure that the project helped to build was resource centers for
initial vocational schools. Given that the Russian economy is growing rapidly, and
regions have been increasing funding for the education sector over the last few years
there is no risk they will face difficulties in funding their operation and maintenance.




                                                17

Findings of social assessments4 of impacts of reforms indicate that there is general
acceptance of the consequences of reforms even though it has led to redundancies of
some personnel and closure of some academic institutions, as the harms clearly
outweighs the benefits. Extensive consultations with stakeholders on the reforms, and
genuine efforts of authorities to help out those who lost job have played a critical role in
successfully moving the reform forward. There is little risk not only that the reforms
already underway will be reversed, but also that these will not be expanded through out
the country. The President's message to the Duma in 2006 directing nation wide
implementation of the reforms, the general consensus about the reforms across the
political spectrum, social acceptance of reforms, and development of in-country capacity
to support implementation of the reforms confirm the above risk rating.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory
The project preparation was rigorously supported by analytical work, the PHRD grant
and the PDL. The main strength of the project design and preparation lies in the ability to
accurately identify the reform needs of the country and to prepare well for their
implementation. The decision to make implementation of PCF a precondition for
eligibility for pilot regions was a good strategic choice that significantly contributed to
the success of the project. Quality at entry was also strengthened through assistance to
pilot regions during the preparatory phase.

The ability of the project preparation team to identify a set of mutually reinforcing
reforms also indicates at the good quality of project preparation. For example, PCF and
restructuring of school networks strongly reinforced one another. Had the project focused
on only one of the above reforms, the outcome of the project would have been less
impressive. Similarly, the reform aimed at increasing public participation in education
management helped to mobilize the constituency for reforms. This helped to smoothly
implement difficult reforms like PCF.

Shortcomings, detected in the design and preparation of the project, were the lack of
baselines and end of the project targets for outcome and output indicators, and the vague
nature of some of the indicators. Similarly, the expectation that the project will contribute
to improvement of standard education indicators within the project period was
overoptimistic. In spite of the above shortcomings the robustness of the design allowed
the project to be completed without any major adjustment. Therefore, the Bank

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
The start up stage of the project was very painful owing to serious delays in project
effectiveness. The project team showed remarkable patience and pro-activity in getting
the problems resolved. Between the signing of the project agreement and the
effectiveness of the loan as well as sub-loans, the project team was able to continue
preparatory activities mobilizing PDL and regional resources, without which timely
completion of the project would have been impossible. The project team was able to
maintain a close relationship with the counterpart in spite of the serious restructuring of
the government and a significant change of staff at the federal and regional levels.
Towards the end of the project there was enormous pressure to catch up. It was almost a
miracle that the project was completed in time. To address the deficiencies in outcome
and output indicators contained in the supplemental letter, key performance indicators
were agreed upon between the Government and the Bank in October 2004. The only
shortcoming identified was that the task team was not able to reflect in the ISR key
performance indicators agreed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall performance of the Bank is rated satisfactory. There were only minor
shortcomings related to both quality at entry and supervision. None of these short
comings did materially affect the achievement of the PDOs.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The commitment to reforms is strong at the federal as well as regional levels. The
commitment to and involvement in reforms were especially remarkable at the regional
level. Regions supported reforms allocating resources on top of commitments made for
the project. Policy environment was also supportive to project activities. MOES was very
proactive to resolve the start up delays.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
         Implementing Agency                                          Performance
  1. National Training Foundation       The PIU team, which was appointed in time, had a high degree
                                        of commitment to achieving development objectives and it had
                                        adequate skills for fulfilling this commitment. It was able to
                                        provide the necessary support including mentoring for regional
                                        PIUs. It was able to maintain good relationship with partners
                                        and stakeholders. Adequate capacity and infrastructure is
                                        already in place for continuing project supported activities after
                                        the end of the project.
  2. Regional Project Implementation    The   PIU    teams    demonstrated    strong   commitment       to
  Units                                 development objectives, and operated in close cooperation with
                                        the regional government and stakeholders. The continuation of
                                        project supported activities is assured as regions have fully

                                        internalized them.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. In spite of the startup delays, which
are the main shortcoming in project implementation, the project has been able to achieve
its development objective in a satisfactory manner.


6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)
The project has generated a large knowledge base of high quality and relevance that
could prove to be valuable for promoting similar reforms elsewhere. The project has
made available this knowledge base to wider public through a large number of
publications. The decision to publish project reports and documentation has significantly
contributed to ensuring their quality. Therefore, projects should strive to publish project
related studies and reports.

The four reform initiatives of the project ­ introduction of PCF, restructuring of school
networks, providing autonomy to schools, and establishing school boards for building
social accountability of schools ­ reinforced each other contributing to the transformation
of the education system. Had the project focused on one or two reforms deemed most
important, the results would have been far less dramatic. Therefore, while designing
reform oriented projects it is important to take up a set of complementary reforms rather
than focusing on only most important reforms.

The PIUs skillfully outsourced many activities related to project implementation such as
capacity building, preparation of reform implementation guidelines, assessment of
impacts of reforms, organization of conferences, and preparation of training materials.
This has helped to enhance the quality of products, develop in-country capacity, and
widen the ownership of project activities. This approach contrasts with the PIU centered
implementation prevalent in many projects. The lesson that could be drawn from this
experience is that while designing projects it is critical to carefully analyze project
activities that could be better implemented by outsourcing.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

In the PAD, the fiscal impact of introduction of per capita financing in general education
and general school network restructuring in terms of savings was estimated at 1.2% of the
regional budget per year for Samara Region. The savings from PCF introduction and
restructuring of general education school network in Chuvash Republic8 are presented in
the table below9.

                         Source: Project Completion Report, Chuvash Republic

The savings are smaller than PAD estimates. It should also be noted that during
implementation maximum efforts had to be made to minimize redundancies by adjusting
the staff to be made redundant in other jobs with in the education system. Therefore, it
would be impractical to expect savings of the level projected in the PAD.

Due to the delays in implementation of IVE component it is too early to evaluate the
impact of IVE schools restructuring. Therefore, this annex does not contain an impact
assessment of IVE schools restructuring.11

11According to the information received from MOES, Chuvash Republic the savings due
to restructuring of IVE schools are 3.4% of the IVE budget for 2005, and 7.6% for 2006.
These figures are close to the projected savings of 9% in PAD.



                                                 24

Assessing the impact of the introduction of per capita financing and general school
network restructuring purely based on the savings from these reforms has limitations
because of the following: (a) salaries of teachers increased considerably during the
project period. For example, in Samara Region the salaries were doubled; (b) education
budget substantially increased during the project period. For example, the share of
education sector in the total budget of Chuvash Republic increased from 23.8% in 2000
to 29.4% in 2006. In Tver Region, regional transfers for education increased by 40%
between 2004 and 2007; (c) maximum efforts were made to adjust staff and teachers that
became redundant in other jobs within the education sector; and (d) all savings made
were put back to the sector. Because of the improvement in economic situation the
priority changed from one of savings to more efficient use of resources and quality
improvement.

Due to the political sensitivity of making staff and teachers redundant and closing schools,
it is difficult to expect that school network restructuring would be fully completed within
the project period. Nevertheless what accomplished in terms of closure and restructuring
of schools and redundancies of teachers and staff was remarkable. This led to the
stabilization of student teacher ratio and classroom occupancy rate in spite of the drastic
decrease in enrolment. To illustrate the fiscal impact of the project through proxies such
as student teacher ratios and classroom occupancy rates, case studies of Chuvash
Republic and Tver Region are presented below.

Case Study: Tver Region

The Tver Region is one of the 22 grant regions under the ERP. The implementation of
PCF began in Tver Region in 2005. The impact of introduction of PCF and general
school network restructuring in Tver Region is presented in the table below.

The Tver Region is a typical rural region in which the number of students declined by
14.5% - from 146,057 in 2004 to 124,870 in 2007. The region was able to reduce the
number of schools by 15.8% - from 926 in 2004 to 780 in 2007. Although the reductions
in number of teachers and other staff, which were 10.6% and 4.8% respectively, lagged
behind the reduction in enrolment of 14.6%, the average number of students per class and
the pupil-teacher ratio did not decline appreciably. For example, the number of students
per class declined by 3.4% between 2004 and 2007, and pupil-teacher ratio by 4.2%
between 2004 and 2006.
The total per student expenditures has increased by 21 percent at the 2004 constant prices
from 12,844 Rubles in 2004 to 15,537 Rubles in 2007, mostly owing to the increase of
the federal subvention (transfer). The non-budget resources also sharply increased, even
though the absolute amount was still small compared to the budget funds. A higher
percentage of the subvention budget is now allocated to teaching/learning materials (from
5.0% in 2004 to 11.2% in 2007), which is reflected in the considerable increase in the per
student expenditures on those materials (from 315 Rubles in 2004 to 1,488 Rubles in
2007 at the 2004 constant prices).

Case Study: Chuvash Republic

Chuvash Republic is one of the three pilot regions. The Republic started implementing
PCF from 2001 fulfilling the condition for participating in ERP. The number of schools
decreased by 18%, from 686 in 2001 to 561 in 2006, whereas the number of students
declined by 29%, from 199,334 to 141,161. In total, about 3,500 teachers (21%) left the
system between 2001 and 2006.

In the Cheboksary Town, where the number of students has declined by 8-9% annually
since 2000, and 29,000 students are enrolled in 85 schools today, 11 schools have been
restructured.12 In the Krasnoznameinskiy Municipality, which was one of the three pilot



12While the number of senior secondary students continues declining, that of primary
students started increasing, and it is expected that the total number of students will start
increasing in 2009.

municipalities during the preparation stage for the ERP, the number of schools declined
from 18 in 1999 to 14 in 2007, and the Municipal DOE plans to restructure two more
schools. The number of teachers has decreased by 28%, from 363 in 2001 to 260 in 2006.
In the Cheboksarskiy Municipality, the school network was restructured from 35 schools
(4 primary, 10 basic and 21 secondary) in 2001/02 to 28 schools (1 primary, 7 basic and
20 secondary) in 2006/07. As shown in the figure below, while the number of students
declined by 35% (from 9,095 to 5,893), class teachers were reduced by 17% (from 864 to
713), and other staff including school directors, non-class teachers, administrators and
support staff by 11% (from 542 to 482). This has helped to limit the decline in student
teacher ratio to 21% and average number of student per class to 10%.

triggering closure of schools and reduction of teachers in response to the decline in
school enrolment.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

Towards the end of the project, thematic and concluding stakeholder workshops were
conducted by NTF. During the workshops, surveys of beneficiaries were conducted.
Beneficiaries surveyed included teachers, directors of general and initial vocational
schools, and chiefs of general and vocational education departments of municipalities and
regions ­ both pilot and grant. The results of the survey are presented below.

"How did the introduction of PCF influence the environment for your pedagogic
activities?"
Response                                                      Agree   Disagree No
                                                                               opinion
It did not influence in any way                               16.5% 52.1%      31.4%
Availability of reference materials/ guides increased         48.3% 36.8%      14.9%
Resource cabinets of classrooms and laboratories became 54.9% 30.5%            14.6%
better equipped
Number of teachers sent for upgrading of qualifications       53.3% 23.8%      22.9%
increased
Classroom occupancy rate increased                            22.5% 63.5%      14.0%
Teaching load increased                                       12.7% 72.7%      14.6%

The perception of majority of respondents that classroom occupancy did not increase may
look some what unexpected, as the purpose of PCF is to arrest its decline, and eventually
to increase it. But this response reflects what PCF has achieved so far, which is to get
back classroom occupancy rate to the level before introduction of PCF. The influence of
PCF on this indicator could have been better captured if beneficiaries were asked whether
PCF introduction has helped to arrest the decline in classroom occupancy rate.

Change in perception of civil society about the process of restructuring of school
network in Samara Region
Perception                                                                    2001 2005
Village will die if there will be no school                                   42%   7%
I would not agree to transportation of my children to the school on a bus     38%   4%
The main purpose of school is to help students get admitted to higher         87%   43%
education institutions
Introduction of State Examinations will harm school graduates                 53%   18%

The above changes in perception indicate that beneficiaries have accepted that the project
interventions have been beneficial to them.

In Chuvash Republic the share of people who think that schools need to enlarge increased
from 28% in 2003 to 57% in 2006. This also indicates that people have realized the
benefit of school network restructuring.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

NTF has prepared an extensive ICR of over eighty four pages that includes results from
survey of beneficiaries and stakeholder workshop results. Completion reports have also
been prepared by all three pilot regions. A brief summary of borrower's ICR is presented
below.

Chapter 1, Project Description outlines project goals, the basis for project preparation,
and project components.

Chapter 2, Achievements and Results of the Project starts with the description of
contracts the project executed and the disbursement status. It gives account of guide
books prepared, development of the legal framework and procedures for establishment of
new types of education institutions such as base schools and socio-cultural and
educational complexes, and development of various self learning packages. Further it
provides outcomes and outputs from each of the sub-components of the Federal
Component. Key achievements from introduction of the PCF, under the sub-component
Education Policy are: (a) stabilization of student teacher ratio, and occupancy rates of
schools and classes, in spite of the decrease in enrolment; (b) reduction of difference in
PCF rates between municipalities; (c) increase in financial and management autonomy of
academic institutions; and (d) more intensive optimization of all types of resources in
regions implementing PCF. Survey of social impacts of restructuring of school network
showed that in opinion of the society this is one of the most effective means for achieving
the social goals within the framework of modernization of Russian Education System.
The project helped to develop different modalities of public participation in education
management at the municipal and regional levels. Each of the pilot regions developed its
own system for this purpose. In Voronezh Region government-public administration,
which initially had only consultative role, was developed as a system parallel to the
government office system, and it was of a top down nature. In Samara Region, the
mechanism for public participation was developed top down by forming Public Councils
for Education at municipal, inter-municipal and regional levels, and bottom up by
forming School Councils, and School Board of Trustees. In Chuvash Republic organs of
public participation were Parents' Committees, School Board of Trustees, and School
Governing Councils. Special importance was given to piloting at the school level of four
directions of innovations, which were: a. enhancement of financial autonomy of schools;
b. mobilization of non-budget resources; c. development of new forms of public
participation in school management; and d. new instrument for public accountability ­
public reports.

The key results achieved under the sub-component Quality Monitoring and Educational
Statistics (under Federal Component) were: (a) publication titled "From Collection of
Statistical Data to Supplying Data for Decision Making"; (b) methodology of preparation
and publication of public reports; (c) development and testing of formats for government
statistical observations; (d) development and testing of tools for monitoring and surveys
such as access to education, impact of reforms, and tracer studies; (e) assistance for
participation of RF in PISA, 2003 and TIMMS, 2003; (f) establishment of the Center for



                                             33

Monitoring of Human Resources under the Academy of National Economy; (g)
development of a federal plan for information-analytical support for implementation of
National Priority Project Education; (h) publication of training materials and program for
regional specialist in the area of statistics and monitoring of quality of education; and (i)
establishment of regional centers for monitoring and evaluation of quality of education in
pilot regions.

The major achievements under the sub-component Training and Retraining (under
Federal Component) are: (a) publication of learning materials and modular program for
retraining of educational administrators; (b) large scale training teachers of the Institutes
of Advanced Training        and school teams (administrators-experts) in 7 regions; (c)
development of a new generation of short term training programs for school directors; (d)
beginning of a two-year academic program in Educational Policy; and (e) development
of know-how for implementation and monitoring of projects.

The key achievements under the sub-component Modernization of Initial Vocational
Education (IVE) (under Federal Component) were: (a) development of the legal
framework for operation of IVE in the context of its devolution to regions; (b)
harmonization of regional projects related to IVE reforms; (c) initiation of demand driven
IVE programs in resource centers; (d) development of a new generation of learning
materials and guidelines for upgrading qualification of IVE instructors; and (e)
establishment of Regional Centers for Development of Vocational Education.

The achievements under the regional component were described separately for each of
the pilot regions. The major achievements in Chuvash Republic were: (a) monitoring of
implementation of PCF including evaluation of its social impact; (b) share of schools
with independent bank account increased from 13% in 2003 to 61%; (c) as a result of
financial autonomy of schools the share of non-budget resources in the school budget
increased 3.8 times between 2001 to 2005; (d) the share of schools with organs for public
participation increased 2.3 times between 2003 and 2006; (e) publication of annual
educational statistics for 2004; (f) number of base schools ­ resource centers ­ increased
from 27 in 2003 to 51 in 2005 increasing the access students to quality education; (g) 125
schools were closed between 2001 and 2006, and 227 schools were restructured; (h)
number of students per computer decreased from 91 to 26 between 2002 and 2006; (i)
closure of two IVE schools with low coefficient of utilization; (j) merger of IVE schools
of the same profile as well of IVE and secondary vocational education (SVE) schools of
the same profile; and (k) between 2000 and 2005 percentage of IVE graduates employed
in their area of specialization increased from 53% to 71%.

The key achievements in Samara Region were: (a) PCF introduced in all IVE schools; (b)
public councils have been formed in all educational okrugs (sub-divisions within regions)
to improve public participation in education management; (c) establishment of Regional
Center for Evaluation of Education Quality; (d) study on efficiency of the use of budget
resources; (e) an automated system for information collection, storage and analysis of
statistical information; (f) labor market survey for determining competency requirements
for graduates of IVE; and (g) development of the legal framework for merger of IVE and



                                               34

SVE schools.

The key achievements in Voronezh Region were: (a) development of the legal framework
for transition of schools to independent budget recipients; (b) development of regional
programs for public participation in management of education at the levels of schools,
municipalities and region; (c) establishment of Regional Center for Monitoring and
Educational Statistics; (d) formation of Board of Trustees in all municipalities, and more
than 25% of schools; and (e) completion of the labor market survey to determine the
demand for IVE graduates.

The following were the main unforeseen factors and risks that affected implementation of
the project: (a) due to the implementation of administrative reform in Russian Federation,
and protracted restructuring of the MOE transition of general secondary and initial
vocational education to the new format of statistical monitoring could not be completed
within the project period; (b) serious delays in effectiveness of the sub-loan agreements
created the risk of disruption of the project implementation schedule; (c) devolution of
authority for management of education to regions made implementation federal policies
non-mandatory, and as result the motivation of non-pilot regions to use the results of the
project decreased; and (d) the treasury control of budget execution in the education
system also lowered the motivation of the subjects of RF to use the results of the project.

The following economic and institutional results of project implementation were
highlighted: (a) the use of project approach constitutes a new phase in modernization of
education system. This approach helps to concentrate resources to clearly specified goals
which allow changes to be implemented within the given timeframe; (b) the project
approach helped to leverage regional resources ­ pilot regions contributed US$ 7.01
million for the project and grant regions US$0.47 million. The use of savings from
restructuring of school networks for modernization of the education system was a
significant achievement. Similarly, project was supported by regional targeted programs
like School Bus, and Road to School; and (c) the project approach also helped to replicate
the results of the project in a large scale.

Chapter 3, Project Results Sustainability notes that the following factors will ensure
sustainability of project results: (a) new institutional infrastructure to support
continuation of activities initiated by the project has been established at the federal and
regional levels; (b) 11,700 persons including 5,700 from grants regions have been
trained; (c) the project has not only developed and tested new models, procedures and
instruments for management of education, it has also prepared guidelines for their use in
regions. Thirty two publications have been distributed across RF, and five special
editions of Journal "Education News Letter" have been published; and (d) methodologies
developed by the project like introduction of PCF, restructuring of networks, publication
of public reports and others will be used by National Priority Project Education.

Chapter 4, Lessons learned lists the following as the main lessons learned from the
project:
    · A holistic approach to changes manifested in fusion of innovative activities at the



                                             35

 levels of regions, municipalities and schools at the same time, and simultaneous
 focus on a number of directions such as training of staff, legal framework,
  guidelines, and technical and institutional support has proven itself.
· The project focused on issues that could not be fully addressed within the
  traditional operating framework of the education system. The project helped to
  address these issues playing the role of an initiator.
· The dissemination of results of the project took place not in words but through
  actions ­ dissemination grants. This approach has proven to be effective for
  dissemination of project results.
· Weakness in communication about reforms and methods of their introduction can
  result in resistance of population to reforms even when they do not disagree with
  the content of reforms. Therefore, the ability to build positive image of reforms is
  critical for success of reforms.
· While implementing reforms one has to be careful about the possibilities about
  delivering the same old content under the new sign board. For example, there
  have been tendencies of introducing PCF for allocation of budget to
 municipalities by regions but continuing the same old approach of non-transparent
  and subjective allocation of resources to schools.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


European Training Foundation

The ETF shares the overall evaluation of the project contained in this ICR. In addition,
ETF has the following observations:

"In spite of the initial fears of the Ministry of Education and Science and the pilot
regions, particularly Chuvashia and Voronezh, that the devolvement of financing
responsibilities from the federal to regional level would have serious negative
implications on the regional IVET systems, there was no particular evidence on any
damage. On the contrary the project helped significantly the regions by advising them to
restructure the school networks, diversify the target users and clients of the IVET schools
and attract more attention of the communities towards the reforms of vocational
education and training in the regions. The devolvement of IVET management and
financing responsibilities to the regions in fact increased the operational efficiencies and
proved that the decentralization of VET was a right strategy of the government to
increase the labor market relevance of vocational education and speed up the VET
reforms in the regions."
