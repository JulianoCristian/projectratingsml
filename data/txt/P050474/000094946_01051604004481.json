competitively selected regions of Russia to reform general\n            and initial vocational education in order to improve quality\n            and standards; promote the efficient and equitable use of\n            scarce public resources for education; modernize the\n            education system; and improve the flexibility and\n            market-relevance of initial vocational education. The\n            project has two main components. At the federal level, the\n            project will build capacity to support the education reform\n            strategy of the Russian government through the development\n            of new policies, services, and procedures. The\n            sub-components include: education policy reform, quality\n            monitoring and statistics, training and retraining, and\n            courses for new professions and teaching and learning\n            materials to develop work-related core skills. At the\n            regional level, the project will pilot essential reforms in\n            general and initial vocational education in three regions\n            selected on a transparent basis: Samara Oblast, Yaroslavl\n            Oblast, and the Chuvash Republic. A third component, Project\n            Management, will fund effective project coordination."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
