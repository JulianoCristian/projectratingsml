MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRiCTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE FERTILIZER RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for $221.7 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a Fertilizer
Restructuring Project. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent by the
Government to the five fertilizer companies feor periods of either 10 or 15
years, including respective grace periods of three and five years, at a
variable interest rate reflecting the market rate for domestic terms funds.
The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  During the past two decades, Indonesia has successfully
developed and implemented a policy of promoting food self-sufficiency,
particularly in rice. In parallel, the Government has built a strong domestic
fertilizer industry, assisted by the Bank through loans and credits amounting
to $375.0 million. Large investments in producing and distributing fertilizer
were made through five Government-owned enterprises operating 13 fertilizer
plants, with a combined capacity of E.2 rLillion tpy of fertilizer products,
mainly urea, triple superphosphate (TSP) and ammonium sulfate (AS). Today,
the industry is meeting domestic demand for nitrogenous and phosphatic
fertilizers and is successfully marketing its surplus urea in export markets.
The development of the fertilizer industry, however, has been associated with:
(a) controlled and heavily subsidized fertilizer prices at the farmgate level
(subsidies are forecast at about $320.0 million for 1990), which have promoted
intensive and possibly inefficient use; (b) controlled ex-factory and natural
gas prices differing from economic prices, which have resulted in production
inefficiencies (for TSP and AS) and inappropriately low returns to equity;
(c) regulations on product marketing and distribution, which have constrained
marketing efficiency; and (d) inadequate assessment and monitoring of the
environmental impact of fertilizer production.
3.        The Government is aware of the effects of these factors on its
budget and on the economic efficiency of the fertilizer industry. As part of
its efforts to redress existing problems in the industry it has recently
raised the farmgate AS prices to their economic level and has adjusted upwards
the farmgate prices of urea and TSP. However, the latter prices are still
about 47 percent and 33 percent lower, respectively, than their economic
levels. The Government intends gradually to make the remaining fertilizer
price adjustments at the farmgate within the Repelita V period (1989/90-
1993/94) as indicated in the Policy Statement for the fertilizer sector issued
prior to negotiations. In addition, the Government plans to: (a) replace the
cost-plus formula for setting ex-factory prices of fertilizer by linking the
ex-factory price of urea to its export-parity and the ex-factot-y prices of all
other fertilizers to their import-parities; (b) establish the price of natural
gas to the fertilizer industry between a floor corresponding to the economic
cost of the resource and a ceiling corresponding to its netback value, and
eliminate economically unjustified price differentials among natural gas



- 2 -
users; (c) foster competition in marketing and distribution system among
wholesalers and retailers to improve efficiency and provide better service to
farmers; and (d) study the environmental impact and standards for the industry
and prepare an environmental management plan to be implemented by fertilizer
enterprises and monitored by the Government. These are all expected to be
achieved during the Repelita V period.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Since 1970, the Bank has assisted
Indonesia in developing its fertilizer industry by financing investments for
urea production in PUSRI and two distribution projects. As noted in the
Project Performance Audit Reports, the approach, although project-specific,
has been largely successful. An ongoing Industrial Energy Conservation
Project which supports a program of implementing energy savings in the
fertilizer industry, is also proceeding satisfactorily. Given the
Government's objective to promote food self-sufficiency, past projects focused
mainly on expanding domestic production. The Bank's strategy, based on the
1988 Fertilizer Sector Report, is to assist the Government in: (a) promoting
a more efficient and competitive industry; (b) satisfying domestic needs;
(c) maintaining a reasonable level of exportable surpluses at efficient
prices; (d) assessing the scope for improved efficiency in marketing end
distribution; and (e) minimizing the adverse impact of fertilizer operations
on the environment. The proposed Project conforms with this strategy.
5.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed Project are to:
(a) assist the Government in implementing an agreed Statement of Policy for
the fertilizer sector; (b) support an industry-wide investment program;
(c) identify the scope for improved efficiency in marketing and distribution;
and (d) assess the industry's environmental impact, develop environmental
standards and prepare an environmental management program.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed Project will support measurep to
implement the Government's efficiency-oriented objectives in the fertilizer
industry. It will comprise: (a) construction of a new ammonia/urea facility
at Gresik, with a capacity of 1,350 tpd of ammonia and 1,400 tpd of urea, to
provide low-cost ammonia to existing operations and to supply low-cost urea in
East Java; (b) modernization of Gresik's existing fertilizer plants to improve
their perf3rmance and reliability, and to ameliorate environmental pollution;
(c) optimization investments in four fertilizer plants (Iskandar Muda, Kaltim,
Kujang, and PUSRI) to realize productivity gains, energy savings,
environmental improvements and product diversification; and (d) studies on:
(i) marketing and distribution; and (ii) the overall environmental impacts of
the fertilizer industry, including identification of long-term objectives for
environmental improvement, and an action program for ensuring that the
industry will meet appropriate environmental standards.
7.        The total project cost is estimated at $444.3 million equivalent.
The proposed Bank loan of $221.7 million equivalent would cover 50 percent of
total financing requirements. Retroactive financing for up to $22.2 million
will be provided to the five fertilizer companies for advance procurement of
essential equipment and engineering services incurred after January 15, 1990.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and the disbursements schedule are given in



Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia are in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8333-IND, dated November 26, 1990,
is being distributed separately.
8.        Understandings and Agreements Reached.  The following were agreed
upon during negotiations: (a) the Project will be implemented in accordance
with the principles stated in the Policy Statement; (b) the revised farmgate
fertilizer prices for 1991 adopted by the Government recently, represent a
satisfactory progress in bringing these prices ultimately to their economic
levels; (c) that the Government will, by October 1 of each year, commencing
not later than October 1, 1991, review the farmgate and ex-factory prices of
fertilizers, exchange views with the Bank on the results of the review, and
thereafter, if required revise such prices taking into account the principles
set forth in the Policy Statement; (d) the studies of Fertilizer Distribution
and Marketing, and or the Development of an Environtental Management Program
for the Fertilizer Industry will be prepared by March 1, 1992 and an action
plan for its implementation will be agreed upon; (e) Gresik will, not later
than May 1, 1991, appoint consultants to assist in the implementation of the
ammonia/urea plant, and the modernization subproject; (f) PIM, Kaltim, Kujang
and PUSRI, will appoint consultants to assist them in the implementation of
their respective optimization subprojects; (g) Gresik, for its modernization
subproject, and the other PFEs, for their respective optimization subprojects,
will, not later than June 30, 1992, submit to the Bank for review and approval
a subproject appraisal report and an environmental impact assessment of the
subproject, including an Executive Summary (in English); and (h) Gresik will,
not later than November 30, 1991, develop an Environmental Management Plan to
overcome the main environmental issues identified in the Environmental Impact
Study of the Gresik's complex and not dealt with as part of the implementation
of the new ammonia/urea plant to be built under the Project.
9.        The Subsidiary Loan Agreements between MOF and the five
participating fertilizer companies will be signed prior to Loan effectivenejss.
The conditions of disbursement would be: (a) for the Gresik Restructuring
Component that a contract for the provision of the required natural gas to
Gresik has been executed on behalf of Gresik and PERTAMINA and found
satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) for subprojects under the Optimization
Component and for the Gresik modernization subproject would be that the
appraisal report and the Environmental Impact Assessment for these investments
by each PFE have been found satisfactory to the Bank.
10.       Benefits and Risks.  The main project benefits would be improvements
in the industry's economic performance, reducing Government subsidies and
minimizing the environmental impact of fertilizer production. The investments
to be supported under the Project would present no significant technological
and managerial risks. The timely availabi'ity of natural gas to the Gresik
ammonia/urea plant is a potential risk. To account for this risk, no
disbursements will be made against expenditures for the Gresik component until
a gas supply contract is signed. The main sector-wide risks are that domestic
ex-factory prices may not be increased to border prices as anticipated and
that international fertilizer prices may not be in line with Bank forecasts.
The first risk is minimized by the Government's stated objective in zhe Policy



-4-
Statement to bring the prices to their economic levels through actions taken
during Repelita V. The latter risk is acceptable, since the lndustry has a
relatively low variable cost structure and even at significantly lower prices
it would remain financially viable.
11.       Recomuendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articleo of Agreement of the Bank and recomend that the bxecutive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
