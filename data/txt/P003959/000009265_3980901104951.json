Some lessons learned\n            included: well-defined policy measures including\n            quantitative targets and timetables should have been agreed\n            with the Government in the design stage. Implementation of\n            the fertilizer policy statement should have addressed more\n            fundamental issues such as full sector deregulation,\n            competition development, and privatization. Coordination (or\n            the lack of it), while being a classic issue, continues to\n            be an important ingredient for policy implementation in a\n            multi agency environment. In this context, a strong lead\n            agency should have been agreed upon and appointed early in\n            the design stage. Strong technical capability, as shown by\n            the Participating Fertilizer Company (PFC), is of utmost\n            importance in the implementation of an industry\n            restructuring project that involves adding new production\n            capacities and enhancing plant efficiency and productivity."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
