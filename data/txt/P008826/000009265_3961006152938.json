transition to a\n            market economy in such areas as enterprise restructuring,\n            the financial sector reforms and privatization. The project\n            has three principal objectives: 1) to train practitioners in\n            three core fields of management, financial sector, and\n            public finance; 2) to develop an intermediary institution to\n            mobilize and channel resources for high priority training\n            investments; and 3) to implement pilot projects in other key\n            market areas and establish the basis for a broader\n            second-phase investment. The project will finance programs\n            within the following eligible fields: 1) in management\n            development by training managers in privatized enterprises;\n            strengthening management capacity in terms of policy,\n            standards, resources; and development of professional\n            supporting infrastructure; 2) in the financial sector by\n            training in auditing, auditing and financial management, and\n            banking; in particular, training of accountants and\n            auditors, financial managers and bankers; 3) in public\n            finance, by training of senior public finance officials in\n            revenue collection and budget processes; and 4) a phase two\n            pilot project which will include the development and\n            implementation of subprojects of limited scale in other\n            important areas such as small business, public\n            administration, and market economics for the general public."}, "docdt": "1994-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
