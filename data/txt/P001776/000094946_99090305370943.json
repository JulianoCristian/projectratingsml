"Overall, the outcome of the project is\n            satisfactory, since it contributed dramatically to the\n            economic and political transition of the country. The\n            improvement of the educational system ensured an annual\n            enrollment expansion of over ten percent. However, the\n            performance of the Bank gave mixed results, for, although\n            project identification was satisfactory, preparation and\n            appraisal were considered marginally satisfactory, since\n            political and economic transition circumstances, hindered\n            the seemingly ambitious project. Nevertheless, the\n            performance of the Borrower was rated satisfactory, with\n            gradual improvements in preparation, implementation, and\n            compliance with covenants. The lessons learned suggest that\n            the positive impact on learning outcomes, stems from the\n            implementation of activities, in line with the responsible\n            directorates, who are accountable for budget and program\n            management. The Bank's responsiveness, and flexibility\n            in project design became extremely critical during\n            implementation, when rapid political and economic changes\n            occurred. Hence, easier administrative/procedural\n            requirements would be beneficial under changing\n            circumstances. Extreme caution should be given for complex\n            project design, particularly under weak institutional\n            capacity, or political unrest, which may constrain\n            partnerships, and cross-conditionalities, and, make it\n            difficult for the Bank to manage, when not a party to the agreement."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
