effective learning such as local\n            language instruction, student achievement testing, support\n            for flooding classrooms with reading materials, testing\n            extramural programs, and student health interventions; (b)\n            the quality and efficiency of the University Eduardo\n            Mondlane, especially in enhancing the university's\n            capacity for strategic management and long-range planning,\n            and strengthening the teaching of physical sciences,\n            engineering and economics; (c) the management of the\n            education sector, particularly the Ministry of\n            Education's ability to address financial monitoring and\n            control.
