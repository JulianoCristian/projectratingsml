MOZAMBIgQUE
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDI? AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           The People's Republic of Mozambique
Beneficiariest      Ministry of Education and University Eduardo Mondlane
Amountt             SDR 38.7 million (US. 53.7 million)
Termss              Standard, with 40 years maturity
Proiect Objectivess
The proposed Credit has three main objectivess
(a) to improve the quality and efficiency of primary education;
(b) to improve the quality and efficiency of the university;
(c) to strengthen the management of the education sector.
Project Descriptions
Tn line with these objectives, the project will support
improvements ins (1) the quality and efficiency of primary
education through financing of pre-service and in-service
training of teachers; providing them with pedagogical support;
introduction of distance education as a future means of teacher
training; rehabilitation and expansion of schools in Maputo,
Dondo, Beira and Macala; and introduction of five new
initiatives to enhance effective learning such as local language
instruction, student achievement testing, support for flooding
classrooms with reading materials, testing extramural programs,
and student health interventions; (2) the quality and efficiency
of the University, especially in enhancing the University's
capacity for strategic management and long-range planning, and
strengthening the teaching of physical sciences, engineering and
economics; (3) the management of the education sector,
particularly MINED's ability to address financial monitoring and
control. Another essential area which would be strengthened
under the project is school construction and maintenance
capacity.
Benefits and Riskes
Benefits: The project will contribute significantly to
furthering the goals of the Government's ESRP in regard to
educational development as part of broader efforts to increase
productivity, raise the quality of life, and reduce poverty.
The project would strengthen the Government's implementation
capacity to carry out its strategy in both strategic and
management areas. The project would also assist in further



- ii -
developing the intellectual underpinning of the strategy by
generation of data, staff training and development of long term
plans in the vocational/technical education and higher education
subsectors, and annual consultations on both budget and
implementation.
At the primary level, children in four cities would benefit from
additional availability of classrooms and additional hours of
instruction. In Beira, Dondo and Nacala, the project would
provide between 6L and 702 of the total number of classrooms
required for secondary and primary education by 1993. In
Maputo, the project will provide 33Z of all classrooms needed by
1993. Children in selected heavily populated areas (covering at
least 262 of the school population) would benefit from improved
pedgogical support, better trained teachers, increased funding
for school maintenance and longer hours of instruction. Support
for improvements at the University Eduardo Mondlane's Faculties
of Engineering, Economics, and the three Science Faculties will
generate graduates who can strengthen the country's productive
sectors.
Risks.   The main risks are three.  First, the continuing
hostilities might disrupt project execution or damage project
assets. To minimize this risk, the project will focus on the
secure areas, which include most urban and semi-urban centers,
which are of strategic importance for the economic development
of the country as they represent the port areas for the
transportation corridors and some of the forty rural priority
districts. Second, the limited capacity of the implementing
institutions might pose difficulties. To mitigate this
possibility, the project includes measures to strengthen
implementation capacity. Third, the substantial coordination
required among the many Government and donor agencies involved
may be difficult to sustain. To address this issue, a thorough
consultation process has been undertaken during project
preparation, involving a series of workshops and seminars, and a
donor conference, and plans have been made to continue this
process during project implementation. In light of these design
features, risks would be minimized and the proposed project
would constitute a suitable basis for investment in the
improvement of the educational sector in Mozambique.

SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
STAP? APPRAISAL REPOIT
W. INTRODUCTION
1.01.     The project would assist the Government in refocusing its
efforts in the education sector to meet the needs of the 1990's with
restricted budgetary resources. Activities supported by the project would
help the government launch its ten year development plan for the education
sector. The objectives of the plan ares to improve quality and efficiency
in education; to improve access and equity; resolve financing, expenditure
and cost issues in accordance with the fiscal realities that the country
faces; upgrade the capabilities of the education secto. to solve problems
and cope with change (by strengthening management, planning, and financial
monitoring); and to contribute effectively to human resource development at
the University level.
1.02      The strategy, objectives and content of the project have been
developed through extensive consultations and analysis within the
Government and in discussions with IDA, and have taken into account the
following:
(a) Considering the economic situation and prospects and the
policies that the government is pursuing (including the
ongoing Economic and Social Rehabilitation Program), an
appropriate environment exists for support to a long term
development program of the education sector (Chapter I);
(b) The problems and needs of the sector are severe, broad
ranging and urgent. The coverage and quality of education
have deteriorated significantly in the 19808, seriously
undermining the impressive accomplishments of earlier
years. Rectifying the deficiencies of the sector will be a
massive undertaking, equiring more than a decade to
complete and entailitg comprehensive rehabilitation and
substantial investments in quality and efficiency (Chapter
II);
(c) Considering the Government's education otjectives and
policies, its recognition of what needs to be done, and its
commitment to taking the necessary steps, financially and
otherwise, to secure substantial and sustainable progress,
conditions are favorable for proceeding with further action
without delay (Chapter III);
(d) Within the context of the broader, long term development
plan,the main aims of the proposed project would be tc: (i)
increase the quality of primary education so that the
limited amount of funds which the Government has available
for education can be stretched further; (ii) improve the



- 2 -
quality and efficiency of the University, especially in
overall strategic management development and in the
physical sciences, as well as continue actions in the
fields of cngineering and economics; and, (Wii) improve the
management of the education sector, particularly focussing
on strengthening the Hinistry of Education's ability to
undertake financial monitoring and control, and school
maintenance capacity (Chapter IV);
(e. The costs of the project have been carefully evaluated and
IDA financing is limited to high priority areas for which
other cofinanciers could not be found. The project design
has taken into account the limited project implementation
capacity (Chapter V);
(f) The benefits of the project would be considerable. The
risks, although not insignificant, would be minimized by
provisions included in the design of the project (Chapter
VI);
(g)  The agreements reached between Government and IDA are
consistent with the dual need of facilitating the progress
of the Government's ten year plan and assuring effective
utilization of the IDA credit and successful completion of
the project (Chapter VII).
1.03      The rest of this Introduction presents further background on the
economic policy environment and the Government objectives for the education
sector, setting the stage for the discussion of sectoral issues and the
Government's education strategy in subsequent chapters.
A. The Context: Economic Conditions and Government Policies
1.04      At the time of independence in 1975, Mozambique's economy was
greatly dependent on South Africa and Rhodesia as receipts from the
provision of transportation services and from the remittances of Mozambican
workers employed in South Africa helped offset a persistent and chronic
deficit on external trade. Therefore, Mozambique was highly vulnerable to
a series of exogenous shocks from which the economy suffered in the post-
independence period. In addition to climatic problems and shifting terms
of trade that have affected many other countries in Africa, Mozambique was
seriously affected by the exodus of 90 percent of the Portuguese settlers
which began just before independence and continued into the post-
independence period, and by the increasing instability and turmoil in the
Southern Africa region. The resulting insecurity caused serious
disruptions in production, marketing and transportation, and destructions
of essential social and economic infrastructure which were reflected in
slow economic growth.
1.05      Inappropriate government policies also contributed to poor
economic performance. Rigidities in the pricing and marketing system, a



concentration of resources on the state sector, increasing government
involvement in external trade, administrative allocation of foreign
exchange while maintaining the exchange rate at a level which severely
undervalued foreign resources, and the extreme scarcity of skilled manpower
led to much inefficiency in the use of resources.
1.06      The combination of severe exogenous shocks and inappropriate
domestic policies was disastrous for the Mozambican economy. After an
initial deterioration immediately after Independence, the economy recovered
a little between 1977 and 1981 but then deteriorated again and, by 1985,
real GDP had fallen to around two-thirds of the 1973 level, and to around
50 percent in per capita terms.
1.07      The Economic Rehabilitation Program, 1987-89  Prompted by the
serious deterioration of the economy, the Government launched a
comprehensive Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP) in January 1987
intended to deal with the structural problems and widespread distortions in
the economy. The global objectives of the ERP were to reverse the decline
in production, reduce substantially domestic financial imbalances, enhance
effVciency and establish the conditions for a return to higher levels of
econ.mic growth.
1.08      Economic recovery was the first priority of the ERP.  To achieve
this objective, the ERP focused on restoring financial incentives at the
producer level, and diminishing the degree of administrative control over
economic activity and creating a more market-based economy. The second key
objective of the ERP was to reduce domestic and external imbalances. This
was a long-term objective in many respects, given the nature of the
existing imbalances and the already low level of per capita income which
effectively precluded drastic cuts in aggregate consumption aimed at
reducing imbalances. Nevertheless, substantial fiscal adjustment was
achieved. The revenue base was strengthened through tax reforms and
improvements in tax administration with the result that budgetary revenues
rose from 13.3 percent of GDP in 1987 to 23.8 percent in 1989. Recurrent
expenditure was contained and steps were initiated to improve the financial
discipline of the public enterprises. Externally, the desired reduction in
imbalances was constrained by the key role of imported consumer and capital
goods in the ERP strategy. Increasing the supply of both commodities was
viewed as crucial for restoring the capital infrastructure and providing
the incentive go-4s that were the necessary complements to the reform of
financial incentives.
1.09      The implementation of the ERP had a significant impact on the
economy in 1987-89, despite the continuing dislocations in the countryside.
The 1982-85 decline in GDP was reversed, with GDP increasing by 4.4 percent
p.a. on average from 1987 to 1989. This positive growth rate reflected a
substantial rise in the agricultural production of the family and private
commercial sectors resulting from the improved pricing incentives and the
increased flow of consumer goods, and a recovery in light industrial
activity as a result of increased imports of inputs and spare parts.
Increased aid flows, meanwhile, made possible a rise in per capita
consumption and the maintenance of investment levels. As a result of the
exchange rate adjustments, together with the freeing of many product prices



- 4 -
and the adjustment of fixed prices, consumer prices increased sharply in
1987 by 163 percent, but the rate of inflation decelerated considerably to
55 percent in 1988 and 42 percent in 1989.

suffer from shortage of managerial and technical skills; public finances
continue to be largely dependent on external aid, and affected by the
growing burden of external debt servicing; the rate of inflation remains
high; and shortages of freely available foreign exchange, in conjunction
with growing demand for imports, are leading to continuous pressures on the
exchange rate. Both in recognition of the progress already achieved and in
the light of continuing problems and constraints, the Government remains
firmly ccmmnitted to the ongoing process of reform, the next phase of which
is elaborated below.
1.11      The Economic and Social Rehabilitation Program, 1990-92  The
adjustment program over the next three years continues to aim at reducing
domestic and external financial imbalances and establishing the basis for
sustained growth, with priority given to broad-based rural development and
increased focus on poverty alleviation. Recognizing the importance of
poverty alleviation as one of the central concerns of the ERP, the
Govensraent has indicated that the program would be renamed che Economic and
Social Rehabilitation Program (ESRP). In addressing the specific poverty
concerns of the two-thirds of the population which are estimated to live in
absolute poverty, the Government has identified three priorities:
(i) creating employment opportunities for the poorest; (ii) providing a
nsafety net' of direct and indirect income transfers for those poor
households which remain beyond the scope of strategies designed to
stimulate growth; and (iii) establishing a comprehensive and prioritized
expenditure program which would integrate all poverty reduction programs.
To provide a broader framework for all of these ongoing and proposed
actions, a Poverty Alleviation Strategy Paper has been prepared.
1.12      Within this comprehensive and prioritized expenditure program
the government considers five sectors as its priorities. The education
sector is one of the five, because it is considered one of the best long
term investments to reduce structural poverty in the future and to assist
in economic development.
B. The Education Sector in Government's Overall Strategy
1.13      Education has long been a high priority in Mozambican policies
and development strategy. During the independence struggle, provision of
education to all was a promise, which, after Independence, became a
preeminent goal. The Constitution incorporated the right to education and
an ethos was established by which all educated people had to instruct
others less fortunate. Education was nationalized in 1975 and all existing



- 5 -
curricula and books were suspended. With the enthusiastic contribution of
many volunteere, new curricula were developed through community
participation. Self-direction of the educational process at the grassroots
was the norm. Enrollments grew at phenomenal rates in these first post-
independence years in primary, secondary and adult education courses. Such
rapid enrollment growth also spawned undesirable effectss the quality of
primary education eroded due to the rapid expansion and heterogenous level
and content of education offered; access to higher levels of primary
education and secondary education was severely restricted to those
fortunate enough to be able to enter into boarding arrangements inl urban
areas; and the competence of the candidates for post-secondary education
declined significantly due to a lack of qualified teachers at secondary
levels.
1.14      From L978 on, the organization of the education system began to
be more planned and controlled. In 1980, in coordination with all other
sectors, an Indicative Prospective Plan for 1980-1990 was developed. This
Plan emphasized the relevance of developing a national education policy to
meet the needs of political, economical and social development. In
response, the planning of the National Education System (SNE) started, and
its introduction began in 1983. To date, the progressive introduction of
the SNE, grade by grade, is on schedule. The SNE is based on: (a) unified
curriculum objectives with appropriate methods and contents to obtain a
cohesiveness between all levels; (b) correspondence between the education
sector content and objectives and the social and economic needs, with
continual built-in evaluation; and, (c) an integrated system which will
offer the opportunity to individuals to always continue their studies. In
1989, a series of evaluations were carried out to assess the impact of the
complete primary cycle of the new system.
1.15      Due to the continued hostilities, enrollments at the primary
levels have declined since 1981. Simultaneously, education sector budgets
also began to erode. A thorough evaluation of the sector's problems was
carried out and presented to the Ministers' Council in 1988 and eight
priority programs were established. Since that time a series of planning
exercises and discussions of the educational issues and priorities have
taken place. In 1989, a document defining educational policies was adopted
by the Fifth Party Congress. This Congress recognized the importance of
improving educational quality and the financial and practical constrairts
which would make it impossible to aim at universal primary education by the
year 2000.
1.16      In 1989 and 1990, the Government moved to renew and strengthen
its efforts to address the needs of the social sectors, including education
explicitly. Budgets rose in real terms, and options for reversing the
erosion of the level of public spending on social services were examined in
the context of preparing the Government budget. Government has now
committed itself to maintaining minimum levels of investment and recurrent
expenditures for the education sector in real terms and in budgetary
allocations and to restoring the 1981 levels of educational services as
quickly as possible. However, it also realizes public investment alone
would be insufficient to reach 1981 levels on a national scale within the



- 6 -
next decade. Hence, the Fifth Party Congress opened the door to the
possibility of the private sector, perhaps through NGOs, providing
educational services as well.
1.17      With the renewed emphasis on social issues, poverty alleviation
and restoration of social services, the Government commitment to education
is strong as it plans for the 1990s. The objectives reflect the issues now
considered crucial - primary education, quality improvement, manpower
development. In addition, other themes are stressed: physical
rehabilitation before expansion as well as maintenance, efficiency
improvement, management strengthening, financial monitoring. They are
based on the deficiencies of the existing system and a clear recognition of
the urgency to address them.
1.18      In general, the objectives of the Government's Ten Year
Education Development Plan are consistent with the Bank Group analysis of
the state of Mozambican education and the priority needs to be addressed in
the sector. They are also consistent with the findings of a public
expenditure review whiLh was jointly carried out by the Government and the
Bank in 1988, further deepened in the forthcoming Economic Memorandum in
1990. Huch is also in line with the themes in the Bank policy studies:
Education in Sub-Saharan Africa, Policies for Adjustment, Revitalization
and Expansion (World Bank, 1988) and Improving Primary Education in
Developing Countries (World Bank, forthcoming, 1990).

IT. TEE EDUCATION SECTOR
2.01     This chapter presents the principal issues confronting Mozambique
in the education sector. The most important priorities are underscored,
based on the conclusions from the discussions, analyses, and studies
undertaken or used during an extensive review done as part of the
preparation of the proposed project (see Annex 1 for a list of documents).
2.02     The main themes that emerge are, in brief preview, the following.
The resources available for education will remain highly constrained
through the 1990s. The sector must stress improving the quality of
schooling at the primary and secondary levels, by the most cost-effective
means possible, and should not now be aiming for further rapid expansion.
Efficiency must be improved at every level, so that the limited resources
available are used as effectively as possible. Progress in higher
education is critical to help address the drastic shortage of skilled
professionals in the country. Strengthening of management, planning, and
organization in the sector, especially in the Ministry of Education, is
also vital.
2.03     The chapter begins with a brief overview of the basic
characteristics of the sector, followed by sections on the principal
issues. Subsequent sections cover the role of external assistance and the
World Bank group's experience.
A. Basic Characteristics
2.04     Current Situation and Indicators.  Although the progress made
since Independence is impressive, serious problems remain in the coverage
and quality of education. Primary school enrollment is still only about 62
percent (1987 data), compared with 66 percent for the region. At the
secondary level, enrollment is only 7 percent of the corresponding age
group, compared with 46 percent in Zimbabwe and an average of 16 percent
for all of Sub-Saharan Africa. Of all children of the same age cohort, 38
percent will not have access to schooling and 42 percent will leave primary
education before the fourth grade, not having achieved functional
proficiency in reading or writing. Less than 20 percent of the cohort will
complete primary schooling or will go on to secondary school. The system
continues to be very wide at the bottom, with about 500,000 children in
first grade, and narrow at the top, with only 1,000 students in the 10th
grade and about 500 entering university each year. This means that less
than 1 in 500 students entering the system will have the chance to finish a
secondary education.
2.05     Earlier expansion in the system occurred at the expense of quality
and efficiency. Learning is hindered, in particular, by large class size
(60 students per classroom on average in urban areas), the short nuimer of
classroom hours due to a triple-shift system in urban areas, the use of
Portuguese as the only language of instruction (about 1 percent of
Mozambican children learn Portuguese in the home (see map 1)), and poor
nutrition and health of the students. Over 60 percent of the population is



- 8 -
still illiterate, 22 percent have less than 2 years of schooling, 6 percent
have 4 years of schooling, and those with secondary level education
constitute less than 2 percent. Moreover, at the primary level enrolment
has decreased every year since 1981 (Annex 2). This is primarily due to
security problems but also to the increasing burden that school fees and
charges represent for families.
2.06     Institutions.  The Minister of Education is responsible for the
three subsectors in the education sector. The Ministry of Education
(MINED), through a system of National Directorates, manages the subsector
of the general education system, which covers: primary and secondary
education; teacher training for the primary level; and, adult education at
the primary and secondary levels. The two other subsectors are: (a)
vocational and technical training which is under the tenure of the State
Secretariat (SETEP) and includes training at three levels; and (b) higher
education which is delivered by the Eduardo Mondlane University and the
Higher Pedagogical Institute responsible, respectively, for preparatory and
university courses and teacher training for secondary schools. Also under
MINED is the National Institute for the Development of Education (INDE),
which is responsible for developing curriculums and textbooks. (Annex 3
depicts the organizational structure of the education sector as it is still
at present; reorganizations are eminent though). The Ministry of Finance
organizes a course for high-level public managers, and the Ministry of
Agriculture is in charge of rural extension services.

2.07     Structure of the Education System.  In March, 1983, the Government
issued a comprehensive education law that established a new National
Education System (SNE). With this reform, the primary and secondary
education system is divided as followss grades 1-5 are lower primary (EPI);
grades 6-7 are upper primary (EP2); grades 8-10 are secondary (ESG) and
grades 11-12 are university preparatory (EPU). The reform extended the
primary cycle from four to seven years and reduced the secondary cycle by
twQ years. Thus, under the new system the combined primary and secondary
cycle has been increased from 11 to 12 years. Technical and vocationa.
training were unaffected by this reform, though, in 1987 the Minister of
Education announced intentions to subsequently review this system. The
University continues to offer a five-year program, though it has



experimented with three year degrees, depending on the discipline and
degree sought.
2.08-    At the moment all education offered is under the purview of the
public sector, as private and church schooling has not been allowed since
the education system was nationalized following Independence. However, in
one of several major changes announced in the Fifth Party Congress in 1989,
the Party decided to permit community education, which means that Non-
Government Organizations (NGOs),church groups and com=unities are now able
to set up and direct their own schools. No regulations exist yet for this
participation of the private sector.
B. Priority Issues
Issues Concerning Resource Constraints. FinanciaR Sources, and Exnenditure
Allocation
2.09     Resource Constraints.  The resources available to the education
sector are extremely limited, given that the average annual income per
capita in Mozambique is only estimated to be US$100 in 1989, one of the
lowest in the world. Government spending, which accounts for most of the
domestic funding of the sector (since community and individual
contributions are minimal and private education is nonexistent), is barely
adequate to meet even the most urgent requirements. In 1988, Government
direct recurrent expenditures on primary and secondary education amounted
to about US$20 per student and donor aid added another US$18 per student,
compared to per student expenditures in 1983 of about US$200 (in constant
1983 dollars) for all low-income economies combined, US$200 for Malawi,
US$853 for Tanzania 1/. Continued population growth (2.7 percent per
year) will put still more pressure on the budget; considerable incremental
resources will be necessary just to maintain current enrollment and quality
levels, let alone to regain earlier enrollment levels, achieve much-needed
improvements and satisfy some of the large unmet demand for education.
2.10     Relative to the level of GDP and total Government spending,
education's share is currently on the low side compared to many other
countries but is not among the lowest. The education budget allocation is
5 percent of projected GDP in 1990 -- about the same as Kenya and Zambia
and only slightly below Zimbabwe (7 percent) and Botswana (8 percent).
Actual outlays for education were nearly 9 percent of total Government
outlays in 1989, and would rise to almost 12 percent in 1990 under the
approved budget estimates. This is below the figures for most African
countries (the median was 18.5 percent in 1980 and 15.3 percent in 1983)
and some neighboring nations (Zimbabwe at 20 percent), but not far from
where other neighbors are (Malawi, 11 percent, Tanzania and Zambia at 8
percent).
1I This is a somewhat misleading comparison, as expenses for boarding at the
secondary level make up the lion's share of the per student expenditures and
contribute heavily to the figures 4uoted for other countries, while
Mozambique's enrollment in secondary education is much lower than that of
other countries.

2.11     Prior to 1989, education spending was for many years much lower
than it is now, and rapidly declining in real terms. After falling by
about 15 percent per year on average between 1982 and 1987, the period of
the most marked decline, the education budget reached a nadir in
1987 21.  At that point, education spending was only 47 percent of what
it had been in 1980, in real terms, and only 2.3 percent of GDP.
Education's share of total Government expenditure was only 4.3 percent.
Both the recurrent and the investment portions of the education budget
suffered --and with similar rates of decrease.
2.12     The massive contraction in education spending in the 19809 was the
result of several contributing factors, and has major implications for the
1990s. The most important contributing factor was the overall
deterioration of the economy -- and as a consequence, the decline of all
Government speading (in real terms) -- in the mid-80s, due to the ongoing
hostilities and the failure of the then prevailing economic policies. In
addition, as the total budget was squeezed more and more in this period,
education bore a more than proportionate share of the cutbacks. Regarding
the implications of the decline for the 1990s, the long period of drastic
underfunding of essential requirements, both recurrent and investment, has
left the sector with vast needs for rehabilitation and catching up on
deferred development.
2.13     Beginning in 1987 and 1988, the downward trend was sharply
reversed as Government greatly increased its budget allocation for
education. The reversal was possible because, with the launching of a new
Economic Rehabilitation Program in 1987 widely supported by the
international donor community, the country began to receive substantially
higher aid inflows, both for the recovery program itself and for the
emergency program to mitigate the dislocations caused by the hostilities
and drought. With additional funds at its disposal, Government was able,
by the time the 1990 budget was prepared, to raise education's allocation
well above the levels of the 1980s -- in real terms and as percentages of
total public spending and GDP.
2.14     The recent increases are partially deceiving, however, in that
their contribution to improving education is more limited than their
magnitude suggests. First, much of the incremental spending has been for
salary adjustments. 'hile higher teacher salaries are critically needed,
attainment of significant, lasting progress will require advances as well
in crucial non-salary inputs -- textbooks, training for teachers, curricula
reform, etc. Second, some of the new funds are paid right back to the
treasury in the form of taxes and duties which the education sector was
previously exempt from, but now must pay along with other sectors, under a
new Government policy. These assessments can amount to 30 percent of the
total costs of capital investments. Third, some of the increase is for
large new externally-assisted projects, including the first IDA and AFDB
credits. While these activities are explicitly intended to contribute to
improving education, they do not lessen the need for Government also to
21 See Annex 4 for budgetary expenditures by year, and graphs depicting the
trends.



- 11 -
expand its ovn efforts, especially on matters not covered by external
support.
2.15     Thus, although the budget situation has eased slightly, the
combined effect of a long period of extreme underfunding in the 1980s, and
continued budgetary austerity currently, have resulted in making resource
constraints the dominant issue that must be confronted in all endeavors in
the education sector. Only if the full extent and seriousness of the
resource limitations are adequately taken into account by all parties
involved will new actions be successful.
2.16     In the 19909, this constraint will remain every bit as preeminent
as at present -- given the prospects for the various financing sources
available to the sector, as discussed next.
2.17     Financing Sources.  The education system obtains its financial
resources from four main sources: Government spending of domestic
resources, through budget allocations and other special outlays; external
assistance, through projects and program aid; students' families, through
cost recovery (e.g., fees for books or boarding) and payment of private
costs (e.g., family outlays for materials not provided by the schools); and
community participation (local construction of school buildings) and
private sector involvement (NGOs or church groups -- which play a limited
role currently).
2.18     The first source -- Government spending -- is unlikely to increase
by large amounts in the 19909, and as noted above, is already highly
constrained. At most, public expenditure on education might rise at the
same (probably modest) rate as overall Government spending, or slightly
more if and when resources are shifted from other sectors to education.
The large upward adjustments of 1988 through 1990, however, will not be
replicable in the years ahead, given Government's need to maintain economic
policies requiring fiscal austerity and to address priorities in other
sectors.
2.19     The second source -- external assistance --  is very substantial,
reaching an estimated T3S$ 21.4 million in 1989 (Annex 5). There are
indications that this aid may be extended to higher levels in the near
future, especially with the switch in SIDA's aid from the industrial sector
to the education sector, which will double SIDA's support (to Kroner 80
million for 1993). In addition, some donors might consider financing
education expenditures through their counterpart fund support instead of
other activities and thus increase the resources available to the education
sector. However, total aid is not growing as fast as Mozambique's needs
and support to the education sector may come under pressure to decline as
some donors diminish their support for the emergency program or increase
their allocations to other areas. Therefore, for planning purposes, it is
necessary to assume no major increase to the education investment budget,
and possibly some new support to the recurrent budget, or to private costs
of education.
2.20     The third source -- students' families -- account for only a very
nominal fraction of the total resources of the sector currently, and will
be unable to increase much in the 1990s, given the heavy burden that most



- 12 -
families are already bearing, with extremely low incomes and high expenses.
Presently, cost recovery from students and their families through fees and
other income collected by Government covers, in theory, about 6 percent of
recurrent expenditures in education. 3I Family outlays for school
supplies and school fees, paid in fiscal stamps, have quadrupled between
1986 and 1988. Since family incomes have not risen at the same pace as
costs, the burden is heavier every year. Annex 6 shows the 1989 private
costs of education in books, materials, school fees, and boarding costs.
The cost of books is a large part of the burden, though in 1989 a counter
value tax on paper representing 45 percent of the cost of most textbooks at
EP1 and EP2 was eliminated, which resulted in the price of books remaining
constant for the last four years. Heavy price increases are predicted for
tuition at the secondary level and for boarding fees for 1991 on, further
aggravating the unequal access to education. Moreover, in addition to
expenses for schooling, families have had to absorb large increases in fees
for other services as well, and extraordinarily high upward adjustments in
food prices in recent years.
2.21     Thus, the contributions that students and their families make to
covering the costs of education should be assumed to remain limited at this
juncture. Attempts to force still more cost recovery would most probably
backfire, resulting in strong opposition and/or lower enrollments (and
hence denying access to education for children in urgent need of basic
literacy and numeracy skills). Indeed, some reduction in cost recovery may
need to be seriously considered as a transitional measure until incomes
improve. To that end, Government is currently exploring options for
lowering the private costs of textbooks, since sales have been declining
and less and less students are able to afford textbooks (see Annex 7 for a
description of the textbook situation and policies). In addition, measures
to alleviate other private costs of education for poor families will also
be reviewed.
2.22     The fourth source -- community participation and private sector
involvement -- is also very tiny, relative to the total resources of the
sector. Community participation includes contributions of time, labor, and
modest sums of money to local improvement efforts. Most of the primary
school network is composed of small schools built by the community itself.
Some of the lower secondary school installations have also been constructed
by communities. All of this has been done on a community-to-community
level, without the financial support or organizational skills of NGOs or
church groups to help. Private sector activ3ty is just starting. Now that
the Fifth Party Congress has approved the participation of the church and
the productive sector in education, these groups may represent the best
opportunity for communities to redress the situation of falling
expenditures in education.
3/ The costs of collecting revenues in the education sector have not been
included in this estimation. However, collection costs are probably fairly
low since boarding fees stay with the institution where they are gathered and
textbook fees are paid to the government by means of a transfer from a
parastatal.



- 13 -
2.23     Overall, considering all four sources together, there is little
prospect that the total financial resources available to the sector will
increase sufficiently to cover the needs in the next few years. For all
practical purposes, therefore, the sector will have to live with a resource
envelope close to the current level in real terms, and will need to adjust
its strategies and actions with that constraint very much in mind. For the
longer run, other issues will require exploration, including (i) the roles
of the different sources (e.g., should there be a shift toward less heavy
reliance on the Government budget as the dominant source, and more emphasis
on other, non-governmental sources? if so, how should this shift be
effected? and at what pace?) and (ii) the methods and structure of the
revenue mobilization techniques used (what kinds of fees? who should pay?
with what provisions for the poor? etc.). These questions, however, should
not deflect attention from the more critical issue of the overall resource
constraint, which will still be the overriding factor well into the 1990s.
2.24     Given that Government funds are limited and other financing
sources cannot be expanded much in the near term (except perhaps with
counterpart funds, if donors agree), the sector must concentrate its
efforts to achieve progress in education on the one avenue for dealing with
the resource problem which is mostly under its controls namely, utilize
available resources more effectively through better deployment of funds and
improved efficiency. This requires appropriate solutions to expenditure
allocation issues.
2.25     Expenditure Allocation.  In general, the current allocation of
expenditure between the different levels of education remains consistent
with the goals of the sector. Primary schools continue to absorb the
largest percentage of the education budget, followed by adult education and
the university. This pattern coincides with the aim of providing basic
education for everyone and responding to the need for skilled manpower in
the public and private sectors, and is the best use of public r3sources in
cost-benefit terms. In one respect, though, recent allocations have
departed from these precepts. The share for higher education Increased
from 7 percent of the education budget in 1987 to 24 percent in 1989. Most
of this was destined for the Higher Pedagogical Institute, which was
created in 1986. The Higher Pedagogical Institute replaced the
University's department of education, and requires new infrastructure,
boarding facilities and laboratories. While this may have been a oae-time
investment, it does not correspond to the most urgent sectoral priorities.
2.26     In addition, recent allocations are consistent with stressing the
importance of non-salary items, especially teaching/learning materials,
which are often among the most cost-effective of education expenditures.
The 1989 budget is encouraging in this respects overall the proportion
allocated to materials is 26 percent, while for technical education and
higher education the allocations are 60 percent and 56 percent,
respectively. The percentage going to materials at the primary education
level is still very low, however, at 15 percent, but much higher than in
1986, when they reached an all-time low of 1.5 percent of the actual
expenditures going to material costs.
2.27     Unit costs throughout the system are extremely high, and this is a
major source of inefficiency -- reducing substantially the extent to which



- 14 -
resources are being used effectively. The main factors driving up unit
costs include: high repetition and drop out rates throughout the education
system; high costs for non-academic staff at the university and technical
levels; high costs for boarding of students; and, inefficiencies in
training institutions stemming from the fact that they have overcapacity in
places but under-capacity in boarding facilities. The first two of these
factors are discussed in the sections below on primary and secondary
education and post-secondary education.
2.28     Regarding the latter two -- boarding costs and capacity issues in
the training system -- there are pervasive problems at all levels above
primary. Boarding costs are a significant proportion of the annual
expenditures of secondary, technical, teacher training and higher
education. Since 1987, students have had to contribute to boarding costs
(except in teacher training, which is free and -- not coincidentally -- is
experiencing overcrowding), but their contributions fall far short of
meeting the full costs. Alternative ways to educate or to house students
need to be explored, such as transportation for students from the city
itself, the use of distance education, or private dormitories and
cafeterias. Boarding also contributes to the high cost of non-academic
staff at the technical and university levels because much of this staff is
employed in the dormitories. The other factor -- capacity issues in the
training system -- arises because the system has been designed to have
greater capacity than its boarding facilities can accommodate. Because
students have traditionally received access to boarding at this level, the
number of students actually enrolled is limited to the number who can be
boarded, with the result that the dormitories are overcrowded but the rest
of the system is under-utilized. This leads to high costs through, for
example, having low student/teacher ratios. In the teacher training
colleges, for instance, the student/teacher ratio is only 1:15, far below
what it could be for cost-effective instruction. At the university and
technical levels, the ratio is also too low (although there remain
shortages of teachers in certain areas, including for physics, math, and
Portuguese).
2.29     Besides improving expenditure allocations and reducing unit costs,
achievement of significant efficiency gains will also require upgrading of
financial management and control in the sector. Under the existing
arrangements, the budget for the education sector is decentralized in its
implementation. Information is kept in the provinces, and sent to the
Ministry of Finance for budget control purposes. The Ministry of Finance
is in the process of introducing a new budget system in parallel with the
existing one to enable it to monitor expenditures better. MINED is also
reviewing the eff-ciency of the current system based on a study of the
financial organization and management of the system (financed by the IDA
Education and Manpower Development Project (Credit 1907-Moz). The current
system does not account well for important data like external assistance,
school fees and other revenue, and does not allow MINED to monitor
provincial education expenditures. For instance, all were surprised when
the provincial education salary budgets were spent before the end of the
fiscal year in 1989. The study has recommended centralization of financial
planning and execution in MINED and clarification of financial
responsibility among the central and provincial levels.



- 15 -
2.30     Effective decision-making about new investment in the sector is
also critical. In 1987. financing of investment in education was roughly
equal for the Government and donors at Mt 320 and 297 million respectively.
For 1989. donor contributions were not yet adequately reflected in the
budget and the overall allocations by subsectors and priorities was
unclear. Among the specific investment activities planned (and for which
funding is already secured), many correspond well to the highest
priorities. These includes the construction and equipment of one teacher
training college, and the rehabilitation of another, to be financed by the
APDB with a credit of US$12 million; and continued support from UNICEF for
teacher training and dealing with war traumatized children. In addition,
there are various arrangements with bilateral donors and NGOs for projects
aimed at improving the quality of education. Among these is SIDA's support
for distribution of free primary level textbooks and review of the primary
curriculum is the largest. Other support is coming in under the emergency
program. Most of this support, which services some 500,000 students, is
directed at purchase of books and materials, specialized teacher training
to deal with the war traumas, and in some cases rehabilitation of destroyed
infrastructure. MINED is in the process of creating a database which will
brirg together all data on external support, regardless of affiliation or
destination and would enable it to commence a process of reviewing whether
its highest priorities are fully met.
2.31     Conclusion.  The resources available for education in the 1990s
will continue to be highly constrained compared to the needs, and this fact
needs to be a central consideration in all next steps in the sector.
Government spending for education is projected to increase only moderately;
cost-recovery is not going to be an important factor yet; and donor
support, in total, can be increased only slightly. Therefore, the relative
priority of education needs to be discussed and decided on, and emphasis
needs to be put primarily on making the most effective possible use of the
available resources. There would be possibilities to shift resources from
other sectors and from the investment to the recurrent budget, however,
this needs to be discussed in a wider context of the rehabilitation
program. For the education sector itself, the major theme is to make most
effective use of available resources and this has several vital
implications which underlie the points made in the sections followings
namely, that (a) improvement of quality and efficienc, throughout the
education system need to be stressed rather than expansion at this stage;
(b) cost effectiveness of every expenditure must be a paramount concern;
(c) a comprehensive strategy and action plan for the sector specifying the
highest priority objectives is essential; and (d) adherence to these
priorities is important not only for how Government funds are used but also
for how external assistance is channelled. The donor coordination meeting
in February, 1990 underscored these issues.
Issues in Primary and Secondary Education
2.32     The principal issues in primary and secondary education include,
in addition to the expenditure and financing concerns discussed above, the
full gamut of traditional education problems -- involving questions of
quality, efficiency, access (and coverage), and equity. The specific areas
most critically in need of attention for the 1990s are discussed below



- 16 -
under the following headingst textbooks and other teachingllearnirg
materials; teachers (training and pedagogical support); hours of
instruction; language of instruction; the learning capacity of students
(their health and nutritional status); repetition and dropout rates; and
enrollment rates and their determinants. While many other areas also
require action, these seven emerged as especially important in the analyses
done as part of the preparation for the project and in independent studies
supported by other external assistance programs.
2.33     The dominant overarching issue that comes out clearly from the all
various detailed concerns is, again, the need to improve quality and
efficiency.
2.34     Textbooks and Other Teaching/Learning Materials.  Inst-uctional
materials, of which textbooks are the most important, are a key ingredient
in education. Over the past decade researchers have documented the
consistently positive effect of textbooks on student achievementb. 4/
Increasing access to textbooks is the most cost-effective means cf
improving education, especially if a ratio of 2 students per book can be
achieved. When students have to learn a second language, the provision of
supplemental reading materials in that language also has a positive effect.
2.35     Up to now, the Government's policy has been to develop,
manufacture, distribute and sell textbooks and teacher guides at a highly
subsidized uniform price to parents and schools. The subsidy comes from
donors and the Government (see Annex 8 for the annual subsidy of
textbooks). The goal is a lsl student-textbook and supply ratio.
Tremendous progress was made initially, with the production and
distribution of textbooks for all primary school children. With assistance
from SIDA and NORAD, the Government has produced textbooks for one grade
each year, beginning in 1983 with grade one. However, even in 1986, before
the cost-recovery mechanisms went into effect, a ll ratio was not quite
met. In addition, textbook sales have plummeted over the last years,
presumably because the total private costs of education for parents have
quadrupled between 1986 and 1988.
2.36     The sale of textbooks is organized through the private sector.
After textbooks a:e written at INDE, they are made print ready at the
Editora Escolar (a semi-independent publishing house in INDE). Then,
DINANE, the public enterprise which distributes textbooks, orders
manufacturing from the public enterprise (CEGRWP) responsible for book
printing and upon delivery, distributes books to a few wholesale points in
the country. Wholesalers, and in turn retailers, are then supposed to
supply the public with the books at prices fixed by the Government, which
include fixed profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. The public
price of a primary school textbook has been maintained at 252 MT including
value-added taxes, since 1986. This represented about 20 percent of the
real cost of a new textbook and 40 percent of the cost of a reprint in
1989. Sales fell sharply when this price was introduced in 1987 and have
not recovered even though the real price is going down by holding the
41 M.E. Lockheed, A. Verspoor et al, Improving Primary Education in
Developing Countries, Washington, D.C.: World Bank (Forthcoming).

nominal price constant. Clearly, this system is not achieving the
Government's objective of having textbooks available to all in the school
system.  The following issues must be considered in analyzing Mozambique's
textbook policy:
(a) pricings uniform average price for textbooks and teacher guides
implies a subsidy from the parents of first and second graders
to higher grades and teachers; and, ignores the real issue of
capacity to pay of many segments of the population;
(b)   safety net: there is no safety net for those segments of the
population unable to pay and therefore the policy to sell, and
to have s 1:1 ratio student/textbook ratio is not achieving the
objective, which is to have books available in schools to
stimulate a teaching/learning process;
(c)   specifications: in order to hold the price down, very low
quality paper, binding and covers are being used. Textbooks
last less than a year, ultimately increasing manufacturing, and
particularly, distribution costs because the total stock needs
to be replaced each year;
*d)   distribution: a large part of the price is made up of taxes and
controlled profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. A
lack of demand and limited transportation capacity contribute
to a scarcity of books in most provincial capitals. The
retailers respond rationally to the controlled profit margin by
not selling in areas where demand is slack. The situation can
only be worse in the rural areas;
(e)   management: no one organization has authority of the three public
enterprises involved with textbooks. The Government also needs
reconsider whether subsidizing the public enterprises highly is
the most efficient way to achieve the objective of making
textbooks available to classrooms.
2.37     Awareness of the textbook problems is increasing, and alternative
solutions have been proposed, e.g. to subsidize boc,, purchase for poor
parents through a Social Action Fund. The administrative and targeting
problems have not been analyzed carefully yet. Further data is needed on
the private costs of education, and the mechanism for supply from the
public enterprise to private wholesalersIretailer network needs to be
thoroughly reviewed. A study on the ability to pay for textbooks at
differential prices has been designed but not yet implemented.
2.38     Teacher Training and Pedagogical Support.  Education systems are
only as good as their teachers are, and two of the most powerful
instruments for improving teacher quality are (i) teacher training and (ii)
the pedagogical support which the teachers receive (i.e., guidance and
coaching through supervision and other support).
2.39     Mozambique has made a strong effort in this area since
Independence. In spite of this, as can be seen in Table 1.1, many of the
teachers in Mozambique still remain poorly trained in subject-matter and in



- 18 -
pedagogical techniques. In fact, in 1986 only 8 percent of all teachers
had themselves received more than 6 years of schooling and only half had
received pedagogical training. The degree to which teachers are trained
varies tremendously among provinces. For example, the province of Sofala,
the only with two centers of training for primary teachers, has the highest
number of teachers with training at the EPI level with 79 percent. At the
other extreme. in the province of Maputo only 46 percent of the teachers
have received pedagogical training.

2.40     Currently the teacher training is divided intl three separate
levels, training for lower primary school, upper primary school and
secondary (Annex 9 depicts the teacher training structure). The Higher
Pedagogical Institute is responsible for the training of secondary
teachers. Teachers for the first level (grades 1-5) must now have six
years of schooling and three years of training and are being trained in
some 16 residential teacher training centers (CFPPs). This was recently
changed from one year of training, and the Government is considering
increasing the level of general education required before being admitted to
teacher training for EP1. The next level (grades 6 and 7) requires nine
years of schooling and two years of training. This kind of training is
being given residentially in middle level pedagogical institutes (IMPs).
Teaching at the secondary level technically requires ten or eleven years of
schooling and five years of training. Teachers' ability to impart
knowledge (rather than teach by rote memorization) increases as their own
level of education increases. However, cost considerations should also
enter into a decision about changing entry requirements or length of
teacher training.
2.41     Few resources are being spent on retraining, upgrading and re-
qualifying teachers already in service. Two small programs are currently
underway: some 90 teachers with one year of training are taking night
courses to obtain the three year training certificate. Some 100 EP1
teachers are enrolled in the regular IMP course to be upgraded to EP2
teachers.
2.42     By far the largest in-service training exercise has been conducted
in the context of the introduction of SNE. From 1982 to 1988, central
level subject matter specialists and instructors from CPPPs and IMPs
trained 120 provincial and district level staff which in turn would repeat



- 19 -
the same courses for all the teachers who would have to teach the new
materials that were to be introduced in the next grade. Since not all the
textbooks and teacher guides were ready on time and there was no follow-up,
these courses were not very effective (particularly for 4th and 5th grade).
2.43     Until the security situation prohibited free and frequent travel,
teachers all participated in regular in-service training sessions in their
integrated pedagogical zone (ZIP) consisting of one or several schools
depending on size.   Every Saturday morning is reserved for planning and
pedagogical support discussions. Pedagogical adjunct directors from larger
schools were responsible for managing these meetings and providing support
during the week. Such meetings are now restricted to the school level and
most pedagogical staff are working as regular teachers. The pedagogical
support system consists of 159 employees of which 148 function at the
district level and 11 at the provincial level. School directors in most
cases also teach full time and have no training in either pedagogical
support or school management. In addition, a third teacher is employed as
the administrative adjunct director. In large urban schools these
positions are fully justified, but they should not be the model for all
sizes of schools.
2.44     Insecurity has also prevented the establishment of an
inspectorate. Provincial inspectors exist, but district staff were never
appointed, although some positions exist in the budget. The Fifth Party
Congress emphasized the need for establishment of an inspectorate.
However, the proposed roles and functions of the inspectors and pedagogical
support staff at the district level are overlapping and at this point in
time, pedagogical support is most needed to improve the quality of
education.
2.45     One way in which this in-service training might be supplied is
through distance education. There is currently little or no distance
education being used in Hozambique. There was an experimental distance-
course training of teachers undertaken from 1980-82, but it did not yield
satisfactory results in such a short amount of time. However, distance
education has been a very cost-effective way to promote higher learning in
other countries. Its success would require a serious effort to integrate
distance education in the normal operations of MINED.
2.46     In addition to improving teacher training, the Government must
improve its examination and testing system in order to further boost the
quality of teaching. Nationwide standardized achievement testing is
nonexistent in Mozambique (there are annual examinations by grade, but
these will be phased out in the lower grades). Teachers also receive
little or no training in student evaluation through tests either made up or
administered by the teacher.
2.47     The teachers receive minimal support in the form of basic didactic
materials. While most classrooms have some sort of blackboard, many do not
have chalk, not to mention scissors, paper, maps, a globe or access to a
library. And, many students do not have desks. Improving access to these
didactic materials would easily improve the quality of education. In
addition, some of the classrooms are considered to be non-existent (open
air classrooms). This also does not facilitate teaching or learning.

2.48     Hours of Instruction.  The hours of instruction received by
students is a powerful determinant of how much they learn, according to
recent research evidence. Yet, school days and years are usually shorter
in developing than in developed countries. Actual instructional time in
many developing countries is not even half of the 800 (lower grades) to
1000 hours (upper grades) per annum commonly available in primary schools
in developed countries.
2.49     Mozambique, which has shifted from running a double to a triple
shift in its urban schools, is no exception. With the present three shift
system in the cities, instruction time has been reduced from the mandated
24 hoursiweek to about 16117 hours per week, or between 550 and 600 hours
per annum. This loss of instruction time significantly reduces potential
student achievements. To combat this problem, many donors, including IDA
under the Education 1 and Manpower Development Project (Cr. 1907-Moz), have
financed the construction of new classrooms (in Maputo) to allow the
restoration of a double shift regime. However, the growth of enrollments
has been such that this objective will not be achieved. The estimated
costs of rehabilitating and constructing sufficient classrooms to enable
all students at the primary and secondary levels to go to school in double
shifts in Maputo and Beira/Dondo by 1995 are about US$50 million, which is
US$10 million more than rehabilitating the current network with three
shifts. Some rehabilitation and new construction is essential in any
event, but it is unlikely to be comprehensive enough to allow all students
to return to a double shift and thereby have the desired effect on the
hours of instruction received by each student.
2.50     Another alternative for increasing the hours of instruction is to
manage the school year differently (see Annex 10). Methods which have been
used successfully in other parts of the world include staggering attendance
of tlhree groups of students on a double shift regime throughout the whole
year and eliminating periods during which school buildings are empty. As
teachers are paid on an annual basis and only have the right to one month
of vacation, there should not be additional recurrent costs, if eleven
month schooling were chosen.
2.51     Language of Instruction.  Another issue adversely affecting the
quality and efficiency of education is the use of Portuguese as the
language of instruction beginning in first grade, since the vast majority
of Mozambicans are not Portuguese speakers. Without a strong foundation in
a first language, it is more difficult for children to acquire verbal
fluency and literacy in a second language. This may account in part for
the high repetition and failure rates in the system. The most effective
policy would be to initiate instruction using the mother language as a
medium, followed by a gradual transition to the national language in
subsequent years.
2.52     The Learning Capacity of Students.  The effectiveness of the
education process is often limited by the poor health and nutritional
condition of students. Healthy, well-nourished children learn better.
Students who are ill or underfed during their school years, and/or who need
to compensate for retarded development caused by disease or malnutrition
during their pre-school years, are at a distinct disadvantage. The
instruments available to combat such problems are numerous, including, for



- 21 -
example, targeted school feeding, vitamin and mineral supplementation, and
deworming programs.
2.53     Nutritional information on Mozambique is scarce but the available
statistics indicatt widespread malnutrition and hunger. Daily calorie
supply per capita is estimated to be 1,617, considerably below requirements
of 2,300 calories. Among children, available statistics show that the most
common causes of illness and death are anemia, malnutrition, pneumonia and
diarrhea. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition among children, measured
by weight-for-age (stunting), is between 30 and 40 percent; while severe
malnutrition, measured by weight for height (wasting), is prevalent in an
average of about 6 percent of children surveyed. Micronutrient
deficiencies common in Africa are also prevalent in Mozambique, namely iron
deficiency and iodine deficiency in areas close to Malawi. The situation
is presumably much worse in areas cut off by war activity. Data on the
nutritional status of school-aged children is lacking.
2.54     Several organizations are involved already in providing school
meals in Maputo and beyond. For example, the World Food Program provides
food for all dormitories and the IDA Health and Nutrition Project supports
a program of providing fortified buns to primary schools in Maputo.
2.55     The cost-effectiveness of aiding children's nutritional status
when improving education is knovn; however, the best manner of redressing
children's nutritional detriments within the system for food distribution
in Mozambique needs to be examined further. Other countries have
successfully introduced programs for iron and vitamin A supplements,
nutrition and health education, physical exams for all school entrants, and
school feeding.
2.56     Repetition and Dropout Rates.  More than 360,000 places, or 28
percent of all places, in the primary and secondary education are occupied
by repeaters, and dropout rates are exceptionally high. Although the
effect of SNE introduction has been to decrease repetition rates somewhat,
drop out rates have remained high. A 1986 study indicated that of each
1000 students entering the system in grade one, only 718, 506 and 362 would
eventually enter grades 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Of these 362 entering
the fourth grade, each would spend an average of 7.7 years in the four
grades, and only 49 would be promoted to the fifth grade in their fifth
year of schooling. As a result of these poor promotion rates, the age
range in primary schools is very wide. MINED has attempted to reduce the
attrition level through the introduction of a lower maximum number of
permitted repetitions, automatic promotion in some grades, and a lower
ceiling entry age to the primary level. The ceiling entry age (7 years for
grade 1) is being introduced gradually starting in 1989 and phased in over
the next five years. A study on the causes of drop out, which started in
1989 with SIDA financing, should give important indications of elements
that may be amenable to policy interventions.



- 22 -
2.57     Failure, repetition and drop out rates remain high at the upper
primary level as well. In 1984, repetition rates were 21 percent and 32
percent for grades five and six respectively. At the general middle
secondary level, the system has grown, but attrition is still high and the
pass level from grades 9 to 10 has been around 50 percent in recent years.
Basic level vocational education, which is an important parallel to general
secondary, has also experienced problems with attrition. Graduation
dropped by 64 percent at the basic level over the period from 1982 to 1986
and 39 percent at the medium level over the same period. The result of all
these high rates of repetition and dropout are to drive up the unit costs
of education, particularly of producing graduates. The system's capacity
is not fully vsed at the higher levels, and students who repeat a grade
cost twice as much to educate at any given level.
2.58     Enrollment Rates and Their Determinants.  The coverage of the
education system is still very incomplete, with an overall 20 percent of
school-aged children attending primary schools. Enrollments for primary
school declined by 3.5 percent between 1984 and 1987. New entrants to
primary school decreased by 17 percent between 1985 and 1987. However,
enrollments for secondary schools increased by 11 to 33 percent, depending
on the level, during the same time period. However, graduations for
primary schools were up by 3.4 percent between 1984 and 1986, while
graduations from secondary schools fell during this period.
2.59     Girls continue to represent far less than fifty percent of the
students at all levels, and the percentage of girls attending school in the
higher grades has decreased in recent years. In 1986 only 44 percent of
all primary students were female, 36 percent of all fifth and sixth year
students, and 30 percent of all secondary students.
2.60     At the secondary level, all of the 42 schools in operation are
located in larger towns or cities. Maputo City had about one third of all
enrolment at this level and probably produced half of the graduates. The
obvious reason for the system being so skewed toward urban education is the
continuing security preblem in rural areas. In the rural areas and smaller
towns some 3,119 schools or 51 percent of all primary schools have been
destroyed or forced to close down by 1989, leaving more than 800,000
primary age children without schools and affecting 12,500 teachers. At the
upper primary and secondary level, 32 schools have been destroyed,
affecting 13,000 students. In addition, 40 boarding schools and teacher
training centers have been destroyed. Frequently, in rural towns the
parents do not want their children to attend school for fear of becoming
separated from them if the village is attacked. Also as a result of the
continuing conflicts, a tremendous number of people have fled to the
cities, flooding the urban schools and far surpassing the urban system's
capacity for absorbing students. Security problems are likely to continue
affecting the distribution of schools and access to education, and the



- 23 -
urban s7stems are likely to face a continuing flood of migrants from the
rest of the country.
2.61     Although there is no information available on the distribution of
students among income levels, it is safe to assume that the drastically
rising private costs of education are screening out students from the
lowest income groups. A family with three children in school (4th, 6th,
and 9th grade) would pay Mt. 18.7,5 in 1988 compared with Mt. 3,714 per
year in 1986. This represents 35 percent of the minimum wage in
agriculture, or 6 percent of an average salary, as compared to 15 percent
and 5 percent two years earlier. Rural families also incur a level of
foregone income by the absence of their children from production. At this
time, some of these costs are subsidized by donors, but this is not
sufficient to assure an equitable access to education. The Government has
created a Social Action Fund to pay for some schooling and textbooks in
January 1989 in part as attempt to stem the private costs of education.
Issues in Post-Secondary Education
2.62     The Government would like to increase access to the Eduardo
Mondlane University and to higher level vocational training in order to
address the continuing shortage of higher level manpower. However, in
1989, only 570 students graduated from EPU, and not all were allowed to go
on with further studies, some also had to go to the armed forces. With
such a small pool of potential students, the University has still not fully
recovered the level of enrolment which it had before Independence, though
it has made significant progress. As shown in Table 1.2, enrolment
increased by 88 percent between 1980 and 1986, but unfortunately the number
of graduates actually decreased.

Source: SIDA, 108? and University
2.63     Another reason for the low number of graduates (and therefore high
unit costs per graduate) at the university is that the drop out rate is
11.1 percent per year, therefore only half of the original entrants ever
graduate. Those who graduate generally need about 6 years instead of the 5
officially required. At the University's Faculties of Engineering,



- 24 -
Biology, Agronomy and Sciences, problems arising from the low level of
qualification of entering students have improved because the University
instituted (with Dutch financing) a half year training course in basic
sciences before admitting students. However, with the general lack of
teachers for math and physics at secondary levels, and the low quality of
teaching at this level, this half year remedial teaching is not enough to
form them into qualified entrants; moreover, such remedial measures do
increase unit costs per graduate significantly.
2.64     Because the University is not being used to capacity, unit costs
have skyrocketed. The reasons for this are the same as those discussed
above for secondary and technical schools, namely high boarding and staff
costs. The major problem facing the University is the lack of boarding
facilities (its capacity is for 732 students only, all of which is occupied
by full scholarship students of which there were 931 in 1989) and the
appalling state of existing ones. Some students have even been financed to
study abroad when the courses they sought were offered in Mozambique, but
there was no room to board them. The University has more non-academic
staff than academic staff (1057 versus 426, in 1988), in part to deal with
boarding facilities and security on its sprawling campus. In addition, the
University pays a significant amount of its budget for salaries of foreign
staff because of the lack of qualified professors. The 1988 budget was the
equivalent of US$ 18 million, of which 16 percent came from the
Government's budget and income from services rendered. The Government also
paid some US$120,000 in foreign currency to foreign lecturers. Most of the
support in the form of salary payments are donations (some US$ 11.9
million).   Such a large dependency on donations, through agreements with
as many as thirty different donors, does not offer the University the
optimal level of freedom to decide on its priorities and engage in rational
long term planning.
2.65     For countries like Mozambique, the University has an important
role to play in the development of the technological basis needed to start
on the road to modernization. For such development the University needs to
modernize its institutions, and foster a growing interaction between the
technological and scientific sectors within the University and the
society's productive sectors. Since Independence, the University has had
to concentrate on training manpower, in many, sometimes short term,
experimental programs, and it has not been able to design a long term plan
for itself. Yet, it is about the only institution in the country that
could produce manpower to guide technological development and carry out
research to foster the proper adaptation and own development.
2.66     The single largest problem to succeeding in the science and
technology faculties is the number and quality of its teaching staff.
National staff now represent 60 percent of the academic staff in the four
faculties, but 70 percent has five years or less of teaching experience,
and qualifications below the foreign staff. Only 10 national staff, out of
a total of 78 national and 57 foreign, is at present abroad to pursue
graduate studies, so dependence on foreign academic staff will persist.
The official policy is to allow teaching staff graduate training abroad
interspersed with periods of teaching at home, so it takes 13 to 15 years
after graduation for an academic staff member to start a teachinglresearch
career with a doctorate. As doctorates are necessary to develop enduring



- 25 -
research in basic and applied sciences, shortening the training period and
increasing the number of staff on graduate programs abroad seems advisable.
Further difficulty arises upon the return of academic staff, namely the
salaries and fringe benefits, especially housing availability, are said to
be significantly below the conditions offered by the public enterprises and
emerging private sector.
2.67     Effective utilization of foreign staff, as they will be necessary
for the foreseeable future, should also be improved. Rapid turn-over, lack
of choice of candidates, language problems, personal research interests
rather than support to the faculty's program are all reported as problems.
2.68     Specifically in the sciences, the University is also hindered in
attempts to provide a good program because the facilities are dispersed
over two sites and they lack the necessary laboratory equipment. The
science faculties have common activities and a high degree of compatibility
among their disciplines, and integration of these four areas (mathematics,
biology, physics and chemistry) is highly recommended. Such integration
should aim for the elimination of duplication, reorganization of teaching
of the introductory science year, redesigning teaching and research
laboratories to centralize equipment and use, centralization of
maintenance, storage, and sectoral libraries.
2.69     A major problem facing the University is the lack of a clear
planning and management structure. The Rector is assisted by two Councils
and a number of central technical units. There is no organizational unit
responsible for assisting in decision making and management, planning, or
research. In fact, many of the functions which are performed by the
central units are duplicated in each Faculty (e.g. personnel management and
payments). Also, donor coordination, while officially going through the
office of international relationships, is often managed directly by each
faculty. Overall university development plans have not been drawn up, and
universally applied policies do not seem to exist. Decision making is
totally centralized, on paper, with the Rector who has to carry out the
mandate given to him in overall university congresses (held every five
years) and councils consisting of students and staff. In practice,
decision making is almost totally decentralized to the faculties, and much
policy making is driven by interactions with donors.
Issues in Management, Organization, and Planning
2.70     The diagnostic phase of an organization and management study,
financed jointly by SIDA and the first Education and Manpower Development
Project (Cr. 1907-Moz), has been concluded. The study looked at the
organizational structure and operations of MINED, SETEP, and the Provincial
Education Directorates. It specifically looked at objectives and
procedures in five areas: personnel management; financial management;
documentation and information retrieval; computerization; and, management
of property. Organizationally, it reviewed the role and function changes



- 26 -
needed because the Ministers' Council decided to create a position of
Permanent Secretary in each Ministry and to eliminate the National
Directorates of External Relations. The roles of the two Vice-Ministers,
Secretary of State for Vocational/Technical Training, and the National
Directorates were also reviewed in light of: the introduction of private
sector education; the transfer of non-formal vocational training to the
Ministry of Labor; the need to give more weight to general education and
less to adult education; and, possible role of MINED in higher education.
Many overlapping functions were found. Many procedures on the books were
not known and followed; many data collected that are not processed and
analyzed, nor passed on the central levels or passed back- to the provinces.
Decision making powers exist only at the highest levels oi the ministry.
The current reorganization of MINED should help address these problems.
2.71     MINED has improved its planning capacity significantly in recent
years, including the construction of a computer model which it uses to
prepare projections of enrollment and financing costs. Despite these
improvements already made in the planning capacity, more work is still to
be done in order to make the optimum use of its scarce resources. For
instance, a data base is under development to record and merge assistance
received under the emergency program with governmental sectoral, bilateral
and NGO allocations and donations. Secondly, while a sectoral development
plan has been developed by MINED, it is not based on detailed subsector
plans for the vocationalltechnical and higher education sector, and there
is no mechanism in place to reach an agreement between the subsectors on
relative priorities. Consequently, national and foreign investments are
not necessarily all directed to the highest priority needs of the sector.
Thirdly, investments in operations, maintenance and rehabilitation should
have priority over expansion of the system, and there is little capacity in
place at either the central or provincial level to organize construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance programs. Donor assistance in these areas,
even financing recurrent costs, should be considered to halt further
decline of the education system.
2.72     Training of human resources at all levels of the administration is
an urgent need. However, the present governmental policy which allows all
civil servants time off to study, does reduce to a significant degree the
productivity of the sector, and especially at the central level. Low civil
service salaries also reduce willingness to work, and many try to obtain
second Jobs, e.g. as teachers or giving classes at ISP. Private
consultanciee are only available for donor agencies, but such as are
available are sought after and in turn, because of their inherent
inequities, produce low morale and productivity.
C. Donor Assistance
2.73     Bilateral aid for the provision of instructional materials comes
from Norway and Canada (in the form of paper); Finland (textbook printing);
the Netherlands (equipment for hostels, geometry instruments, and basic
school materials); Sweden (publishing and printing); Italy and GDR
(laboratories); and the Federal Republic of Germany, (library books). A
number of bilateral donors -- including Sweden, Denmark, the Soviet Union,
Switzerland, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Netherlands --



- 27 -
contribute to infrastructure development such as the construction and
equipping of technical schools, teacher training institutes, primary
schools, and adult education training centers. Donors also contribute to
the training of personnel, either through technical assistance (GDR,
Sweden, UK, USSR), scholarships (GDR, UK, USA, USSR), or provision of
schools abroad (Cuba, GDR). The World Food Program supplies food for
boarding schools, the largest category. In addition, Italy, Sweden, UNICEF
and the World Lutheran Federation support experimental projects and
personnel development at various levels of the system, and the Netherlands
and the USSR provide personnel support at the University. Though the
expenditures of donors in the education may change and increase, the
overall level of aid is not increasing enough to fully cover all needs.
2.74     Future coAmmitments of donors would continue to be important.  The
donor coordination seminar, held in February 1990, started a process of
dialogue among donors and with the Government starting to focus all future
contributions to high priority areas. Some of these have already been
covered. AFDB is financing a teacher training rehabilitation project;
UNICEF a program supporting teacher training, community participation and
special education needs for war traumatized children; and SIDA would
support curriculum evaluation, textbook adaptation, paper for textbooks
(instead of NORAD), distribution of free primary textbooks and educational
research as well as the reorganization of MINED's human resource management
procedures. These are all directed to high priority areas. Many NGO's
fund programs aimed at educational needs of the displaced population,
including sometimes school rehabilitation. UNDP is financing the training
of education planners. FINNIDA is financing a primary school for displaced
children and tne rehabilitation of the existing secondary school in Nacala
in the context of the Urban Rehabilitation Project. At the University, EEC
is financing construction and equipment of laboratories for the initial
science program; the Netherlands would continue its technical assistance
and equipment support to science faculties and the Rockefeller Foundation
is supporting some actions in libraries. The Gulbenkian Foundation would
support the major curriculum review due to take place in 1991.
D. The Bank Group's Experience
2.75     The World Bank has been involved in the education sector in
Mozambique only since 1988 with the start of its first Education and
Manpower Development Project (Credit 1907-MOZ). This project is ongoing.
With regard to sector work, there has been a review of public expenditures
in the education sector, and a longer term view of the sector's issues and
needs has been taken in the forthcoming Country Economic Memorandum.
2.76     The first objective of the Bank's Education and Manpower
Development Protect in the education sector in Mozambique is to improve the
quality and efficiency of primary education in the city of Maputo, which is
being achieved through the following means: (a) expanding and improving
primary school facilities; (b) training school managers and principals; and
(c) providing basic school supplies to 300 classrooms. The second
objective is to strengthen the quality of post-secondary training and to
target its programs more towards the technical needs of Mozambique. This



- 28 -
part of the project is improving the training of accountants, office
managers, bookkeepers, and customs officials at the Commercial Institute of
Maputo and refining the training offered through the Faculties of
Engineering and Economics at the Eduardo Mondlane University. The last
component of this project is working to improve financial management,
planning and project implementation by training the high-level officials of
both the Ministry of Education and provincial education directorates.
2.77     This project, which became effective in October 1988, is scheduled
to continue through 1994. Four contracts for the construction of new
primary schools have been awarded, and construction as well as school
rehabilitation started in 1990. The first principal training is to be
given in July 1990. The Commercial Institute of Maputo has not received
any assistance as the twinning arrangement with a Portuguese institution
fell through, but technical assistance arrangements are now being made. At
the University, the Economics Faculty benefits regularly from technical
assistance, and the Engineering Faculty's remodeling is nearing completion,
while all equipment is on order. The improvement of educational planning
and financial management is an ongoing and successful process.
2.78     From the experience of the first project, the Bank has learned the
followings (1) there is a sufficient number of civil works contractors in
Maputo to justify raising the ICB limit; (2) the project unit has proved
capable of handling procurement procedures, but its lack of a full staffing
complement (due to salary supplement payment problems) was felt in delays
in project implementation; (3) the University is also not sufficiently
staffed to handle the procurement of technical assistance contracts on an
individual basis; (4) there are serious bottlenecks in disbursements and in
contract approval in the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Mozambique.
2.79     In the 1989 Public Expenditure Review on Mozambique, a separate
chapter examined the expenditures and financing of the education sector.
The report stressed the need for focusing expenditures towards improving
the quality of education, rehabilitating the system rather than expanding
it, and on improving the coordination of education financing so that all
investments were an integral part of the public sector investment program.
Together with the PER, the 1990 CEM, which analyzed external efficiency
issues as well as the lack of capacity to manage the rehabilitation,
resulted in a strong dialogue with the government which has resulted in the
a ten year plan developed by MINED.
2.80     Another important piece of economic and sector work on Mozambique
was the Food Security Study of August 1989. This report stressed the need
to address the common occurrence of many infectious and parasitic diseases
in order to improve the nutritional standing of Mozambican children. This
is another argument for a deworming program in the schools. A Training
Needs Study for Mozambique will be conducted in 1991 and should provide
information on the desirable trends in education, such as the number of
graduates required at the different levels of qualification, of the career
profiles demanded by enterprises and public services, and the quality
standards they expect. At the request of the Government, the Bank and SIDA
will also initiate a Higher Education Study to review in depth the issues
of: quality; cost and financing; centralization in one university versus
proliferation of sectoral institutions of higher education; and linkages

with the needs of the labor market and the Economic and Social
Rehabilitation Program.

III. GOYNERNENT'S STRATEGY FOR EDUCATION
3.01      To address the priority issues discussed in Chapter II and work
toward the goals outlined in Chapter I, Government has dev-sloped and
committed itself to a strategy and action plan for the education sector
through the year 2000. Based on a thorough review undertaken by Government
itself as part of the preparation of the proposed project, and
incorporating extensive revision of earlier policies, this strategy and
action plan consist, specifically, of: (i) a set of policies and programs
for improvement of the education system for the period 1989 - 2000,
including priorities, means, and next steps; and (Ui) a development plan
indicating in quantitative terms how this program will be met, and the
investments and other expenditures that will be required. The programs and
development plan are the foundation ror Government's planned ititiatives in
the sector in the 1990s, and the framework from which the proposed project
and all its componsnts (described in Chapter IV) have been derived. They
also are the basis for Government's letter and associated implementation
matrix (Annex 11), which refiect vhe understandings reached during project
preparation and during negotiations, where the Government confirmed its
commitment to adhere to the agreed course of action. The main elements of
Government's strategy for the sector are introduced in the following
section. and then elaborated in more detail in subsequent sections.
A. Background and Overview
3.02      The new strategy is the result of a comprehensive rethinking
that Government initiated in the latter part of the 1980s, as it became
increasingly aware of the deficiencies of prior approaches. As part of
this reassessment, the principal Government authorities involved, including
MINED, consulted widely to identify and assess the issues and options, and
build consensus within the country. The deliberations and conclusions of
the Fifth Party Congress in 1989 became a major input to the ongoing review
process, and further ideas emerged from discussions in sectoral
coordination councils and from the analysis undertaken for the public
expenditure review. As the new strategy began to take shape, it was
discussed at the Cabinet level and in January 1990 was presented to the
National Education Council, which approved it. A month later it was
presented to the donors at an education sector coordination conference.
Throughout this process, the participants devoted considerable attention to
(a) sectoral objectives, (b) resource requirements, (c) resource
limitations, (d) implementation constraints, and (e) the feasibility of
possible changes, considering consensus-building and political economy
issues. There was keen recognition within and outside Government of the
realities imposed by the severe scarcity of resources available for the
education sector and the need to use these resources where they will be
most effective.
3.03      The final strategy that emerged from these efforts has the
following principal features and objectives:



- 31 -
Quality and efficiency improvement will be emphasized at all
levels of the education system and expansion will be de-
emphasized -- in recognition of the extreme deficieaicies in
quality and efficiency in the existing system, and the stringent
resource constraints that preclude major expansion on a
sustainable basis. Earlier expansion plans (e.g., in the number
of schools and in enrollment rates) have accordingly been scaled
back to more realistic targets.
Primary education will be a priority, with special focus on
enhancing quality and efficiency in key aspects where serious
deficiencies are impeding progress of primar7 schooling as a
whole. This will include particular attention to:
a)   textbooks (improving access to and utilization of books and
other teaching/learning materials, and improving the
quality of the books and materials);
b)   improving the quality of teaching process especially
focusing on teacher training (improving in-service and pre-
service training) and pedagogical support for teachers
(improving the guidance and coaching that teachers receive
from higher levels through supervision and other support);
(c) hcurs of instruction (increasing the amount of classroom
time for effective learning of essential subjects);
(d) new initiatives to enhance effective learning especially on
language of instruction (accelerating plans to use local
languages more in the early years of primary school, in
accordance with the mounting evidence that children learn
to read and wri.e better that way, with Portuguese being
introduced after the first two years), student achievement
testing (improving the examination system as an instrument
for enhancing learning), and student learning capacity
(improving the health and nutritional status of students
through addressing problems contributing to ill health and
undernutrition).
In secondary education , quality issues will be addressed as the
SNE moves into this subsector. Further in-depth analysis of the
structure and content of subjects and courses provided, and of
the inputs to the system (teachers, textbooks, facilities, etc.)
will provide the basis for changes as necessary. Some expansion
is also planned.
In vocational/technical education, expansion will be deferred
until all available training capacity has been filled. An
analysis of this subsector's role and structure is planned to
provide a basis for reform and changes as necessary.
In higher education, the University will be strengthened, in
recognition of the country's extreme shortages of and urgent
need for trained personnel with the skills, knowledge, and



- 32 -
abilities to provide the professional, technical, and
intellectual leadership the country requires for sustainable
development. Strengthening measures will include improving the
teaching staff through training and recruitment, revamping what
is taught and how, rectifying problems in the physical
facilities that are hindering effective learning, and -- as
resources permit -- increasing student intake in line with the
national requirements for more graduates.
-    Sector management and organization improvements will be
stressed, with special emphasis on: (a) reorganizing MINED so it
can more effectively discharge its leadership role, (b)
improving management skills through training and institutional
strengthening, (c) reducing unit costs through efficiency
enhancements, (d) capacity building in financial management,
budgetary control and analysis, and resource allocation.
In addition, Government will move forward on other critical concerns too --
as far as resources allow. This is likely to include, for example, special
actions in support of the broader national program for rural areas (the
priority district program), and new measures on equity and resource
mobilization.
3.04      The program that flowed from these priorities is set out in more
detail in Annex 11. Overall, the actions envisioned constitute a concerted
attempt by Government to address the principal problems and issues in the
sector. They are fully consistent with -- and closely related to -- the
findings and conclusions of the most recent public expenditure review.
They build on and benefit from donor assisted activities and from
initiatives begun during the preparation and implementation of the first
IDA-supported project.
3.05      The development plan that complements the program was prepared
early on in the process, to assist in identifying, assessing, and selecting
among alternative options. 5/ It provides a detailed quantitative
plan -- the first ever that Government has assembled -- of the sector's
financial requirements, given the reforms anticipated and the expected
changes in underlying parameters such as enrollment rates and population
growth. The plan was assembled using a micro-simulation model located in
MINED's Directorate of Planning and covering the years 1989 - 2000. 6/
5/ The discussion that follows is based on Ministerio da Educacao,
Dirreccao de Planificacao: aLinhas gerais para a definicao de uma politica
educativa2, (August 1989); and "Projecto 2000', (September 1989); and
'Alternativas de finaciamento da Educacao*, (July 10, 1989).
6J Enrollments are projected by provinces, stages and grades, aiming at
achieving more balanced attendance rates, and based on regional demographic
projections. This model takes into account improvements in efficiency in
the light of a series of measures linked with the reform, and calculates
needs for teachers and classrooms according to normative ratios of
utilization of human and material resources. The results of those
projections are synthesized for the whole nation in a second model which
translates enrollment into recurrent expenses through the use of unit
costs; the budget estimates are then compared with foreseen public
resources.



- 33 -
3.06      In the working out of this development plan, MINED had to
consider what could reasonably be achieved in the time period chosen, in
light of all the many factors involved. Among the targets finally selected
were that the system should:
(i)       reach an average admission rate into primary education of
86? of the 7 year age group by the year 2000, with a much
smaller dispersion by province than in 1990;
(ii)      improve efficiency through a reduction in both repetitions
and the drop out rate;
(iii)          attain transition rates from one stage to another as
follows:
EP1 -E2       EP2 - E          ES - EPU
195          785            49 X        a4 X
20e00         65X1 X                           39 W
(iv)          increase the student/classroom ratio in order to stay
within affordable costs, as follows:
EP1          EP2           ESO         EPU
l9ow           46.3          42.2          40.1        37.3
2000            58.0         52.5          44.7        44.5
3.07     The Plan makes detailed estimates of the expenditures implied by
the program envisaged to meet these objectives. 7/ In aggregate,
including other estimates for technical and higher education, the recurrent
expenditure requirements to be supported by the Government budget
(excluding higher education) would grow from Mt 8.3 billion (constant 1987
prices) to Mt 14.1 billion in 2000 (Annex 12). This implies that, with an
4? p.a. rise in the Government's recurrent budget, the share devoted to
education would grow to 11.42, which is slightly more than the 11.2? of the
recurrent budget spent by education in 1989. 8/
3.08     As set forth in the implementation matrix (Annex 11), the
government agrees to set itself budgetary goals to be allocated to the
education sector, namely 12? of the recurrent and 6? of the investment
71 The evolution of unit costs assumes over the period the following
elements: (a) an increase in the proportion of staff teaching in two shifts
a day in EP1 from 16.3 to 39 2; (b) an increase in salaries of 0 up to
1992, of 1.5Z p.a. during the next five years, and 4? thereafter on top of
a 1? annual increment for scale promotion; (c) a slightly larger share of
the Government budget in the costs of teaching material and other goods and
services; and, (d) no modifications in administrative costs.
8/   Various simulations were tested before arriving at this target;  the
results were discussed by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of
Finance and the latter found the projection feasible and desirable.

budget, but no less than the 1989 real budget.  During negotiations, the
Goxeimment agreed to present evidence annually by March 31, that it
ccmpii.d with the agreed goals.  These annual consultations fall within the
au.cements already made under the PFP and the Third Rehabilitation Credit
(C., 2021-140Z). As MINED's plan only makes rough assumptions about the
development of the vocational/technical and higher education subsectors,
the total and intra-sectoral allocations may have to be altered when more
1    ~.ro Ge subsector plans become available.   During negotiations, the
Govkziaitent agreed to carry out two subsector studies, to discuss the higher
ecrucaticn susector study with IDA by December 31, 1992 and to discuss the
voc^ai_ona2ltechnical subsector study with IDA by December 31, 1993.  At the
morment, MlINED assumes that 75 percent of the investment budget and 70
percent of the recurrent budget of the education sector would go to primary
educae'ion. During the annual budget consultations, adjustments to the ten
year pla-n parameters could be made, especially once the two sub-sector
p'ans have been agreed on by the government.
-.C4,    Ml'NED's quantitative plan is accompanied by qualitative strategies
and p-ority action programs.  The policies, strategies and action programs
agreed on by the Government and described in summary form in the policy
matrix are discussed below.
B. Primary and Secondary Education
3.10     The Government's decision to assign high priority to strengthening
primary education, and especially to improving quality and efficiency in
primary education, is the result of, and has implications for, many
additional and more detailed considerations -- which are outlined in this
section under the following subheadings: textbooks, teachers, hours of
instruction, new initiatives to enhance effective learning, revision of
coverage goals (i.e.. enrollment targets), and issues concerning the
structure of the education system and the plans for secondary education.
3.11     Textbooks.  As of Februarv 1990, the Government had already taken
steps to alleviate the private costs of education because of the high costs
of textbooks. It kept primary textbook prices constant, abolished the
textbooks required for subjects which will no longer be taught (e.g. civic
education, Annex 13), and obtained a subsidy from SIDA to pay for printing
costs at CEGRAF. But, more significantly, SIDA made available a maximum of
SK3 million for each of the next two years to, at least, three provincial
education directorates to buy the available stock and make distribution
arrangements to make books available to EPI and EP2 school children free of
charge. In addition, working groups are reviewing the grade 1 and 2
curriculum in order to abolish workbooks for grades 1 and 2 by February
1991, and offer one textbook rather than 2 workbooks per grade. MINED will
also in 1990, with SIDA financing, carry out three studies; (a) a two year
observation study of the utilization of textbooks in the classrooms; (b) a
study of the technicalleconomic aspects of production, costs and pricing of
textbooks, and (c) an economic review of CEGRAF, the textbook printing
public enterprise. In addition, during 1991, an experiment will be carried
out to test the price sensitivity of rural populations in nine priority
districts and to test different management arrangements of the distribution
system. In February 1990, the Government introduced a book rental system



- 35 -
in the eight grade, enabling it and parents to utilize the new books for
the three year trial period, without obliging parents to pay high costs.
However, parents preferred to buy the books and the rental system had to be
abolished. Policies and practices at other ESG and the EPU level have not
changed, and parents are fully responsible for supplies and materials.
3.12     With continuing SIDA support for the primary textbook sector
virtually assured for the period 1991-1994, the Government expects to
evaluate the present policy and program, and submit to SIDA a revised
textbook policy and program by November, 1990. Such evaluation would look
into policy options already discussed by a textbook working group during
1989 (Annex 7), such as the use of durable books, rental versus sales
systems, alternative distribution systems, management of the book sector,
improvement of the quality of editing of books, possibility of converting
the public enterprises into private ones or opening the markets to other
private enterprises, as well as ways to target subsidies to alleviate high
private costs of education, e.g. subsidizing consumers through the Social
Action Fund instead of subsidizing production costs in public enterprises.
In principle, ideas such as requiring a book sector coordination unit.
providing books at symbolic prices to the targeted, rural populations,
testing use and storage problems with durable books in the present war torn
Hozambican situation, and changing the distribution system have already
gained acceptance. A point of discussion remains whether cost-recovery
should be abolished altogether or just temporarily alleviated by charging
of symbolic prices. It is expected that by 1995, the Government would have
all the elements of a new textbook policy and program tested, and it could
be applied nationwide. During negotiations, the Government agreed as a
condition of disbursement on the rehabilitation and construction of
schools, to present evidence that the financing of a text book policy and
program by SIDA has been obtained in a legally binding agreement.
3.13     Teachers: (1) Improving Quality of Teaching Process.  To improve
the quality of learning, the Government now proposes to carry out a
comprehensive priority action program aimed at improving the quality of
teaching that takes place in the classrooms. This program aims at the key
actors, the teachers, and will focus on: increasing their remuneration;
improving their general education and professional training levels;
providing them with instructional materials and techniques for dealing with
difficult situations; and providing them with regular supervision and
support. MINED is in the process of drawing up a teacher charter. This
program has several sub-programs aimed at improving: (a) quality of pre-
service training, (b) general education and professional training levels of
existing teachers; (c) regular classroom support and supervision system.
Only the pre-service training system is operational at this time, in-
service training and professional support systems are either embryonic or
have been inoperative for a while. A parallel system which could assist in
all of these tasks, distance education, is also in an embryonic state, and
will need to be developed over the next ten years.
3.14     Teachers: (2) Pre-Service Training.  By 1995, the country might
start to experience a shortage of EP1 teacher. To prevent such a situation
the training program would be cut from three to two years and the entry
level would be raised from primary to completed secondary education (9th
grade). This practice requires less instructors and classrooms at the



- 36 -
centers (CFPPs), so new buildings would not be required. 9/ At the same
time it would contribute to improving the quality of teaching by raising
the intake level and enable the training to focus on psychology, pedagogy,
methodology and use of manuals instead of on teaching secondary school
subjects. As secondary school quality increases and experience is
gathered, MINED should consider the possibility of decreasing the in-
service training to one year only. The conversion would take place over a
period of ten years and be implemented in each center after its
rehabilitation. The gradual process has the advantage that experience in
the first two centers (to be rehabilitated under the AFDB Project),
starting in 1993, can be incorporated into the others, before a nation wide
program is started.
3.15     Equally important is the program already set in motion to improve
the level of instruction in the centers. During 1990, the curriculum of
the centers will be adjusted to take into account the SNE curriculum and
all instructors will be trained in its use and its textbooks. Specific
training courses are planned for instructors in math and Portuguese. A
similar program is also needed for the institutes preparing teachers for
EP2, especially in light of the decision to change teaching in EP2 from
subject matter, requiring five teachers to serve a group of 6th and 7th
graders, to teaching of two areas (language/social science, and
math/sciences), requiring only two teachers for the same group of students.
This should have the effect of enabling the Government to open EP2 schools
in more, and especially, rural areas requiring less teacher housing etc. A
new curriculum, corresponding to the changes in entry education level, is
expected to be ready by the end of 1990, in order to train instructors at
the two AFDB financed centers in a crash program to be executed by ISP.
Definition of a general instructor upgrading program, including the
possibility of obtaining a bachelor degree in primary education at ISP, is
also under consideration, but this is not yet decided. Annex 14 depicts
the action program timetable (now no longer valid, see footnote 5).
3.16     Sufficient numbers of graduates from secondary schools will be
available to enter into teacher training, and it is also feasible to
accommodate the increase of the salary budget due to hiring of more
qualified teachers at higher initial salary levels. However, over the next
few years, too many graduates would emerge from teacher training centers
and the Government would have to modify its practice of hiring all
graduates of CFPPs and IMPs almost automatically. It has no legal
obligation to do so any longer, and it would also behoove the Government to
adjust the output, hence the intake, of teacher training centers until such
time that it is clear that either public or private expansion would absorb
the graduates. MINED intends to do so to a lesser degree than the
projection model indicates because it would like to furnish trained
teachers to the private sector if and when private sector education takes
91 However, most teacher training centers originally belonged to the
church, and in May 1990, the church requested its old infrastructure for
use in the private sector but possibly still to be used as teacher training
centers. The Government agreed to provide IDA by July 31, 1991 with an
alternative pre-service teacher training program which would take into
account the lack of public control of infrastructure.



- 37 -
off in 1991. Also, to enable the Government to receive maximum benefit
from its high investment in providing free teacher training, it would try
to enforce its own rules that only the top candidates from each graduating
class- are offered this free education. More importantly, however, a cut-
off point would be established, and candidates with graduation scores below
this point would not be allowed into the teacher training stream.
3.17     Teachers: (3) Special Program of In-Service Training to Improve
Qualifications of Existing Teachers. The Government proposes to start a
crash training program for some 600 teachers who have completed more than
primary education, but who did not undergo any formal teacher training.
Such a program, based on auto-instructional materials would focus on the
use of manuals and textbooks of the SNE curriculum and on the management of
groups in multi-grade classrooms and other problems related to management
of classrooms under deprived conditions. They would also have three short
periods of intensive residential study during 1992 and 1993.
3.18     Teachers: (4) Improving Pedagogical Support.  The Government
intends to revitalize the integrated pedagogical zones (ZIP), define its
function based on its circumstances and train the pedagogical support staff
at central, provincial, district, ZIP and school level. This cascading
program would reach schools situated in the urban centers and branch out to
some rural priority districts (Annex 15 compares priority districts and
districts slated to participate in the ZIP revitalization program). As
experience is gained and security improves other districts would be brought
in, but initially schools and ZIPs with the largest concentration of school
population would be selected. The pedagogical support staff at each level
would be trained in the curriculum and its textbooks, teaching
methodologies, school and classroom management, planning and supervision
techniques. The establishment of this pedagogical program would
temporarily preclude the establishment of an inspectorate program as the
sector's administrative capacity would be stretched too thinly. Any
flagrant abuses of the system would be reported by the district level
pedagogical staff to the provincial inspectors.
3.19     The pedagogical support system wo'.4 test the use of a systematic
in-service training system (a modified ver.ion of the training and
visitation system). As customary, school staff or staff belonging to a
ZIP, would meet each Saturday morning to plan for the next week under the
leadership of the pedagogical adjunct director or district staff. Once
every two weeks, however, the teachers would focus on a prepared topic. It
is expected that some 20 in-service training units can be covered each
year. In-service training units would focus on e.g. textbook use,
classroom management, dealing with traumatized children. -n schools
participating in the program, the roles of the pedagogical adjunct director
would be changed. Instead of teaching, this person would be a resource
person in the school. The costs of this measure are expected to be about
Mt. 150 million until 1995, more if additional schools can participate.
The role of the director of the school would also change, and special
training courses for school directors in urban areas are being tested under
the first IDA financed project in 1990. District staff would carry out
systematic visits of schools and meet with teachers and pedagogical school
or ZIP level staff on a regular basis. Provincial staff would also meet



- 38 -
regularly with district level staff. Regular training meetings would be
organized for directors and adjunct directors.
3.20     Teachers: (5) Distance Education for Continuing In-Service
TraininR. The Government has already recognized in many of its documents
how important distance education could be to help it reach its objectives.
Well established extension programs in other sectors prove this point. The
Government would like to develop the existing embryo in the form of the
Teacher Upgrading Institute into a Distance Education Institute. However,
this would truly require .a thorough and slow process of policy development
and institution building, and such an institute would not be expected to
make a significant contribution until about the year 2000. The period 1990
- 1995 would be considered a research and development phase staff training
and pilot experiences with thorough evalvitions. As a small first step,
the Government allocated a separate budF t to the existing institute for
1990, enabling it to hire about 15 staf members. SIDA support will enable
this staff to become proficient in English during 1990 and to carry out
some study visits to neighboring countries. A non-ambitious development
program with distinct steps has been outlined (Annex 16).
3.21     New Initiatives to Enhance Effective Learning: (1) Language of
Instruction. Since findings overwhelmingly indicate that it is easier to
learn to read and write in their local languages and then learn Portuguese
rather than the other way around, the Government is also anxious to
accelerate plans to offer primary courses in local languages for the first
two years with gradual shifting to Portuguese by grade 4 to 5. It has
drawn up a ten year plan to test the requirements in terms of teacher
training, development of materials and student achievement evaluation
(Annex 17). As studies in other countries have shown the positive effects
of flooding students in grades 4 and 5 with materials to read in the second
language, the Government has also agreed to carry out an experiment in
providing schools with children's literature in Portuguese. This program
would first be applied in the schools rehabilitated under the first IDA
financed project in Maputo. It would be evaltated by IND!.
3.22     New Initiatives to Enhance Effective Learning: (2) Student
Achievement Testing. In order to measure the impact of any of these
proposed quality enhancing measures, and to enable it to compare itself
with worldwide data, the Government has agreed to participate in the second
international achievement testing of the International Assessment of
Educational Progress in 1990. In 1990, Mozambique would only test a sample
of thirteen year old students in math in Beira and Maputo on the same
standardized tests that will be administered in nearly 20 countries.
However, in 1992 and 1994, the participation would increase. In 1992,
thirteen year old would be tested in math and science; in 1994, thirteen
and eight year olds would be tested in both subjects. The Government
realizes, however, that it would also have to build its own capacity to
manage such type of tests on a regular basis, and to build up feed back
mechanisms to take sRdvantage of the data. It does not yet have a plan how
to do so, but it would probably also carry out schoolsurveys in conjunction
with the student assessments.
3.23     New Initiatives to Enhance Effective Learning: (3) Student
Learning Capacity. The Ministries of Health and Education signed an



- 39 -
agreement establishing a school health commission in 1990. This
commission, already involved in one school health program in MIaputo, would
draft guidelines on priority areas.  In February 1990, the Hinistry of
Commerce started the distribution of a school snack (a high calorie/protein
bun) in Maputo (in part supported under the IDA Health and Nutrit-on
Project, Cr. 1989-MOZ). The Government intends to extend this program, if
possible even during 1990, to other cities. In the future, the Government
may also test the impact on health and scholastic achievement of providing
students with good water and sanitation facilities, and if the situation
warrants it start programs to provide students with deworming medicine as
well as iron and Vitamin A. Special programs may have to be developed for
schoolchildren in other parts of the country, e.g. where iodine
deficiencies exist. As security improves, the priority of such programs
would have to be assessed.
3.24     Revision of Coverage Goals: (i.e. Enrollment Targets).  In the
19909, the capacity of the education system is too severely stretched and
the investments necessary to expand the system to full primary coverage are
no longer feasible. Thus, the Government stated its desire to focus on
improving the quality of the current system, and to expand only at the rate
at which it can be guaranteed that quality does not suffer. This implies
that it will fall short of universal primary education by the year 2000.
Instead the country would aim for allowing 862 of all seven year olds to
enter first grade each year by the year 2000 (Annexes 12 and 18 shows the
enrollment projections at the different educational levels).
3.25     At the moment, many of those entering first grade are older than
seven, and the Government would allow ages 7 through 10 to continue
entering, slowly phasing this practice out by 1994 and emphasizing -,he
practice of admitting only seven year olds. Limited physical expansion and
rehabilitation would take place in urban areas where the classrooms are so
overrun that the system has to offer three shifts in one day to accommodate
all students, in safe rural areas (under the priority district program
(PDP)) and, once peace is secured, in rural areas that are devoid of
educational infrastructure.
3.26     Issues Concerning the Structure of the Education System arnd the
Plans for Secondary Education. During the nineties, the Government would
consolidate the National Education System (SNE), not making any major
changes in structure, continuing its introduction of the new secondary
education program and emphasizing its quality improvement. Since less than
half of the primary schools are currently offering the fifth year of Lower
primary introduced by the reform, and since only 732 of the students
currently graduating from EP1 go on to EP2, the Government has revised its
goals which are now to provide enough schools by the year 2000 so that the
current level can be maintained, which will mean that about 70Y of all
students graduating for EP1 go on to EP2.  Similarly, the Government wants
to maintain the ratio of half of all graduates of EPZ going on to secondary
schools (ESG, grades 8,9,and 10). To achieve these two goals, expansion at
EP2 and ESG levels would have to be emphasized over expansion at the EP1
level.
3.27     The Government would improve quality in the SNE by changing the
weekly schedule of subjects offered in primary as of February 1990 and



- 40 -
emphasizing more the teaching of basics such as Portuguese and mathematics
(see Annex 13 for new schedule). Annex 19 shows the timetable agreed on
for the review of the classroom practices, followed by adjustments of the
curriculum objectives, teaching materials and textbooks. SIDA has agreed
to consider funding this total program in its 1991-1994 education sector
cooperation program. In addition, in EP2 it has been decided that from
1995 on, students will be taught by two teachers rather than by subject
matter specialists since many schools could not afford this.
3.28     Similarly, as textbooks had not been prepared for the introduction
of the reform in secondary education as of February, 1990, the Government
decided to temporarily import existing Portuguese textbooks (with
supplements to cover additional Mozambican curriculum requirements) for a
three year period. While this is a costly solution to solve a problem, it
buys the Government the time to properly review these materials, compare
them with others available in the world market and prepare plans for
acquisition and/or development. The implementation schedule is in Annex 19.
Once the materials are developed, the Government proposes not to alter the
curricula for the next 5 years, until at least the year 2000.
3.29     Hours of Instruction.  The Government has decided to increase the
number of hours of instruction per year in primary education (currently
about 600 hours per year) by lengthening the school year by five weeks
(Annex 10 shows the proposed schoolyear). Since, in addition, examinations
in the lower four grades will be abolished from 1991 on, the effective net
gain will be ten weeks of instruction. Even in the three shift system in
urban areas, this will imply a net gain of 130 hours of instructional time.
For the total EP1 cycle, children would receive 675 additional hours of
instruction, which equals almost an additional school year at the present
rate. During negotiations, the Government agreed that it would present to
IDA by July 31, 1991 a satisfactory plan prepared by MINED for the
introduction of a longer school year. The Government also agreed to take
all measures necessary for implementing the longer school year by December
31, 1991, so that the new schedule could begin in 1992.
3.30     In addition, MINED will test in 1991 the effects of organizing
about 4 to 6 hours per week in extra-mural activities for children in the
three-shift system in some primary schools in Maputo. With the aid of
volunteers, programs for school gardens and, art and library activities
would be established. If parents, teachers, the volunteers and students
perceive these activities to be positive, such programs would be expanded
and a fund would be established in MINED to sponsor such activities.
3.31     No such elaborate policies and action programs have been developed
to improve the quality of secondary education. As SNE reaches the upper
grades of secondary education, many decisions still have to be made on
curriculum, testing of textbooks and materials and upgrading requirements
of present teachers. SIDA might support the textbook evaluation during the
next three years. ISP, responsible for providing pre-service training for
secondary teachers, would have to be actively involved to be able to
incorporate results of any textbook testing program. However. ISP itself
is still a rather weak institution.

C. Post-Secondary Education
3.32     Higher Education.  In 1989, the University of Eduardo Mondlane
drew from 570 graduates of EPU for its entering class. In a first draft of
its Ten Year Plan, the University has developed three hypotheses
(Annex 20). Its low hypothesis estimates that the number of EPU graduates
would continue to grow at the historical growth rate (4.7 percent per
annum) to at least 950 by the year 2000. The maximum hypothesis takes the
total number of EPU graduates projected by the MINED model, i.e. almost
2500 by the year 2000. This means that by the year 2000, between 800 and
2300 new students could enter the University and the total number of
students could be between 3400 and 8300. An intermediate hypothesis was
developed, considering full utilization of existing infrastructure and of
that of the agricultural faculty at a new campus as well as a minimum
number of 30 entrants per specialty. In that case, the University would
have a student population between 5000 and 5500, with around 4000 in Maputo
and 1200 in the branch campus for agriculture. With the maximum projected
number of entrants, the University would reach capacity between 1995 and
1997. However, with the minimum number of entrants, the University would
not reach capacity until the first decade of the next century. Assuming a
student body of 5000 to 5500 by the year 2000, the University would still
lack 950 placements in specific faculties.
3.33     Several reservations may be expressed at this early stage on this
first draft of a ten year plan:
(i)   all those who have completed secondary education are assumed to be
possible candidates for higher education and to embark on the
licenciatura courses, in or outside the University. However, the
creation of one-to-three year higher education degrees - whether
inside or outside the university - is absolutely mandatory: first,
on account of the very wide diversity of abilities shown by
secondary education graduates; and, secondly, because it is
requirement of the employment market;
(ii) drop out and completion rates are not assumed to improve
significantly. Yet, the University is about to introduce a
preparatory or remedial semester for students in all programs
rather than only in basic sciences, and at the EPU level students
have also been divided into science and humanities majors. These
measures should have some effect;
(iii) the pedagogic organization of studies, based on a 30 student
course enrolment, and the quite high number of teaching hours
foreseen (from 25 to 34 hours a week according to specialties and
levels), imply a very generous personnel/student ratio. This
ratio is most unlikely to be sustainable in view of the implied
unit costs;
(iv) the calculation of current capacity is currently based on
statements made bf each faculty. Optimal use of premises calls



- 42 -
for the utilization of every available space, irrespective of the
faculty with direct responsibility. A technical analysis of
present capacity entails a survey of all existing rooms, an
analysis of the purposes they may serve and the use of programming
techniques to assess the probable occupation rates within an
extended weekly period. This technical exercise should be
performed before providing for any extension of the
infrastructure.
3.34     The long term development of the higher education subsector
necessitates the preparation of a detailed subsector study, with specific
analysis being made of: internal efficiency; the performance of students;
the social origin of students; the ratios of utilization of personnel and
infrastructure; and, the appropriate unit costs by discipline, not only of
the University but also of the Higher Pedagogical Institute and of other
small institutes at this level managed by other sectors. The role of a
private university at the Zimbabwean border (now in the planning stage)
which would reserve 301 of its student places for Mozambicans would also
have to be taken into account. The study should use the findings of the
Training Needs Study (to be carried out by IDA and Ministry of Labor in
1990/91) on the needs of highly qualified personnel as a benchmark to
measure its external efficiency and possibly to reappraise its development
objectives. Moreover, it is recommended that a thorough review be made of
both the projection methods employed in the draft plan, and the hypotheses
underlying them, in order to find out the most cost-effective alternatives
for higher education development.
3.35     According to the University's own estimates, accommodating the
projected full utilization of campus, would demand an investment of US$32.5
million by the year 2000, of which US$19 million would need to be invested
in 1991 and 1992. Donor commitments are not systematically known.
3.36           The Fifth Party Congress emphasized the need for applied
scientific research which is relevant for the country's development needs,
and called for a profound reflection on research priorities, incentive
structures for research careers, financing, and inter-sectoral and inter-
institutional links. It also pointed to the glaring need to invest in
infrastructure (student housing, pedagogical and scientific equipment and
library facilities).
3.37     The University itself, after the production of its draft ten year
plan and donor coordination seminar documents, has also established a
number of task forces to recommend future internal policies. The following
recommendations of the task forces were endorsed by the Rector: (a) central
library facilities would not be needed, instead a documentation and
information retrieval system would be studied and established to provide
access to sectoral collections; (b) computerization of the campus would be
based on purchases of compatible micro computer systems, to be networked in
the future, rather than an upgrading or replacement of central computer
facilities; (c) an overall staff development plan would be drawn up,
emphasizing the need to train mid-level support staff, even abroad if
necessary, as well as academic staff; (d) an equipment and building
maintenance policy would be drawn up, including a plan for staff training,



_ 43 -
and (e) a master space utilization plan would be drawn up before further
investments In construction or rehabilitation are to be started.
3.38     Such a space utilization plan was drawn up for the science
programs, including the facilities already tendered with EEC financing for
the teaching of the preparatory semester. To better develop the science
and technology faculties, all four areas of basic sciences would be brought
together in the main campus; a common building for classes, laboratories,
reproduction and maintenance services to serve the unmet needs of the four
faculties would need to be constructed. This move of the Science Faculty
would enable the Faculty of Engineering to utilize available space and
accomuodate the students already in the four specializations.   Detailed
human resource development plans for the four faculties' academic and non-
academic staff are under development and would complement the investments
in hardware. A plan for the improvement of management and planning is also
under development. This plan aims to strengthen the Rector's ability to
make longer term decisions based on data and alternative projections, as
well as to make day to day decisions based on management information.
3.39     Vocational Education.  With regard to vocational education, the
MINED plan assumes and SETEP has announced its intention to provide a full
rehabilitation of existing capacity for all three levels of vocational
training, but not to expand the system at any level. If this is accepted,
it would represent a major concession politically by the Government because
there is a strong feeling among the population and many members of
government that everyone coming out of primary schools should be offered
some type of vocational training if they are not going on to secondary
school. Such training may be provided under non-formal training schemes,
for which the Ministry of Labor will shortly be made responsible rather
than SETEP. If such is the case, the rehabilitation objectives for SETEP
could easily be accommodated into the ten year plan as drawn up by MINED.
D. Nanagement, Organization and Plannina
3.40     Since December 1989, MINED has been under reorganization.  A
formal Ministerial decree on the final organization of MINED was approved
in October 1990 (Annex 21 shows the new structure). During 1991 the sector
staff will need to adjust to the new organization, new procedures (for
which staff training is to be provided during 1991 and 1992), and the
shifting and emerging power constellations within the sector (some brought
about by the reorganization, some by other changes occurring at a high rate
at the moment in the society at large). Pressures from the societal
changes could be large if peace occurs and pent up demand for education and
training emerges. MINED needs to construct longer term strategies and
contingency plans to deal with restoration of peace.
3.41     Detailed implementation plans for the five organizational
functions which were studied by organization and management consultants in
1989, were presented in February 1990. MINED decided to implement the plan
for human resource development (which will be financed by SIDA) and some of
the proposed changes in planning, financial management and control and
property management. The same management consultants will implement the
required changes in three phases and provide staff training. Financing for



- 44 -
the first implementation phase would come from the IDA financed Education
and Manpower Development Pro4ect (Cr. 1907-MOZ).  MINED dct-ded not to
implement the proposals on computerization of the Ministry until the re-
organization is completed and plans for staff training can be better
developed.
3.42     The proposed staff training and reorganization in five major
administrative processes in MINED would go a long way to strengthen the
management of MINED's routine objectives (which are large in a system with
many staff members in decentralized implementation units i.e. schools).
Its planning process, qualitatively and quantitatively, is already a model
for other countries, although it depends to a large extent of few
individuals and a broader basis in planning is foreseen by starting a
systematic, UNDP financed, ttaining program in country and abroad (e.g.
introduction of education planning in ISP curriculum, training of ISP
faculty in education planning, graduate courses for MINED planners.
provincial staff training etc). Some support exists for flexible mechanisms
to translate political and societal changes into educational objeztives and
management of such a process, which almost inevitably will demand greater
decentralization of authority to respond to local and regional
circumstances. However, concrete strategies for decentralization do not
exist.
3.43     The significant change in the Government's position on adult
education and the private sector require an indepth study to focus on the
regulations and organizational structure needed to enable the private
sector to provide high quality liLoracy training, non-formal training and
basic education. Regulations are being written.
3.44     No changes in unit costs are assumed in MINED's model.  As unit
costs of several subsystems e.g. teacher training, are very high due to
high boarding costs, it would be most important to review these and to
design alternative lower cost models.  Similarly, Jhares of the budget
going to support central provincial administration have been held constant.
It would be possible to reduce these shares when and if the
management/organization study on the MINED/Provincial organization and
management is finished and reorganized funct4ons and roles can be agreed
on. A first set of steps is outlined in the diagnosis: it requires a
better monitoring system so MINED has information on education spending of
the provinces.
3.45     Utilizing the simulation model referred to earlier, MINED's Plan
provides estimates of the budgetary needs for the expansion, rehabilitation
and maintenance of the capital stock. Although there will be an increasing
demand for the expansion of the stock, the priority over the short to
medium term is for the rehabilitation of the existing capital, which has,
in particular, suffered severely from the lack of maintenance over the



- 45 -
post-Independence period. 101 It is roughly estimated that, using the
best available unit costs, the total investment requirement between 1990
and 2000 will be nearly US$500 million, comprising US$187 million (constant
1987 prices) for capital expansion, US$212 million for rehabilitation
(including reconstruction of unsalvageable schools), and US$94 million for
maintenance. This aggregate would be equivalent to more than four times
the Government investment expenditure on education over the recent past,
when only 3 percent of its resources were designated for the sector. This
points to the importance to be given to (a) decreasing if possible the unit
costs, or increasing the financing from sources other than the government
budget going to construction, rehabilitation and maintenance; (b) designing
the most cost-efficitnt system to manage the process; and (c) introducing
into the budget a priority category for maintenance. Generally speaking,
about 2 percent of investment costs per year are ass med to be necessary to
maintain capital stock. Total estimated costs are iven in Annex 22.
3.46     Moreover, a reevaluation of the priorities within the Ministry
itself is required, with more attention being devoted to the respective
roles of the various construction units in the planning process, and to the
management, financing and implementation of the programs. The
organizational decree revises the structure of the existing school unit in
the Planning Department, giving it more management responsibility. The
organization and management consultants are assisting in designing the
internal functions and external relations of this School Construction Unit.
3.47     Government would like to encourage all training institutions (ISP,
the Mid-level Pedagogical Institutes, CFPPs, and the University) as well as
INDE and IAP to increase their research on education and on educational
administration. INDE, in fact, was left only with research
responsibilities in the recent reorganizations. Given the low present
level of research capacity, it would be better to concentrate on building
such capacity in a very limited number of institutions. INDE is already
being assisted by SIDA which is financing several studies (e.g. drop out
study, classroom observation study); the Netherlands is also discussing
assistance in developing own research capacity, especially at INDE, to
carry out school effectiveness research. There are three topics, in
particular, which the Government is anxious for its education system, with
assistance from abroad, to address:
(a)   The requirements of the Mozambican labor market in the coming
decade, 1990 to 2000, and the education and training methods which
should be adopted to fulfill the needs of the labor market;
(b)   The learning methods being used internationally which produce the
best results for students in primary school. In conjunction with
this, the Government would like help in developing a method of
101 Despite the paucity of information regarding past expenditure of the
Ministry, the education plan deals in a satisfactory way with recurrent
costs. As far as needs for infrastructure are concerned, the projection
model is able to determine the number of classrooms to be built to enable
the system to expand, and multiplies this by estimated unit costs for new
constructions:



- 46 -
evaluating its primary schools for their success in adopting
effective teaching mechanisms;
(c)   The psychological effects which the country can expect the war to
have on its children, along with the most effective ways in which
the children's trauma can be addressed within the schools.
3.48     The first topic will be addressed by the upcoming Manpower
Training Needs Study which will be completed in 1991 and financed by IDA.
The Goverrment will have a chance to address the second topic in part
through participating in the program for achievement testing with IEA, and
possibly in collaboration with the Netherlands. The third topic concerning
the psychological effects of the war on children is being examined through
a study financed by UNICEF.

IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project would support the Government's strategy in
the public sector investment program and in the education sector as
outlined in Chapters I and III, and therefore address the most pressing
needs of the education sector as discussed in Chapter II. The project
would also assist the Government in continuing the progress started under
the first Education and Manpower Development Project (Cr. 1907-MOZ) with
respect to improving the quality and efficiency of education at the primary
and university levels.
4.02      With the Government's strategy as a guide, national project
preparation teams, working since March 1989, identified action programs and
specific project objectives which would help Mozambique's educational
system advance. The teams outlined specific objectives with regard to each
over-arching goal, which reinforce one another. The project was negotiated
in Mozambique in October 1990.
A. Summary of Objectives
4.03      The project's objectives are to:
(a) improve the quality and efficiency of
primary education so that the limited amount
of funds which the Government has available
for education can be stretched further. The
project would support the improvement of
teaching process quality as well as the
introduction of new initiatives to enhance
effective learning, by:
(i) improving pre- and in-service training of teachers;
(ii) providing teachers with pedagogical support;
(iii) introducing distance education as a future means of
teacher training;
(iv) testing local language instruction, supporting
participation in international student achievement
testing, supporting the flooding of classrooms with
reading materials, testing extramural programs, and,
testing student health interventions; and,
(v)  rehabilitating and supporting limited expansion of
infrastructure in three cities, which are so overrun
with students that the system can not function
properly, even in three shifts.
(b) improve the quality and efficiency of the
University, addressing the critical areas
of the manpower shortage in Mozambique by:



- 48 -
(i) enhancing the University's capacity to develop
strategic management and long-range planning capacity;
(ii) starting a process of integration and strengthening of
the physical sciences; and,
(iii) continuing actions in the fields of engineering and
economics.
(c) improve the management of the education
sector, particularly of the subsystems
managed by MINED, by:
(i) strengthening MINED's ability to address educational
planning, and, financial monitoring and control;
(ii) supporting studies in important areas such as unit
costs, and boarding costs;
(iii) strengthening school construction capacity at the
national and provincial levels to deal, inter
alia, with the needs of reconstruction of the
education facilities in the priority districts;
(iv) strengthening the provincial and municipal school
maintenance capacity; and,
(v)  supporting efficient project management and
implementation.
4.04      In order to achieve the desired impact of improving primary
school quality, the project will provide an infusion of essential inputs
Into school buildings affected by this project and the ones already
constructed or rehabilitated under the Education and Manpower Development
Project (Cr. 1907-MOZ), as well as in the other schools in the same
districts. Consequently, teacher training, pedagogic support, quality
improvement initiatives and distance education pilot programs would first
be applied in the geographic areas where rehabilitation and construction is
taking place in this project (Maputo City, Maputo Province, Beira, Dondo,
Nacala Port and the some of the forty rural priority districts) as well as
the existing project under implementation (in Maputo city and province).
4.05      The choice of project area is based on the importance of
providing complementary social infrastructure to the investments ongoing
and planned in these cities as the ports of three important transportation
corridors. in order to ensure that skilled staff are willing to live in
Beira and Nacala, schooling for their children has to be available. The
provision of quality improvement actions in at least 34 districts
complements the Government's strategy of rapidly wanting to rehabilitate
social infrastructure in the priority districts, although not all districts
coincide (map 2). As described in Annex 15, some priority districts will
be receiving benefits from teacher training, improved pedagogical support,
distance education, local language instruction ar.d studies on the health



- 49 -
ana nutrition status of students. Some funds for physical rehabilitation
in priority districts are also included in the project.
B. Detailed Description
4.06      The project would have three principal components: (a) primary
education quality improvement; (b) university quality improvement; and, (c)
planning and management strengthening.
Primary Education Quality Improvement
4.07      This component would have three major subcomponentss (1) teacher
training; (2) new initiatives, and (3) school rehabilitation and expansion.
(1)  Teacher Training
4.08      The objectives of the program have been described in paras.
3.13-3.19. The project would support the comprehensive priority action
program aimed at improving the quality of teaching that takes place in the
classrooms, including development of textbooks, curricula and a long-term
plan for technical and vocational education. In addition, the project will
enhance teaching through working with pre-service training, in-service
training, pedagogical support and distance education.
4.09      Pre-Service Training.  The project would upgrade the quality of
pre-service training given to EPl and EP2 teachers (see para. 3.14).
First, in 1991, some 40 CFPP instructors each would receive a one month in-
service training course in teaching methodologies for Portuguese and math.
Second, further CFPP and IMP instructor training courses would be provided
as the other curriculum adaptations become available through the work of
national committees and consultants. The Department for Teacher Training
would also be equipped with audio-visual equipment and transport.
4.10      The credit would finance: (a) one month training courses for 80
participants in math or Portuguese, and for 160 participants in other
instructor upgrading courses; and, (b) equipment and vehicles for the
national directorate. UNDP would finance consultant services (8 staff-
months of local consultants for math and Portuguese in-service training
courses, and 4 staffmonths for curriculum development and subsequent
instructor training).
4.11      Inservice Training.  The project would upgrade the
qualifications of all EP1 teachers with more than 6 years of primary
education but no professional training. About 600 teachers would undergo
one year of training through auto-instructional materials and also have
three short residential courses (para 3.17). CFPP instructors would be
trained to provide this type of professional upgrading by the Central Level
Pedagogical Support Team, which itself would be trained under the project
to design in-service teacher training courses.
4.12      The credit would finance: (a) 3 staffmonths of training for the
45 CFPP instructors responsible for providing the training to teachers; (b)
2 months of training, divided in three periods of one month and two periods



- 50 -
of two weeks each, respectively, for the EP1 teachers; and (c) training
materials. UNDP would finance consultant services (0.5 staffmonths of
foreign consultants and the equivalent of 2.6 staffmonths of local
consultants to design the training).
4.13      Pedagogical Support.  The project would reinstate the system of
pedagogical support through the pedagogical zones (ZIPs) (para. 3.18).
Toward this end, a cascading training system would be designed, whereby 12
central level staff, once trained, would train 44 provincial staff, who
train 102 district staff (three from each 34 participating district), who
in turn would train 300 pedagogical adjunct directors and school directors.
The program would first be implemented in all urban districts which have
construction action and branch out to 34 districts, including rural
priority districts, with further expansion as security and funds permit
(Annex 15 lists all districts and the districts in which actions would be
implemented during the first year. The exact location of these districts
is on map 2).
4.14      Once the system is in place, a program of systematic pedagogical
training of all teachers in the 300 participating schools, covering 26
perceat of the school population, would be established on an inservice
basis. All teachers would, once every 2 weeks for a total of 20 sessions
per year, receive a training sessiou in their school or ZIP dealing with
textbook use, classroom management techniques, and how to cope with
children traumatized by the war.
4.15      The credit would finance: (a) technical assistance (one
staffmonth foreign, six local) to train 12 central level staff for three
months as well as training costs; (b) training costs of one month courses
at provincial and district level, and of two weeks courses for two people
from each school management team; (c) materials for 20 in service training
sessions per year; (d) costs of a continuous evaluation by the central
level staff; (e) provision of equipment and means of transportation for the
central, provincial and district levels. UNDP would finance consultant
services (ten staffmonths of local consultants each for three years to
prepare teacher in-service training materials).
4.16      Distance Education.  There is no existing institutional capacity
in distance education in Mozambique, which means that the project must
support an intensive institution building effort in addition to financing
pilot efforts in distance education (para. 3.20). The project would train:
(i) specialists in the field of distance education, and (ii) coordinators
at the provincial level --through the use of consultants and fellowships,
and participation in international courses and seminars. This training
would be geared towards simultaneous development of materials and
management systems while upgrading up to 3000 teachers with 4th and 5th
grade of education. In addition, the project would also support a pilot
project involving teaching through radio and correspondence to upgrade
teachers' educational level to a higher primary level and to provide
professional training. This would include rental of radio studios,
purchase of small radio receivers, and training of monitors. The impact of
this pilot project would be evaluated, and a five year plan covering the
period 1995-2000 would be presented to the Government by July 1, 1994. The
Government will present a five year plan by July 1, 1994 to IDA based on



- 51 -
satisfactory progress reports of the pilot experiment to be presented to
Government each year by March 31. In addition, as a condition of
disbursement, the Government would present a negotiated agreement on radio
studio rental at cost rather than at commercial rates.
4.17      The credit would finances (a) 20 staff months of study tours;
(b) vehicles and equipment, including audio-visual and desktop publishing
equipment; (c) materials; and (d) training of 15 monitors for a total of 3
weeks. UNDP would finance consultant services (52 staffmonths of foreign
consultants to assist in management, and specific program tasks).
(2) New Initiatives to Enhance Effective Learning
4.18      The project would support initiatives in five additional areas
aimed at enhancing effective learning in schools. These initiatives would
be meant to test, in the Mozambican context, interventions which have been
successful in other countries in improving the quality of primary education
in cost-effective ways. The project will also introduce a longer school
year for primary education.
4.19      Local Language Instruction.   The project would support the
testing of the use of local languages in primary education as a means of
facilitating the learning of reading and Portuguese language (para. 3.21).
The test would be conducted in two languages, Nyanja and Nday, which are
spoken in Monica, Sofal and Tete as well as in its neighboring countries of
Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi.    Experienced teachers (with nine years of
education and teacher training), who are native speakers of these
languages, but not familiar with their written form, would be trained in
reading and writing them. The testing would start in 1992 in one city in
each of two priority districts. INDE would take responsibility for
conducting the test, but training would be provided by NELIDO in
linguistics. INDE as well as MINED staff would be involved in the design
of in-service training strategies and materials as well as the student
materials. Experience from neighboring countries in the introduction and
use of local languages in primary education would be studied and materials
from neighboring countries would as much as possible be used without making
further adaptations. Annual evaluation meetings would take place as well
as continuous classroom evaluation to observe student and teacher reaction
to the materials and methods used. Student promotion rates would be
monitored and achievements tested to determine the effectiveness of this
intervention. NELIMO would continue its research work by mapping the
existing languages, including the dominant versions and variations across
the country, in order to determine how local languages could be introduced
on a larger scale later in the decade.
4.20      The credit would finance: (a) one year of in-service training
for 20 teachers in 1992, and 40 teachers in 1994; (b) teacher and student
materials; (c) evaluation studies; (d) 10 staffmonths of study tours for 5
people. UND? would finance consultants services (18 staffmonths of foreign
and 60 staffmonths of local consultants to assist in design, implementation
and evaluation).
4.21      Student Achievement Evaluation.  The project would assist the
Government in participating in 1992 and 1994 in the international student



- 52 -
achievement evaluations and in establishing national capacity to interpret
and manage student achievement evaluations (para. 3.22). Staff from
institutions such as MINED, INDE and ISP would be trained to incorporate
this concept and to analyze the interpretations and applications of the
data to be generated by the first test program to take place in 1990.
Staff of these institutions would participate in international workshops
and training courses, and form a technical nucleus which could manage the
future achievement testing programs of 1992 and 1994.
4.22      The credit would finance: (a) student materials for testing;
(b) 10 staffmonths of study tours; and (c) a turnkey contract for
achievement testing during 2 years with the International Assessment of
Educational Progress.
4.23      Book Flooding.  The project would test the hypothesis that
children who have abundant reading material available in Portuguese, their
second language, in grades 4 and 5 will advance more quickly and thoroughly
at a relatively low additional cost (para. 3.21). In the three cities, and
in the 34 districts as they can be incorporated, about 250 books would be
placed in each classroom, incorporated in daily teaching practices, and
made freely available for children's perusal. The impact of having such
material available would be tested and incorporated as a variable in the
design of student achievement test samples. This program might be expanded
if the results were positive and the Government presented a suitable
expansion program.
4.24      Extramural Activities.  The project would support pilot
experiments to offer extramural education activities outside of the school
so that vital short school hours can be used solely for instruction in the
fundamentals (para. 3.30). MINED would present a plan to experiment with
two extramural activities (reading and art in open air spaces close to
schools and school gardens) in a few schools in Maputo during 1991.
4.25      Student Health and Nutrition. The project would support the
development of a program for improving students' health and nutrition
status (para.3.23). The recently formed Inter-ministerial Committee
dealing with school health would develop programs in Maputo coordinating
school rehabilitation with introduction of latrines by neighborhood,
followed by testing for worms among school children, application of
deworming medicine, testing for anemia and, if required, introduction of
iron supplements for school children. In addition, the Ministry of Health
would carry out studies of school children's health and nutrition status in
some of the priority districts and the project would support appropriate,
correcting actions.
4.26      The credit would finance: (a) tests for worms and anemia; (b)
supplies needed for deworming and iron supplementation programs for, at a
maximum, all urban schools in three cities and in the participating
districts; and (c) studies on health and nutritional status.
4.27      During negotiations, the Government agreed to furnish to IDA
detailed implementation plans satisfactory to IDA for the five initiatives



- 53 -
as a condition of disbursement of credit funds for the school construction
and rehabilitation would be able to takes place.
(3) School Rehabilitation and Expansion
4.28      The project would support rehabilitation of the existing school
network at EP1, EP2 and ESG levels within Kaputo, Beira, Dondo and Nacala
and some expansion of the network, especially at the EP2 level. At the
primary level, this would include: ti) the rehabilitation of 743
classrooms, and construction of 97 new classrooms in existing EP1 and EP2
schools, all of which would substitute for current use of unsuitable
settings, such as outdoor spaces or garages; (ii) the expansion of 11
primary schools, for a total of 53 classrooms (all these schools are
projected to have over 1000 students by 1995); and (iii) the construction
of 19 new schools, 4 at EP1 and 15 at EP2 level, in the outlying areas of
Maputo, Beira and Nacala, for a total of 280 classrooms (Annex 23). Each
classroom would be equipped with student and teacher furniture, blackboard,
shelving and a storage space for books. All schools would be provided with
teachers' room and toilets, administrative and storage space, and latrines,
as well as a septic tank and water well (Annex 24). All schools would also
be provided with two globes, 5 maps and a metric set. Annex 25 shows the
detailed actions to be carried out in eacn school.
4.29      At the lower secondary level, 125 classrooms would be repaired
in the six existing secondary schools, four in Maputo, and one each in
Dondo and Beira. In the secondary schools, the appropriate furniture as
well as library books and equipment for four laboratories would also be
provided. FINNIDA has included the rehabilitation of eight secondary
classrooms in Nacala under its Nacala Urban Rehabilitation Project, to be
implemented by the Ministry of Public Administration and the municipal
authorities. Annex 25 lists the schools to be rehabilitated.
4.30      In physical terms, the impact of the rehabilitation and
construction program is significant (Annex 26) and covers 44 percent of the
required classrooms in the three urban areas by 1993. In these three urban
areas, the schools would accommodate 35 percent and 63 percent,
respectively, of the projected EP1 and EP2 population (Annex 27). However,
it would cover only 5 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of the
projected national primary school population in EPI and EP2 for the year
1995. By situating the new schools in outlying areas, the project would
also help promote equity in that the refugee populations at the edges of
the major population centers often lack access to educational services at
all and certainly to complete primary education.
4.31      The credit would finance: (a) civil work contracts for
construction of the new schools and classrooms and repairs for existing
classrooms; (b) furniture for students, classrooms and schools, and school
supplies; (c) equipment for laboratories for lower secondary schools; and
(d) architectural and supervision services.
University Quality Improvement
4.32      The project would support the Government's efforts to meet
essential manpower requirements by strengthening the quality and relevance



- 54 -
of training at the University in three major areas, and by laying the
foundation for the development of a strategic and efficient planning and
management process at the University.
4.33      Strategic Management Development.  The project would support an
action program drawn up by the University to strengthen its central level
planning and decision making capabilities. Four areas would be emphasizeds
(a) improving planning and decision-making by (i) developing an information
system to support decision makers, establishing an organizational structure
(with staff training) and defining its relationship with other advisory
organs of the University; (ii) modernizing the computerized academic
registration management system and making available data sets compatible
with each other; (iii) studying alternative solutions to transportation
problems on campus, for staff and students; (iv) studying the issues
surrounding student housing, their management, costs and financing; (b)
proposing alternative solutions to renovate the libraries and establish a
scientific, technical and humanities info,mation system; (c) developing a
comprehensive computerization policy and program, including a material and
human resource development plan; (d) completing studies to develop detailed
programs for maintenance of laboratories and physical plant, including
methodologies, costs and training programs for middle and lower level
staff; and (e) a long-term plan for higher education.
4.34      The studies on the decision-making structure, computerization
policy and computerization of student registration are to be carried out
during 1991. In addition, the University is drawing up a comprehensive
mnpower development plan for academic, management and middle level staff,
including the use of foreign study opportunities, and developing a
comprehensive space utilization plan. Both will be completed by the end of
1990.
4.35      The credit would finance: (a) office equipment and a computer;
(b) software and books; (c) one vehicle, and (d) 4 months of study tours.
uNDP would finance consultant services (15 staffmonths of foreign technical
assistance).
4.36      Faculty of Economics.  This component would continue the actions
already started under the first project, namely to strengthen the
curriculum and upgrade the academic qualifications of national teaching
staff at the Faculty of Economics. Ongoing support is specifically needed
in the fields of development economics, African economics, development
sociology, political economics, macroeconomics, and methods of economic
research, and in providing in-service training sessions for the faculty
through a series of seminars. In addition, the Faculty has grown so much
in the last few years, that it has started operating in two shifts and
lacks sufficient furniture for its 700 students, and its services are
overstretched. The project would support the acquisition of furniture, as
well as of a minibus for student transport on field visits, and of
sufficient print and photocopier equipment to enable the Faculty to operate
smoothly with this second shift.
4.37      The credit would finance: (a) three doctoral fellowships for
promising national teaching staff who would take up responsibility for
teaching in disciplines covered by foreigners until now; (b) books,



- 55 -
software for the library; (c) furniture, equipment and materials; and (d)
one minibus. UNDP would finance consultant services (60 staffmonths of
foreign technical assistance for development of curricular modules and 15
staffmonths of foreign technical assistance to provide faculty upgrading
seminars).
4.38      Faculty of Engineering.  As above, the project would continue
the support already started under the first project, namely to enable the
Faculty to switch to more practical training through the equipping of basic
laboratories in applied thermodynamics, basic electrical engineering, and
electric machines. Installation of these laboratories would require the
addition of a second floor over the Mechanical Engineering Department. The
project would also provide continued support for (i) the acquisition of
equipment for the electronics laboratories for which there were not
sufficient funds in the first project; (ii) materials for the mechanical
workshops, and (iii) computer hardware and software. In addition, the
project would support the Faculty by enabling it to hire short-term
technical assistance for: definition of equipment needs; integration of new
equipment in study program; and, training in operation and maintenance of
equipment. The project would also provide funds for short-term
scholarships independently from donor offers.
4.39      The credit would finance: (a) site development and civil works;
(b) professional fees; (c) furniture; and (d) equipment for the three
laboratories. In addition, the credit would finance: (a) computer software
and hardware; (b) equipment for electronics laboratory; (c) materials for
mechanical workshops; (d) 8.5 staff months of foreign technical assistance;
and (e) 32 staffmonths of scholarships.
4.40      Faculties of Basic Sciences.  This component would provide
support for the gradual integration of the current three faculties of basic
sciences (Sciences, Math and Biology), and the remedial first semester
program. It would support their physical integration in one corner of the
main campus by allowing Sciences to move away from Engineering and Biology
to move away from Agriculture; and by providing them with common facilities
for classrooms, storage, print and duplication services, maintenance
services, cafeteria, library, and laboratories. Professional staff
development for academic staff is already being supported by many donors.
Training for middle level technicians and for maintenance staff might be
financed by the Netherlands and/or the Gulbenkian Foundation. A permanent
consultation process between the three faculties has been established by
organizing a committee of the three heads of the faculties to exchange
information, improve research and to a certain extent integrate the three
existing faculties.  Before negotiations, the Government submitted aplan
for human resource development in the basic sciences satisfactory to IDA
which will be incorporated into overall HRD plans for the University.
4.41      The credit would finance: (a) site development and civil works;
(b) professional fees; (c) furniture; (d) equipment for laboratories; (e)
print and photocopying equipment; (f) materials, books for 1ibraries of
math, science and biology, software; (g) vehicles.

4.42      MINED Planning and Financial Management.  Significant progress
is being made in the first Education and Manpower Development Project in
strengthening educational planning in Mozambique. The second project would
strive to further advance the country's educational planning, with
particular regard to financial, administrative and personnel management.
It would also aim to improve the working conditions in these three areas,
as well as to improve the use of data and data management systems through
the use of short-term foreign consultants as advisors. Specifically the
project would support the action program proposed by the organization
management consultants reviewing the systems and training in planning,
budget, financial monitoring and control, procurement and property
management. The first phase of this project would be supported under the
first project, subsequent phases under this one. In parallel, SIDA will
finance the human resource management action program over the next two
years.
4.43      The project would support two courses for a total of 45
participants from the central and provincial levels. These courses would
be on: (a) design, monitoring and evaluation of (internationally financed)
projects and (b) education planning techniques. In addition to these
courses, the project would fund eight study trips for course participants
in these areas, as well as the purchase of necessary equipment, materials
and vehicles at the national and provincial levels. In parallel, UNDP is
financing training in educational planning through the International
Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP). This would include short-term
training for 15 participants in country, master's degree training for 7
participants, and scholarships to participate in IIEP's normal one year
courses for 4 persons. Technical assistance in the form of consultants and
materials would also be provided to ISP to prepare education planning
courses.
4.44      The project would also support the Department of Planning in
carrying out several studies, designed to improve knowledge about the
causes of the high unit costs observed and options for addressing this
problem. Two such studies have been identified, and funds for a third
would be made available under the credit for, for example, developing
private sector regulations. One study would look into unit costs of
boarding, the alternatives of operating and managing boarding systems, and
especially at the appropriateness of providing totally free boarding to
teacher training students. The other study would assist the Government in
reviewing its administrative costs, which are unusually high if central and
provincial levels are combined, and consist mostly of personnel costs.
Case studies for both these studies would be carried out by the trainees in
the IIEP program. The phases of the second study would include an
inventory of existing staff on the payroll, matching of MINED, MINFIN and
provincial data on staff employed, and establishment of a personnel data
system. Once the baseline data are collected, the study should. present
recommendations on the appropriate actions to be taken with regard to roles
and functions of central and provincial staff.
4.45      The credit would finance: (a) management consultant contract to
provide technical assistance and training amounting to the equivalent of



- 57 -
46.7 staffmonths of foreign consultants; (b) six staffmonths of foreign
consultants as advisors on improving systems and processes; (c) 3.5
staffmonths of foreign and 22 staffmonths of local consultants to design
and give the courses; (d) 8 staffmonths of study tours; (e) equipment,
vehicles and materials; and (f) funds to print the annual statistical
yearbook and studies.
4.46      School Construction Unit (Reparticao) and Rural Reconstruction
Program. The project would support the institutional development of a
national school construction capacity. A new unit in MINED has been set up
within the Department of Planning, but the exact internal organization and
its relationship with other entities responsible for construction would be
recommended by the managementlorganization consultants working with MINED.
The new unit would be responsible for: (a) updating the inventory and
cadaster of existing schools and assisting with the school mapping; (b)
preparing a plan for and supervising implementation of the rural
reconstruction program, to be implemented first in the forty priority
districts; and (c) developing and establishing technical procedures and
systems applicable to schools at different levels of education, and for
contracting and supervision procedures. During negotiations, the
Government agreed to provide a plan, satisfactory to IDA, on the
organization of the school construction unit by June 30, 1992.
4.47      The project would assist the unit's development by financing
national and international consultants to help develop adequate procedures
and systems. Some consultants would fill in for staff that is at present
non-existent or studying and who often leave after their studies because
salaries paid in MINED are lower than those received by similar
professionals in the public construction sector, let alone in the emerging
private sector. During negotiations, the Government agreed to a revision
of salary scales for this stream of *achnical personnel by June 30, 1992
4.48      As security permits, a rural teconstruction pilot program would
be supported in the priority districts. Some schools in Xai-Xai have been
built by communities for US$100 per square meter under an ongoing program
with UNICEF assistance. Another pilot system, which uses civil works
extension workers who would motivate communities to reconstruct school
buildings using local materials and providing them with essential imported
materials, would be tested with SIDA financing during 1990. UNEP has also
drawn up plans for the use of low cost local construction materials, and
other districts have already implemented reconstruction programs. The
project would support the evaluation of all pilot schemes, and the
development of a replicable rural (re)construction program for schools.
The exact process that would be tested out would likely be some form of
training of local staff, acquisition of tools and of local and imported
building materials will be included. In the two priority districts of
Montepuez and Hemoine, the exact Xai-Xai experience linking the teacher
training college to the rural construction effort could be replicated. The
constant assessment of the impact of such a program and its unit costs
would also be included. The management of this pilot program would be with
the 'national directorates for school construction, but implementation
would be the responsibility of the provincial directorates and districts,
where the pilot program would opertte. Special attention would be given to



- 58 -
setting up monitoring and evaluation criteria, including requiring some
form of participant evaluation.
4.49      The credit would finances (a) tools, means of transportation
(vehicles. motorcycles and bicycles); (b) local and imported building
materials; and (c) operating costs. UNDP would finance five UN Volunteers,
three for the school construction department (if appropriate local
consultants can not be found), and, two to deal with the rural
reconstruction program as well as 83.5 staffmonths of local consultants for
both programs.
4.50      School Maintenance.  The project would continue the acticns
started under the first project in building up local and provincial
capacity to carry out preventive maintenance on new school building and
rehabilitation of existing ones. The model being tested in Maputo, with a
provincial (or municipal) unit responsible for maintenance which uses
worker brigades, would be replicated in the cities of Beira/Dondo and in
Nacala. The worker brigade in Nacala would fall under the jurisdiction of
the provincial unit already in existence in Nampula, the provincial
capital. The project would support: all costs of management and operation
of the brigades in the three cities; acquisition of vehicles and equipment
for the two units to be established; and materials.   Special attention
would need to be paid to the salary scale used to employ brigade workers
and other staff in this maintenance field to make it attractive. This
salary issue would be included in the revision to be agreed upon
(para. 4.47).
4.51      The project would also support all the maintenance costs for the
new capital stock created under this project and others 11/, calculated
at 1Z of the new value per year. The estimated costs of proper maintenance
of new and newly rehabilitated schools is given in Annex 28.
4.52      The credit would finance: (a) vehicles and equipment for the
maintenance units in Nacala and Beira; (b) operational costs of vehicles
and equipment of maintenance units of Maputo, Beira and Nacala; (c) 10O2 of
the maintenance budget for all rehabilitated and newly constructed
classrooms in durirng the period 1991 to 1995, with the exception of those
financed under Cr. 1907, and up to a maximum of 300 classrooms in 1991;
800 classrooms in 1992; 1300 in 1993; and 1800 classrooms in 1994 and 1995,
declining to O in 1996. UNDP would finance one UN Volunteer to work with
each brigade for a period of five years.
4.53      Proiect Manaaement  In order to ensure that this and future
education projects are well prepared, implemented and monitored, the
project would support strengthening of project management. In particular,
for the Project Management Unit responsible for preparation and
implementation of projects funded by AFDB and World Bank (GEPE), the
project would support consultants, study trips, equipment, vehicles and
11/ But excluding schools being constructed or rehabilitated under
Education and Manpower Development (Cr. 1907-MOZ), as the Government has
already legally agreed to finance maintenance for those classrooms from
1990 on.



- 59 -
operational costs. GEPE is responsible for monitoring procurement,
accounting, disbursements and reporting activities and as such coordinates
the implementation of different project components. Even with salary
suppIements being paid under the first project, GEPE has not been able to
attract highly experienced staff and it would need to be suppurted by short
and long term consultants to provide training and technical assistance.
Strengthening of management capacity for each component has been included
in the components.
4.54      The credit would finances (a) two foreign consultants for eight
months per year; (b) supplies; (c) four staff months of study tours; Cd)
vehicles; (e) vehicle and equipment operation; and (f) studies: annual
audits, and future project preparation. UNDP would finance consultant
services (seven local consultants to complement staff).

V. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, NANAGDEKNT AND IMPLEMENTATION.
A. Cost of the Proiect
5.01     Summary of Project Costs.  Project costs are estimated at Mt.63.2
billion or US$ 67.9 million equivalent and include construction, site
development and professional services for new buildings; rehabilitation of
existing facilities; provision of furniture, equipment and vehicles;
supplies and materials; foreign and local specialist services; per diem and
local trips for training courses, studies, study tours and fellowships;
indirect taxes, and incremental recurrent costs for the project items shown
in Table 5.1 and further detailed in Annex 29. Financing of the SNE
consolidation and provision of textbooks a d teacher guides by SIDA, while
not reflected in this table as it has not been finalized, is of utmost
importance. This financing would probably be in the order of about US$12
to US$15 million over the period 1991 to 1994, SIDA's next programming
cycle, and an additional US$ 5 million in 1995, if SIDA decided to continue
its support for textbooks at primary and secondary level. The table does
include the financing by UNDP of foreign and local technical assistance to
an estimated total of US$ 4.8 million.
5.02     Basis of Cost Estimates.  Except for local salaries, all project
costs shown were estimated in US$ terms and converted to meticais using the
official exchange rate prevailing at the time of negotiations, October
1990: US$l - 930 meticais. Costs of the construction and rehabilitation of
primary schools and the University are based on reviews of contracts
recently awarded in 1989 for comparable facilities financed under Education
and Manpower Development P-o1ect (Cr. 1907-MOZ). Furniture costs are based
on existing, priced furniture lists and amount to 9 percent of the cost of
new construction. Equipment costs have been estimated on the basis of
existing equipment lists and specifications for about 80 percent of the
items to be procured. For the remainder of the components, equipment costs
have been calculated on the basis of mission estimates. Technical
assistance costs - US$ 12,0CO per staffmonth of specialist services and US$
4,500 for fellowships training - have been estimated on the basis of recent
prices for comparable technical assistance in the Education and Manpower
Development Protect (Cr.1907-MOZ). The staffmonth costs of specialists
include housing, relocation costs, salaries, subsistence, office services,
fees, overheads and recruitment costs. However, for the foreign technical
assistance financed by UNDP, UNDP norms have been used, namely US$10,200
per month for short term assistance, US$8000 per month for long term
technical assistance, and US$1,750 per month for UN volunteers. Base cost
estimates reflect prices as projected at the time of negotiations.

a/ Includes US$4.9 million in taxes and duties.



- 62 -
5.03     Customs Duties and Taxes.  Project costs include an estimated
US$4.9 million in indirect taxes on locally procured civil works and goods.
Since 1989 all equipment and goods imported directly for use by Government
ministries have been subject to duties and taxes; these taxes and duties
are not normally included in the cost of items, but have to be paid by the
buyer separately. Annex 30 shows the taxes included in the base costs and
the duties and taxes levied by category of expenditure. This implies that
the Government, in addition to its contribution to the project costs, would
have to set aside a total amount of US$ 11.8 million in duties and taxes
(Annex 31), or about US$ 2 million per year, which it has to make available
to the education sector in order to be paid back into general revenues.
These duties and taxes have not been included in total project costs. If
they were, total costs would be artificially inflated, and the Government's
contribution would seem much higher than in reality would be the case
because a contribution to taxes and duties is not cumulative, but rather a
rotating use of funds.
5.04     Contingency Allowances.  Project costs include a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions (U$ 5.0 million or 11 percent
of base cost), equal to 5 percent of the estimated costs of equipment,
vehicles, supplies and materials; 10 percent of the estimated cost of
construction and rehabilitation, architectural fees, and furniture; and, 20
percent of the estimated costs of technical assistance, training, studies,
and fellowships. Price contingencies between negotiations (October 1990)
and the end of project implementation are estimated at US$ 16.1 million
equivalent, or 31 percent of base cost plus physical contingencies. Total
contingencies represent 45 percent of the base cost. Annual rates of price
increases have been applied to both local and foreign costs and for all
categories in US$ terms at 8.7 percent for 1991, and 7.5 percent
thereafter. Local price contingencies are estimated at 16 percent for
1991, and 12 percent for 1992, and 10 percent thereafter.
5.05     Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component was
estimated as follows: (a) construction and refurbishment of existing
facilities, local trips, rent, building and equipment operation and
maintenance, operating expenses - 60 percent; (b) furniture - 30 percent ;
(c) equipment, vehicles, studies, foreign technical assistance, study
trips, fellowships, vehicle operation and maintenance, supplies and
materials - 95 percent; (d) architectural fees,local technical assistance,
per diems, salaries - 20 percent. These percentages have been determined
by: (a) estimating the indirect foreign exchange of construction and
furniture; and, (b) assuming that all equipment would be ifrrted.
Including contingencies, the resulting foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$ 38 million, or about 56 percent of total costs.
5.06     Unit Costs  The baseline school construction costs are based on
space standards developed by the Ministries of Education and Construction
and Works, and are those being applied under the Education and Manpower
Development Proiect (Cr. 1907- MOZ). They amount to an average of US$ 197
per m2 (including circulation and walls). The unit costs per gross
classroom in US$ (including the administration areas, services,
circulation, walls and site development) are as follows:

New construction
primary           27,000         29,700          32,400
Rehabilitation

secondary          6,300          9,800           10,700
Construction costs for the Faculty of Engineering are estimated at USS 280
per square meter, the same as the ones currently being used under Cr.1907-
Moz. Construction costs for the new science faculty are estimated at US$
350 per square meter, with additional site development estimated at US$50
per square meter, professional fees at 10 percent and unit costs for the
rehabilitation of the biology and math buildings are estimated at US$100
per square meter. Professional fees were estimated at 4 percent of new
construction costs at primary level, at 9 percent of the rehabilitation
costs of primary and at 10 percent of the new construction costs in the
case of secondary school rehabilitation.
5.07     Vehicles.  Annex 32 shows the detailed list of vehicles to be
acquired by implementation unit and the maintenance costs supported by the
credit.  To the extent possible, bicycles have been introduced to reduce
maintenance costs and decrease dependence on imported materials. Other IDA
supported projects are supporting the Government in establishing capacity
to repair and maintain bicycles and to construct appropriate urban
transportation infrastructure in Maputo and Beira. Therefore, use of
bicycles would become more appropriate.
5.08     Recurrent Costs.  Under the proposed project additional recurrent
costs for MINED would be generated by: (a) recruitment of additional
teachers in new primary school classrooms; (b) recruitment of additional
teachers to replace the pedagogical adjunct director in, maximally, 300
primary schools and during the training of teachers in local languages; (c)
additional staff to implement the distance education, rural reconstruction,
and other pilot programs when and if they are pursued. In addition, the
Government would add to its budget the salaries of the rehabilitation and
maintenance brigades of Beira/Dondo and Nacala, as well as a budget line
equal to 1 percent of the new construction costs for maintenance of new and
rehabilitated schools from 1996 onward. The total additional recurrent
(base) costs generated by these items would be about US$ 784,000, of which
US$424,000 is for maintenance and US$360,000 for additional salaries (Annex
33). In Meticais this represents Mt 745 million in 1996 (in 1990 constant
prices). This sum represents 3 percent of MINEDs recurrent budget in 1989
(Mt.24,856 million). The estimated amount is within the budget parameters
for growth of the recurrent budget according to the projection model (which
does not assume that maintenance costs are in the recurrent budget, but
rather maintains the practice of allocating maintenance costs to the
investment budget).   The project would also include studies which would
have the objective of analyzing alternatives in areas with high recurrent
unit costs (teacher training boarding, administrative costs, rural
construction) in order to identify cost saving options.
5.09     Recurrent costs at the University would also increase, because the
University intends to: (a) hire additional staff to operate and maintain



- 64 -
the laboratories, workshops, computers and buildings; and, (b) establish a
building and equipment maintenance routine. Incremental recurrent costs
for the University would amount to US$60,000 in 1996 (Annex 33), of which
US$42,000 for maintenance and US$18,000 for incremental salaries. These
amounts are also very small compared to present budgets.
5.10     During negotiations, the Government agreed to include in its
budget, from 1993 on, the amounts needed to maintain the newly constructed
or rehabilitated infrastructure at the university, and from 1996 on, the
amounts needed to maintain the newly constructed or rehabilitated primary
and secondary schools.
B. Proiect Financing
5.11     The proposed IDA credit of SDR 38.7 million (or US$ 53.7 million)
would finance 90 percent c.f the foreign exchange component and 80 percent
of the local costs of the project. Foreign and local technical assistance
would be financed by UNDP to an estimated US$ 4.8 million. The Government
would finance US$ 9.4 million in taxes, and recurrent costs in the form of
incremental salaries and maintenance at the University. However, during
negotiations, the Government agreed to provide evidence to IDA on an annual
basis, by March 31, that it has taken steps to reduce the existing salary
budget in MINED and the University to the equivalent of the incremental
salaries, so the total salary bill is not increased due to this project.
Project financing would be in accordance with Table 5.2.

C. Management and Implementation.
5.12     Management Structure.  The proposed project would be implemented
by the University's Rectoria and faculties and by MINED's line agencies in
charge of main activities. The Director of the Educational Projects
Management Unit (GEPE), which was first established for the preparation of
the AFDB project (as PROFORMA) and manages the Education and Manpower
Development Proiect (Cr.1907-Moz), would have the overall responsibility
for coordinating and supervising project implementation. The director of
GEPE is directly responsible to the Minister of Education, and would serve
as liaison between MINED, the University, the various project implementing
institutions, the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Mozambique and IDA. He
will meet regularly with the implementing agencies and will monitor
progress, keep project accounts and prepare reports required by the
Government and IDA. The Director would also be responsible for the



- 65 -
reorganization of GEPE with the advent of a third project to manage. As a
condition of Board presentation, the Government agreed to present the
Ministerial Decree announcing the reorganization of GEPE. The proposed
internal organization of GEPE is shown in Annex 34.
5.13     The reorganized GEPE would be staffed by a director, three
coordinators (each responsible for a project), an accountant with
assistants for each project and one for handling UNDP accounting
procedures, procurement and construction supervisors. As in the past
project, the functions of GEPE would primarily be those of coordinating the
work of implementing agencies, but as neither the MINED or provincial
authorities have school contruction agencies, GEPE would still take an
active role in the civil works implementation, being directly involved in
the approval of designs, contracts and supervision of works. During
negotiations, the Government agreed to provide proof, as a condition of
credit effectiveness, that GEPE had filled the following positions to IDA's
satisfaction: (a) director: (b) two Project Coordinators; (c) Chief of
Finance and Importation Department, and (d) Chief of the Construction
Department.
5.14     Implementation.  Responsibilities for implementing the .echnical
components would be divided as follows: The Directorate for Studies and
Projects of the University Eduardo Mondlane would be responsible for
coordinating the four university components, and implementing the planning
and management component. Within the University, the faculties of
engineering and economics would be given responsibility to deal directly
with GEPE on implementation matters, but the science faculties have formed
a coordinating committee consisting of the deans to manage the project.
5.15     Before negotiations, the Government presented the legal proof that
MINED's reorganization has been finalized and sanctioned.  Based on the
Ministerial Diploma of October 1990, components will be implemented by the
following units. The Department of Planning (DP) has the overall
coordination responsibility for MINED's components and would be responsible
for the activities under the planning and management improvement component.
The work of the organization and management consultants would deal with the
Departments of Personnel Management, and Finance and Administration, but
coordinated by the DP. The DP would also be responsible for organizing the
training, and carrying out of studies, which could be subcontracted. The
National Directorate of Primary Education would be responsible for
implementing the pre-service and upgrading training; the department of
pedagogical support within this Directorate for the pedagogical support and
systematic in-service training program; and, IAP for the development of
distance education.
5.16     The quality enhancing initiatives all have multiple implementing
agencies, because their experimental nature draws on the resources of more
than one agency, which in turn stand to learn from the results of these
initiatives. INDE, assisted by NELIMO and in coordination with the
National Directorate for Primary Education would be responsible for the
introduction and evaluation of local languages. INDE, IPS, and the
National Directorate for Primary Education would jointly be responsible for
utilizing the results of student achievement testing and introducing any
changes into the primary curriculum based on the results, if so warranted.



- 66 -
Within the National Directorate for Primary Education, the Documentation
Center would be responsible for managing the book flooding program (but
could ask DINAME to help secure the distribution of books and INDE to
evaluate the initiative), and the extramural reading and arts program.
Within the same National Directorate, the Unit for Practical Activities
would manage the school garden initiative. MINED's Department for Social
Action, in coordination with the Inter-ministerial Committee on School
Health, would monitor the school health and nutrition program and would
joimtly with the National Physical Planning Institute draw up a plan for
parallel introduction of latrines in neighborhoods and schools. It would
also follow up with the Ministry of Health on starting the school child
health and nutrition studies in priority districts.
5.17     Responsibilities for school construction and maintenance would
have to be carried out by multiple agencies. At the national level, the
management and organization consultants have presented several options of
handling the functions and the advantages and disadvantages of each would
be studied indepth during 1990. The national school construction unit,
which already exists under the DP, would be responsible for preparing norms
and prototype design criteria, norms for monitoring construction programs,
supervision procedures, training of staff, establishment of cadastre etc.
It would continue to have direct responsibility for implementing smaller
construction programs (NGO, emergency program, rehabilitation of individual
schools etc.) and it would become fully responsible for establishing the
coordination of the rural reconstruction program in priority districts.
GEPE would still take full responsibility for implementing the construction
and rehabilitation process (through consultants and contractors).
5.18     School rehabilitation and maintenance would be carried out in
coordination with the provincial education directorates. In Maputo and
Nampula maintenance units (GATECEs) have already been formed; in the
province of Sofala (to deal with Beira and Dondo), such a unit would have
to be formed. During negotiations, the Government agreed to take all
necessary measures to establish a school maintenance agency in the Province
of Sofala, and to provide it with its own budget line by December 31, 1991.
Similarly, the Government would be asked to agree to provide the school
maintenance agency in the Province of Nampula with its own budget line by
December 31, 1991 (Maputo already has an agency and budget). The GATECEs
would employ their own brigades for part of the work and contract for the
rest. GEPE would assist with tender documents, contracting and supervision
of works through consultants and contractors. The provincial directorates
with assistance from the national level would also be responsible for
preparation of equipment layouts (in lower secondary schools) and arrange
for the necessary modifications to existing structures. Equipment lists
for the university faculties would have to be prepared by the faculties
with the assistance of consultants.
5.19     GEPE is staffed by 2 procurement professionals and would be
responsible for procurement under the project. During 1989 it handled
about US$ 6 million worth of local and foreign construction and equipment
contracts from the drafting stage of tender documents to final distribution
and settlement of contractual disputes. The experience acquired with
procurement and ICB under Bank rules was valuable, but showed that this
task took too much time of the GEPE director. By hiring an experienced



- 67 -
staff member, and retaining a lawyer on part time basis, processing will
become standardized. GEPE is currently acquiring a minicomputer and
industrial copier to assist its staff in processing procurement more
efficiently. Once this system is operational, its capacity to process
contracts, tender documents and evaluate bids is expected to increase
sharply.
5.20     Architectural Desian Services.  As a continuation of the practice
under the Education and Manpower Development Project (Cr. 1907-Moz), these
services would be acquired from consultants. Acquisition of such services
would be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency, dated August 1981. Standard designs for urban primary schools
already exist from the ongoing project; designs for the rehabilitation of
secondary schools exist in the School Construction Unit.
5.21     Site Acquisition.  All school sites have been visited by teams of
the school construction unit and the provincial and local authorities. No
problems have been identified with regard to sites for rehabilitation in
Maputo, or in the cities of Beira/Dondo and Nacala. Nineteen new sites
have been acquired. The University owns the site of the newly to be
constructed science building as it will be within its main campus.
5.22     Technical Assistance.  Technical assistance requirements for this
project have been carefully designed to take into account high costs of
consultants, the small number of local counterpart staff available to work
with internationally recruited consultants, as well as the housing shortage
in the city of Maputo. Annex 35 shows the technical assistance requirements
and financing arrangements. UNDP would finance the bulk of foreign and
local technical assistance. For each technical assistance position, the
Government is in the process of identifying a suitable counterpart, drawing
up detailed, terms of reference for the technical assistance positions and
Mozambican counterpart positions. The consultants would be selected in
accordance with principles and procedures acceptable to the Bank on the
basis of the 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency.' During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances that by December 31, 1991, consultants
contracting arrangements for the first year of project implementation would
be finalized, whether financed under UNDP or hired directly. GEPE would be
responsible for the management of housing of consultants not financed by
UNDP using the houses financed under the Education and Manpower Development
Project (expected to be completed by July, 1991).
5.23     Fellowships.  Fellowships and study tours would contribute to
improved understanding of experiences elsewhere in improvement of quaiity
of primary education, management and financing of education systems,
management of projects, and state of the art in academia. Selection of
candidates for fellowships would be made by the implementing institutions,
which would also prepare detailed terms of reference for each study tour
and fellowship. Additional information is on study tours and fellowships
is found in Annex 36.
5.24     Proiect Implementation Schedule  Implementation is expected to
take six years, starting in March, 1991. Project completion would be



- 68 -
October 31, 1996 and the Closing Date would be May 31, 1997. An
implementation schedule showing implementation activities for these five
years is shown in Annex 37.
5.25     Project Implementation Review and Project Evaluation.  Annually,
GEPE would be responsible for the preparation of an evaluation report on
project activities. As it is important to have baseline data on the status
of certain interventions before project activities commence, GEPE would
commission the compilation of a baseline report based on existing data and
some survey work. Annual evaluation reports would also need inputs from
the implementing agencies, and at times from independent researchers.
These reports would be discussed with IDA in an annual project
implementation review meeting to be held every year in October (coinciding
with the review meeting for the first project). Annex 38 presents the
supervision plan agreed on during appraisal with the required inputs of IDA
staff resources. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that
it would conduct jointly with IDA a project implementation review, not
later than October 31 of each year, in order to: (a) discuss the annual
evaluation reports prepared by GEPE: (b) monitor progress in achieving
project objectives; (c) identify implementation issues and proposed
solutions; (d) promote exchange of ideas among staff involved in project
implementation; and (e) update project timetables, cost estimates and
budget requirements.
5.26     Present Status of Preparation.  The project was prepared by
national working groups appointed by the Government with the occasional
assistance of consultants. At negotiations, a list of preparatory
activities which need to be finalized was drawn up. This list includes:
(a)   topographic site surveys for preparation of rehabilitation plans
per school;
sb)   consultant services to assist in implementation of several studies
at the University; and,
(c)   consultant services to train central level pedagogical support
staff.
These activities could be financed under the preparation funds of the
Education and Manpower Development ProLect (Cr. 1907-MOZ).
5.27     The project is in a state of preparation that would permit timely
implementation because: (a) the process of awarding of contracts for
primary school construction has been tested and draft tender documents have
been approved by the Bank; tb) about 80 percent of all equipment lists with
bid specifications have been completed; and (c) 80 percent of the technical
assistance package has been fully defined and, draft terms of reference are
under preparation or already prepared; (d) consultant services have been
contracted for an architectural firm for: rehabilitation plans per school;
for the preparation of design of buildings for the integrated schience
complex on the University campus: and, for management and planning studies
at the university.



- 69 -
5.28     One remaining obstacle to prompt initiation of project activities
is that 31 families, including 5 businesses, are currently living on some
of the sites designated for school construction (20 in Maputo, 8 in Beira,
and 3 in Dondo). The Government needs to resettle these families before
construction can take place. Under the Education and Manpower Development
Project (Cr. 1907-Moz) the Government has carried out the plan submitted to
IDA in a satisfactory manner. Similarly, the Government presented a plan
satisfactory to IDA for the families on the sites in this project. This
plan is based on a survey of households currently occupying these sites.
During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, no later than
December 31, 1991, it will have taken all necessary measures to free of all
occupants the sites legally attributed to the education authorities to
carry out primary school construction, and as a condition of disbursement
for the school rehabilitation and construction program, it will have
implemented, in a manner satisfactory to IDA, the resettlement plan.
D.Procurement
5.29     Goods and services to be financed by IDA would be procured in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits' (May, 1985). Contracts would be awarded as per Table 5.3
and a list of expected contract packages is given in Annex 39.
5.30     Contracts for civil works would be grouped as follows: one
contract of about US$ 5.2 million for construction of science faculty and
rehabilitation of math and biology buildings; one contract of about
US$140,000 for construction of engineering faculty; in Maputo, for
primarylsecondary schools eight packages of about US$1 million each for
rehabilitation and new construction; in Beira/Dondo, for rehabilitation and
new construction of primary/secondary schools ten packages of about US$1
million each, and in Nacala, two packages also of about US$1 million each
for the construction of one new primary school each. All contracts would
be procured through ICB, except for the following contracts: (a) the
contract for the engineering faculty (about $140,000); (b) the
rehabilitation of the four lower secondary schools in Maputo ($2.6 million
aggregate in three phases); (c) the rehabilitation of four schools in
BeiralDondo ($1.8 million in two phases); and (d) the two contracts in
Nacala ($2 million in two phases). These contracts will be procured under
LCB procedures because of their relatively small value, remote locations
(Beira/Dondo and Nacala), and the phasing of the rehabilitation work in
order to minimize the disruption of school occupancy.

b/ Not applicable for procurement.
LCB procedures will include local advertising, public bid opening, clarity
of evaluation criteria, and award to lowest bidder, and foreign bidders
will not be excluded from participation. This also equally applies to LCB
procurement of goods. The three school maintenance units of the provincial
education sector authorities (GATECE, para.4.50) would be responsible under
force account arrangements for the rehabilitation of some schools to a
total of US$ 700,000 as a training ground for the maintenance work to be
carried out later. These units, which are under the Ministry of Education,
are currently executing by force account contracts for maintenance and
rehabilitation, and they use unit prices to monitor these contracts.
Payment will be made on the basis of completion of work.
5.31      Furniture for the primary and secondary schools would be grouped
in three major packages to be procured through ICB; a fourth package would
cover the furniture for the university and other implementing agencies.



- 71 -
About US$ 700,000 should be procured under LCB procedures to take advantage
of the low prices of limited, local artisanal school furniture
manufacturing capacity which is being developed with SIDA assistance.
5.32      Procurement of equipment, vehicles, materials and supplies have
been grouped into 15 major packages of goods, the contents of which
typically corresponds to one supplier. Of these items, 70 percent is
suitable for ICB. The rest would be procured through local and
international shopping. LCB would be more suitable for the procurement of
goods and services such as purchasing about 140 bicycles (given the recent
research on and local manufacturing capability of the most suitable
bicycles for Mozambique). Local shopping will be used for maps, globes and
other small classroom supplies; radio receivers for the pilot program in
distance education teacher training; medicines for the schools involved in
the student health program; art and school garden materials for the schools
involved in the extramural pilot programs and printing contracts for local
training materials. These contracts are estimated to cost less than
US$25,000 each and would in aggregate not exceed US$ 500,000.
5.33      International shopping would be used for procurement of: (a)
audio visual and office equipment (about $290,000); (b) books for the six
lower secondary schools at about US$130,000, because these books would only
provide small additions to the school libraries and only a few firms would
be interested and capable of supplying the books at that level in
Portuguese; and (c) the acquisition of books and journal subscriptions for
the libraries of four university faculties (estimated to cost about US$
490,000 in aggregate), because only a limited number of library supply
houses exist which would have the capability of providing the wide variety
of books, mostly in Portuguese and English; (d) tools, local construction
materials, and imported construction materials for the rural reconstruction
program (about US$730,000 in aggregate). The total value of all
procurement by international shopping would be about US$1.6 million. The
exact arrangement would depend on the methodology chosen to assist in the
reconstruction of rural primary schools in some of the 40 priority
districts which are scattered throughout the country and subject to very
different security and transportation arrangements. The phasing of this
pilot program is also subject to the development and phasing of the overall
Priority District Program.
5.34      Technical assistance, both local and foreign, to be financed by
UNDP (about US$ 4.8 million) would be procured through three contracts, one
with Unesco, one directly executed by the Government, and a third through
UNDP Headquarters. This is acceptable to the Bank. Local and foreign
technical assistance and studies to be financed by IDA (e.g. audits,
project preparation) would be selected in accordance with principles and
procedures acceptable to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as
Executing Agency' (August 1981).   The remainder would be disbursed for
fellowships, study trips and local training and seminars, to be contracted
directly by the Government and subject to prior IDA review and approval.
5.35      The incremental recurrent costs supported by IDA would be for
maintenance and operation of vehicles and equipment and of newly



- 72 -
rehabilitated and constructed buildings, both categories of expenditures
for which it would be unlikely that the necessary funds would be
forthcoming in sufficient amounts to maintain the Investments made. Some
of the building maintenance would be carried out by the Gateces, but the
project would also try to develop the local contracting capacity, and the
Gateces would package typical maintenance tasks and procure them under LCB
procedures. Incremental salaries are entirely supported by the Government.
5.36      In the comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through
ICB, domestic manufacturers would be allot'ed a preferential margin of 15
percent, or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower over the c.i.f.
prices of competing imports. In the comparison of bids for civil works to
be procured through ICB, domestic contractors will receive a preference of
7.5 percent following IDA guidelines. Bidding packages, invitations to bid
and the proposed award of contracts for civil works and goods valued at
more than US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to prior review by IDA.
It is estimated that this review would cover about 85 percent of the value
of all contracts (US$ 43 million equivalent). The remaining 15 percent of
contracts would be subject to selective post award reviews. However, all
LCB bid packages, invitations to bid, proposed award of contracts and draft
contracts, regardless of size, would be reviewed and cleared by IDA to
ensure compliance with the Bank's procurement procedures.
5.37      Implementation of the procurement process is shown in the
implementation schedule (annex 37). Procurement would be carried out by
GEPE, which has shown to be able to carry out Bank procurement guidelines
satisfactorily (para. 5.19). GEPE would also receive technical assistance
to help it with procurement tasks (para 4.53).
S. Disbursements
5.38      The proposed project would be disbursed over a period of about
six years (Annex 40), and major investments have been programmed for a
period of four years. Disbursements t-ould be made in accordance with table
5.4.  The disbursement schedule reflects the conditionality on disbursement
for the rehabilitation of primary schools, quality improvement initiatives
and radio studio rentals. Disbursements from the proposed credit are
expected to take place on an average of about 6 months after incurring the
expenditure. A disbursement schedule and profile, reflecting this and
making a comparison with education sector in Africa profile, are shown in
Annex 40. Disbursements are expected to be completed by April 30, 1997.
5.39      All disbursements from the IDA credit account would be fully
documented except expenditures for (a) contracts, purchase orders for goods
and services or overseas training programs valued at less that US$20,000
equivalent; (b) local training programs; and, (c) force account and
operating costs for which expenses would be made against certified
statements of expenditures (SOE). Documentation would be retained by GEPE
for review by Bank supervision missions and project auditors.



- 73 -
5.40      Special Account.  To facilitate timely project implementation,
the Government would establish, maintain and operate, under terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA, a Special Account in a counercial bank
acceptable to IDA. IDA would make an initial deposit, equivalent to about
US$ 2.3 million. This amount is expected to cover about four months of
eligible payments. The Special Account would be replenished as appropriate
when the undisbursed balance of the account falls below an amount equal to
50 percent or less of the amount of the Special Account. Withdrawal
applications would be submitted monthly regardless of the volume of
business handled by the Special Account and would be supported by full
documentation except for items eligible for disbursement on the basis of
certified statements of expenditures.

- 74 -
5.41       Accounts, Audits and Reporting.  GEPE would maintain separate
accounts for the project. Auditing would be financed by IDA and contracted
with a specialized private firm. Statements of Expenditures would be audited
every six months and audit reports would be furnished to IDA within nine
months of the end of each fiscal year. Project accounts including the Special
Account would be audited in accordance '1th the March 1982 Bank 'Guidelines
for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank".
The audit reports would be of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably
request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against
a certified statement of expenditures. The Governmuent provided assurances to
this effect during negotiations. To facilitate close monitoring of the
project, GEPE would also submit to IDA: (a) semi-annual progress reports; and
(b) within six months of the project's closing date, a final report on the
implementation experience and project outcomes. Preparation of the semi-
annual reports would also be financed by the project, and every year they will
be presented and discussed during the annual implementation review meeting.

VI. BENETS AND RISKS
6.01     Benefits.  The project will contribute significantly to furthering
the goals of the Government's ESRP in regard to educational development as
part of broader efforts to increase productivity, raise the quality of
life, and reduce poverty. The new strategy for education that Government
has developed with IDA assistance, and the major steps that must now be
taken to implement the strategy, are crucial elements of its overall ESRP.
Success will require resolution of numerous complex issues on which
Mozambique has limited experience and capacity, and thus requires
assistAnce. Other external assistance agencies are unable to meet this
need entirely, and both they and the Government are looking to IDA to play
a significant role in supporting the restructuring and reconstruction of
the sector. The project would strengthen the government's implementation
capacity to carry out its strategy both in strategic technical areas and in
its management. The project would also assist in further developing the
intellectual underpinning of the strategy by generation of data, staff
training and development of long term plans in higher education and
training, and annual consultations on both budget and implementation.
6.02     At the primary level, children in four cities would benefit from
additional availability of classrooms and additional hours of instruction.
In Beira, Dondo and Nacala, the project would provide between 60 and 702 of
the total number of classrooms required for secondary and primary education
by 1993. In Maputo, the project will provide 332 of all classrooms needed
by 1993. Children in selected heavily populated areas (covering at least
262 of the school population) would benefit from improved pedgogical
support, better trained teachers, increased funding for school maintenance
and longer hours of instruction. Support for improvements at the
University Eduardo Mondlane's Faculties of Engineering, Economics, and the
three Science Faculties will lead to graduates who can strengthen the
country's productive sectors, lead in the adaptation of the country's
economic development strategy and of science and technology to the
productive and social sectors.
6.03     Risks.  The main risks are three.  First, the continuing civil
unrest may disrupt project execution or damage project assets. To minimize
this risk, the project will focus on the secure areas. The areas chosen
are three major urban and semi-urban centers, which are of strategic
importance for the economic development of the country as they represent
the port areas for the transportation corridors and, therefore, are heavily
guarded and some of the forty rural priority districts, which are by
definition supposed to be guarded and defended against attack. Second, the
management capabilities of the implementing institutions, which have all
been reorganized since February 1990, may be limited. To mitigate this
problem, the project includes measures to strengthen implementation
capacity. Third, sustaining the substantial coordination required among
the many Government and donor agencies involved might require special
efforts. To address this issue, a thorough consultation process has been
undertaken during project preparation, involving a series of workshops and
seminars, and a donor conference, and plans have been made to continue this
process during project implementation. In light of these design features,
risks would be minimized and the proposed project would constitute a
suitable basis for investment in the improvement of the educational sector
in Mozambique.

VII. AGREMENTS AND ASSURANCES
7.01           During negotiations, The Government reconfirmed its
commitment to implementing the actions outlined in the Letter of Education
Development Policy and the attached Action Matrix (Annex, 11). Within the
context of carrying out this program, the Government has provided
assurances that it will do the following:

(para 3.08);
(c)   furnish to IDA by July 31, 1991 a satisfactory plan prepared by
MINED for the introduction of a longer school year, and take all
measures necessary for implementing the longer school year by
December 31, 1991, so that the new schedule could begin in 1992
(para 3.29);
(d)   prepare and furnish to IDA a satisfactory plan on the
organization of school construction administrative unit
in MINED by June 30, 1992 (para 4.46);

staff with the education sector to levels consistent with
technical streams in other public sectors, by June 30, 1992 (para.
4.47);
(f)   include in its national general budget from FY1993 on, the
amounts needed to be able to maintain its newly constructed
or rehabilitated university infrastructure, and fron, FY1996
on, the amounts needed to maintain its newly constructed or
rehabilitated primary and secondary schools, both at a rate
of 1 percent of new construction costs (para 5.10);
(g)   provide satisfactory evidence to IDA on an annual basis, by March
31, that it has taken steps to reduce the salary budget in MINED
and the University to the equivalent of the incremental salaries,
so the total salary budget is not increased due to this project
(para 5.11);
(h)   establish formally by the competent authorities no later than
December 31, 1991, a school maintenance unit in Sofala Province,
and provide it and the similar unit in Nampula Province with their
own budget line (para 5.18);
(i)   provide evidence satisfactory to IDA that by December 31, 1991,
all technical assistance contracting arrangements for the first



- 77 _
year of project implementation have been finalized, whether
financed by UNDP or hired directly under the project (para 5.22);
(j)   conduct jointly with IDA a project implementation review, not
later than October 31 of each year, in order to: (a) discuss the
annual evaluation reports prepared by GEPE; (b) monitor progress
in achieving project objectives; (c) identify implementation
issues and proposed solutions; (d) promote exchange of ideas among
staff involved in project implementation; and (e) update project
timetables, cost estimates and projected levels of recurrent and
investment budgets for the education sector (para 5.25);
(k)   take all necessary measures no later than December 31, 1991
to free all of the sites of occupants from the formal sites
legally attributed to MINED to carry out the school
construction program and implement the resettlement plan
agreed with IDA (para 5.28);
(1)   take all necessary measures to ensure that the Statements of
Expenditures are audited every six months and audit reports
are furnished to IDA within nine months of the end of each
fiscal year, and that the project accounts would be audited
in accordance with the March 1982 Bank 'Guidelines for
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the
World Bank (para 5.41).
7.02        The condition for Effectiveness of the Credit is:
Select and employ the following staff members at GEPE with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDAs (i) Director;
(ii) two Project Coordinators; (iii) Chief of Finance and
Importation Department; and (iv) Chief of the Construction
Department (para. 5.13);
7.03        Conditions for Disbursement of Credit funds are:
(a)   For the schools to be constructed and rehabilitated, furnish to
IDA a legally binding grant agreement with SIDA on the financing
of a textbook policy and program (para 3.12); having presented
detailed implementation plans satisfactory to IDA for the five
initiatives (para 4.27); and having carried out satifactorily the
resettlement plan (para.5.28); and,
(b)   For the rental of radio studios in the distance education pilot
project, the Government will present satisfactory evidence that it
has entered into a contract providing rental at cost (for
educational purposes) rather than at commercial rates (para 4.16).
7.04        Subject to the above assurances, the project constitutes a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 38.7 million (US$ 53.7 million
equivalent) to the People's Republic of Mozambique.

MOZUMBIQUE
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
Book Sector Study and PrimaKr  School Teztbook Policy  1/
Backtround
Under the current system for manufacturing and distributing
textbooks in Mozambique, there are three principal agencies involved. INDE
is under the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is responsible for writing and
designing the textbooks. DINAME, also under the MOE, has the
responsibility for ordering materials for the textbooks and ordering the
textbooks from the printer. DINAME is also responsible for distributing
the printed texts to wholesalers. The third agency is CEGRAF, under
Ministry of Information, which is the sole agenty capable of printing
textbooks. The distribution of textbooks is done on a commercial basis,
with DINAME selling to wholesalers, who sell in turn to retailers.
However, profit margins are fixed by Government for DINAME as well as for
the wholesalers and the retailers.
Parents and teachers buy textbooks at one set price. The books
are manufactured as inexpensively as possible, and thus generally last only
one school year. The price of the books to the parents is highly
subsidized -- an initial study indicates that the parents pay only 191 of
the cost of a new book and 412 of the cost of a reprinted textbook.
Despite the high subsidy, textbook sales have fallen steadily since 1986.
Current Textbook Policy
The Government plans to publish all materials for teachers and
students in the SNE a well as for its adult education programs. In the
short term, however, the Governrent will Import books for the lower and
upper secondary levels. The Government's policy is to prescribe the books
to bo used in schools and to sell all textbooks at a highly subsidized
price as describod above.
Issues
In designing a nw policy for textbooks, the Government must
address the following issues:
1.    Initially, the shortages of textbooks In rural areas was
thought to be a distribution problem; the crux, however, is the
1L  _emsive Scy .t uSiqms Be&  Sese S%uft ea Prtm.y Salteel Teatbas Policy
by Ca_sl Io sDoing, NW, low.

inability of rural parents to pay for textbooks, which makes it
uneconomical for wholesalers and retailers to operate in rural
areas. Also, with a fixed profit margin, the retailers have no
incentive to bear the costs of distribution in rural areas.
Thus, the books are not available even to those who can afford
them.
2.    The current curriculum was designed and the textbooks written
in only one year under an extremely tight schedule, and some
books need to be improved to correspond to the correct level of
study and improved teaching methodology.
3.    there is a lack of executive authority in the planning,
publication and distribution of school books.  No single agency
is responsible for coordinating textbooks.
4.    Although the books are subsidized, they are still too expersive
for the parents to buy. Also, the real costs of production are
not known.
Ontios
There are three basic policies of textbook supply: providing the
books for free, renting the books or selling the books. The effects of
each of these three alternatives can be mitigated through, for example,
subsidies or mixed systems.
The advantages of a sales strattgy are that the books will be
maintained at home, which requires less storage in the schools, and the MOE
would save on overhead costs. DLstribution would be through commercial
outlets, which would reduce MOE coats on transportation, storage and staff
and strengthen the book market. MOE can continue to control discounts and
retail prices and could experiment also with more durable books to create a
secondhand market. The dLsadvantages of selling books include continued
problems with access to books in rural areas and with parents' ability to
pay. Some parents will not be able to afford either new or secondhand
books; although this might be alleviated through a social fund.
A renta sXchom would have that advantage that annual rental fees,
calculated by amortising the cost of a more durable book over three years,
will be affordable for parents where purchase is not. Free rentals can be
provided for pupils who cannot pay. MOE will have control over the number
of books In the school. The disadvantage of this system is that the
schools will have to store and manage the book stock. Moreover, since the
books are only rentals, the pupils may not care for them properly.
Free supply of books will ensure that famLly income levels will
not prevent puplls form having access to textbooks. Remote rural areas
will not be disadvantaged. The obvious disadvantage is that without some
cost recovery NOE funding may bc too limited to supply books to the whole
system, including the coats of distribution, storage, and management*

Recommendations
The Textbook Working Group for the Second Education Project
recommendod that a system using a rental fee be developed in the schools.
The fee charged to urban pupils would be subsidized, and rural pupils would
pay only a vary small nominal charge. Teachers books would be provided
free to all schools. The money collected would stay with the rural schools
and the urban schools would contribute the fees to a textbook renewal fund.
This proposal is being reviewed by the Government; however, there is
concern that the costs of storage would be too high and that more durable
books may be too expensive. The Government must also consider eliminating
the fixod profit margins for the wholesalers and retailers. As long as the
retailers are receiving only a fixed margin, they will have no incentive to
distribute books in the more isolated rural areas. This Textbook Working
Group, which is in close consultation with SIDA, is continuing to examine
options and will make a formal policy recormendation by the end of 1990.

MOZAMBIQUE
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
Increasing Hours of Instruction
Back round
The average primary student in a developed country spends a little
more than 1100 per year in the classroom, over the period of nine or ten
months. The hours of instruction in Mozambique has always been shorter
than this for the lower grades at about 800 hr.Iyr and equal to it in the
upper primary grades at about 1100 hrslyr (see Table A.2). The school year
runs from February to November and includes 37 weeks of instruction. The
hours of instruction were considered reasonably adequate until the schools
began to have to switch to a three shift system, which reduced the average
hours of instruction per year to 630.
Based on the analysis presented below, the Government and the
World Bank agree that the best solution to this problem is to increase the
length of the school year, change the curriculum in the primary schools to
focus on the fundamentals and offer extracurricular activities outside of
school hours.
Problem
In recent years the primary school-aged population in the urban
areas of Mozambique has grown very rapidly as a result of families flooding
into urban areas in order escape the war. In order to accommodate this
influx of students, the schools in most urban centers have had to switch
from offering two shifts of classes with different students each day to
offering three shifts. Unfortunately, this has had an adverse affect on
the hours of instruction received by each student. Whereas primary
students used to receive between 22 and 30 hours of instruction per week,
the average primary student now receives only 15 to 17 hours of instruction
per week.
Options Considered
A. Classroom Construction in the Urban Aro a
Initially, the World Bank and the Government of Mozambique agreed
that it would be desirablo to construct enough new classrooms in the
capital city of Msputo, and the major city of BoiralDonde to allow the
schools system to return to two shifts a day. It was estimated that the
cost of constructing and rehabilitating enough classrooms to provide space
for the same percentage of primary school-aged children and offer two



- 96 -
Annex 10
Page 2 of 5
shifts vould be about US$40 million. Presented with the theoretical
alternative that year round utilization of the classrooms by scheduling
three shifts in alternative school calendars, could save US$10 million, the
Government decided to examine other alternatives for increasing hours of
instruction. Some construction of new classrooms will be necessary
reg.dless since the number of refugees arriving in the large cities is
still increasing.
B. Year-Round Schooling
One very cost-effective way to increase classroom hours is to
lengthen the school year. Initially, the Government was considering the
feasibility of switching to a year-round school system in which students
would be divided into three sections, each of which had vacations at
different times in the year. This system would have allowed for a greater
use of existing fac_ ities and might have made it easier for the schools to
switch back from three to two shifts per day. However, the Government
perceived major obstacles to Implementing these changes in the school
system and anticipated much resistance among the population. In the urban
areas, the problem would have boen a cultural one because the families are
used to spending their sumer holidays together as civil servants also
receivo a month off at the ond of the year. In the rural areas, the
problem was more of an economic one. The busiest time of the agricultural
year for farmers falls during this month at the end of the year, and many
rural families rely on the help of their children during this harvest
season. As a result, the Government rejected the idea of alternating
schoolr years.
C. Lengthen Sehool Year
Though year-round schooling would be problematic for the families
of students, the Government still felt that increasing the length of the
school year should be possible. As a result, the Governmeat proposed
instead to merely shorten the summer vacation as well as shortening other
vacations during the course of the school year. The now and old schedules
for the sehool year are prosonted below:

Vacation weeks                 1                  1
School weeks                  9                10
vacation  eeks                 3                 3
School weeks                 10                 11
Vacation weeks                 1                  1
School weeks                  8                10
Sumoer Vacation                10                 5
Total                     52                52
In this manner the Government would add an additional five weeks and 85
hours to the school year. In addition to this, the Government has already
decided to eliminate the final exam period for grades one through four,
starting in 1991. This period used to last for five weeks for all grades,
including two weeks of review, two weeks of preparation at home and one
week of exams. In el"imnating exams for these grades, the Government will
effectively add another five weeks to the school year in which new
materials can be presented. This brings the total additional hours of new
instruction to 10 weeks or 170 hours per year.
Is this sufficient to nullify the effects of having three shifts
per day in each school rather than two? Unfortunately, in most grades even
10 additional weeks cannot completely make up for the hours lost under the
three shift system. As shown in the table below it would take over 28
additional weeks to provide the same hours of instruction in the upper
primary grades six and seven.

Calculated using the 17 hrs/vk offered under the 3 Shift System.
Nonetheless, the additional time being added to th, school year will make a
significant differenco in the hours of instruction received by primary
students, and, therefore, in the quality -F their education. In addition
to these changes, the Covernment is considering the promotion of extramural
programs such as those discussed below.
D. Additional laesures: Curriculum Change"
and Extracurricular Activitie8
In order to make up for the decrease in hours of Instruction
during primary school, the Government is considering the elimination of all
soft  subjects in the eshool curriculum. Thus, the schools would no
longer include progrm_ in music, art or drama. Nor would time be set
aside for gym or athletics. Instead, the students would spend their
limited time In the clasroom focusing on the most important fundamentals,
namely, learning to read and write in Portuguese and learning math and
science.
In order to compensate for these changes in curriculum,
communities would b encouraged to organize extracurricular activities for
students outside of school facilities. In this way, instruction in art,
music and dram could be provided in various homes or commuiity centers.
Extracurricular sports could also be organized by the comunity. This
coumunity participation would increase parents' involvement in the
education of their children and enrich the child's educational experience.
The Government would have to actively promote this Idea and perhaps provide
limlted funding for some activities. The Government might also encourage
private voluntary organizations to get Involved in the provision of
extracurricular activities.



- 99 _                 Annex 10
Page 5 of 5
Costs and Benefits
The construction of sufficient classrooms to return to a two shift
system in the urban areas of Mozambique would have cost at least US$40
million. Moreover, since the number of refugees arriving in the cities
continues to grow, even this would not have been a sufficient to build
enough classrooms for long. Changing the school calendar as proposed
above, on the other hand, has no budgetary implications -- it will not cost
the Government anything. Teachers in Mozambique are supposed to work 11
months a year like all civil servants. In the past they have not been
working much over 10 months, a month of which was spent on administrative
work. As a result, no increase in teachers' salaries will be necessary to
implement the proposed schedule changes. The teachers will still have more
vacation time than their official fLwr weeks. The extracurricular
activities may require a limited allocation from the Government budget
initially in order to encourage communities to get these programs off the
ground; however, private organizations and community groups should be
encouraged to take over the funding very quickly.
Recommendation
Adding ten extra weeks of time for instruction on new materials,
in addition to using the time spent in the schools to be used solely on the
basics of reading, writing, math and science, should work together to
eliminate much of the negative impact of the three shift system and help o
improve the quality of primary education. The elimination of exm_ in the
lower primary grades will not hart the system, since other mechanisms, more
appropriate for the lower age group, already exist for evalusting the
students. The community, private organizations and the Government will
have to work together to coordinate extracurricular activities, but this
coordination will also serve to strengthen the primary education system in
Mozambique.

U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Jaycox,
LETTER OF EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY
I am writing to you in connection with the proposed Second Education
Project to inform the International Development Association of the steps
the Government has already taken or is planning to take to improve the
educational system in Mozambique. Through a process of Improving quality,
rehabilitation and selective expansion the Government of the Popular
Republic of Mozambique aims at developing a more effective system with
increased access at all levels that is sustainable. given available
resources. The Government's sectoral development objectives are elaborated
in the Education Plan to the Year 2000, which was endorsed by the Council
of Ministers on     , 19901/, communicated to the donor community,
including IDA, during a donor coordination seminar held in Maputo in
February, 1990.
The Government is fully aware that the long term economic and social
development of Mozambique is heavily dependent on the improvement of the
educational level of its population, and it is also conscious of the fact
that the social sectors, particularly the education sector, is being
underfunded compared to the needs.  The serious economic constraints which
Mozambique faces, makes it essential to use available resJurces in the most
efficient and effective way possible, and to supplement the Government
budget with additional resources.
Achievements in Education
Despite the severe resource constraints and decreasing budgets until 1987,
the Government has made an effort to improve quality and efficiency at the
primary level as well as to expand access at the secondary and higher
levels to ease the lack of qualified manpower. The most important measures
taken are as follows:
(a) Primary level: (i) the primary school reform has been evaluated
and its curricular structure simplified to make it consistent with
available teaching resources; (ii) this reform has resulted in a
reduction of the incidence of repetition; (iii) two multi-year
research projects are ongoing: one on the factors affecting drop-out,
and a second on the teaching - learning process ongoing in the
}/Date to be provided by the Government by November 20, 1990.

classroom and the use of textbooks and other teaching aids; (iv)
Mozambique is participating in an international comparative study on
student achievement in math and science; (v) a high protein-caloric
snack is being provided to school children in Maputo under a pilot
program;
(b) Secondary level: (i) a new curriculum has been prepared for
grades 8 to 10 and texts are being tested in a three year evaluation
program; (ii) students are now specializing in either humanities or
sciences at grades 11 and 12 level to improve quality and efficiency:
(c) University: (i) enrollments have doubled in last five years by
re-opening of courses (e.g. math, physics) and enrolling more
students per course; (ii) we organized a committee to study measures
to integrate basic science teaching and research; (iii) special
programs in the engineering and veterinary faculties should lead to
significant improvements in efficiency and quality;
(d) Training: (i) a school director training program has been
developed and will be tested with all school directors in Maputo
during 1990;
(e) Planning: (i) a ten year development plan for the general
education system was developed based on improved statistical analysis
and state of the art planning techniques. The plan itemizes year by
year targets based on priority policies, and estimates both the
recurrent and investment costs of all aspects of education, including
the expected coverage from the government budget's share to the
sector and donor commitmerts. This plan was developed, analyzed and
endorsed in a participatory process throughout the sector and the
government structure and reflects the shared objectives of many
interest groups.
(f) Management: (i) an organization and management study was carried
out for five basic management functions which together determine
efficiency of organization of inputs into the system; (ii) a
provincial sciool maintenance unit was established and has started to
operate in Maputo, providing a model for other provinces.
Proposed Program 1990-1995
Over the period 1990 -1995, The Government is planning to carry out tte
program and priorities spelled out in the ten year development plan. The
objectives and timetables of the action programs are set out in the
attached policy matrix. The major elements are as follows:
1.    Education Sector Budget:  The Government has increased funding
to the sector in the last two years and the Ministers Council
has recommended that the 1989 level of funding be maintained as
a minimum both in real terms and as a share of the overall



- 102 -
Annex 11
Page 3 of 12
government's budget for the 1990-1992 period, subject to annual
consultations within the Government. The Government also aims
at maintaining the intra-sectoral allocations at levels
currently achieved, which emphasize development of primary
education. In addition, more emphasis will be placed on the
provision of non-salary recurrent budget.
2.    Primary level: (i) the school year will be increased by 5
weeks; (ii) a new student evaluation procedure will be
initiated in 1991 to reduce the incidence of repetition solely
due to rigorous exams at each grade level; (iii) results of the
classroom sEservation study will be integrated in a revised set
of teaching and learning materials; (iv) a new textbook policy
and production and distribution program will be initiated as of
1992 aiming at decreasing the private costs of education and
ensuring an adequate availability of textbooks in the schools;
(v)other quality enhancing initiatives, such as school health
and sanitation and introduction of local languages will be
tested.
Teacher training:(i) substantial changes in the pre-service
teacher training curricula and length will be introduced
gradually; (ii) inservice training courses aimed at
professional upgrading will be developed; and (iii) a
pedagogical support system will be revitalized. Distance
education methods will be developed and integrated into teacher
training.
3.   Restructurina of Ministry of Education:  In line with the
recommendations of the management/organization study, a plan is
in place to streamline the management functions and
organization dealing with human resources, and planning,
budgetting and financial control over the next two years. This
will involve strengthening the central operational efficiency
and decentralizing some of the functions now carried out at the
Ministry. In addition, we intend to carry out a study of the
provincial and district organization to streamline their
functions and to enable us to abolish redundant posts. The
Inspectorate function will not yet be developed, because of its
limited impact in our country during the present security
situation. We will strengthen the planning function within the
Ministry by appointing additional planners and providing them
with professional training. A plan for a reorganization of the
MINED dealing with the educational processes and outputs is
also in place. This is meant to strengthen the integration of
functions dealing with the levels of education. A seperate
entity for school construction and rehabilitation within the
MINED will also be set up, subject to a study of the proper
functions of suxch an entity.
4.    Higher Education: (i) the institutions in higher education will
develop a plan to guide development of this subsector to the



- 103 -
Annex 11
Page 4 of 12
year 2000, aiming for a balance between needs, access and
costs; (ii) the University Eduardo Mondlane aims at increasing
its quality of teaching and research by embarking on an
accelerated human resource development plan; (iii) during 1991,
an overall,in-depth assessment of all university curricula will
be carried out; (iv) the University will increase its
administrative efficiency by developing a comprehensive space
planning and utilization plan for both campuses; computerizing
key functions as well as the library system; developing a
maintenance plan and service; (v) the University will integrate
and develop basic science teaching and research by centralizing
all faculties involved in the main campus and starting an
academic integration process.
I hope that these details will help to clarify the main directions of
our education effort. We will, of course, be willing to provide you with
any further information you may require.
Yours sincerely,
Governor of the Bank of Mozambique

SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
COMPARISON Of PRIORITY DISTRICT PROGRAM AND ACTIONS PLANNED UNDER PROJECT
1.          ~akcround  For the last two years, the Government of Mozambique has prepared a
Priority District Program (POP). This program alms at the rovitalization of tho rural ar*se
of the country, particularly It would support tho agricultural sector as the central source
of economic growth; a concomitent reduction of structural povorty; ond a significant
contribution to national food security. The Government selected 40 districts (out of 130)
based on the following criteria: (a) agricultural potentlal baned on historical production
data; (b) population density; (c) av8ilability of infrastructure which Is in relatively good
conditions; (d) accessibility by road, water, airs or train, and good telecommunications
connnections; and (e) rolative security. Those criteria w*re balanced against the political
noed to avoid creating regional dleparitioe. About four districts per provineo were
eventually selected.
2.          Apreh   The PDP aims at coordinating Government and donor activities already
ongoing In dfst-Rict -In several sectors and at rationalizing future interventions.  The
approach to be takon Is a dynamic one, building on local initiatives, planning and
Implementation capabilities of government agencies as well as private or comunity resourcee.
The PDP Is thus a frameork which would support sectoral activities and programs as well as
local and provinclal activities and programs. It is not intended to be a single, parallel,
mutl-sectoral overall program.
8.          Education   The objective of the POP in the education sector is to regain as fast
as possible th-e1981 enrollment levels In the districts and to provide educational
opportunities at primary and secondary levels to the population. The explicit program
objective is to reconstruct the school network and expand it as noeded. For some districts,
detailed reconstruction plans were made; other districts did not consider the reconstruction
of schools as the highet priority. The Planning Directorate at the Ministry of Education
has not (yet) incorporated planning to the district level into their provincial projection
model, and the focus of PDP has not been explicitly incorporated In the ton-yer plan of the
education sctor.
4.          Po3ct Interventions  Under tho project, the ten-year education sector plan
would be upda ad nd discussd on annual basis, and the POP focus and framework would be
integrated. The project also foreses a serlos of specific actions In some, but not all,
priority districts as the normal expansion of priority action programs of the ten-year plan
reches out from urban to rural areas.  The lnterventions that would support the Improvement
of quality and effiet ncy in primary education are: (a) ineervice training to all teachers in
the country who have more than 6 yers of general education, but no professional training
( asuming that thes teachers would be able to travel three times during the yesr to a More
central location); (b) pedigogical support to the teachers In revitalized pedgogtcal zones
In 84 districts, 16 of which colncide with priority distriets (see list below); (c) testing
of the use of radios In teacher training In three areas, Including priority districts; (d)
testing of local langusge Introduction In two priority districts; (e) expansion of som of
the quality nhancaing Initiatives, once tested, to priority districts (such as bookflocding
and extramural activities); and (f) carrying out studies on health and nutrition statue of
school children In priority districts.
S.          To support the reconstruction of primory schools In the priority distriets, the
project foresees the establishment of a management system and the teoting out of
reconstruction modalities. The newly created Directorato for Equipment and School
Construction In the Ministry of Education would study the advantage and disadvantages of the
experiences already ongoing In rural reconstruction from the cost, and managzment point of
viow. It would then have funds available (about US$ 1.4 million with contingencies) to corry
out rural roeonstruction progras.. However, neither the methodology to follow, nor the
distrite  In which to reconstruct have been decided.  Such decisions would be ode on an

a/    EP1 schools have standard buildings with 10 or 15 classrooms, and
administration and other spaces have been scaled accordingly, The same unit
costs per gross classroom have been used for new construction at EP1 level.
bl    Site development includes trees, access paths, paved areas, water well pump
and tank and site fence.
c/    US$40,300 is equivalent to a base unit construction cost of about US$245/m2
or US$27,000 per gross classroom in Maputo city. These costs were increased
102 in Beira and Dondo and 202 in Nacala due to the transportation cost
incidence.
