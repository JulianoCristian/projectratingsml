  alleviate acute shortages of manpower at the technician and\n            skilled worker levels. It will also provide the Government\n            for the first time with the capability of training technical\n            vocational instructors. Moreover, the proposed project will\n            systematize and rationalize technical education and\n            vocational training programs through the establishment of a\n            National Technical Training Board (NTTB). Specifically, the\n            proposed project will: (i) establish a two-year\n            post-secondary polytechnic in Sanaa; (ii) establish a\n            technical secondary school in Hodeidah; (iii) replace two\n            workshops and re-equip the technical secondary school in\n            Sanaa; (iv) relocate an existing vocational training center\n            in Taiz; (v) establish an instructor training program at the\n            proposed polytechnic in Sanaa; and (vi) provide expert\n            services for the above and assist the Government in\n            establishing the NTTB."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
