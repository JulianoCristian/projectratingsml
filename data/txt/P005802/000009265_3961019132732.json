Careful attention should be given to project\n            implementation arrangements for civil works at the\n            preparation stage, especially to the acquisition of land for\n            new buildings. Effectiveness conditions can unnecessarily\n            delay project start up. Urgent actions should be executed by\n            Government upfront (before negotiations or Board\n            Presentation) rather than as a condition of effectiveness.\n            Simple procurement procedures transparently applied should\n            be followed by the Borrower to facilitate the award of tenders."}, "docdt": "1995-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
