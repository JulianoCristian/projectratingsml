    development impacts are substantial, resulting from a highly\n            satisfactory Bank performance, and satisfactory Borrower\n            performance. Several lessons were drawn from this operation:\n            a) adjustment lending programs work well when based on the\n            government's own priorities, and when the government\n            owns the process. This is particularly important if the\n            program involves a wide range of activities, and, in\n            addition, having a long-term adjustment program consisting\n            of three programmatic adjustment lending operations, may\n            ensure sustainability against government backtracking,\n            giving an opportunity to see the progress and direction of\n            the program, and also the flexibility to make modifications,\n            to adapt the program to changing circumstances. Furthermore,\n            it is important to ensure an adequate technical background\n            work, fostering sufficient capacity and understanding of\n            issues on the government's side. Given that adjustment\n            programs are built upon the government's program, and\n            with the government as a counterpart, thus vulnerable to\n            changes in government and political instability,\n            constituencies for reforms may also need to be rebuilt. A\n            cross-cutting, thematic design provides both flexibility,\n            and depth for addressing systemic institutional reform,\n            which within its framework, and recognizing the stepwise\n            nature of reform progress, the approach provides discipline\n            because there is a pre-agreed program of needed, and\n            complementary reforms which are to be addressed within the\n            programmatic package. Finally, the concept of benchmarks, as\n            opposed to conditionality, serves two purposes: (a) it takes\n            the Bank out of the delicate situation of imposing terms and\n            conditions; and, (b) lowers the risk of the project, in the\n            sense that the outcomes are already achieved."}, "docdt": "2003-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
