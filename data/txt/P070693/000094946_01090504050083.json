Programmatic Adjustment Loan Project\n            aims at supporting the medium-term economic development, and\n            reform program in Ukraine, to set the basis for sustained\n            economic growth, poverty reduction, and improved\n            environmental protection. The project will further improve\n            fiscal, and financial discipline, by eliminating\n            non-transparent budget off-sets, reducing budget arrears,\n            and increasing cash collections for energy. A more efficient\n            regulatory framework for entry, and operation of enterprises\n            will be in place, to improve corporate governance, and,\n            up-to-date regulatory functions in critical sectors will be\n            introduced. In the medium run, improved property rights will\n            form the basis for the revival of economic growth coming\n            from private investments, and foreign direct investments. In\n            addition, public sector accountability is being strengthened\n            through the public administration reforms, while, in the\n            medium term, completion of fiscal reforms will remain a\n            strong government commitment. And, completion of the pension\n            reform, and improved health and education services, will\n            help balance social assistance management. The highly\n            volatile political, and socioeconomic environment are risks\n            not to be underestimated, given the project's aim to\n            reduce budget arrears, and streamline public administration."}, "docdt": "2001-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
