project would promote economy and\n            efficiency in UTE's operations and administration in\n            accordance with the power sector strategy.  It specifically\n            consists of:  (1) a feasibility study for the rehabilitation\n            of the Gabriel Terra hydroplant; (2) a distribution system\n            study; (3) an operation planning study; and (4) a training\n            program for managerial level officers.  It further includes;\n            (5) installation of meters to implement a power tariff\n            structure based on marginal cost criteria; and (6) purchase\n            of instruments and materials for distribution system\n            maintenance and monitoring the safety of the Gabriel Terra\n            Dam.  The proposed loan would assist UTE to reduce system\n            losses, improve operating efficiency and management\n            practices, develop an adequate planning framework for the\n            distribution network, and rationalize electricity use by consumers."}, "docdt": "1984-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
