of concrete-lined main, branch and distributary\n            canals; (c) 39 pressure pumping stations to provide pressure\n            to water entering about 1,570 km of buried distribution\n            pipelines; (d) about 240 km of 20 kV power transmission\n            lines with transformer substations having an aggregate\n            capacity of 137 MVA; (e) portable irrigation equipment,\n            operation and maintenance equipment, and farm machinery and\n            implements; (f) land levelling and erosion control works.\n            Other related investments are: (a) establishment of a\n            vineyard on 450 ha and of an orchard on 350 ha; (b)\n            construction of a 44,000 ton grain silo; (c) eleven dairy\n            units each with a capacity of 830 dairy cows, imported dairy\n            cows for use in farms in eight judets (counties) in eastern\n            Romania, and two beef fattening units each with a capacity\n            of 3,200 animals; (d)
