and the borrower.\n            The project was part of a larger package of assistance to\n            Honduras in response to the ravages of Hurricane Mitch. The\n            major factors affecting project implementation were the good\n            financial and project management. Early Bank involvement,\n            with a quick assessment of a country's macroeconomic\n            situation, is needed to develop an effective emergency\n            assistance project. Longer term concerns about disaster\n            management preparedness and mitigation need to be address,\n            but it is not effective to combine this with emergency\n            support objectives. The existence of experienced operational\n            staff in the Field office is fundamental."}, "docdt": "2000-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
