Eithth Hiahwav Pro1ect (Loan 2091-PE)
Attached is the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Peru -
Eighth Highway Project (Loan 2091-PE)", prepared by the Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office. The report includes a project review by the borrower
(Part II).
The project sought to support road improvement, rehabilitation and
maintenance and development of road sector institution4s. Adverse macro-economic
conditions, frail institutions, insufficient government commitment, loan
suspension (for country reasons) and natural disasters severely constrained
implementation and attainment of objectives. Less than two-thirds of planned
civil works were completed. Improvements in road maintenance capacity were
minor. Strengthening of institutions was well below expectations. On balance,
project performance was rated as unsatisfactory, institutional development as
negligible and sustainability as uncertain. The PCR is of excellent quality.
No audit is planned.

EVALUATION SUlMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Eighth Highway Project (Loan 2091 PE, US$ 93 millior), approved in February 1982,
was intended to assist the Peruvian Government in achieving the improvement of the national road
network, an important objective of its development strategy. The Project followed seven previous
Bank loans totalling US$ 186 million for highway development since 1952.
2.    The Evaluation Summary summarizes the record and mam findings contained in Parts I, H
and m of the main report.
3.    The main objective of the project was to provide assistance for key elements of the
Government's highway -vestment program by supporting priority road rehabilitation and
Improvement works. The project also aimed to strengthen the Directorate Genervi of Highways
*pGC) mangement and its road maintenance activities.
Specifically the project consisted of:
a)    rehabilitation ^f about 195 km of paved roads, mostly in the northern part of the
Coastal region, as well as engineering for future rehabilitation of an additional 800 km
of roads;
b)    improvement to a gravel or paved two-lane tandard of about 400 km of roads needed
to support regional development programs in the jungle highland regions of the Selva
Cental and Alto Mayo, as well as detailed engineering for these and other roads in
both regions;
c)    provision of spare parts, equipment, workshop improvements and advisory services
needed to strengien highway maitenance,
d)    strengthening of highway administration through provision of 17 experts to fill key
positions in the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MTC) as well as
development of annual traiing programs and financing consultant services for
planning and installing an improved vehicle weight control system; and
e)    the consulting services for studies aimed at (i) preparing an agriculural development
scheme for the Selva Central region to be served by the road improvements mentioned
in b); (ii) improving coastal shipping operations; (iii) defining a better mechanism to
finance feeder road construction; and (iv) improving sector planning.



-iii-
4.    lhe execution of the Eighth Highway Project encountered basically the same problems that
afeced the three previous Bank highway projects In Peru, namely:
-     time delays d.e to instutdonal weaknesses; and,
-     lack of ntepart fumds.
In addition to these constzainlng factors, the following events exacerbated implementation problems:
-     tlhe natural disasters (etensive floods, landslides and persistent droughts) which struck
Peru in 1983 when project implementation was about to gain momentum;
-     difficult macroeconomic conditions wbich beset the country from 1983, leading to a
decision by the Bank to suspend loan disb   fo all project in Peru in May
1987, followed by the cancellation of the undisbursed balance of the loan, in 1991.
5.    MTC's management and staffing problems, lack of commitment to inttutiomi! reforms, and
IC's reluctance to hire five tehical specialists at higher saies than the civil service scales for
filling key management posltions in DGC -a condition for loan effectiveness- delayed by about one
year the loan effectiveness.
6.    In 198S because of severe natural disasters, the Project had to be ameded to inAclude urgent
woris for restoring high priority bridges and reconstructig culverts on road links close to the Project
area as well as repairs to airpots in Piura and Tumbes. A significant amount of project effort was
redircted to areas affected by these disasters.
7.    Encorag  trends in project implementation could be observed by mid 1984. The
reactivation of the Project, however, was hanrjered by financial constraint. Avafailay of matching
finds became a problem resulting towards the end of 1983 in the suspension of worls on some
contracts.
8.    Finally, as the Project was building up momenum, dircughout 1986, and progress was being
made towards meetng in May 1987 newly agreed targets, the Bank, for country reasons, suspended
disbursements on Its project portfolio in Peru.
9.    From then on, the Project progwssed with difficulties until cancellation of the undisbursed
bance of the loan In 1991. By then, the Project would have needed major reformuation t reflect
changed conditions and priorities.
RGW
10.   In view of the difficulties en red in implementing the Project, only 60% of the civil
works initily contemplated fr rehabilitation and improvements was completed. Altogeer, 187 km
of paved roads were rehabilitated as compared to 195 km planned, while under the improvement
program, 190 km were implemented (93 km paved and 97 km gravel) compared to a target of 400 km
(286 km paved and 114 km gSwel.)



-iv-
11.   Practically all of the engineering studies peraining to the first tranehe of the rehilitation and
Improvement program, i.e over 595 km of roads, were carried out, and supervision of the
implemented sections duly performed. Consultant services for detailed engineering of the 800 km
second tranche of road rehabilitation works were not utilized.
12.   Only 2% of the total amount allocated for repairing and increasing road maintenance
equipment and workshops was used, becase by the time the Directorate General of Highways was
ready to implement the mainece component in 1986, while an amount of US$7 million spare parts
and  _intenance equipment was tendered, loan disbursements were stopped. Simlarly, little attention
was given to the training of operating and technical staff before suspension of disburseme.
13.   The transport sector studies planned under the project were not undertaken while technica
assistance to strengthen the Ministry's directorates of engineering, investment planning and schedtuling
was only implemented to about 50% of targeted objectives.
14.   At closing date, the total cost incurred for the Project amounted to US$ 88 miUion, iLe, 47%
of initial estimates. About 75% of project costs incurred relates to civil works for which a 60%
completion rate was achieved. The contribution of the Peruvian Government to the total project
amounte to US$ 45 million, while the cumulative disbursement of the Bank reached US$ 42.6
million, i.e., 46% of the expected amount. The overall cost overrun for civil works amount  to
approximately 10% and this was mainly due to the payment of arreaxs to contractors, resulting from
delays in providing counterpart fuids.
SunbS
15.   Despite partial completion of the rehabilitation and Improvement program enviaged at
appraisal, significant savings in transport costs have been achieved on those sections which were
rehabilitated and improved by paving. The ex-post overall economic rates of return averaged about
24%, lower than the 40% calculated at appraisal; this is essentWaly due to costs overruns which, on
average, amounted to 25%.
16.   Most of the rehailitated road sections, particularly those paved under the project, still have a
fair surface condition after S to 6 years of service. On-going mintenace and resealing programs
financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) as well as the Bank's proposed Transport
Rehabilitation Project now under preparation will help to maintain these road sections in serviceable
condition.
17.   Regarding the sections which were not paved, the sustainability of economic benefits is
somewhat doubtful as these sub-projects were not fully completed, as a result of suspension of the
loan. The surface has been exposed to extensive wear and tear by traffic and rainfall, while litde
maintenance has been performed on these sections. The proposed Transport Reilitation Project
now 2nder preparaton by the Bank contemplates the completion and paving of these sections.
18. Sustainability of the "soft" components of the project, i.e maitenance equipment availability,
strengthening of the highway administration and implementation of special transport sector studies was
not achieved as too little had been implemented in these areas during the course of the Project.

was to constitute a first phase in a long-term highway development plan. However, under pressure
frm the govement to expand and accelerate Bank financing, the project was split into two proposed
successive operations, with the first one scheduled for Immediate processing (para. 1.4), while a
subsequent proposed highway maintenance and rehabilitation project (to be ready by 1983-84)
constituted a follow-up four-year road rehabilitation and maintenance program.
1.3 The Eighth Hi8hway Project was appraised in March 1981, negotiated in December 1981,
approved by tble Board of Executive Directors on February 16, 1982 and signed on June 4, 1982.
Board discussion centered around the peril of inatitutional weaknesses which might frustrate project
Implementation.
C.        ect Objective and Description
1.4   The need for improved access to the- inland regions of Peru, with the urgent requirement for
repair and rehabilitation of the existing road network in support of the country's overall developmnt
efforts were the underlying consideradons in defining the objectives of the project.
As spelled out in the Staff Appraisal Report, the Project was designed to support:
a)    a first tranche of road rehabilitation;
b)    measures to increase enance equipment availability;
c)    strengthening of highway administration;
d)    roads improvements needed for regional development; and
e)    assistance to the transport sector.
1.5   To achieve these objectives, the following components were included in the Project:
1.    civil works, detailed engineering reviews and supervision of construction for:
the rehabilitation of three paved roads having a total length of 195 km and
located in the northern coastal region (mainly on the Pan American Highway);
the improvement of five unpaved roads totalling 400 km in length and located
in the Selva Central and Rio Mayo areas; the improvements comprising the
paving of 286 km and graveling of 114 km.
2.    acquisition of spare parts, improvement of exisdng workshops, repair of maintece
equipment and procurement of light equipment needed for routine maintenance.
3. provision of 17 specialist consultants to serve as in-line and advisory NITC staff for a
period of one and a half to two years, togetror with the implementation of a training
program for the Ministry's operational staff.
4.    performance of specific studies related to the transport sector and technical assista
to strengthen the Ministry's directorates involved in investment planning and
progr-Ing.

D.    Priject Design and Orgion
1.7   The progression of project preparation and app,raisal indicates that the Bank had a clear
undersanding as to the project's planned objectives, and the proposed means to achieve them. The
scope of the project was set with precision, responsibilities for implementation assigned, needed
institutional improvements spelled out, budget requirements quant'led, a detailed plan of action and
implementation timetable drawn up, and project monitoring indices devised. Institutional weaknesses
in the borrower's Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC), particularly in its Directorate
General of Highways (DOC), were recognized as the project's main risks. The possibility that actual
costs could exceed estimates was also seen as a potential risk.
1.8   In order to minimize the risks stemming from institutional weaknesses the project design
foresaw: (1) fairly large technical assistance inputs of consultant services, including a staffi  scheme
with outside exrs filling line positions in DGC; and (2) implementation of improvements in the
organization and procedures of MTC and DGC -particularly the introduction of adequate personnel
grade classifications and salary levels, coupled -Ath personnel training and regular consultations with
the Bank on the subject. The filling of five key technical assistance positions in DGC was made a
condition of loan effectiveness. To safeguard against the risks of possible cost escalation ample
contingency provisions were included in the estimates (26%).
1.9   Detailed evaluation of economic returns was carried out both for the road rehabilitation and
road improvements contemplated by the Project. They were found to lie in the range of 28%-46%
and 18%-63%, respectively. Consequendy, proceeding with the project was found well justifled.
The econornic justification of proposed measures for strengthening maintenance and insfitutional
improvements was not evaluated in detail, but on the basis of comparison with 3imilar operations such
measures were deemed to yield higher benefis than rehabilitation works.
1.10  On the whole the project, when presented to the Board, ,ppeared well conceived, responsive
to Peru's developme-t needs, technically sound, economically and financially feasible. In retrospect,
however, the project came out far from meeting its origv-al expectations. MTC was constained by
civil service regulations and far from readv for the institutional changes envisaged. The large



differences between public and private sector salary levels turned techical assisace, and particularly
the recruitment of outside experts to DGC, into a difficult issue. These were complexities in
nstitltion buiding which neither the Bank nor the Borrower had correctly anticipated. Project imple-
mentation was at. affected by the lack of availability of local funds. The special accounts set up
under the project as a device to facilitate timely availatility of local funds filed to function, iu a
situation where goverment funds were short and decreasing.
E.    ErJet lementation
1.11   The project had a slow start because of MTC's management and staff problems, and lack of
commitment to institutional reforms (para 1.14 and 1.15). Further delays resulted from the need to
restucture the project under the Emergency Relief Program (paras. 1.12 and 1.13). Once atitudes
toward institional reforms improved and management problems eased (para. 1.15) the rate of project
implementation quickened, albeit still trailing far behind original expectations. With the increase in
letting of contracts and the start of workm, the next stumbling block in the way of progress arose from
the lack of local funds, due to the deteriorating economic situation which beset the country at that
time (paras 1.18 and 1.19). The fatal blow to the project came when the Bank suspended all
disbursements in Peru on May 5, 1987. At that point civil works were about 40% implemented and
atual disbursements had reached approximately US$35.5 million. The original schedule had set 1986
as the date for full completion.
()    Loan effeciveness
1.12 The terminal date for meeting the conditions of loan effectiveness was specified in the Loan
Agreement as September 7, 1982. Filling of five key management positions in DGC was a condition
of effectiveness (para 1.06), but the first supervWion missions (MUarch and July 1982) reported
reluctance and no progress in the matter of hiring the requisite experts. Recruiting outsiders to
managerial positions with salaries much higher than thosc of the civil service scales escalated into a
political as well as a financial problem.
1.13 It took pressure and intense negotiations, and three extensions of the effectiveness date (to
December 7, 1982, January 31, 83 and March 17, 1983) to bring these problems under some control.
As a pragmatic arrangement, four experts were hired and seconded to MTC by Corporaci6a
Financiera de Desarrollo (COFIDE), an agency of the Ministry of Economy and Finance which also
contracted personnel under the Public Sector Management project (Loan 2204-PE). The Bank waived
the requirement of hiring of the fifth expert before the loan could be declared effective. The Bank
also relaxed its insistence that the experts fill line positions. Under these conditions, fte loan was
declared effective on March 17, 1983, six month behind the original schedule.
(11)    Restrucuring of project under the Emergency Relief Progi %m
1.14 Soon after the problem of loan effectiveness was resolved, severe natural disasters struck
Peru, creating an emergency situation. The most serious of these natal events were extensive
flooding in the Northern part of the country, substantial landslides occurring in the Center, and
persistent drought in the South, causing severe damage to infrastructure and crops. The disasters
came at an especially unforunmate time, when availability of Governme  funds was already shrinking
due to the slowdown of economic activity.



-5-
1.15  Responding to the emergency sitation the Bank focused Its efforts on redirecting the use of
available funds under outstanding loans to assist in the reconstruction effort. This entailed some
minor changes in projact content such as the inclusion of the rebabilitation of two local airports and
part of the severely damaged Pan American highs ay, increases in the cost sharing levels, and some
simplification of procurement arrangements. The proposed amendments of the project to reflect the
changes were approved by the Loard of Executive Directors on December 16, 1983 and formally
notified to the Government by letter of February 10, 1984.
fit)   Evolution of project until general suspension of Bank disbursements in Peru
Managemet and staffing problems
1.16 A recurring topic reported by Bank supervision nmssions relates to the persistent personnel
and organizational weaknesses in MTC, and the difficulties faced with the implementation f the
technical assistance programs designed to strengthen MTC. The personnel problem reached crisis
proportions when, at the end of 1983, MTC personnel went on strike (December 1, 1983, Bank
Supervision Report). The Bank reassessed the management problems obstructing implementation of
the project, and in a letter to MTC dated May 1, 1984, warned about its risks and costs.
1.17  From then on, MTC deployed extensive efforts to ease management problems.
Remunerations for government employees were increased by 130%, and the JulylAugust 1984 Bank
supervision mission reported encouraging trends. A working committee was established within DGC
and prepared a document entitled: "Specific Proposals to IBRD on the Institutional Strengthening of
fie Directorate General of Highways" (Propuesta Especffica al BIRF Sobre Reforaamiento
Fisfitucional de la Administracin de Caminos). This document reflected a watershed in attitudes
tonvard the management problem, though practical solutions still were hard to come by.
1.18 Progress, along with efforts to strengthen MTC during the remaining period of the project,
remained mixed. The propositions put forward in the "Propuesta" for improvements in the structure
and staffing of the highway administraon remained on the Government's agenda, though little could
be done effectively in the generally declining politico-economic environment of the country.
Implementation of the technical assistance program improved with the hiring of experts throtgh the
mechanism of COFIDE, (Corporacidn Financiera de Desarollo), which in turn expedited the
implementation of the project. The intagration of the experts into the administrative structure, and
productive use of their services, however, remained less than optimal.
Overal Ug=ors and disbursement
1.19  Project implementation for the most part proved difficult and time consuming, as explained
before. The first time an encouraging trend was noted was in mid-1984 (para 1.15). By then, the
project was already two years behind schedule and less than ten percent complete, against fifty
percent in the original projections.
1.20  On July 28, 1985 a new administration took office, coMmitted to the reacdvation of the
project. A more aggressive management team in MTC replaced the previous one. The new
management boosted the project's rate of progress on all fronts. Technical assistance positions were
filled, consuting firms for studies, engineering and supervision were appointed, and contracs for
construction works and equipment supplies were let. The November 1986 supervision mission



-6-
reported the appointment of a capable and experienced Highway Director in June 1986, and
confirmed the improving trend in technical project implementation.
1.21 Improvements in management, however, were not parallelled with commitments of matching
local fimds needed to carry on with the increasing momentum gained in project implementation. The
resulting payment problems with contractors led tc tme suspension of works for half of 1985 and also
contributed to arrears which amounted sometimes up to 25% of the original contract cost. A passing
respite occurred briefly in 1986, when sufficient counterpart funds were allocated to speed up the
execution of ongoing works (May/June 1986 supervision mission report). Subsequent missions,
however, had to contend with the availability of local funds as the main pioblem for project
implementation.
1.22  The schedule of estimated disbursements in the appraisal report though consistent with
standard disbursement profile for Peru, in all sectors, projected an optimistic rate exceeding that of
the average profile applicable to highway projects in Latin America. Disbursements of loan proceeds
were expected to be 100% complete by end of PY 1986, as compared with 77% according to the
profile. Actual disbursements lagred far behind original estimates, amoundng to only 32%. The
comparative record of disbursements is shown in Part m, 3.
1.23 The loan agreement was amended three tin.3s. The first amendment was signed on September
9, 1983 to establish a Revolving Fund and to amend the amounts and percentages of expenditures in
the various categories of Schedule 1. The loan agreement was subsequendy amended on February 19,
1984, on account of the Emergency Relief Program (paras. 1.12 and 1.13). On June 24, 1985 the
loan agreement was further amended to continue until December 31, 1985 the application of the
disbursement pcentages set forth in the September 9, 1983 amendment.
1.24 On May 5, 1987 the Bank suspended, for country reasons, the disbursements on Its loan
portfolio in Peru. The suspension meant a severe blow to the project at a time when implementation
was on the right track and was makdng progress towards meeting newly agreed targets. Project
completion overall stood at about 40% at this point.
(iv)  TFha phase of project from suspension of disbursements to cancellaton of loan
1.25  Suspension of disbursements halted the project's momeatum built up during the preceding two
years. The Government carried on with execution of works and services already contracted, but no
firther engagements were made. To substitute finsncing for the suspended loan the Government
plamed to pay half of the expenses for civil works through public investment bonds.
1.26 The Bank continued to supervise the project, and the last supervision mission took place in
March 1988. At that time the project was still progressing, although with difficutties. The mission
reviewed possible actions needed to revitalize the project in case Bank disbursements were resumed,
including a one and a half year extension of the closing date. By the end of 1989, the physical
progress of the Civil works had reached approximately 57% and disbursements amounted to about
US$ 42 millions1.
Although  e Bak's loan was officially suspended in May 1987, commitments for an amount of
approAmately US$7 miion were paid between May 1987 and August 1992.



-7-
1.27 A legitimate question to ask is what the likely fate of the project would have been, had
disbursements not been suspended. From discussions with Bank staff, indications are that the
momentum of the project would have come to an end. The growing problems country-wide with lack
of local funding, combined with DGC's declining ability to hold a lid on costs, most likely would
have led to a new series of difficulties in project implementation.
1.28 By mid-1990 Peru initiated restoration of financial and institutional relations with the Bank,
and the Bank reassessed the disposition of projects with potentW for successful execution and
undisbursed loan funds avdlable. For this purpose, the Bank decided to keep the Eighth Highway
Project open. In June 1991, the Bank mounted a mission to Peru with the aim to define a short term
rehabilitation program for the transport sector. In subsequent consultations with the Peruvian
Government, the decision was made to cancel the undisbursed balance of the loan since the project
would have required a major reformulation in order to reflect current conditions and priorities. The
cancellation was formally nodfied to the Govemment per telex dated Jamnary 30, 1992, effective May
1, 1991.
F.     rject Results
1.29  The project implementation history would indicate that, in technical terms, the project was
well conceived as a prelude to a larger follow-up operation which would address the long term
development needs of Peru's highway sector (para 1.2). Due to adverse political and economic
developments, however, the project fell short of achieving this objective.
1.30 Physical implementation of the project was well under way in 1987 when the Bank suspended
disbursements (para 1.22). Information received from the Ministry of Transport and Commuicon
regarding the outcome of the activities in progress at that time and also at final loan closure, i.e., at
the end of 1991, are summarized in the following tables. It can be seen that ultimately civil works
for rehabilitation and improvements of roads (including design and supervision) have been completed
to about 60% of targeted objectives while the overall institutional measures aiming at strengthening
the highway administraion were only halfway fulfilled. Very litde was achieved in the areas of
improving maienance equipment availability and of enhancing the capabilities of the Ministry's
technical engineering or planning directorates (mcluding the soils and materials unit). In the transport
sector studies component, practically nothing was implemented.

0.    Poect Susainabity
1.31   Civil works for road rehabilitation or improvements constituted almost 90% of the total
financial scope of the project. Economic reevaluations carried out for the sections of roads (approx.
290 kIn) which have been rehabilitated or improved by paving show that taking only into account
savings in vehicle operating costs, the ex-post rates of return are upwards of 12%, ranging from 14%
to 34% (Part m-6). Traffic volumes increased at an annual rate ranging from 2% to 4%, between
appraisal (1982) and 1992. The assumption, at appraisal, for growth rates was between 3% and 5%.
The rates of return suggest that at least for these sections the project has achieved, so far, an
acceptable level of net benefits. Sustainability is not at risk as the rehabilitated segments of the
project are now being maintained, essentially through an IDB financed program, while the improved
sections, recently observed to be still in fair to good condition (mostly requiring a seal coat), are
being addressed by a Transport Rehabilitation Project proposed for Bank financing.
1.32 The sections of the road improvement program which were not completed (i.e., not paved)
have suffered from traffic and weather aggression. As indicated by low ex-post economic rates of
return, their sustinability may be questionable. This problem is being addressed by the proposed
Transport Rehabilitation Project which contemplates, in a near future, the paving of these sections
with drainage improvemens. The detailed engineering studies carried out during this project are
being profitably used for that purpose as they only require updating.
1.33   The susainable economic benefits of the other components of the project, i.e., maintenance
equipment availability, strengthening of the highway administration and special studies is doubtful as
very little was accomplished in these areas during the course of the project.
1.34 Finally, the project raises questions about organizational and managerial effectiveness In
Peru's highway administraton, and personnel policies in the public sector. It prompted a study which
resulted in recommendations for reforms in MTC and the highway administration, subsequendy
endorsed by the Government. Through these actions, the project exercised significant impact on
Govemment atitudes tward institon building.
H.    Bank Peform
1.35 The Bank performed reasonably well its responsibilities in regard to the project from inception
to suspension of disbursements. Preparation and appraisal were thorough and responsive to the
country's needs. Project risks were correctdy diagnosed. Nevertheless, the Bank underestimated the
complexities of institution building and could not have foreseen the political developments in the
country. Under the presres to move forward with the project the Bank may have also overlooked
the implementation problems encountered under its previous operations in the transport sector.
1.36   Supevision missions were regular and timely, representing, on average, 14 staff weeks per
year, i.e, approximately one mission every four months. The missions focussed on implementation
problems and their solutions. The Bank displayed flexibility in keeping the project open for a long
time after suspension of disbursements, until cancellation (para 1.25), in the expectation of a possible
resumption of project implementation.



-10-
I.    Borrower
1.37 The Borrower had a clear concept of its development objectives, in the highway sector and of
the assistance expected from the Bank. However, the Borrower failed to recognize the limitations of
its capacity to adequately implement the project and like the Bank underestimated the complexity of
instiuion building. Furthermore, adequate local funding of the project remained an intractable
problem beyond the Borrower's abiity (para 1.19).
J.    Project Relationship
1.38   At Project identification and preparation phase, the relationship between the Bank and the
Borrower was smooth and constructive. In the early phase of project implementation, however, a
communication problem arose between the Bank and the Borrower over technical assisance and
management issues (para 1.14 - 1.15). As progress ensued in overcoming these initial problems,
compliance with loan covenants improved and reached a satisfactory level (see Part 111,7).
K.    Project Documion ad Data
1.39 The Staff Appraisal Report, Loan Agreement, supervision reports and LAC Information
Cmeter project fies provided the information necessary to identify the critical aspects in the life of the
project for the purpose of the preparation of Part I and Part m of this Project Completion Report.
Information on the latter part of project implementation which show the aggregate fnal results of the
project were obtained from MTC in September and December 1992.
1.40 The Staff Appraisal Report was well prepared and provided a useful framework for the under-
standing of project objectives, components, and procedures. It included a detailed program for the
monitoring of project implementaion and performance. Follow-up project reporting, however,
remained erratic and fell short in many respects. Reporting lacked the focus necessary to serve as a
useful management tool, an aggregate portrayal of progress, and the status of the project at any time.
L.    Lessons Leamed
1.41   MTC showed a strong reluctance to accept consultant staff in line and advisory positions at
salaries significantdy higher than those paid to its own staff. This is not an unexpected reaction where
the disparities between salaries of agency and consultant staff become too large. Future technical
assistance programs should mimize the use of advisors in line positions, and should explore the
possibility of 2lling advisory positions or clearly defined specific tasks with local consultants enaged
on a fixed-term basis or with bilateral technical assistance agents. Whether expatriate or local
experts, they both should work closely with ministry's line managers and provide training with their
staff in order to strengthen the existing institutional framework during the tramsiton period.
1.42   The main lesson learned from the project stems from the experience with instion building,
which was the principal problem area of the project, having as its object the improved management
and staffing in MTC's highway administration (para 1.14). The difficulties encountered tend to
suggest that institution building, regardless of how well intentioned, cannot be effected as an enclave
undetaking in one Ministry, in isolation from the general country context. Futre projects should at
least make sure that an efficient project management and coordinating unit is set up, preferably within
the Ministry, using private consultant services Oocal, if feasible) to ensure timely inplenentaon and



-1 1-
adequate monitoring of project results. Furthermore, and although the project was not successful in
achieving its institution building objective, this issue should continue to be given priority if MTC is to
overcome the decline in capacity it has experienced over the last decade. Institution building may
require a greater reliance on the private sector and should be conceived as a progressive undertaking,
the accomplishment of key elements being made a condition for loan effectiveness, with a detailed
review of progress at the Mid-term Review.
1.43   The lack of avaiability of counterpart local funds was a recurrent problem in project
implementation, (para. 1.19). This problem is a common denominator in a broad section of Bank
projects. Experience has shown that legal obligations, special accounts, revolving funds, and other
similar devices set up under projects may not be sufficient to ensure the timely availability of local
funds. Perhaps, Bank's participation and cost sharing percentages on key components such as project
design, supervision and monitoring, which for this project ranged between 30% and 70%, should be
increased to 100% in order to ensure that lack of matching funds does not affect the implementation
of these critical elements.
1.44   Another lesson that can be drawn from the experience of this project is that the project was
conceived to move at once on too large a front. Future Bank involvement in the Peruvian highway
sector should focus on progressively attainable objectives more in tune with MTC's abso.ptive
capacities and should stress the need for early initiation of studies or actions leading to better planning
(road inventory, pavement surface surveys, traffic counts and axle weighing, etc.) and a better
identification of the network needs.
1.45   Finally the Bank lending program and the prospects for this project were predicated on an
optimistic macro-economic outlook of economic growth and prosperity during the 1980's. The
unfolding of events, however, did not hear out these optimistic predictions. The country's economic
performance in reality turned down, and the project fell victim to the worsenmig maco-ecowmic
conditions which resulted from that decline. Under these circumstances, it is notable that the project
was not a complete failure. It has tangible physical achievements to its credit that now constte the
basis for the formulation and design of the Bank's prnposed Transport Rehabilitation Project.

PART II- PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S P2
2.1    As a conseqi'ence of erroneous policies of protectionism and reliance on the public sector
during the progressively last twenty years, the country's economic crisis became more accentuated.
Public sector was the first one to be affected by the crisis, resulting in technical and administrative
deficiencies in the state's organization, associated with a growing deterioration of salary levels of civil
servans and increasing insittional weaknesses.
2.2   In order to minimize risks and ensure an efficient use of the Loan proceeds for the Eighth
Highway Project, the Bank planned to strengthen the Directorate General of Highways (DGC) by
providing technical assistance, using local and foreign consultants. Some of the consultants were
intended to fill In key positions in the structral organization of DGC.
2.3    Regrettably, during the first years of operation of the Eighth Highway Project, the plan did
not receive the support of MTC staff, essentially because the technical assistance was not adequately
designed to avoid conflicts such as duplication of functions or responsibilities, interferences, loss of
authority, professional disputes, etc. Furthermore, there was difficulty in acceptng that the experts
would be paid salaries disproportionately higher than those of the directors or technical staff of DGC.
The differences in salaries being even greater when the consultants were expatriates. Finlly, and
approximately two and a half years after the effective date of the Eighth Highway Project, this
problem was resolved and by the second half of 1985, with the Bank's approval, five local consultants
were appointed.
2.4    As a result of those problems and also because of delays due to lengthy bureaucratic
procedures of the Mimistries of Transport and Finance as well as of the Bank, the Project started and
progressed slowly. The procurement procedures of MTC and the Bank were, for example,
responsible for the long process initiated in Januay 1985 for the purchase of micro computers which
finaly were never procured. Another example was the time taken to make the Loan effective, the
actual date of effectiveness occurred in March 1983 while the Loan was signed in December 1981.
2.5    On the other hand, MTC overestimated and did not adequately assess its capacity to fulfill the
objectives and obligations of the Bank's Loan. MTC's capabilities decreased even further when the
natural disasers hit Peru at the beginning of the 1980's, compelling the Government to declare a state
of emergency across a major part of the country. As a result, some of the human, materid and
economic resources of MTC were redirected to support the efforts needed for the rehabilitation and
safeguard of the transport infrastructure affected by the natural disasters. At the same time, the Bank
reassigned part of the Loan to assist in the reconstruction efforts.
2.6 Ihe late start and slow progress of the Project were also due to the continuous strikes called
by the technical and administrative personnel of MTC, for salary increase claims. The strikes lasted
for severa months and among other problems, impeded payments to consultants and contactors
engaged in the Project as well as delaying the solution to tedhnical problems or disputes and the
approval of works.
2.7    Unfortnately, during this period of implementation of Jhe Project, not only was MTC
personnel on strike, but also a mber of other pulic services such as PETOPERU and supliers of
2  Prt It is a lilg ftrlon of te Boowe's ontribution.



-13-
materials for highway construction. Furthermore, in the vicinity of the Project sites, the stikes also
resulted in blcAking of road accesses thereby causing significant shortages of supplies.
2.8 The economic crisis, the emergency situation and the occurrence of strikes aggravated the lack
of counterpart fituds which motvated contractors to slow down the pace of construction or in some
instances suspend the works altogether.
2.9   In response to these events, the cotractors requested an extension of the contractal
construction periods as well as the recognition and acceptance of additional conigency costs as
provided for in the Conditions of Contract with the result that the works suffered significant time and
cost overruns.
2.10  To objectively illustate the impact of the above mentioned problems on the output of the
Project, the following table shows for each of the three sections of the Tarapoto-Rioja highway the
final ratio of actual to contractual time and cost figures at loan closure:
Section     I            II           m
Time        2.06          3.57         3.70
cost        1.50          1.12         1.28
2.11 Of these three sections, only the first one has been fully completed while the second and third
sections to 81% and 70% completion respectively. Had these been fully implemented, the ime and
cost overruns would have been greater than indicated above. As this highway is located in a zone of
narco-tefforism, the time and cost increases were higher than for the other highways included in the
project. Physical achievements (civil works) of the project, as of May 1987, and percent annual
progress from 1985 to 1991 are summarize in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 respectively.
Peim ce of theBw
2.12   During the implementation of the project the performance of the Borrower was not as
adequate as should be. However, both MTC and the Government in general are presendy very
receptive and give high priority to support and assistance from intational organizations.
Relationship between the Bank and MTC
2.13   The relationships between the Bank and the Ministry of Transport were not good during the
first half of the 1980's. While they improved thereafter, the economic crisis in Peru became worst.
and lack of counterpart funds resulted in the suspension of loan disbursements by the Bank in May
1987.

Comments*:
1. At appraisal, an average rate of constrction of 5 to 7 km/month, per contract, was assumed
(average length per contract: 50 kn). When contracts for improvement works were awarded,
generally during year 1984, it was expected that, prcnat, a pace of construction of
approximately 3 km/month would be achieved. In reality, delays due to a  nber of causes-
essentially to lack of countrpart funds followed by paralysis of the works-resulted in an actual
pace of construction of about 0.5 to 1 km/month.
2. Rehabiiitation works on the coastal region (Piura-Paita and La Brea-Talara-Cancas) were
substantialy completed by the end of 1987. Improvement works on the Selva Central and Rio
Mayo areas totalling 185 km started only towards mid 1984 and were stopped incomplete by mid-
1988, i.e. extending over a total duration period of 4 years.
