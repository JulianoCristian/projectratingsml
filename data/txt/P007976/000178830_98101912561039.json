provide support for key elements of the Government's\n            expanded highway investment program and to strengthen the\n            Ministry of Transport and Communications' Highways\n            Directorate. The project would include: (i) rehabilitation\n            of 195 km of severely deteriorated paved roads; (ii)\n            improvement of another 400 km of unpaved roads, to a gravel\n            or paved two lane standard; and (iii) assistance for\n            strengthening DGC's road maintenance operations through\n            provision of equipment, spare parts, workshop improvements,\n            technical assistance and training staff. In order to improve\n            the quality of management in DGC, the project also provides\n            for contracting experienced engineers and managers to fill\n            senior positions. Finally, the project also includes\n            detailed engineering for future road rehabilitation and\n            improvement and technical assistance for preparing a\n            regional development project and for executing three\n            transport sector related studies."}, "docdt": "1982-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
