Key Outcome Indicators        Reforms in public finance
by end of DPL series1
                              Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) implementation
                              More strategic allocation of budget resources and more predictable and
                              transparent budget execution. Measured by the reduction in the structural fiscal
                              deficit from 8.5% of GDP in 2008 to less than 3% in 2011; the reduction in
                              variance between the approved budget and actual expenditures for major
                              economic categories from 27% in 2008 to less than 10 percent in 2011; the
                              disclosure of planned and actual spending for major capital spending in budget
                              project documentation; and the reduction in budget rectifications from five in
                              2008 to maximum two in 2011.
                              Public Sector Pay
                              Reduced public wage bill, and more transparent and performance-based system of
                              public pay. Measured by the reduction of the public wage bill from 9.4% of GDP
                              in 2009 to below 8% in 2011; and a base salary amounting to at least 70% of the
                              average total compensation of public servants in 2011, compared with less than
                              70% before 2008.
                              Health
                              Increased fiscal sustainability and efficiency of public health. Measured by the
                              introduction of a co-payment system as of 2012; a reduction in the number of
                              hospitals by over 60 from end-2009 to end- 2011; a 5% reduction in the rate of
                              admissions to acute care facilities from 2008 to 2011; the increased proportion of
                              generic drugs from 20% in 2009 to 25% in 2011; and an increase of over 40% in
                              revenues generated by tobacco excise in 2011 relative to 2008.
                              Education
                              Better fiscal management and increased efficiency in public expenditures to
                              provide better services and greater equity in access. Measured by an increase in
                              the average class size from 20.6 in 2008/2009 to 21.5 in 2011/2012.

      Most outcomes cover the lifetime of the DPL. Reforms are expected to continue over the medium term.

                                                       ii
                      Reforms in social protection
                      Social Assistance
                      Increased coverage of better targeted program (Guaranteed Minimum Income—
                      GMI) and improved targeting of other programs. Measured by a 85% targeting
                      accuracy of GMI in 2011, from 81.5% in 2009, the reduction of unpaid GMI
                      benefits as share of due payments to entitled beneficiaries from 20 percent in
                      2009 to less than 5 percent in 2011, and increased targeting of family benefits for
                      the poorest quintile from 59.5% in 2009 to over 65% in 2011.
                      Pensions
                      Greater sustainability of the public pension system. Measured by a reduction
                      equivalent to 0.5% of GDP of the 2012 projected fiscal deficit (from 1.7% percent
                      in the absence of a pension reform to 1.2%, controlling for the impact of the
                      special pensions); the inclusion of the special pensions in the public system; and
                      by a 40% reduction in the number of new invalidity pensions in 2011 relative to
                      2009.
                      Reforms in financial sector
                      Strengthened contingency planning to reduce potential vulnerabilities and
                      improve resilience and functioning of the financial sector over the long term.
                      Measured by a capital adequacy ratio of over 12% at end-2011 compared with a
                      8% minimum requirement; the increase in the share of corporate insolvency cases
                      handled through reorganization proceedings from 1.5% of total insolvency cases
                      in March 2009 to 3% in 2011; and the capacity of the banking sector to avoid
                      failures between 2008-2011 and maintain a 90% exposure of the nine main
                      international banks operating in Romania relative to 2008.
                      Improved functioning of financial markets through regulatory and supervisory
                      changes. Measured by the joint supervision of financial conglomerate groups by
                      relevant regulators as of October 2011.
Program Development   The objective of the proposed DPL3 is to support the Government’s reforms in
Objective(s) and      fiscal management, social protection and the financial sector, and position
Contribution to CPS   Romania to emerge from the economic and financial crisis on a stronger footing,
                      and resume and sustain convergence to the living standards of more advanced EU
                      economies and withstand better any further shocks. These reforms aim to: (i)
                      strengthen public expenditure management, a key weakness and root cause of
                      Romania’s vulnerability to the financial crisis; (ii) cushion the impact of the crisis
                      on the poor and vulnerable by enhancing the efficiency and targeting of social
                      assistance, and improving the fiscal sustainability of pensions; and (iii) minimize
                      risks of a domestic financial sector crisis by addressing current and potential
                      vulnerabilities as well as strengthening regulation and supervision for a more
                      resilient and well-functioning financial sector in the long term.

                      The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-13 focuses on three pillars: i)
                      economic growth and competitiveness; ii) public sector reform; iii) social and
                      spatial inclusion. This DPL series focuses on reforms to improve fiscal
                      management, enhance social protection, modernize agriculture, and strengthen the
                      financial sector, and is fully aligned with the CPS pillars. The CPS Progress
                      Report (CPSPR) presented to the Board together with this DPL3 maintains this
                      focus and the DPL program remains critical in achieving the CPS objectives.

Risks and Risk           Risks are significant, and the authorities are taking steps to anticipate and mitigate
Mitigation               them.
                         Economic risks that could affect DPL3 include the increasingly uncertain and
                         turbulent global economic environment and the significant risk of a renewed
                         recession owing to sovereign debt crisis and problems in Eurozone countries.
                         This could suppress demand for exports and capital inflows, put pressure on fiscal
                         and external balances and undermine growth prospects. Romania’s external debt
                         could increase its vulnerability to external shocks. In addition, domestic risks
                         include the fiscal adjustment and state-owned enterprise reforms, and slow
                         mobilization and absorption of EU structural and cohesion funds. These risks
                         could affect domestic demand and economic recovery.
                         Political risks stem from the structure of the coalition government which forces at
                         times compromises on the scope and timing of reforms, and implications of
                         upcoming local and parliamentary elections in 2012. Fiscal austerity measures
                         have increased social dissatisfaction, and future policy reforms may further fuel it.
                         These risks are mitigated partially by the determination of the Government to
                         continue implementing the reform agenda agreed with the World Bank under the
                         DPL series, and supported by an extension of the multilateral support program
                         with the IMF and the EC until 2013 in the form of a precautionary agreement,
                         which provides protection against financial distress. In addition, government has
                         expressed interest in a new DPL with the deferred draw-down option as a
                         financial buffer. Romania’s incipient economic recovery as of 2011 and improved
                         macroeconomic balances should provide some cover, and position the country to
                         better withstand external pressures.
                         The content of the program also mitigates risks. In the banking sector, the
                         program supported by the IMF includes in-depth examination and recapitalization
                         requirements in the event of capital shortfalls, as well as the strengthening of
                         regulatory and supervisory powers. Under the DPL program, these measures have
                         been reinforced through reforms strengthening contingency planning. These
                         included the preparation of a strategic action plan to govern potential
                         interventions of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) and the Ministry of Public
                         Finance (MoPF) to sustain financial sector stability and the establishment of a
                         framework to facilitate debt restructuring (implemented under DPL1) and
                         encourage adequate restructuring of viable impaired loans (supported under
                         DPL2). Finally, the fiscal reforms implemented under the overall IFI program are
                         reducing fiscal pressures both in the short and medium term, and thus contributing
                         to lowering external financing needs.

                                  I.       INTRODUCTION

1.     This Program Document (PD) describes the proposed third loan in a
program of three Development Policy Loans (DPLs) to Romania for a total amount
of € 1 billion. The first DPL (DPL1) disbursed €300 million in October 2009, and the
second DPL (DPL2) disbursed €300 million in June 2011. The proposed third DPL
(DPL3) would disburse €400 million in FY12. The proposed Bank operation reinforces
and complements programs financed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
European Union (EU) which were completed in April 2011, as well as the successor IMF
and EC precautionary financial assistance agreements that were reached in May 2011,
for a two-year period. Consistent with the precautionary agreements that shifted focus
from crisis management to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and enhanced
competitiveness, the DPL3 has strengthened the structural policy reform agenda adopted
by the Romanian authorities (see Letter of Development Policy, LDP, Annex 1).

2.      The DPL3 program supports progress towards a sustainable fiscal
framework, improved quality and efficiency of health and education services, the
modernization of the social assistance system, and financial sector stability. As
outlined in the Program Documents for DPL1 and DPL22, the program supports
Government’s structural reforms in three key areas: a) improving fiscal sustainability and
management of public finances in general, and in the health and education sectors in
particular; b) enhancing social protection systems so that they address the immediate
needs of the poor and vulnerable and provide sustainable social protection over the long
term; and c) strengthening contingency planning in, and the resilience of, the financial
sector. This document does not discuss in detail the general features of the program to be
supported by the DPL series, which were covered in DPL1 and DPL2 documents, but
focuses instead on developments under the DPL3.

3.       The DPL series is central to Bank’s engagement in Romania as highlighted in
the Progress Report on the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which is planned
to be presented to the Board in tandem with this DPL3 operation. While financing a
relatively small share of the €20 billion support package extended by the IMF, the EC,
the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and
the European Investment Bank (EIB), hereafter referred to as International Financial
Institutions (IFIs), the DPL series targets structural reforms which will improve
Romania’s medium to long term economic outlook. Bank financing of a results-based
operation in social assistance3 and a possible operation in health, implementation of
Government’s action plans with EC financing derived from the recommendations of the
Functional Reviews (FRs), technical assistance, and proactive restructuring of the IBRD
portfolio will enhance the DPL3 impact and improve the sustainability of reforms.

4.     Fiscal and structural reform measures taken by the Government have
created a sounder macroeconomic environment and strengthened Romania’s long
term growth prospects, but there are significant downside risks and capacity
bottlenecks. Despite the slow economic recovery, an ambitious fiscal adjustment
equivalent to 4.6 percent of GDP has halved the 9 percent of GDP structural fiscal deficit

recorded in 2008, and put Romania on track to meet the European Union (EU) Maastricht
(SGP) fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by 2012. Also, the economy has stopped
contracting, and modest 1.5 percent growth is projected in 2011. However, downside
risks have lately increased. The most critical risks are external and they have lately
considerably increased with the turmoil in the Eurozone and the persisting global crisis.
These risks are compounded by sluggish recovery of domestic demand and low
mobilization of EU structural and cohesion funds. In addition, there are political risks
linked to upcoming elections in 2012, social risks associated with the fiscal austerity
package and proposed reforms in health, social assistance and social insurance, and
economic risks linked to persistent weak aggregate demand, global economic slowdown
and regional financial markets turbulence. There are also concerns about central and local
government administrative capacity and strategic coordination of policies.

5.      The IMF and EC have extended their support to fiscal stabilization and
structural reforms with new 24-month precautionary arrangements, which partly
mitigate these risks. Both the previous Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF and
the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the EU were successfully completed.
The IMF Board approved the Seventh Review under the SBA with Romania in March
2011 and released the seventh tranche of the program, bringing total disbursements to
SDR 10,569 million. At the request of the Government, the final eighth tranche of the
SBA (SDR 874 million) was treated as precautionary. A new SBA approved in March
2011 would make available an additional SDR 3,090 million, also on a precautionary
basis. The EC also released the last tranche of the previous €5 billion program in April
2011, and approved a precautionary assistance program of €1.4 billion under the Balance
of Payments (BoP) facility.

6.       The Government has demonstrated strong and steady commitment to the
crisis management and reform agenda. It has implemented a large fiscal retrenchment
and the agreed structural reform agenda, and pledged publicly and in meetings with the
IFIs its firm intention to continue implement its program of macroeconomic management
and reforms. The President has issued frequent public statements in support of
Government’s reform program and endorsed publicly the programs with IFIs. The
Parliament has adopted in a timely manner legislation pertaining to reforms. Political
risks have been so far well managed by the Government, and mitigated by efforts to
increase consultations with the opposition parties and other stakeholders. The current
governing coalition has stood firmly behind the Government’s reform program.

                                A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

7.      Romania entered the global crisis in 2008 with high growth rates, but also
large macroeconomic imbalances. Real GDP grew at over 6.5 percent per year on
average during 2003 to 2008. At the same time, the 2008 external current account deficit
reached almost 12 percent of GDP, the trade deficit almost 14 percent, and the fiscal
deficit almost 5 percent of GDP when measured on a conventional cash basis and almost
8 percent of GDP on a structural basis. The 2008 inflation stood at almost 8 percent
(Table 1). The crisis hit Romania hard in the last quarter of 2008, when the economy
contracted by almost 13 percent compared to an annualized 9 percent growth in the
previous quarter. Financial markets were vulnerable to the global financial crisis due to
liquidity constraints. Fiscal revenues plummeted, and Romania faced the prospects of a
fiscal deficit spiraling out of control in 2009.

8.       The crisis depressed severely growth, demand and investment, but may be
abating (Table 1). The economy contracted by 8.4 percent in real terms in 2009-2010,
demand declined by almost 14 percent and gross domestic investment contracted by over
25.3 percent in Euro terms compared to 2008. Inflation reached 8 percent by end-2010 as
food prices rose because of flooding, higher world market prices, the VAT rate increase
of 5 percentage points, and increased administered prices. Economic performance since
the last quarter of 2010 suggests, however, that recession may have bottomed out. For the
first time in two years the GDP in the fourth quarter of 2010 stopped contracting. Export
growth also accelerated to 17.1 percent, and averaged 13.1 percent for the year. Growth
continued during the first half of 2011, in spite of slackening demand and weaker growth
in industrial production and exports. GDP growth reached 1.7 percent in the first quarter
and 1.4 percent in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis. The excellent agricultural
harvest is mitigating declining domestic demand and slowing export demand, and
economic growth is projected at 1.5 percent in 2011. The job market has stabilized, and
unemployment declined, although it remains high at 7.5 percent in mid-2011.

9.      The 2010 budget deficit was reduced through strong fiscal austerity
measures, but challenges remain. The deficit reached 6.5 percent of GDP in 2010 –
lower than the deficit in 2009, but is still considerable - in spite of an austerity package
implemented as of July 1, 2010, consisting of tax increases and expenditure cuts. This
adjustment package arrested the rise in deficits. The Government managed legal
challenges to proposed measures4 and was able to find alternative measures. Revenue
boosting measures included the increase in the VAT rate from 19 to 24 percent, the
introduction of a turnover tax on medical suppliers, significant increases in property
taxes, and the reintroduction of taxes on bank deposit interest and capital gains. Tax
enforcement benefitted from the introduction of indirect control methods and of
electronic filing for large and medium-sized tax contributors. Expenditure cuts included a
25 percent nominal reduction in public sector wages, the elimination of most public
sector wage supplements, a further reduction in public sector staffing, a reduction in
untargeted transfer payments, and cuts in outlays for goods and services. Cuts in

          personnel compensation wiped out in good part the 2005-2008 pay increases, and by end-
          2010 public employment was 5 percent lower than two years before. Despite these
          measures expenditures reached almost 40 percent of GDP, against revenues at 33 percent
          of GDP. Fiscal difficulties were due in part to the inability of state-owned enterprises
          (SOEs) to meet obligations to the budget (including contributions to health and social
          insurance). Government arrears, generated primarily by SOEs and local administrations,
          were reduced from RON 1.8 billion in June 2010 to RON 1.1 billion (around Euro 260
          million) at end-December 2010, compared with a target of RON 0.5 billion.

external debt to 74.7 percent of GDP by end 2010 (from 51.8 percent in 2008), and
to 209 percent of exports (up from 170 percent in 2008, but lower than the 224.5
percent recorded in 2009). Public debt increased by end-2010 to 28.7 percent of GDP,
from 11.8 percent in 2008, and the public sector debt to revenue ratio reached 87.4
percent, against 36.8 percent in 2008 (Table 3).

11.     The financial markets are stable, and banks have so far weathered well the
stress. Since the activation of the international financial support package in 2009 the
exchange rate has remained broadly stable. The three-year Credit Default Spread (CDS),
which peaked at 780 basis points in February 2009, declined below 300 basis points by
end-August 2011, reflecting the positive impact of fiscal consolidation on market
perceptions of debt sustainability. However, financial markets turbulence in Europe has
increased downside risks in 2011: the CDS spreads have widened and the national
currency has lost gains made earlier in the year. So far Romania has weathered rather
well the turmoil in international financial markets in 2011. Fitch upgraded Romania’s
long-term foreign currency rating to investment grade in July, but risks remain. Further,
there have been expressions of interest from foreign institutions and private investors in
Romania’s energy, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors in recent months. The stock
market has improved considerably, up around 2.8 times at end-2010 relative to the trough
of February 2009. The banking sector remains well-capitalized and liquid. All banks have
capital adequacy ratios in excess of 11 percent (compared with a statutory ratio of 8
                                                            5
percent), and the average ratio was 13.4 percent at end-September 2011, higher than in
2008. The largest nine foreign banks broadly complied with the terms of the European
Bank Coordination Initiative (EBCI), and as a group retained their March 2009
committed exposure to Romania. EBCI lowered to 95 percent the floor for exposure
commitments of the banks. Although non-performing loans (NPLs) continued to increase
in 20115, the rate of increase has declined. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) is
confident that the banks can manage the increased risk, and is monitoring the situation
closely.

12.     The National Bank of Romania and the Government have taken measures to
safeguard the stability of financial markets. First, prudential regulations have been
strengthened to address the risks of contagion from the turmoil in European financial
markets. Second, the contingency plans mandated by the Strategic Action Plan for
strengthening the financial sector are being reviewed by the NBR supervision department
to verify the credibility of the assumptions and the robustness of the banks’ emergency
5
 The non-performing loan ratio went up from 11.9 percent in December 2010 to 14.2 percent in September
2011.
                                                                    6
funding arrangements. Third, the reporting framework that the NBR has put in place
monitors exposures that do not appear in the banks’ balance sheets (e.g., parent group
direct exposure to Romanian entities).

13.     Credit to the private sector has continued to shrink, while the public sector
has increased its exposure. Domestic credit to the private sector contracted in real terms
by 6.7 percent in 2009-2010 compared with the 41 percent growth recorded in 2007-
2008, largely due to lower demand by enterprises and households, stricter lending
standards due to worsening asset quality and rising provisioning requirements. This
constitutes a further impediment to economic recovery. At the same time, domestic credit
to the public sector increased in real terms by 182 percent in 2009-2010, reaching 23.6
percent of total bank loans (from 8 percent at end-2008), compensating the fall in private
sector credit demand.

14.    The Government has taken measures to contain unemployment. A ―technical
unemployment‖ subsidy to companies encouraged labor hoarding, and many Romanians
moved to other EU Member States in search for employment. Registered unemployment
increased from 4 percent of the labor force in 2008 to 7.6 percent in 2010, but came down
to around 5 percent as of September 2011 and remains lower than the EU average of
around 9.5 percent. Youth unemployment, however, is elevated, at around 20 percent,
comparable with the EU average.

15.     The Government has also taken steps to mitigate the poverty impact of the
economic crisis. Higher social protection and insurance spending, and pension increases
in 2009 helped reduce poverty to a decade-long minimum, with 4.4 percent of the
population living in absolute poverty compared to 35.9 percent a decade earlier and 5.7
percent in 2008. Further progress in poverty reduction in 2010 was hampered by: (i)
higher unemployment; (ii) unfavorable climatic conditions; (iii) higher inflation; (iv)
major cuts in the compensation of public sector employees; and (v) cuts in untargeted
social transfers. The impact of cuts in public sector wages and untargeted social transfers
on the poor has been mitigated by several factors. First, the minimum wage floor of 600
RON per month is high enough to maintain the living standards of civil-servant
households above the poverty line. Second, the social assistance programs that have been
curtailed have low targeting performance, affecting mostly middle and upper income
households. Third, the policy to top-off low pensions to a minimum of RON350
continued during 2010. Fourth, the budget of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI,
the best-targeted social assistance program) was protected and the family allowances
program was better targeted.

16.     The Government remains strongly committed to macroeconomic discipline.
The structural underpinnings of Romania’s medium-term macroeconomic policies are
consistent with a sustainable outlook supporting resumed growth, and deemed
satisfactory to proceed with the proposed DPL3. The Government intends to continue
ongoing efforts to align the fiscal balance and inflation with the Maastricht targets,
further curtail the current account deficit, and carry out monetary policies conducive to
private investment. These policies could allow Romania to resume growth and gradually
reverse the austerity measures which have affected public wage earners and pensioners.

          B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
17.     Earlier expectations on Romania’s improving macroeconomic outlook have
been dampened by the resurgence of the global economic crisis and deepening
financial distress in the Eurozone. Until recently, macroeconomic forecasts for 2011-
2012 were optimistic, reflecting gains in domestic macroeconomic management and the
improved outlook of the global and European economy. These expectations have been
drastically revised downwards, reflecting increasing concerns about a potential double-
dip recession in Europe and the United States as well as about weakening growth
prospects in Eastern Asia.

18.    The latest IMF projections estimate a GDP growth of around 1.8 percent in
2012 and closing of the output gap by 2015. Year-end inflation is projected at 3.4
percent in 2011 and 3.3 percent by end-2012, within the targets of the central bank, while
the current account deficit is projected to stabilize below 5 percent of GDP. The labor
market is expected to stabilize and wages in the private sector to rise in nominal terms,
though they will still decline in real terms in 2011.

19.     The Government’s key medium term challenge is to foster steady economic
growth while keeping the fiscal deficit below 3 percent. This requires a vigorous
pursuit of the adjustment and structural reform agenda. Policies currently in place should
enable Romania to meet the proposed fiscal deficit target of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011.
Following the recent enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation, the Government
approved a medium-term Fiscal Strategy for 2012-14 that commits to observing the 3
percent fiscal deficit target for the medium term, giving priority to investments co-
financed by EU funds, and allowing wage increases in accordance with the unitary pay
law to recoup recent wage cuts. The Government has set a 2012 consolidated budget
deficit target of 2.1 percent of GDP. However, this objective may be hard to achieve as
the economic environment in Europe is deteriorating, and given the Eurostat decision to
include the deficit of loss making SOEs in the government’s general budget as of 2012.

20.     The Government has continued in 2011 expenditure restraint. It continued to:
(i) contain the wage bill through further reduction in public employment; (ii) implement
the new pension and unitary pay laws; (iii) reduce the drain of SOEs on the budget; (iv)
contain expenditure overruns in healthcare; and (v) resist the eventual postponement of
cuts in public employment, rationalization of social assistance programs, or introduction
of co-payments for healthcare, especially in the run up of the 2012 elections.
Specifically, the Government has taken the following measures:




                                            8
       The 2011 wage bill is projected to decrease by 5.3 percent in nominal terms (0.4 percent
        of GDP) through further reduction of public employment and continuing the salary freeze.
        Additional financial savings will be generated by better control of proposed capital
        projects and through health and education sector reforms, as investment projects will be
        screened more rigorously. A health sector restructuring plan imposes wage spending
        limits, contain drug cost escalation, and reduce hospital costs through better hospital
        management6. In education, per-student financing was introduced in January 2010 and
        will be further refined in the school year 2011-2012.
       To reduce the drain of SOEs on the budget, the Government intends to take steps to reduce
        the losses of ten largest loss-making SOEs, continue SOE privatization and divestiture of
        state minority shares in firms, and reform the transportation sector to reduce losses and
        clear arrears of major railway and road transport SOEs. Under the IMF program, the
        Government is recruiting professional managers for nine SOEs in 2011, and a further six
        SOEs in 2012, especially in transport, post, energy and chemical industries, which record
        the greatest drain on the budget.
       To prevent the accumulation of payment arrears by the central government, the
        Government intends to integrate the accounting reporting system with the Treasury
        payment system in 2011, use budget appropriations as commitment ceilings and require
        line ministries to monitor their subordinated units in observing ceilings, and enforce
        sanctions against institutions and individuals who breach the ceilings. Under the IMF
        precautionary SBA, the Government has met the end-September 2011 targets for arrears,
        and is closely monitoring the targets for the rest of 2011.
       To prevent further build-up of arrears by local governments, they are required to include
        arrears repayment in budget execution as of 2011 and are prohibited to commit to new
        expenditures or contract loans until previous obligations are repaid.7

21.    The Government is committed to enhancing revenue performance through
tax policy reform, measures to improve revenue collection, and faster absorption of
EU funds, as follows:

       Ad hoc changes to the tax system will be strictly limited, with a view to ensuring
        predictability and stability, and promoting growth and competitiveness. Once firmly on
        track to meeting deficit targets, the Government will undertake a comprehensive review
        of the tax system with a view to its revenue-neutral optimization and simplification.
        Contingent on fiscal space, the Government will consider a gradual reduction in labor
        taxation with a view to enhancing competitiveness.
       Revenue collection will be enhanced by focusing on the 25,000 largest taxpayers (who
        provide 80 percent of revenue), increasing taxation of high net wealth individuals,
        strengthening the audit of unreported income, introducing compulsory electronic filing
        for medium and large taxpayers, and reducing customs fraud.

6
  373 hospitals were decentralized and will be managed by local governments. All the hospitals contracted
by the National Health Insurance House (CNAS) have been assessed and reclassified, and CNAS
discontinued financing for 65 hospitals – of whom 32 were already converted into permanent care or multi-
functional health centers, and the rest will be converted into nursing home for the elderly. The costs of
drugs prescriptions will be reduced through the introduction of an electronic prescription system in the
second half of 2012, the revision of the list of subsidized drugs, the introduction of a pre-approval
mechanism for drugs used to treat chronic diseases and the drugs listed in national health programs, and the
promotion of generic drug use by increasing the proportion of compensation from 20 to 25%.
7
  The relevant amendments to the Local Public Finance Law were enacted in June 2010. The Government
also issued an ordinance allowing local governments the use of swap agreements to offset mutual debts and
partially clear arrears.
                                                     9
      Mobilization of EU funds will be improved through strengthening of administrative
       capacity of units managing such funds, modernizing the legislative and regulatory
       framework for public investment and other expenditures eligible for EU financing,
       encouraging public-private partnerships, and giving priority to public investments co-
       financed with the EU. The recent creation of a Ministry for EU Affairs, headed by a
       former EU Commissioner who enjoys credibility over a wide political spectrum, is
       expected to improve the mobilization of EU funds. The new minister has set out
       aggressive goals in this respect, and has formulated specific proposals to improve
       efficiency and accountability. The government’s 2012 budget projects the mobilization of
       Euro 4 billion in EU structural and cohesion funds, i.e. around 3 percent of GDP. This
       target appears ambitious, given past record and persisting capacity constraints.

22.    The external balance is projected to stabilize over the medium-term, subject
to the recovery of the EU and global economy, and to Romania’s progress towards
enhancing competitiveness. Structural reforms pursued in public and financial sectors,
measures to enhance labor market flexibility such as the recent revision of the Labor
Code and the removal of barriers to doing business, would help ensure a stable external
balance in the medium term, with a current account deficit in the 5.0 percent range, well
below pre-crisis levels. This stabilization would hinge on the eventual economic rebound
of EU15 Member States, dynamic exports, moderate import growth contained by real
exchange rate depreciation that has taken place since mid-2008, and the pick-up in
workers’ remittances.

23.     Romania’s financing needs in 2011-12 will remain considerable at over €76
billion, though about €8 billion less than in 2009-10 (Table 2). Gross external
financing needs in 2011 are projected at around €39 billion, marginally higher than in
2010.

24.     External debt will continue to rise in 2011 and gradually decline through
2015 as a share of GDP, while the ratio of public debt to revenue will remain high
over the medium term (Table 3). External debt is projected to peak at almost 78 percent
of GDP and 200 percent of exports in 2011. It would gradually decline through 2015 to
65 percent and 161 percent, respectively, though remaining vulnerable to downside risks.
Public debt will also be higher though manageable in 2011 at over 34.8 percent of GDP,
and its ratio to revenue will reach 104.5 percent. This ratio would remain at about the
same level through 2015. Compared to many advanced and emerging markets, public
debt is at relatively modest levels in Romania and poses no substantial threat to debt
sustainability. The Government will seek to extend the maturity of public debt and
consolidate the financial buffers. The authorities successfully launched in June 2011 a
medium-term Euro note issue for €1.5 billion, which was well subscribed; it also
conducted successful Treasury bond auctions on the domestic market out to 10 years
maturity at reasonable interest rates.

25.     The macroeconomic framework is considered satisfactory to proceed with
the proposed DPL3, though the downside risks have significantly increased. The
Government remains committed to macroeconomic discipline and ready to adjust the
policy mix if required. The Government intends to continue ongoing efforts to align the
fiscal balance and inflation with the EU Maastricht targets, further curtail the current
account deficit, and carry out monetary policies conducive to private investment. If
downside risks do not materialize, these policies would allow Romania to resume growth
                                             10
and gradually reverse the austerity measures which have affected public wage earners and
pensioners, perhaps not as of 2012 as earlier envisaged, but as soon as the international
environment improves.

26.     Key risks to this scenario and recovery of the Romanian economy relate to
weak domestic demand and export markets, as well as high external debt. Medium
term growth projections rely heavily on strong export growth to make up for the
stagnation in domestic demand due to fiscal retrenchment and falling real household
incomes, as well as on greatly accelerated absorption of EU structural and cohesion
funds. However, export growth is highly dependent on the robustness of the Eurozone
economy, which is increasingly uncertain, while the proposed mobilization of €4 billion
in EU funds in 2012 is probably optimistic. External debt is high, increasing Romania’s
vulnerability to external shocks. On the financial sector side, in the view of the Romanian
authorities the risk of contagion from the Eurozone crisis is manageable. The share of
assets and deposits of Greek and Italians banks is about 20 percent, and funding from
parent banks is less than 4 percent of the total funding of banking system assets. The
National Bank of Romania (NBR) is of the view that it can manage the related risks.


           III.     THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY
                                 PROCESSES

27.    Government’s fiscal management and structural reform agenda is
articulated in the National Reform Program (NRP). The NRP is a three-year program
which seeks to adapt the priorities set by the European Lisbon Strategy and its successor,
the Europe 2020 Agenda, to Romania’s realities. It is updated annually and reviewed by
the EC. The current NRP for 2011-13 was issued in draft form in November 2010 and
was finalized in April 20118. It incorporates commitments made at the time of EU
accession, the 2009-12 program of the governing coalition, and commitments made under
the 2009-11 programs with IFIs. The government’s reform agenda has been since
updated, and incorporates now commitments entered under the precautionary agreements
with the IMF and EC, as well as under DPL3 (see LDP, Annex 1). The 2012-14 NRP,
under preparation, will emphasize the government’s policy reform agenda for the
medium-term.

28.     Romania’s overarching objective is to achieve convergence with the EU in
terms of income and living standards. With a GDP per capita at 45 percent of the EU27
average, Romania must close a large gap. The 2011-13 NRP proposes short to medium-
term priority reforms aimed at prudent macroeconomic management, increased efficiency
and transparency of public administration, and improved business environment. The NRP
complements these priorities with national targets and measures aimed at employment,
research, development and innovation, climate change and energy, education, and social
inclusion/poverty reduction. As of 2011 the NRP has been aligned with the objectives
and targets of Europe 2020 Agenda.

29.     The agenda of the governing coalition is formulated in a Government
program for the period 2009-12.9 The objectives of the program are twofold: first,
dealing with the effects of the crisis by stimulating confidence in the economy and
mitigating its adverse impact in general, and on the poor and vulnerable in particular; and
second, anchoring short-term measures in a medium-term structural reform agenda that
would support economic growth and resume progress towards convergence with EU
living standards, social cohesion and eventual entry into the Euro-zone. The Government
recognizes the need to re-focus the policy attention on the large unfinished structural
reform agenda.

30.     The presentation of the Government’s program below updates the DPL2
Program Document presentation. DPL3 would continue to support the reform program
supported by the first two DPL operations, as well as further reform of social assistance
and health systems10 In parallel, the implementation of Government’s action plans to
strengthen the capacity at the center of government and in five key sectors, based on the
recommendations of the functional reviews (FRs) carried out during 2010-11, may be
supported by the Bank through a fee for service arrangement.

                                  A. IMPROVING PUBLIC FINANCES

Strengthening fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability

31.     Implementation of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) will
enhance aggregate fiscal discipline and improve resource allocation. As detailed in
the DPL2 PD, a more disciplined budget process is critical in the current environment of
severe fiscal constraints. The Government has taken the following steps:

        The Government approved the MTEF for 2012-14 in August 2011, submitted it to the
         EC as part of the Fiscal Strategy for the period 2012-14, and updated it as part of the
         submission of the 2012 budget to the Parliament in mid-November 2011. The Strategy
         presents the forecast for the macroeconomic framework three years ahead and succinctly
         describes the policy measures through which the Government intends to achieve the
         proposed indicators. The Fiscal Responsibility Law11 (FRL) requires approval of the
         MTEF by the Government and informing the Parliament prior to voting on the annual
         budget and the yearly update of the Fiscal Strategy.
        The FRL imposes binding aggregate expenditure ceilings, strict rules on rigorous
         monitoring and enforcement of the ceilings, and severe penalties for failure to comply
         with the approved ceilings. It also prohibits new measures during the budget year that
         increase aggregate expenditures beyond the limits agreed under the MTEF. The FRL is
         expressed in the Fiscal Strategy for 2012-14, which improves on the first such Strategy
         for 2011-13, adding the analysis of fiscal risks. The Fiscal Strategy is overseen by the
         now operational Fiscal Council established in 2010 (see below).

32.   The government has taken an important step to enhance fiscal transparency
and accountability by establishing in 2010 a Fiscal Council. The authorities appointed

   The rationale for the reform agenda and the framework for broader reforms are discussed in the DPL2 Program
Document.
11
   Romania approved a Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2010 (Law 69/2010), as presented in the DPL2 Program
Document.
                                                     12
a respected technocrat recruited from the private sector to lead the Council, and made
available adequate budget resources to enable it to play its role of a consultative
independent institution that oversees and assesses public policy decisions which have
fiscal implications, and informs the public. Fiscal transparency benefits from the
publication of the government’s annual budget and its posting on the MOPF website,
with detailed annexes by credit holder under both economic and functional
classifications. An annex to the budget law provides information on capital expenditure
allocation per projects, articulates the policy rationale for allocation, and prioritizes the
projects for redesign, cancellation, or new funding authorization in case they cannot be
completed within the three-year MTEF period.

Reforming public pay and employment

33.    A new pay and grading system that addresses long-standing shortcomings in
public administration has been introduced and will be implemented over the 2009-
15 period. The Unitary Pay Law (UPL) is a framework law whose actual implementation
is spelled out by subsidiary annual legislation consistent with budget envelopes.
Government measures include the following:

      In 2009 the Government eliminated or reduced some non-wage bonuses and allowances,
       enacted a Unitary Pay Law (UPL), based on the recommendations of a bi-partite (line
       ministries and trade unions associations) Commission. The UPL framework limited non-
       wage personnel expenditures and bonuses for non-military personnel to 30 percent. It
       also set a timeline for the introduction of a salary grading structure based on job
       responsibility and qualification; salary grades that better align pay in the public sector for
       select benchmark positions to actual labor market conditions (through a salary survey);
       reduced disparities in pay between similar performing positions; enhanced career
       advancement for high-performing public servants; and articulated an implementation plan
       for the introduction of the new pay system fully-costed and consistent with the medium
       term budget projections.
      In 2010 and 2011 the Parliament approved implementing pay legislation. Most notably,
       the implementing legislation proposed new job grades and target salary levels for all
       public sector positions, based on job evaluations completed for selected benchmark jobs.
       Implementation will take place over several years and its pace is contingent on the
       mobilization of necessary fiscal resources. The proposed procedures mandate quarterly
       reports on the effectiveness of new human resource management policies (e.g., turnover
       by position, qualified applicants for positions).
      In 2011 the Government began implementing the pay provisions of the UPL, including
       new job grades. Pay adjustments in 2011 have been consistent with the UPL targets. The
       Government also eliminated regulation which had led to abusing the use of temporary
       appointments in public administration, to ensure that appointments are based on technical
       competencies and competitive recruitment.

34.     The reform of public pay and employment is complemented by Functional
Reviews (FRs) carried out during 2010-11. The FRs recommended reforms in the
following areas: strategic management, organizational structures, budget and human
resources management, performance management, and client orientation in 12 ministries
(transport, agriculture, public finance, center of Government, competition, health,
economy, environment, regional development, labor and social policy, pre-university and
higher education, research and development). The Government has prepared action plans
for the implementation of FRs’ recommendations and applied for EU structural funds to
                                                13
finance fee-based IBRD technical assistance in the ministries of public finance,
agriculture and rural development, transport, education, the center of government, and the
Competition Council.

Improving public finances in health services

35.     Government’s 2009-12 program supports health sector reforms aimed at
mobilizing resources and improving the efficiency and equity of service provision.
The reforms attempt to substitute expensive hospital based services with less costly
outpatient and primary care services, introduce co-payments, rationalize hospital
infrastructure, regulate better the introduction of new drugs and technologies, and review
the package of benefits insured by the Government:

        In 2009 the Government implemented cost-saving regulations governing drug pricing and
         promotion of generic drugs in the framework contracts concluded by the National Health
         Insurance House (CNAS) with service suppliers.
        The Parliament has approved legislation to introduce co-payments (including exemptions
         for the poor) which has been promulgated and legislation has also been enacted to
         advance the restructuring of the hospital network still in 2011. Work is in progress also to
         redefine the basic package of healthcare services, introduce a supplementary private
         health insurance, and introduce measures aiming to control the continuous increase of
         costs with the consumption of pharmaceuticals.12
        Over the medium-term the Government will implement a comprehensive sector reform
         agenda, reconfiguring health services delivery and networks, and enhancing financing,
         monitoring and evaluation of health services.13

Improving public finances in education

36.     Government’s program supports the rationalization of the school system and
better use of resources through the use of per student financing. This mechanism
will provide local authorities and schools with financial incentives to use resources more
efficiently and take reallocation decisions needed to address quality enhancement
objectives:

        In 2009 the Government set the standards for per-student financing formula and per-
         county budget allocations for 2010 based on them. 2010 was the first year in which
         schools were financed on a per student basis, albeit only for salary expenditures, with
         local authorities expected to cover other costs. This has provided a strong incentive for
         rationalizing the school system. Schools started to reduce the number of classes
         increasing the average class size from 20.6 to 21.5 in the school year 2010/11.
        In October 2010 the Government assumed responsibility for a new Education Law in the
         Parliament; the new law enshrines the principle of per-student financing formula and
         mandates the use of this formula in preparing future budget laws.

health expenditure see footnote 8, para.22.

   The proposed Health Sector Reform Program Project would support the implementation of the reform agenda (see
IV-C).

                                   B. STRENGTHENING SOCIAL PROTECTION

Targeting social assistance

37.      The Government has embarked on a systemic reform of social assistance,
starting with the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) and continuing with a
comprehensive three-year program. As the first step, the Government increased the
eligibility threshold of the GMI and improved its funding and administrative
arrangements. In the second stage, the authorities initiated far-reaching reforms to align
Romania’s social assistance system more closely with EU practices and make it more
efficient and equitable, better performing, and more accountable:

      In 2010 the Government increased GMI threshold to reach more needy families, enforced
       more strictly than before GMI eligibility norms, earmarked GMI funding and assumed its
       integral financing, thus substituting for the 20 percent contribution of local governments
       which sometimes resulted in partial payments if local governments were fiscally
       constrained. The Government approved means-testing procedures for heating benefits,
       transferred the registry and payment functions for the GMI from the local authorities to
       the Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection (MoLFSP), through the National
       Agency for Social Benefits (NASB), and approved the consolidation of family
       allowances.
      In 2011 the Government embarked on systemic reform of social assistance. In February,
       the Government adopted the Social Assistance (SA) Reform Strategy, followed in April
       by an action plan for 2011-13 that proposes a realistic timeframe with an adequate
       allocation of resources and responsibilities, and results indicators for 2011-12.
       Subsequent to the Social Assistance Framework Law, currently submitted to the
       Parliament for adoption, a legal package, simplifying and systematizing the social
       benefits system based on the SA Reform Strategy, has been drafted by the Government
       and will be submitted to the Parliament for approval.
      Over the medium-term, the reforms would achieve fiscal savings (0.8 percent of GDP by
       2013), consolidate the fragmented benefit programs14 and transfer to the National Agency
       for Social Benefits (NASB) all registry and payment responsibilities, target assistance to
       the needy, encourage households to invest in education of their children and for adults to
       seek and retain work, simplify the administration of the system, and set monitorable
       objectives and results to improve performance management. Reforms will address the
       regulatory framework, management of information, payment arrangements, and control
       of error, fraud and corruption (a particularly innovative feature).15

Pursuing the financial sustainability of the pension system

38.    The Government has taken steps to enhance the fiscal sustainability of the
public pension system (Pillar 1):

        In 2010 the Government tightened controls on pension expenditures, and a new pension
         law was enacted, changing the indexation rule to link adjustments in pension benefits to
         inflation, and gradually increasing the retirement age for women to 63 years through

14
   In 2009, the MoLFSP, the Ministry of Education and local governments operated 57 categories of social assistance
non-contributory programs.
15
   The Social Assistance System Modernization Project, approved by the Executive Board in April 2011, supports the
implementation of the reform agenda (see Report No. 58280-RO).
                                                        15
       2030. The Government initiated a review of the eligibility of disability pension
       beneficiaries and decided to align special pensions (e.g., the military) with the general
       public pension system.
      By end-2011 the Government will complete the recalculation of special pensions.

39.     The Government has restored scheduled contributions to the second pension
pillar. The private pension system was enacted in 2006 in order to address future fiscal
constraints. Its contribution rate was projected to rise from 2 to 6 percent in annual
increments of 0.5 percentage points. In 2009 the planned increment was suspended, but in
2010 the Government restored the projected pace of contributions to the second pillar.

                   C. ENHANCING THE RESILIENCE OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR

40.   The Romanian authorities are implementing the Strategic Action Plan
approved in 2009, with a view to enhancing financial sector viability, efficiency and
supervision:

      In 2010 the authorities adopted Consumer Debt Restructuring Guidelines facilitating
       debt restructuring, amended the insolvency law and Guidelines for Corporate Debt
       Restructuring, introduced a robust policy and decision making process for the assessment
       and accreditation of Basel II advanced models, and updated legislation on political
       independence and financial autonomy of financial sector regulators
      In 2011, the authorities enhanced the supervision of financial groups across sub-sectors,
       after reviewing the adequacy of supervisory arrangements in the Memorandum of
       Understanding between four financial regulators for financial groups in Romania. They
       have also made considerable progress towards enabling the Deposit Guarantee Fund
       (DGF) to finance the new bank resolution and restructuring tools, such as purchase and
       assumption.
      The authorities are committed to passing legislation that would strengthen the range of
       bank resolution tools; are finalizing the regulatory framework and tax treatment for filters
       for provisioning that will preserve the current prudent approach once International
       Financial Reporting Standards are introduced for banks at the beginning of 2012; and will
       soon issue new regulations, already drafted and under public discussions, to discourage
       un-hedged consumer borrowing in foreign currency.

                              D. ENHANCING ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS

41.    The authorities enacted in April 2011 a new Labor Code aimed at improving
the flexibility and competitiveness of the Romanian labor market. The new code
promotes fixed-term and temporary employment, extends probation periods, and
increases the flexibility of working hours.

42.     The Government is committed to deep-rooted reform of SOEs, especially in
energy and transport, to enhance competitiveness, enforce market rules, and
improve fiscal outcomes. Reforms underway and envisaged for 2012 include initiatives
to improve SOE governance, restructuring, privatization, regulatory framework, and
service provision efficiency:

      SOE governance will be strengthened through the expected approval of the Law on SOE
       governance and related regulations by end-2011, building on the recommendations of
       functional reviews (FR) carried out, as well as through the professionalization of the
                                               16
       management, including for some of the largest firms (state airline, railways, the postal
       service, hydropower and nuclear energy generation, electricity transport, chemical
       industry, coal and natural gas production and transport). The new SOE governance
       framework will require independent external audits, quarterly publication of financial
       data, and enforcement of OECD principles on corporate governance.
      Restructuring plans of SOEs, including a significant reduction of arrears, will be finalized
       by end-2011 for about 150 SOEs owned or controlled by the central government. The
       government aims to reduce SOE arrears by almost one percent of GDP at the outset, and
       continue the reduction of arrears in 2012 and beyond.
      The government remains committed to resuming the privatization of state’s shares in
       SOEs, including petroleum, gas, electrical, mining, chemical and air transport.
       Transaction and legal advisors were appointed by September 2011 for a number of
       companies and the process continues for the remaining ones.
      In the energy sector, regulatory reforms and restructuring measures aim to attract private
       investment. The authorities plan to approve legislation to ensure a complete transposition
       of the third EU Energy Package. The government also plans to phase-out unprofitable
       coal operations while spinning-off viable mines; separate viable entities in energy
       producer Termoelectrica while winding-up other operations; restore the operational and
       financial autonomy of the energy regulator (ANRE); take further steps to liberalize the
       energy market; not extend existing below-market bilateral contracts of state-owned gas
       and electricity generators; and contain further accumulation of arrears by district heating
       companies by requiring local governments to budget and pay heat subsidies.
      In the transport sector, the authorities are taking steps to improve infrastructure and
       increase efficiency in service provision. The creation of the new Ministry for European
       Affairs gives a strong signal of government’s determination to step-up the mobilization of
       EU structural funds. Transport revenues will be increased through tariff adjustments and
       enhanced toll collection, while costs will be contained by restructuring staff, refocusing
       services, extending the use of standard costs for contracts, and enhancing control
       mechanisms. Cost-containing measures envisaged include a 2,600 km reduction of the
       rail network maintained by the public infrastructure company via line closures (1,000
       km) and private tendering. As mentioned above, the divestiture of minority state shares
       and appointment of professional managers is intended to bring in private management
       and capital.

43.     Further, the government will pursue the modernization of agriculture
through the acceleration of land registration and titling. The authorities intend to
address the fragmentation of agricultural land and the lack of property titles, which makes
consolidation difficult and prevents the introduction of modern agricultural systems. In
line with the 2012-14 Fiscal Strategy and MTEF, the government will allocate
appropriate resources to the National Agency for Cadaster and Real Estate Publicity
(ANCPI) starting with the 2012 budget, to finance the systematic survey and registration
of agricultural land to the land book and cadastre. This will be measured by an increase in
the number of rural immovable property (built properties and land parcels) registrations
completed through systematic survey and registration from 4,300 in 2010 (baseline) to
about 600,000 at the end of 2012, covering a total area of about 700,000 ha. The
authorities intend to carry out an estimated 500,000 such registrations annually, with a
view to completing by 2026 the land book register and cadaster in rural areas, covering
all agricultural lands. The land registration program will implement strict guidelines
aimed at protecting lands set aside for biodiversity or other environmental purposes, and
ensure that registration is fair, honest, and avoids any discrimination against any
socioeconomic group.
                                               17
                            E. CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION

44.     The Government is consulting stakeholders periodically and informing the
public on proposed reforms and measures. Public consultation is guaranteed by
required posting of new legislative policy initiatives on the internet for 30 days of
consultations and feedback, with a background note justifying them and discussing their
expected social and economic impact. While policies introduced through emergency
ordinances are exempt, such ordinances must be endorsed by the Parliament upon
effectiveness, and must thus comply with public consultation requirements. The
Government holds public consultation meetings for important projects.

45.     The Government has carried out systematic and open consultations on
specific reform measures. Trade unions were invited and accepted to join the Bipartite
Commission to oversee public pay reform, and participated in the elaboration of the
methodology for the new pay system. The Ministry of Labor drafted the new pension law
in consultation with trade unions, pensioner representatives and employer associations,
and consulted trade unions and employers’ associations on the new Labor Code approved
by the Parliament in March 2011. Education reforms underwent substantial consultations
and public debate. The Ministry of Education posted online drafts of the new law,
organized consultations, and debated the changes in parliamentary hearings and in the
media. The Ministry of Health discussed hospital rationalization strategy and exemptions
for co-payments with the Associations of Hospital Administrators, Mayors, and Primary
Healthcare (PHC) Physicians, as well as with the College of Physicians. The Ministry of
Education consulted mayors, principals, school inspectors, and teachers on the design and
implementation of per-student financing.



        IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

                   A. LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

46.     The DPL program is central to the Bank’s engagement in Romania as laid
out in the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Romania for the
period 2009-13. The dual objective of the Bank is to support Romania in dealing with the
economic and financial crisis, and to broaden and deepen the reform program for
sustainable and equitable growth. The main pillars of the CPS are: i) economic growth
and competitiveness; ii) public sector reform; and iii) social and spatial cohesion. The
focus of this DPL program on public financial management, agriculture, social protection
and the financial sector is at the core of the Bank’s program to meet these objectives and
is fully aligned with these pillars. The CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) maintains this
objective and introduces a more European lens based on three cross-sectoral themes: (i)
policy reforms to reap the benefits of EU membership and meet the objectives of the
Europe 2020 strategy; (ii) modernization of public institutions to enhance resource
allocation and absorption of EU funds, and (iii) complement to EU funding. The DPL
series, the Bank’s contribution to the EU, IMF, and World Bank supported program,
remains fully aligned with the CPSPR strategic framework.



                                           18
47.     The DPL series constitutes the bulk of new lending under the current CPS.
Given the severity of the crisis and the exceptional need for large-scale budget support,
all new lending in the first two years of the CPS, 2009 and 2010, consisted of the DPL
series. The CPSPR proposes to add USD1.66 billion in new lending over FY11-12, while
the AAA program is proposed to be expanded with a wider portfolio of Fee Based
Services (FBS). New lending and AAA will be discussed in section C below. The Bank
will remain flexible to client needs in the next two years.

48.      The Government has recently expressed interest in a new DPL, possibly with
a Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO), to support the pursuit of structural reforms
and as a financial buffer against adverse shocks. The request has not been formalized
and the exact content of a potential DPL DDO is yet to be determined. The Government
would see the DPL DDO as a complement to the IMF and EC precautionary agreements
and is potentially considering support to policy reforms in areas such as health, energy,
transport, SOE sector, tax administration and public finance management. As a financial
buffer, the DPL DDO could help Romania reduce its costs of borrowing from the
international markets by enhancing its negotiating position. The Government could draw
the DDO funds if global economic conditions substantially further worsen, the downside
risks discussed earlier materialize, and access to financial markets becomes severely
restricted.

                 B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND THE EUROPEAN UNION

49.     The Bank has collaborated closely with the IMF and the EU since the start of
the DPL series, and DPLs have been linked to IMF and EU programs. The DPL
program supports and complements the 2009 multilateral financial package amounting to
€19.95 billion, of which the IMF contributed €12.95 billion16, the EU €5 billion, and EIB
and EBRD €1 billion (in support to the private sector) and the new precautionary
program with the IMF and EU. The Bank contributes €1billion to the package, of which
DPL1 and DPL2 accounted for €600 million. The measures under the DPL program have
been closely coordinated with both the IMF and EU to ensure that the reform measures
envisaged reinforce and are complementary to the measures supported under the IMF and
EU operations (Table 4). Quarterly monitoring of the program has been carried out in
close collaboration with the IMF and EU through cross-participation in missions and
consultations with the authorities. It had originally been envisaged that the DPL series
would be completed by the time the previous IMF and EU programs concluded in early
spring 2011. However, structural reforms have taken longer than anticipated due to the
severe fiscal crisis and the time needed by the Government to address the social impact of
education, health and social assistance reforms supported by the DPL. The delay does not
affect the complementarity with the IMF and EU, as these institutions have concluded
new precautionary agreements with Romania.

  At the Government’s request, the last tranche of €874 million has not been disbursed, and was treated as
precautionary.

                      single parent families.
Note: the table shows areas covered by DPL3 measures and benchmarks for the precautionary IMF SBA and EC MOU.

50.     The new precautionary arrangements concluded by the IMF and EU with
Romania continue support the agenda of the previous program and expand it to
include pro-growth and pro-equity policies. The IMF-supported new SBA supports
fiscal reforms in health, capital expenditure, government arrears, and tax administration
and simplification17. It also supports structural reforms in the SOE sector (especially in
energy and transport), regulatory effectiveness, and management of administered prices.
The EC supports further fiscal consolidation, improved fiscal governance (including
17
  The IMF arrangement supports the simplification and administration of the tax system. A recent Bank study (Paying
Taxes 2011: The Global Picture, Washington, DC: The World Bank, 2010) ranked Romania 182th in the number of tax
payments required, and 151th in tax collection performance, out of 183 countries surveyed.
                                                                20
specific government commitments concerning the role and functioning of the Fiscal
Council) and structural fiscal reform, financial sector regulation and supervision, and
structural reforms in energy, labor market and business environment. These new
programs are complementary to the DPL3 agenda.

51.     Previous programs agreed by Romania with the IMF and the EU in 2009
were executed satisfactorily and in a timely manner. All performance criteria for the
seventh (last) review of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement were met, with the exception of
the ceiling on general government domestic arrears.18 As mentioned earlier, the IMF
released all agreed tranches, with the exception of the last one, which was converted into
a precautionary tranche at the Government’s request. The EU carried out a final review of
the program in April 2011, approved the release of the last tranche, and concluded a new
two-year precautionary agreement.

                           C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

52.     The economic and financial crisis in 2008 provided an opportunity to resume
dialogue with the Government and advancing overdue structural reforms. The DPL
program represented the only new Bank lending in 2009-2010. This was due to the
severity of the crisis and the exceptional need for large-scale budget support. The DPL
continues reforms launched under the 2003-06 programmatic adjustment loan (PAL),
which supported Romania’s EU accession and integration by helping foster economic
growth and promote social inclusion. The PAL supported reforms in public finance
management, education, health, social assistance, pensions, judiciary, and private sector
development.      Following the successful implementation of PAL1 (rated highly
satisfactory by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group--QAG), the subsequent PALs were
canceled at the Government’s request, as reform fatigue set in after accession in 2007.
The onset of the crisis in late-2008 sensitized the Government and the public to the need
to resume the structural reform agenda interrupted by the EU accession.

53.    The Government has requested World Bank assistance to carry out social
assistance and health sector strategies that expand and extend the reform agenda
supported by DPL, implement the Government’s action plans derived from the
recommendations of the FRs, and strengthen capacities for strategic planning and
public finance management. The Progress Report on the CPS endorses these requests
and the Bank is on track in delivering:

        The Executive Directors of the Board approved a Social Assistance System
         Modernization Project in April 2011. This results-based operation will support four inter-
         related areas of the reform strategy: regulatory, management of information, payment
         arrangements, and control of error, fraud and corruption. The project will focus on

         children.19
        A health sector reform program is being considered by the government. This operation
         would eventually support the reconfiguration of health service delivery and the
         articulation of health service networks; appropriate service provision regulation;
         enhancements in health financing; and sector monitoring, supervision and evaluation.

           Based on the recommendations of the FRs (see Analytical underpinnings), the
            Government prepared action plans and is embarking on a major effort to Modernize the
            Romanian Public Administration (MAP). The Government requested the Bank to
            support implementation of some of their action plans. The program is expected to include
            eighteen TA projects. The first MAP TA was signed in July 2011 and aims to assist the
            Government at the central level in improving its institutional capacity to facilitate policy
            coordination, ex-ante impact assessment, and the monitoring and evaluation of public
            policies. Line ministries are expected to sign the contracts for assistance with the Bank.
            The Management Authority20 for the EU Operational Program for Development of the
            Administrative Capacity (PODCA) will review by end-2011 the other government
            requests for funding Bank technical assistance, with a view to implementing Government
            action plans based on recommendations of FRs in the Ministries of Public Finance,
            Agriculture and Rural Development, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Education,
            Research, Youth and Sports; the Competition Council; and the General Secretariat of the
            Government (GSG).
           Assistance for capacity building is envisaged through an Institutional Development Fund
            (IDF) grant, to help strengthen strategic planning and program evaluation in the Prime
            Minister’s Office, as well as the capacity for integration of strategic, financial and policy
            planning. The Bank is in the process of reviewing the scope and objectives of this
            proposed operation with the Government.
           Bank TA, financed from the structural funds, has been requested by the Authority for the
            Coordination of the Structural Instruments (ACIS) to help with the implementation of the
            Government’s Priority Action Plan for Increasing the Capacity to Absorb Structural and
            Cohesion Funds.
           The government is exploring with the EU the possibility of carrying out FRs for the
            Ministry of Justice, the National Authority for Regulating and Monitoring Public
            Procurement (ANRMAP), and the National Agency for Cadastre and Real Estate
            Publicity (ANPCI).
           Additional proposed TA and AAA supporting the new cross-sectoral themes includes TA
            for tax administration, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessments, an
            Accounting and External Auditing, a Citizen Scorecard and Social Accountability report,
            and a Climate Change policy paper.

54.    The DPL agenda is complemented by reforms and activities undertaken
under past investment operations, as well as the substantial technical assistance
provided under the Public and Private Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) which closed in
December 2008 (Table 5).

                                    D. LESSONS LEARNED

55.     The Bank has been active in Romania for almost 40 years. Lending was
discontinued in the early 1980s and resumed in 1991. Through FY12 IBRD committed
USD7.06 billion through 58 projects. Bank lending since 1991 was extended in four main
stages: (i) support to the transition of Romania’s command economy to a market
economy, FY91-94; (ii) support to reforms in energy, education, infrastructure and the
land market, FY94-04, and to poverty reduction, reform of the state and environmental
protection, FY97-04; (iii) support for institution building, governance reform and EU
accession, FY05-10; and (iv) support to systemic reforms (public finances, public
administration, financial sector, education, health, social assistance, social security,
mobilization of EU funds) and mitigation of economic and financial crisis, FY10-12. The
change in Government priorities translated into an increasing share of policy-based
lending, from 10 percent in FY05-08 to 73 percent in FY10-12.

56.     The implementation of Bank-financed projects and programs in FY05-10 has
been largely satisfactory, with the exception of two large transport operations. Since
2005 onward IEG assessment of Development Objectives (Dos) achievement was largely
satisfactory: the complex, multi-sector PAL program contributed core public sectors
reforms in the judiciary, civil services, policy formulation and public financial
management, while the investment portfolio contributed to positive developments in
agriculture and rural development, knowledge economy, energy. Complexity and
political sensitivity were important challenges of this period, yet mitigated through
leverage of Bank activity with that of the EU to ensure sustained progress. The fee-based
implementation of FRs in FY09-12 was considered satisfactory by both the Government
and the EC, which financed this operation. The two large transport projects that were
closed in FY10 without meeting their development objectives were largely affected by
budget shortages, post EU accession relaxation and Government’s need to switch to DPL
lending, in the wake of crisis (their closing served to make room for new DPL lending).

57.    The design and implementation of the first two DPLs in the series
highlighted several lessons which have guided the design of DPL3:

      The importance of building on the Bank’s comparative advantage in guiding reform in
       certain areas, stemming from knowledge acquired through programmatic and investment
       lending in Romania and elsewhere, as well as from analytical work.
      The need to coordinate closely with other IFIs in the design and monitoring of reforms.
      The need to agree on detailed reform implementation schedules and monitorable
       outcomes.
      The importance of anticipating and managing the impact of political transitions, and
       seeking broader political and civil society support for reforms to enhance reform
       sustainability.
      The need to limit the program to what can be realistically managed and delivered by the
       Government, in recognition of political and social constraints, limited capacity of the
       Government to design and implement coherent policies, and weak capacity of the
       Parliament to review and adopt necessary legislation. In addition to policy changes
       introduced by DPLs, key challenges to success in the public sector require improving the
       way the current institutions work. DPLs should be accompanied by technical assistance
       in order to address implementation issues together with policy issues.


                                             23
        The importance of seeking leadership from the Center of Government. Direct
         involvement and support from the Prime Minister’s office and Presidency are crucial for
         successful implementation of reforms, especially when they are politically sensitive.

                                E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

58.      The DPL is anchored in past and ongoing analytical and technical assistance
work. In addition to past analytical work (as reported in the DPL1 PD, table 6), the DPL
draws on recent and ongoing analytical work. Recent analytical work includes: (i) the
2009 Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PER) examined opportunities for
efficiency gains in main expenditure areas of the public budget, and analyzed aggregate
and sector expenditure patterns, effectiveness and efficiency of spending, and policy and
institutional challenges faced by the Government, including in education and health; (ii)
technical notes prepared since November 2009 to assist the Government plan reforms of
public sector pay, medium-term budgeting and pension system; (iii) technical assistance
to prepare corporate and mortgage restructuring guidelines and revise the insolvency law;
and (iv) a technical note assessing options for extending social protection coverage to
elderly farmers. Ongoing work includes: (i) a series of Policy Notes which will be issued
in 2011 on sources of growth, private sector development, the labor market,
modernization of agriculture, mobilization of EU funds for infrastructure, fiscal
management, SOEs, FDI, and the business environment21; (ii) work on the impact of the
crisis on poverty and social policy monitoring; and (iii) analytical work carried out during
the preparation of the Social and Health Reform projects.

59.     Also highly pertinent to this operation and the overall IMF/EU/World Bank
program are the Functional Reviews of twelve Ministries/public institutions that the
Bank carried out for the Government of Romania over 2010-11. The FRs provide
operational recommendations on strategic management, organizational structure, sector
governance, budgeting, and human resource management. They covered the Center of
Government, the ministries of Transport and Infrastructure, Pre-University Education,
Agriculture and Rural Development, Public Finance, Environment and Forestry,
Energy/Economy and Business Environment, Health, Labor and Social Protection,
Regional Development and Tourism, and Higher Education, Research, and Innovation, as
well as the Competition Council.

  The Policy Notes were discussed during well-attended workshops in May and October 2011 in
Bucharest.

                       V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                               A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

60.     The proposed operation is the last of a programmatic series of three DPLs.
While by no means pretending to address all structural issues accumulated over the past
two decades, the DPL – together with the IMF and EC-supported programs – has helped
the Government make a clean break of many harmful past practices, and embark on long-
needed reforms. The government will need to continue these efforts over a number of
years to allow Romania to make progress towards its development potential. Originally
envisaged to span the 24 months of the previous IMF Standby Arrangement and EC
budget support program, the DPL series was extended to allow delivery of some
important reforms which proved more difficult than initially envisaged. The DPL3
overlaps with new precautionary arrangements concluded by the IMF and the EC with
Romania in 2011. The DPL3 continues the structural reform agenda supported by the
first two operations in three areas critical to Romania’s medium- to long-term prospects:
public sector finances, social assistance and social insurance, and the financial sector.

61.    The Government has made significant progress in implementing the reform
agenda presented to the World Bank Board of Directors on July 18, 2009, and
remains firmly committed to the reform agenda. The Government has met all the
commitments made under DPL1 and DPL2 (see Policy Matrix in Annex 1). With the
delivery of DPL3 the Government would meet and exceed the objectives set by the DPL
program at the outset, against considerable odds.

62.    The results of the reform program supported by the DPL have been positive.
However, the DPL program has supported primarily structural reforms, whose outcomes
will materialize fully in the medium to long term. In the short term, outcomes are also
influenced by the crisis, which limits their scope. In addition, the main outcomes of the
DPL series cannot be always separated from the general outcomes of the program
supported by other IFIs.

63.     Results indicators have been redefined and intermediate outcomes have been
presented to demonstrate the progress made in each reform area over the DPL
series in Table 6. Some of the original outcome indicators have been changed in order to
better capture the reforms implemented, some of them did not have monitorable periodic
data from government or other sources, while others were not consistent with the updates
in policy actions. Table 6 presents in column 2 the initial indicators, and in column 3 the
intermediate outcomes with specific quantitative indicators.

64.   The intermediate results indicators in most reform areas show substantial
progress (see Table 6). For instance:

        Public finances: a major reduction in the structural fiscal deficit from 8.5 percent in
         2008 to 5.1 percent in 2010; variance between budget allocation and budget
         execution has been reduced from 27 percent in 2008 to 10 percent in 2010; the
         number of budget ratifications reduced from 5 times in 2008 to 2 times in 2010; the
         reduction of the wage bill for public administration from 9.4 percent of GDP in
         2009 to 8.3 percent in 2010; enhanced fiscal sustainability of the public health
         system through increased use of generic drugs from 20 percent in 2009 to 22
         percent in 2010; reduction of admissions to acute care facilities by 4.4 percent
         between 2009 and 2011; improved efficiency in pre-university education through
         increased class size following the introduction of per student financing from 20.6 in
         2009 to 21.5 in 2010.

        Social protection: improved coverage of the well-targeted GMI program and
         improved targeting of family benefits from 59.5 percent in 2009 to 65 percent in
         2010; improved fiscal outlook for the public pension system through increased
         retirement age and reduction of unjustified retirement for medical reasons. The
         consolidation of the special pensions (army, internal affairs, etc.) into the public
         pension pillar has however pushed the deficit of the pension fund to 2.95 percent of
         GDP in 2011, but the pension reforms should cap this deficit by 2013 and bring it
         down to around 1.5 percent by 2025.

        Financial sector: greater financial sector resilience through increased capital
         adequacy ratios from below 10 in 2008 to 13.4 in 2010, increased use of
         reorganization proceedings to handle corporate insolvency from 1.5 percent in 2008
         to 2.5 percent in 2010, and the introduction of joint supervision of financial
         conglomerates.

65.     The DPL 3 program contains some changes relative to its initial design. These
changes (Table 7) reflect findings of the recent analytical work and the need to update
some measures defined back in May 2009 to more accurately capture the intended policy
action:

         The trigger on health provider payment mechanisms has been replaced by a prior action
          on a new legal framework for drug prescription management due to changes in the
          priorities of the Government, following discussions with the IFIs.
         The trigger addressing social protection of the elderly poor was dropped in agreement
          with the Government, following the recommendation of a 2010 Bank technical note
          showing that introducing a zero pillar (social pension) would contradict the principles of
          the Social Assistance Reform Strategy. The technical note showed that the needs of the
          elderly poor can be addressed through the existing well-targeted programs, such as the
          GMI.
         The trigger requiring the introduction of per student financing of education in all schools
          in eight counties has been modified to reflect the fact that the Government introduced this
          mechanism nationally.
         The trigger requiring the Government to a) amended the definition of ―Financial
          Conglomerate‖ in Emergency Ordinance 98/2006 to capture all financial groups
          operating in Romania with material operations across more than one financial sub-sector;

                       and b) the review of the adequacy of supervisory arrangements in the Memorandum of
                       Understanding between the financial regulators for financial groups in Romania has been
                       updated to reflect the fact that the assessment conducted under the DPL program
                       concluded that the amendment of the definition of ―Financial Conglomerate‖ was not
                       needed.

         66.     The following discussion summarizes actions proposed to be supported by
         the DPL3. Their rationale, content and objectives are detailed in the Government’s
         Program (Chapter III). Whenever feasible, the results anticipated from the
         implementation of prior actions were quantified against baselines (see Policy Matrix,
         Annex 2). In a few cases, where the results hinge on a broader medium- to long-term
         reform agenda that exceeds the scope of the DPL, they were expressed in this document
         in qualitative terms, and are confirmed by explicit government commitments (see LDP,
         Annex 1).
                                                             B. POLICY AREAS24

           a. Improving Public Finances

         67.     The proposed reforms will improve the management and predictability of
         public spending, and foster better public health and education services. Cross-sector
         reforms concern the MTEF and the public pay system. MTEF reforms seek to strengthen
         the quality of the annual budgeting process progressively and anchor it in a credible
         medium-term framework. Under DPL3, and as presented in the government’s program
         (section III-A), the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) imposes binding aggregate
         expenditure ceilings set by the MTEF, strict monitoring and enforcement of these
         ceilings, and severe penalties for failure to comply. The Fiscal Strategy for 2012-14 adds
         the analysis of fiscal risks, provides more detailed information on capital investment by
         projects, sets a more explicit policy rationale for resources allocation, cancels some
         unviable projects, and postpones capital investment projects. The MTEF was jointly
         reviewed by the Bank, IMF and EU. Public pay system reforms aim to improve the
         transparency and fairness of the public pay system and enhance its capacity to attract and
         retain critical skills in public administration. Measures specific to health and education
         pursue enhanced resource mobilization and efficiency, as well as improved access,
         quality and equity of service provision.

         68.     In the area of education, the DPL program supports the decentralization
         agenda pursued by the government, which devolves more responsibility and
         flexibility to local authorities and schools. Decentralization is accompanied by a new
         accountability relationship between school principals, school boards and local authorities,
         focusing on ―management contracts‖, and which is enforced by the new Education Law.

         24
           DPL3 measures presented in this section should be read in connection with the Government’s program
         (chapter III), as well as the explanations provided in Table 6 above.
                                                                        30
The strengths and weaknesses of the new law – and the critical steps involved in
addressing weaknesses and implementing it – were analyzed in two functional reviews
carried out in 2010-11.

69.   DPL1 and DPL2 supported the Government’s decision to introduce the
MTEF, the preparation of the 2010-12 and 2011-13 MTEFs that were submitted to
the EC through Convergence Programs 2009-10, and the adoption of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law in 2010.

70.       DPL3 prior actions in the area of improving public finances are:

         MTEF: MTEF 2012-14 approved by Government with ceilings for the 3-year period for
          select ministries comprising at least 70 percent of spending. This action has been
          completed, and it represents continued progress towards management of the public
          investment program, and increased predictability, transparency and accountability of
          budget execution.
         Public Sector Pay: (a) Implementing pay legislation is enacted, and (b) pay adjustments
          in 2011 are made in accordance with the implementing law. These actions were
          completed, and they seek to increase fairness and competitiveness of public sector
          employment.
         Health: (a) Promulgate the legislation regarding co-payment and exemption mechanisms
          (amending Law 95/2006). (b) A new framework was approved by the Government for
          electronic prescription management. These actions, completed in November 2011, aim at
          enhanced resource mobilization and control of expenditures in the public health system.
         Education: Legislation enacted to allow all schools to receive their budget according to a
          per capita finance formula. This action was completed and applies nationally. It seeks to
          decentralize the management of pre-university education and ensure a more equitable
          distribution of budget resources allocated to this sector, with a view to improving access
          to, and the quality of education.

b. Strengthening Social Protection

71.     Social assistance reforms seek to increase the coverage of the most efficient
and well-targeted programs to provide greater support to poor families. Social
insurance reform aims to enhance the fiscal sustainability of the public pension system
and protect the poor. As discussed above, the Government has embarked on a three-year
systemic reform of social assistance, and intends to complete in 2011 the reform of the
public pension system.

72.    DPL1 and DPL2 supported the adoption of legislation to reform the public
pension system, improve the coverage and financing of the GMI, and improve the
family benefits system.

73.     Public pension system reform has improved equity, transparency and
sustainability. The integration of special pensions (military and security) in the general
public pension system as of 2011 has increased equity and transparency. Special pensions
have been aligned with general public pensions, and the budget subsidies to cover them
have been consolidated in the accounts of the public pension system. While on surface
this has increased the deficit of the system to about 2.7 percent of GDP in 2011 and
almost 3 percent in 2012-2015, in reality there are net gains for the overall state budget.
The deficit of the system will gradually decrease to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2025. Without
                                                 31
the reform, Prost simulations suggest that the deficit would have reached 5 percent of
GDP in 2025 and about 10 percent of GDP by 2050.

74.     DPL3 prior actions on strengthening social protection have been completed:
(a) Enactment of amendments to the legislation (Law 416/2001) to transfer the program
budget to the Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection (MoLFSP) and transfer the
benefits payments attributions from local governments to the NASB while keeping the
entitlement and recertification attributions with the local governments. This measure
ensures integral coverage of social assistance benefits, which local administrations could
not always deliver in the past; and (b) Enactment of legislation on income-tested family
benefits (unifying CCA and SPA) reducing the maximum eligibility threshold from 470
RON per month per capita to 370 RON, and offering higher benefits to households
earning less at or below 200 RON and to single parent families. This measure shifts
budget resources to better targeted social assistance programs, to reduce waste and
mitigate the impact of the crisis on the poor.

c. Enhancing the Resilience of the Financial Sector

75.    Financial sector reforms seek to bolster contingency planning and improve
the resilience of the sector over the longer term through strengthened regulation
and supervision. The measures supported by DPL complement the more comprehensive
reform agenda under the precautionary arrangement concluded with the IMF in 2011,
including development of new resolution tools, appropriate funding of the Deposit
Guarantee Fund, introduction of International Financial Standards, and stronger
prudential regulations.

76.      DPL1 and DPL2 supported the adoption and implementation of a Strategic
Action Plan for the financial sector, which outlined the BNR’s lender of last resort
facilities as well as a plan for recapitalizing banks if necessary. Second, amendments
to the Insolvency Law underpinned resolution of NPLs and helped protect viable but
liquidity constrained enterprises from closing. Third, guidelines for mortgage
restructuring have helped mitigate the build-up of non-performing loans and allowed
home owners to keep their homes. Fourth, new NBR regulations regarding internal
models, governance, and market risk measurement facilitated the implementation of
Basel II. Finally, improved coordination among supervisory agencies has strengthened
their ability to monitor risks in financial groups and to manage failing groups.

77.     In addition, actions supported by the DPL1 and DPL2 have rendered the
sector more resilient and better positioned to manage renewed stress and the risks
of contagion due to turbulence in regional financial markets. In light of the evolving
European crisis and the exposure the Romanian banking system to Greek and Italian
parent banks as well as funding from European wholesale markets, these improvements
are highly relevant.




                                           32
78.    The DPL3 includes one prior action in the area of financial sector resilience,
namely the review of the adequacy of supervisory arrangements in the Memorandum of
Understanding between the financial regulators for financial groups in Romania. This
action addresses weaknesses in the regulatory framework for bank supervision, with a
view to enhancing the resilience of the financial sector.


                      VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                              A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

79.     Poverty is monitored by the Government and the Bank. MoLFSP and the
National Institute for Statistics (INS) calculate and monitor poverty figures based on a
methodology developed together with the World Bank. In 2008 and 2009 the Bank
validated the poverty figures produced by the two institutions on the basis of Household
Budget Surveys (HBS). The distributional impact of the reform measures is monitored
annually based on the HBS data and administrative data provided by MoLFSP.

80.   The DPL-supported reforms have in general a positive impact on the poor.
Any adverse impact is transitory and mitigated by support measures:

          The reforms in public expenditure management and the introduction of the Unitary
           Pay Law (UPL) will benefit the entire population by enhancing fiscal and macro
           stability, and the predictability and transparency of public expenditure. The UPL
           implementation will also help contain inflationary pressures. Under UPL
           implementation, public administration employment would be curtailed in 2012,
           primarily through attrition, by replacing only one in seven positions made available
           by retirement or voluntary departure of staff. Taking also into account the fact that
           public sector employees are not in the poorest segment of population, the impact of
           this measure on poverty is expected to be marginal.
          In health, the poverty impact of the introduction of co-payments will be minimal as
           co-payments levels will be rather symbolic. Also, select groups of population will be
           exempted (such as, patients of all emergency healthcare services, children up to age
           of school graduation). In addition, there is an annual ceiling for co-payments of
           around US$ 200 equivalent per person, which protects low income groups.
          In education, the introduction of per capita financing is expected to impact favorably
           on the poor, through more equitable distribution of budget resources. While this
           reform will result in some school closures, the impact will be mitigated by a
           government program aimed at maintaining adequate access to education. The
           Government has prepared and submitted to financing by EU funds a technical
           assistance project that would support continuing the optimization of the school
           network by identifying schools which can be closed down without impairing access
           to education, as well as addressing risks of student drop-out and learning outcomes.
           The project would focus on building capacity in the Ministry of Education to
           rigorously monitor and evaluate the impact of school closures on drop-out rates and
           learning outcomes for students affected by school closures. At the same time, the
           project would contribute to creating more favorable public opinion toward school



                                              33
                rationalization. The ongoing Social Inclusion Project25 supports the access to
                inclusive early childhood education of the Roma children in poor communities.
               Social assistance reforms will help reduce poverty through better targeting.
                Simulations on the impact of the reform of the GMI and family allowances suggest
                that the targeting accuracy of these programs to the lowest quintile would increase
                from 51 percent to 60 percent, while the generosity (benefits received as a percentage
                of post benefit household consumption) would also increases for the poorest quintile.
                The GMI and family policy reforms supported by the DPL helped protect the benefits
                received by the poorest 20 percent of the population, in spite of the reduction in
                social spending between 2009 and 2013, by redistributing benefits from upper and
                middle-income households to the poor.26
                The pension reform will protect future generation of retirees by enhancing the fiscal
                sustainability of the Pillar 1 pensions and the financial viability of Pillar 2. In the
                absence of reform, the deficit of Pillar 1 would have steadily increased to an
                unsustainable level of 5 percent of GDP by 2025. The reform of the public pension
                system does not entail the reduction of benefits received by retirees. On the contrary,
                many beneficiaries of special pensions would receive higher pensions once the new
                benefit formula is implemented.

                                         B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

81.     The policy reforms supported by the DPL program are not expected to have
significant environmental effects. The reforms are geared primarily toward ensuring
macroeconomic stability and financial system solvency, as well as to foster economic
growth and improved access to, and equity of, health and education provision. They do
not have significant direct links to the environment. Romania nevertheless has adequate
environmental safeguards and environmental legislation and regulation is reinforced by
EU environmental directives, including the EU guidelines on the adoption of
environmental assessments at the planning and programming level (June 2001) and the
EU’s Environmental Liabilities Directive setting out liability for damage to properties
and natural resources (April 2007).

                         C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

82.     The implementation of the loan requires close coordination between the
Bank and the national institutions responsible for implementation, as well as the
leadership of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Presidency. The Ministry of Public
Finance (MoPF), the National Bank of Romania (NBR), and the Ministries of Labor,
Family and Social Protection, Health, Education, and Justice will provide the requisite
baseline data from which to measure outcomes by the end of the program. MoPF will be
responsible for overall implementation, for coordinating actions among other concerned
ministries and agencies, and for reporting progress on the program’s monitoring
indicators. These indicators have been tracked, discussed and assessed among the Bank
team and implementing agencies both by staff based in the field and by HQ staff during
field visits. As the operation evolves, Bank staff may review with the Government
eventual adjustments needed, with a view to reconciling country conditions with the
25
     Social Inclusion Project - P093096, approved by Bank Board on June 13, 2006
26
   See the Social Assistance System Modernization (SASM) Project Document (Report No. 58280--RO,
April 2011), and the PSIA-type Technical Note on Proposed Reforms to Income-Tested Child Allowance
in Romania (June 2010).
                                                          34
delivery of specific DPL goals. As discussed in section IV-D, leadership provided by the
Cabinet of the Prime Minister and the Presidency is essential for the implementation of
the program.

                                   D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

83.    The Bank has extensive knowledge of the country’s Public Financial
Management (PFM) system. A CFAA was completed at the end of 2003, while a
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was done in 2005 and a Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) was published in 2006. A Functional
Review of the Ministry of Public Finance has been carried out in 2010. Regular updates
of PFM recent reform activities have been carried out over the recent years, and other
external PFM reports have been consulted for presenting this current PFM status.

84.     The CFAA deemed the overall fiduciary risk associated with the PFM system
moderate. In the areas of accounting, reporting and internal control, the fiduciary risk
was considered significant, partly due to the heavy dependence on manual accounting
and reporting processes, weak arrangements for management accountability and the
limited modern internal audit capabilities. The fiduciary risk was considered moderate in
the fields of budgeting, treasury, cash management and external audit and parliamentary
oversight. The fiduciary risk related to Bank investment operations was considered low.

85.     In response to the recommendations of the CFAA, the Government has taken
action to improve coordination and management of PFM reform and strengthen
internal control, financial reporting and auditing systems. A number of the CFAA
recommendations have already been addressed by the Government, including in the areas
of treasury management, harmonization of accounting standards and practices,
decentralization and rationalization of ex-ante financial control and strengthening internal
audit functions. The organization and effectiveness of the Court of Accounts has also
been improved. Overall, steady progress has been made in the development of PFM
systems and institutions.

86.     Romania has made some progress in government budget transparency as
measured by the Open Budget Index assessment (OBI), with its ranking moving
upwards from 2006 to 2008. However, during the OBI 2010 assessment, Romania has
been downgraded from the OBI category ―provide substantial information‖ to the one
below, ―provide some information‖. According to OBI, the remaining budget issues are
the absence of pre-budget statements, of a citizens’ budget and of a mid-year review;
only partial information is available for areas such as Executive’s budget proposal, in-
year reports and audit reports.

87.   The Government has been addressing some of the challenges highlighted by
the DPL1 PD. In addition to the measures highlighted in the DPL1 PD on PFM
improvements, Romania adopted in 2010 an updated Local Public Finance Law, which
became effective in January 2011 The remaining PFM reform areas are being addressed.

88.    The central bank, National Bank of Romania (NBR) can be relied upon to
hold proceeds from development policy operations. The June 2011 IMF safeguards
assessment concluded that safeguards in place at NBR are generally adequate and the

                                            35
weaknesses identified by the previous August 2009 and June 2005 safeguards
assessments have been addressed. NBR can be therefore relied upon to account for the
Bank’s loan proceeds from development policy operations, assuming that the
arrangements are otherwise in accordance with the Bank’s policies and with specific
mutually agreed terms for the operation in question. The Bank needs to take no further
action in this area.
                              E. DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITING

89.    The proposed loan will follow the World Bank’s disbursement procedures
for development policy loans. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases,
and evidence will therefore not be needed to support disbursements, nor will procurement
requirements be necessary. The front end fee will be covered from the Borrower’s own
sources. At the request of the MoPF, the Bank will deposit the proceeds of the loan into a
foreign exchange deposit account at the NBR that forms part of the general foreign
exchange reserves. If loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the
Loan Agreement, the Bank, upon notice, will require the Borrower to refund such amount
promptly, and such amount shall be cancelled.

90.     MoPF will be responsible for the administration and accounting of loan
proceeds. The standard country rules will be followed by Treasury for administration and
accounting. The proceeds of the Loan deposited at the NBR will be used to cover the
budget deficit and/or public debt refinancing. MoPF will be responsible for preparing
withdrawal applications along with maintaining the deposit account as required. With the
assistance of NBR it will maintain records of all transactions under the deposit account in
accordance with sound accounting practices. The Borrower will report to the Bank within
30 days after receiving the loan amounts by sending a confirmation letter on the loan
amounts deposited in the foreign currency deposit account.

91.     The proceeds of the loan will be deposited in a single tranche by the Bank in
an account chosen by the Borrower at the NBR and an audit of that account will not
be required. The currency of the NBR account will be the loan currency. Given the
positive IMF assessments of the NBR, the unqualified NBR audit reports for 2005-2010
as well as the satisfactory audit compliance under the previous PAL and PSAL-2
development policy lending operations (disbursed in 2005), an audit of the NBR account
for the proceeds of the loan is not considered necessary.

                                F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

92.     The proposed DPL program entails significant political, social and economic
risks, as well as implementation capacity constraints. The main risks and constraints
include the following:

      Political risks stem from the coalition government, and approaching local and
       parliamentary elections in 2012. The Government has been able so far to muster the
       needed support of the Parliament for legislation underpinning reforms, although the
       discussion and adoption has been often challenged by the opposition on the floor of the
       Parliament and in the Constitutional Court, delaying action and sometimes modifying
       Government’s intent. The 2012 elections will increase political confrontation, and may
       also lead to the relaxation of public spending objectives, as the ruling coalition may try to

                                               36
         shore up support for re-election by increasing financing for local projects, and delay
         reforms which affect the electorate and require sacrifices in the short-run. Moreover, as
         reforms expand from the macro to the microeconomic domain – especially in the SOE
         sector – vested interests are likely to resist them.
        Social risks are associated primarily with the lingering impact of the 2010 fiscal austerity
         package and the proposed freeze in public sector salaries and pensions in 2012; with
         policy reforms such as the introduction of co-payments for healthcare services, the
         rationalization of social assistance programs, the recalculation of special pensions, the
         implementation of the UPL and further reduction in public sector employment, and the
         restructuring or/and privatization of SOEs; and with the planned 2012 increase in energy
         prices (natural gas, distributed heating, petrol, electricity) to meet commitments made at
         the time of EU accession. Opinion surveys show that voters are not convinced that
         politicians have the willingness and capacity needed to lead Romania’s economic and
         social progress, which makes them vulnerable to populist messages.
        Economic risks stem from external developments and domestic constraints. The
         uncertain and turbulent global economic environment and the significant risk of a
         renewed recession owing to sovereign debt crisis and problems in Eurozone countries
         could suppress demand for exports and capital inflows, put pressure on fiscal and external
         balances and undermine growth prospects. Romania is highly vulnerable to EU market
         developments, with 73 percent of exports towards EU member countries, foreign
         financing of banks amounting to 19 percent of GDP, workers’ remittances amounting to
         2.4 percent of GDP, and high external debt. If these risks materialize, they could
         discourage new investment and prompt the exit of some existing investors, lower debt
         roll-over rates, and put pressure on the exchange rate and the balance of payments. The
         already modest growth projected for Romania in 2012 (1.8 percent) hinges on increased
         domestic demand, including aggressive mobilization of EU structural and cohesion funds.
         The austerity measures stipulated by the 2012 budget program, which seek to reduce the
         still considerable fiscal deficit (4.4 percent in 2011), include a freeze in public sector
         salaries and pensions. Together with capacity constraints in mobilizing EU funds this
         may depress domestic demand and lead to lower growth.
        Capacity constraints include: (i) lack of a coherent strategic vision of Romania’s path to
         EU convergence; (ii) limited Government capacity to design and implement economic
         policies and reforms, coordinate sector and local initiatives, and carry out consultations of
         stakeholders in a participatory manner; (iii) insufficient Parliament capacity to harmonize
         new legislation with past and EU legislation, and weak grasp of economic and financial
         matters; (iv) limited central administration capacity to design, implement and monitor
         reforms, and to mobilize EU funds; and (v) unproven capacity of local administrations to
         assume new responsibilities stemming from health and education sector reforms.

93.   These risks are partly mitigated by Government actions supported by the
IFIs:

        Political risks have been managed well so far by the Government, and the partners in the
         governing coalition have reiterated their commitment to a steady course through elections
         in 2012.27 The constant dialogue of the Bank and other IFIs with the parliamentary
         opposition and stakeholders on the necessity and thrust of reforms, and to inform them on
         progress in implementation and results, could help mitigate partially a potential change of
         direction or halt of reforms in case of significant changes in the governing coalition.


27
   As an example of the Government’s determination to respect fiscal discipline, the Minister of Labor,
Family and Social Protection has publicly stated that pensions are unlikely to be indexed in 2012 due to
fiscal constraints.
                                                  37
          Social risks are partially mitigated by social assistance measures targeting better benefits
           to the needy and by communication with social partners. Increased unemployment and
           social assistance benefits have helped the vulnerable to better withstand the consequences
           of the economic decline, contributing to a reduction in poverty in 2009.28 The DPL has
           supported increases in funding of well-targeted GMI program and income-tested child
           allowances. The Bank has also expanded communication efforts with the social partners,
           including main trade union confederations and business associations. The consultations
           emphasized the costs of continuing with the economic status quo and the long-term
           benefits of reforms. These measures notwithstanding, social risks remain high given the
           bleaker economic outlook for 2012 and the fiscal constraints. The recently approved
           results-based operation for the reform of social assistance is expected to help manage
           better budget resources allocated to social assistance programs and will yield benefits in
           the medium-term, but would not be able to reduce social risks rapidly.
          Economic risks are partly mitigated by ongoing and envisaged structural reforms, strong
           government commitment to macroeconomic stabilization, the extension of the
           multilateral program with the IMF and the EU, and the proposed extension of the
           program supported by the World Bank through a potential DPL DDO. These measures
           are expected to help Romania weather better the impact of the deepening crisis in the
           Eurozone and the risk of contagion. The austerity 2012 budget will reduce fiscal
           pressures and help lower external financing needs. An eventual DPL DDO would help
           strengthen tax administration and mobilization of domestic resources, continue reforms
           aimed at improved efficiency of public sector spending, and serve as a financial buffer.
           Increased mobilization of EU funds would alleviate to some extent fiscal constraints and
           reduce borrowing requirements. NBR has so far managed well pressures on the national
           currency, foreign exchange reserves are at historically high levels, and the new
           precautionary agreements with the IMF and the EC (as well as an eventual DPL DDO)
           provide a cushion in case of need. The financial sector reform program supported by the
           SBA and DPL includes in-depth examinations and recapitalization requirements,
           strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory powers, the preparation of a strategic
           action plan for the banking sector to respond in the event of a crisis, and the
           establishment of a framework to facilitate private and corporate debt restructuring.
          Capacity bottlenecks are partly addressed through ongoing initiatives supported in
           particular by the EC and the Bank, and which aim to strengthen capacity at the center of
           government and in key ministries on the basis of the Government’s action plans
           stemming from recommendations of the Functional Reviews. One of the components of
           the FR for the center of government is to prepare an Annual Government Work Plan. The
           first such plan will be prepared by end-2011 for 2012. The Government has also
           requested Bank support for the implementation of a strategic planning capacity in the
           Prime Minister’s office. The Bank has prepared an Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
           operation, which is currently being reviewed with the Authorities. More needs to be done
           to address capacity shortcomings in local administrations and in the Parliament.

  Mr. Robert Zoellick
  President, World Bank
  Washington OC



           Ref: Letter of Development Policy -Third Development Policy Loan


 Oear Mr. Zoellick,


        This letter summarizes aspects of our program to strengthen public sector
 finances, social protection and the financial sector.

        As a result of the strong fiscal and structural measures taken by the Government
 during 2009-2011, the effects of the global economic crisis have been contained and the
 Romatlian economy has resumed growth. Growth is expected to reach around 1.5 percent .
 of GOP in 2011. and further consolidate towards potential in the medium term, in spite of
the difficult global and regional economic environment At the same time, the structural
reform agenda to support economic growth and resume progress towards convergence
with EU living standards and social cohesion has advanced rapidly. We have vigorously
pursued bold reforms in education, pensions, health, labor markets, social assistance and
other areas to address the root causes of the vulnerabilities exposed by the crisis. These
reforms have placed the sectors covered on a much firmer footing, although more
remains to be done. This reform agenda has been supported by the OPL series, given its
focus on improving the· management of public finances, strengthening social protection
and erihancing the resilience of the financial sector.

        The Goverriment's key medium term objective is to foster steady and equitable
economic growth while keeping the fiscal deficit below 3 percent of GOP. This requires
continued strong pursuit of the adjustment and structural reform agenda. Policies
currently in place will enable Romania to meet the proposed fiscal deficit target of 4.4
percent of GOP in 2011. The Government remains committed to further lowering the
fiscal deficit in 2012, and thus meet the Growth and Stability fiscal deficit target of less
than 3 percent of GOP. The 2011-2013 National Reform Program and the 2012-2014
Fiscal-Budgetary Strategy propose further short to medium-term priority reforms aimed
at prudent macroeconomic management, increased efficiency and transparency of public
administration, and improved business environment. These reflect the Government's
strong and steady commitment to continuing reforms to improve living standards and
catch up with the rest ofthe European Union.

  Reforms aimed at improving the management of public finances

           Our reform agenda aimed at improving the quality of the annual budgeting
  process and rooting it more firmly in a credible medium-term expenditure framework
  (MTEF) has advanced substantially. A Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) was adopted in
  20 I 0, and the Fiscal Council has been established and has started functioning. The FRL
  contains fiscal principles and rules on revenue, expenditure, deficit, public debt and risk
 management with the aim of enhancing fiscal discipline and improving the efficiency of
 public finance management, as well as penalties for failure to comply with the approved
 ceilings. The Government approved the MTEF for 2012-2014 in August 2011, as part of
 the Fiscal Strategy for the period 2012- 2014. The Strategy presents the forecast for the
 macroeconomic framework three years ahead and succinctly describes the policy
 measures through which the Government intends to achieve the proposed indicators, and
 includes analysis of fiscal risks and binding aggregate expenditure ceilings, and strict
 rules on rigorous monitoring and enforcement of the ceilings. It also prohibits new
 measures during the budget year that increase aggregate expenditures beyond the limits
 agreed under the MTEF.

         We have also taken measures to strengthen capacities for strategic planning and
 public finance management. Thus, based on the recommendations of the Functional
 Reviews (FRs), the Goverrnnent has prepared action plans and is embarking on a major
effort to modernize the public administration. The measures in the action plans are both
short and long term and include, inter alia, updated strategies for the transport and
agriculture sectors, anchored into the MTEF and the NRP, a work plan for the
Government for 2012, extended functions for the Public Policy Department in the
General Secretariat of the Government to cover monitOring and evaluation of policies,
further measures to improve tax administration and expenditure policies, as well as
measures to enhance the absorption of the EU funds. We intend to take measures to
strengthen policy coordination at the center of Government, with modalities which
remain to be clarified.

          Our reform agenda in the area of public pay and employment has focused on
 changes to the public pay system to enhance the capacity to attract and retain critical
 skills in public administration and reduce personnel costs. To this end we have adopted a
 Unitary Pay Law (UPL) which provides the structure and principles behind the new pay
 system as well as annual subsidiary legislation which provides specific details including
the implementation schedule of the reformed pay system. Most notably, the UPL
legislation proposed new job grades and target salary levels for all public sector positions,
based on job evaluations completed for selected benchmark jobs. Implementation will
take place over several years and its pace is contingent on the mobilization of necessary .
fiscal resources. Pay adjustments in 20 II have been consistent with the UPL targets. In
April 20 II we have enacted a new Labor Code aimed at improving the flexibility and
competitiveness of the Romanian labor market. The new code promotes fixed-term and
temporary employment, extends probation periods, and increases the flexibility of
working hours.




                                            40
          We have also undertaken reforms in two key sectors with a view to mobilizing
  resources and improving the efficiency and equity of service pinvision. Within the health
  sector we have embarked upon a comprehensive medium term reform agenda. We have
  introduced co-payments to help manage the demand side of health services and create
  incentives for people to use appropriate levels of health services. This is achieved through
  introducing variable copayments that are based on the level of health services used. At
 present there is an over-reliance on the use of expensive hospital services even for
 ailments that could be addressed through simpler, cost-effective diagnostic treatments.
 Co-payment for health services should initiate a shift towards a system where patients
 pay for services in a mOre transparent way while allowing for exemptions based on
 objective and equitable criteria. At the same time, we have advanced the restructuring of
 the hospital network and plan to redefine the basic package of healthcare services, and
 introduce measures aiming to control the continuous increase of costs with the
 consumption of pharmaceuticals.

        There is also scope for improving the efficiency of resource use while enhancing
the quality and access to general education across the country. We are tackling this by
directly addressing the weak incentives currently faced by local authorities in using
resources more efficiently through the introduction of a per student financing formula.
This mechanism will provide local authorities and schools with financial incentives to use
resources more efficiently and take reallocation decisions needed to address quality
enhancement objectives.

Reforms to enhance social protection

        The Government has embarked on a systemic reform of social assistance, starting
with the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) and continuing with a comprehensive
three-year program. Thus, we have enforced more strictly GMI eligibility norms,
earmarked GMI funding and assumed its integral financing, substituting the contribution
of local governments. The Government approved means-testing procedures for heating
benefits, transferred the registry and payment functions for the GMI from local
authorities, to the MoLFPS through the National Agency for Social Benefits, and
approved the consolidation of family allowances. In February 20 II, the Government
adopted the Social Assistance (SA) Reform Strategy followed in April by an action plan
for 2011-2013 that proposes a realistic timeframe with an adequate allocation of
resources and responsibilities, and results indicators for 2011-2012. Subsequent to the
Social Assistance Framework Law, currently being in the Parliament for adoption, a legal
package, simplifying and systematizing the social benefits system based on the SA
Reform Strategy, has been drafted by the Government and will be submitted to the
Parliament for approval.

       The Government has also taken major steps to enhance the fiscal sustainability of
the public pension system. In 20 to the Government tightened controls on pension
expenditures, and the Parliament approved a new pension law that changes the indexation
rule to link adjustments in pension benefits to inflation, and gradually increases the
retirement age for women to 63 years through 2030. The Government initiated a review



                                             41
 of the eligibility of disability pension beneficiaries and decided to align special pensions
 (e.g., the military, interior) with the general public pension system. By end-20ll the
 Government will complete the recalculation of special pensions.

 Reforms to strengthen the financial sector

        Enhancing financial sector viability, efficiency and supervision is a central area of
reform of the authorities. In this sense, in 20 lOwe issued, Consumer Debt Restructuring
Guidelines facilitating debt restructuring, amended the insolvency law and Guidelines for
Corporate Debt Restructuring, introduced a robust policy and decision making process
for the assessment and accreditation of Basel II advanced models, and updated legislation
on political independence and financial autonomy of financial sector regulators. In 2011,
we further enhanced the supervision of financial groups across sub-sectors, after
reviewing the adequacy of supervisory arrangements in the Memorandum of
Understanding between four financial regulators for financial groups in Romania.


Reforms to enhance competitiveness and the efficiency of markets

        The authorities are strongly committed to enhancing Romania's economic
competitiveness and improving the efficiency, fairness and transparency of market
transactions.

         Foremost on the Government's agenda is the modernization of agriculture. We intend to
address one of the key bottlenecks in this area, the fragmentation of agricultural land and the lack
of property titles, which makes consolidation difficult and prevents the introduction of modem
agricultural systems. In line with the 2012-14 Fiscal Strategy and the MTEF, the government will
allocate appropriate resources to the National Agency for Cadaster and Real Estate Publicity
(ANCPl) starting with the 2012 budget, to finance the systematic survey and registration of
agricultural land to the land book and cadastre. We intend to carry out an estimated 500,000 such
registrations annually, with a view to completing by 2026 the covering land book register and
cadaster in rural areas, inclusive of all agricultural lands. The land registration program will
implement strict guidelines aimed at protecting lands set aside for biodiversity or other
environmental purposes. 'The program will ensure that the land registration process is fair, honest,
and avoids any discrimination against any socioeconomic group.

   Valorization is the adjustment of past contributions to account for the changes in the value of contributions between the time they are paid and the time pension is claimed or
calculated. In a point system, valorization is analogous to the procedure used to update the pension point value.

Annex 3: Fund Relation Note

                         Romania—Assessment Letter to the World Bank

                                         November 16, 2011

Growth has resumed in Romania but the recovery remains fragile. After contracting by 7.1
percent and 1.3 percent in 2009 and 2010, the economy is expected to grow by around 2 percent
in 2011–12. The favorable agricultural harvest will likely boost farm incomes and offset slowing
external demand in the short run. This has also reduced significantly the inflationary pressures
that rose earlier from high global food and energy prices. We now expect inflation to remain
within the inflation target range (of 3 +/- 1 percent), despite some increases in administered
prices. Amidst signs of a gradually improving labor market and the anticipated absorption of EU
funds, growth is expected to be mainly driven by domestic demand in 2012. Risks are tilted to
the downside, however, as there remain significant vulnerabilities to adverse developments in
international financial markets and the euro area recovery.

The external account continues to improve. A collapse in domestic demand during the crisis
led to a sharp reversal of the current account deficit to below 5 percent of GDP in 2009 from the
pre-crisis level of over 13 percent of GDP. The export recovery that started in 2010 has generally
held up due to increased market share and a good agricultural harvest, while a subdued domestic
demand continues to limit import growth. The current account deficit is thus projected to remain
around 4–4½ percent of GDP in 2011–12 on the back of improved trade performance. On the
financing side, however, FDI has weakened significantly since the crisis and is expected to
recover only gradually. External debt has risen to around 77 percent of GDP; however, external
financing risks are mitigated by a foreign exchange reserves cushion which currently fully covers
short term liabilities (that include short term debt and amortization of medium and long-term
debt).

The authorities have firmly adhered to the fiscal consolidation path in line with the
commitments under the joint IMF-EU program. Despite a sharp drop in revenues, a large
expenditure-led adjustment under the program helped lower the general government fiscal deficit
since the crisis, making it highly likely that the deficit target of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011 will
be met. The 2012 budget envisages continued spending restraint, targeting a cash deficit of 1.9
percent of GDP. While important reforms to the fiscal framework, pensions, local government,
and tax administration have been achieved, further efforts are needed to strengthen health care
financing, implement public wage sector reforms, and improve capital budgeting and EU funds
absorption. Stronger political commitment to structural reforms in state-owned enterprises will
be key to reduce fiscal pressures and enhance Romania’s growth potential.

The Romanian banking system remains well capitalized but is increasingly vulnerable to adverse
spillover effects from financial market turbulence in Europe. Although profits are declining and NPLs
continue to rise, banks’ capital and provisioning (both high by international standards) provide a
reasonable cushion. Given the significant share of Greek-owned banks operating in Romania, the
authorities have been proactive in monitoring liquidity conditions, strengthening capital buffers, and
enhancing crisis resolution tools. Risks have risen sharply over recent months, however, with the
heightened uncertainties in the euro zone.
