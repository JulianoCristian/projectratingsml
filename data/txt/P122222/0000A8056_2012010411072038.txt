                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         In the context of the current international financial crisis, the objective of the proposed operation is to support the authorities' reforms in fiscal management,
                         social protection and the financial sector. Specifically, these reforms aim to (i) strengthen public expenditure management which has been a key weakness and
                         contributed to the buildup of Romania's vulnerability to the financial crisis; (ii) cushion the impact of the crisis on the poor and vulnerable, enhance the
                         efficiency and targeting of social assistance and improve the fiscal sustainability of pensions; and (iii) minimize risks of a domestic financial sector crisis by
                         addressing current and potential vulnerabilities as well as strengthening regulation and supervision for a more resilient and well functioning financial sector in
                         longer-term.
