The lessons strongly\n            emphasize that, when streamlining institutions, project\n            design should explicitly identify the staff whose expertise\n            will no longer be required, and in turn, include incentives\n            to retain staff with desirable skills. In addition, project\n            design should have also ensured financing arrangements upon\n            the transfer of an autonomous entity, operating on\n            semi-commercial terms, into a budget-supported entity, for\n            instead of allowing full concentration to extension\n            services, such entity also carried the burden of generating\n            their own funds, further increasing their bureaucracy, and\n            dependency on central ministerial services. The concept of\n            \"polyvalence of extension agents\" proved\n            inefficient, and costly, and the quality of service to\n            producers was not improved. However, empowering farmers, and\n            communities with responsibilities, including financial\n            resources management, and appropriate training, contributed\n            to successful partnerships in development, effectively\n            negotiating with the Government, and donors. Nonetheless,\n            the diversity of co-financiers objectives in the rural\n            sector hindered implementation, which should have been\n            agreed at the early stages of the project."}, "docdt": "2000-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
