The\n            project aims to achieve this through financing credit to\n            private farmers and other private businesses for: (a) the\n            establishment and expansion of rural enterprises; and (b)\n            on-farm investment.  The loan will finance private\n            investment in viable agricultural and other rural businesses\n            through a credit line expected to take five years to\n            disburse.  It is intended to be wide ranging and demand led\n            excluding those ineligible subsectors which are assessed not\n            to be economically viable.  It will cover both investment\n            items and incremental working capital for:  (a) agricultural\n            production including certain types of livestock agricultural\n            machinery and related services; (b) processing of\n            agricultural products, particularly small- and medium-scale\n            investment to increase value added in the rural areas; (c)\n            marketing and trade of agricultural products, especially for\n            transport, wholesaling and retailing of both agricultural\n            outputs and inputs; and (d) other rural businesses."}, "docdt": "1992-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
