were highly satisfactory, project\n            sustainability was likely, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the generally\n            successful project outcome underlines a number of positive\n            experiences on which to draw in future and lessons learned\n            when financing development in former command economies. The\n            project also supports the view that credit lines should not\n            be strictly directed to specific sub sectors or to export.\n            Market demand as indicated through PFESP is the right\n            determinant of investment opportunities. The success of the\n            projects financed and the pay back performance of\n            sub-borrowers, who are successfully amortizing their loans,\n            sometimes over shorter periods than initially provided for\n            by banks, are clear indications that a sector wide demand\n            driven credit project can work. Another important lesson\n            learned during the implementation of PFESP is that the\n            choice of the apex institution can greatly affect the\n            outcome of the project. Appointing the Treasury within\n            Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the apex institution for PFESP\n            proved disadvantageous as it introduced a public sector\n            spending control culture into what should have been a purely\n            commercial operation and as a result it generated\n            considerable delays in sub loan processing and disbursement.\n            These added to the costs and risks of project sub-borrowers\n            and considerably frustrated the financial intermediaries\n            (FIs') management."}, "docdt": "1997-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
