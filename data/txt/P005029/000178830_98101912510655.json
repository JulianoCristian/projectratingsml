 shortages of skilled manpower, by providing management and\n            skilled worker training in the agricultural and industrial\n            sectors; improve incomes and living standards of the urban\n            poor by upgrading vocational and handicrafts skills training\n            and thereby improving their employment prospects; raise\n            agricultural productivity and rural incomes by expanding and\n            upgrading training for farmers, support service personnel,\n            and university agricultural education; improve health\n            services by upgrading health sciences university\n            instruction; expand and upgrade secondary and university\n            teaching skills; and strengthen the capabilities of relevant\n            ministries and institutions. To help achieve these\n            objectives, capital and technical assistance would be\n            provided for 25 new and 35 existing vocational, agricultural\n            and handicrafts skills training centers, and an agricultural\n            information reproduction center. The Health Sciences\n            Resource Center would help improve services provided by\n            rural and district health centers. Programs accounting for\n            about 60 percent of the Credit proceeds would be directed at\n            low income groups."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
