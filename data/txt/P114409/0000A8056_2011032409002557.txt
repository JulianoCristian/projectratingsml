                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the first phase of the project is completed. The results of field investigation works, magneto-telluric (MT) sounding and independent interpretation of the
                         sounding results suggested that out of the two geothermal sites, Karkar (in South-Eastern part of the country) has the largest geothermal potential. The second phase of the project
                         includes three-dimensional (3D) magneto-telluric sounding of the Karkar site, independent evaluation of results and assessment of the economic and financial viability of the Karkar
                         site. Procurement of 3D MT sounding for Karkar site is underway.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The results of the first phase of investigation works, comprised of geological field investigations, magneto-telluric sounding of the Karkar and Gridzor potential geothermal sites and
                         independent evaluation of the results of magneto-telluric sounding, suggest that Karkar geothermal site is more promising. Currently, the Renewable Resources and Energy
                         Efficiency Fund, the implementing entity of the project, is procuring the consultant for three-dimensional magneto-telluric sounding of the Karkar site, which will provide further
                         detailed evidence on the potential of the site and enable to make final decision whether exploratory drilling of the site is justified or not.
