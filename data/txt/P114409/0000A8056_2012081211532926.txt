                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective is to remove the barriers to development of geothermal energy.
                         The project development objective is to assess the feasibility of exploratory drilling of the geothermal site with the estimated highest geothermal potential.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation of the first phase of the project is completed. The results of technical field investigation works - two-dimensional magneto-telluric (MT) sounding and independent
                         interpretation of the sounding results - suggested that out of the two geothermal sites, Karkar (in South-Eastern part of the country) has the largest geothermal potential.

                         Implementation of the second phase of the project is underway. The 3D MT sounding of the Karkar site and the independent interpretation of the 3D MT sounding study results are

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The technical investigations completed during Phases 1 and 2 of the project confirmed technical viability of the Karkar site. The economic and financial viability assessment of the
                         prospective geothermal plant in the Karkar site will indicate if exploratory drilling of one or two wells is justified.
