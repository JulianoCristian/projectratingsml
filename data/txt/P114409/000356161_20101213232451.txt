                         Extension of Closing Date
          ARMENIA -- GEOFUND 2: ARMENIA GEOTHERMAL PROJECT

1.      The closing date for Armenia, GEOFUND 2: ARMENIA GEOTHERMAL
PROJECT, (GEF Grant No TF093653), P114409 will be extended from April 30, 2011
until September 30, 2012.

2.       The project development objective is to assess the feasibility of exploratory
drilling of the geothermal site with the estimated highest geothermal potential; this
objective continues to be relevant. The project has made overall good progress towards
achieving the development objective. Specifically, the geological field works, a magneto-
telluric (MT) sounding study, interpretation of the results of the MT sounding and
supervision of the implementation of geological field works and the MT sounding study
have been successfully completed for Karkar and Gridzor sites. These works constituted
Phase I of the project.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow completion of the Phase II
investigation works for Karkar site, which has been identified as more promising based
on Phase I investigations. Phase II investigation works include three-dimensional MT
sounding, interpretation of the results of the three-dimensional MT sounding, supervision
of the implementation of the three-dimensional MT sounding, and assessment of
economic and financial viability of Karkar site. Phase II works were delayed because the
project originally envisaged a three-dimensional seismic survey as part of Phase II works,
which was replaced by the three-dimensional MT sounding as explained in the
Restructuring Paper of June 14, 2010. Given this and the seasonal nature of investigation
works, an extension until September 30, 2012 is necessary to complete Phase II works.

4.     This will be the first extension of the closing date.
