                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective is to remove the barriers to development of geothermal energy.
                         The project development objective is to assess the feasibility of exploratory drilling of the geothermal site with the estimated highest geothermal potential.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of the first phase of the project is completed. The results of technical field investigation works - two-dimensional magneto-telluric (MT) sounding and independent
                         interpretation of the sounding results - suggested that out of the two geothermal sites, Karkar (in South-Eastern part of the country) has the largest geothermal potential. The second
                         phase of the project includes three-dimensional (3D) MT sounding of the Karkar site, independent evaluation of results and assessment of the economic and financial viability of the
                         Karkar site. The Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund has already completed negotiation of the contract for 3D MT sounding of the Karkar site.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The results of the first phase of investigation works, comprised of geological field investigations, two-dimensional MT sounding of the Karkar and Gridzor potential geothermal sites
                         and independent evaluation of the results of MT sounding, suggested that the Karkar geothermal site is more promising. The 3D MT sounding of the Karkar site will provide further
                         detailed evidence on the potential of the site and enable a final decision on whether or not exploratory drilling of the site is justified.
