                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective is to remove the barriers to development of geothermal energy.
                         The project development objective is to assess the feasibility of exploratory drilling of the geothermal site with the estimated highest geothermal potential.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is closing on September 30, 2012 and progressing towards meeting its development objective. The project was limitedtotechnical assistance for comprehensive field
                         investigation works carried out in two Phases.

                         Phase 1: Implementation of thisphasewas completed in November 2009. The results of technical field investigation works - two-dimensional magneto-telluric soundingand
                         independent interpretation of the sounding results - suggested that out of the two investigated geothermal sites,Karkar(inSouth-Eastern part of the country) has the largest geothermal

                         Phase 2: Implementation of the second phase ofthe project was delayed due to the replacement of the originally envisaged three-dimensional seismic survey with thethree-
                         dimensional magneto-telluric sounding. This was based on the results of the Phase 1 site investigation works, whichindicated that geological specifics of the Karkar geothermal site

                         will not allow getting accurate results from thethree-dimensional seismic survey originally envisaged under the project. The implementation of Phase 2 is being finalized. Thethree-
                         dimensional magneto-telluric sounding of the Karkar site and the independent interpretation of the sounding study resultswere completed in May 2012; these estimated the range of
                         geothermal resource temperatures and concluded that the site istechnically viable. The assessment of the economic and financial viability of the conceptual plant at the Karkar site is
                         ongoing;the preliminary results indicate that the economic and financial viability critically depend on the resource temperature, whichwould be confirmed through exploratory drilling.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The technical investigations completed during Phases 1 and 2 of the project concluded that the Karkar site is technically viable. The initial findings of the economic and financial
                         assessment of the conceptual geothermal plant at the Karkar site suggest that the geothermal resource temperature is a critical determinant of the economic and financial viability.
                         Overall, the investigations conducted under the project justify the need for exploratory drilling to confirm the availability of the geothermal resource and its temperature.
