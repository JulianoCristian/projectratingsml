satisfactory, risk to global environment outcome was\n            low or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            include: the project design should allow flexibility\n            regarding the types of field investigation works that can be\n            financed. Thus, if types of field investigation works are\n            strictly prescribed, then a project restructuring will be\n            required, which may delay implementation of the project due\n            to the time required for restructuring and subsequent\n            probability of missing the favorable weather conditions.\n            Procurement of technically sophisticated geo-technical\n            studies should be initiated as early as possible. Given the\n            technically complex nature of some geo-technical studies and\n            non- availability of specialized firms in the local market\n            as well as possible limited interest of internationally\n            renowned firms, it is advisable to start procurement of such\n            studies as early as possible. Otherwise, the consultant\n            selection might result in very few or no bids for such\n            consultancy services, which may require rebidding and delay\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
