the\n            feasibility of exploratory drilling of the geothermal site\n            with the estimated highest geothermal potential; this\n            objective continues to be relevant. The extension is\n            necessary to allow completion of the second phase\n            investigation works for Karkar site, which has been\n            identified as more promising based on first phase\n            investigations. Second phase investigation works include\n            three dimensional Magneto-Telluric (MT) sounding,\n            interpretation of the results of the three dimensional MT\n            sounding, supervision of the implementation of the\n            three-dimensional MT sounding, and assessment of economic\n            and financial viability of Karkar site. Second phase works\n            were delayed because the project originally envisaged a\n            three-dimensional seismic survey as part of second phase\n            works, which was replaced by the three-dimensional MT\n            sounding as explained in the restructuring paper of June 14,\n            2010. Given this and the seasonal nature of investigation\n            works, an extension until September 30, 2012 is necessary to\n            complete second phase works."}, "docdt": "2010-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
