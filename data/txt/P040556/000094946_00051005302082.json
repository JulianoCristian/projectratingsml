access\n            in Georgia's major traffic corridors; 2) to provide a\n            steady and adequate level of funding for road maintenance\n            based on charges related to road use and road access; and 3)\n            to improve the management and effectiveness of the entire\n            road network including local roads by strengthening the\n            state road department and developing the private road\n            construction industry. There are two main project\n            components. The first component provides periodic\n            maintenance and repair of priority sections of the main road\n            network including drainage upgrading and surface treatment;\n            rehabilitates section of the main road network and makes\n            related improvements in shoulders, road marking, and signs;\n            and reconstructs bridges. The second component strengthens\n            the institutional capacity the state roads department,\n            modernizes the road fund and road user charges, develops a\n            traffic safety program, installs a pavement management\n            system and a road data bank, updates technical\n            specifications to international standards, installs a\n            financial management system, improves contract management,\n            plans sectoral performance indicators, sets up training, and\n            funds financial audits and equipment."}, "docdt": "2000-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
