The performances of\n            both the Bank and the Borrower are rated satisfactory. The\n            design and implementation of the project offers the\n            following considerations that might be useful in shaping\n            future projects of this nature: Legal covenants should be\n            carefully worded to allow adequate flexibility in their\n            achievement. An efficient road sector requires the\n            acceptance and adoption of key principles that may be put in\n            place through different mechanisms and under different types\n            of administrations. Among these principles are the need to\n            maintain the quality and serviceability of infrastructure\n            assets through adequate funding, up to date technical\n            capabilities and efficient use of scarce resources and, for\n            the use of public monies, transparency and accountability.\n            The design and implementation of projects in the road sector\n            should give equal or more weight to the issue of quality of\n            expenditures rather than to the issue of quantity of\n            expenditures. Considering that quality issues involve\n            substantial changes in the institutional culture which\n            seldom originate within the road agency, weaknesses in those\n            areas should be brought to the attention of major\n            stakeholders who might have an interest in securing that the\n            increased amount of funding proposed under a project is used\n            wisely. Sector Policy Notes or some other form of sector\n            work, could be an ideal instrument to engage the new\n            government in a meaningful dialogue on sector issues and the\n            role of a project (and future projects) in addressing them.\n            It would provide a strategic blue print or road map for the\n            sector that would help avoid costly mistakes and\n            backtracking, and bring forward those areas that are\n            becoming serious bottlenecks in institutional development\n            (e.g. inadequate university programs, lack of career\n            development incentives, etc). Engaging different\n            stakeholders in a long term vision for the sector would also\n            serve as a cost-effective way to raise awareness of the work\n            ahead and contribute to generate well focused demand driven\n            technical assistances."}, "docdt": "2006-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
