rehabilitation, and\n            reconstruction. The proposed project rating is in\n            Environmental Category B. Such rehabilitation and\n            maintenance projects as this, offer more efficient vehicle\n            operation and a corresponding reduction in pollutant\n            emissions, noise and vibrations from traffic, and the\n            opportunity to offer mitigation of anticipated adverse\n            impacts. Direct negative impacts in this project will arise\n            from 1) producing and applying bituminous products; 2)\n            quarrying stone and gravel 3) causing noise, dust, and\n            traffic disruptions because of construction; and 4)\n            designing and placing drains, which leads to surface\n            erosion. These concerns will be addressed thus:\n            Environmental guidelines will be issued to asphalt plants,\n            which must meet certification requirements to receive\n            project contracts. Similarly, all quarry and crushing sites\n            must obtain certification and all contractors will be\n            required to use materials taken only from licensed sites.\n            All contractors will attend training in construction\n            management and road maintenance as a prerequisite to bidding\n            eligibility. Contract documents will specify that the\n            contractors undertake work site mitigation actions detailed\n            in the bidding documents. Drainage improvements will be\n            considered in project design. Improper drainage will be\n            corrected before road repairs are made."}, "docdt": "2000-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
