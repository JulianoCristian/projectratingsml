The\n            National Polytechnic Institute Project will rehabilitate\n            general facilities and provide specialized instructional\n            facilities, equipment, furniture, instructional materials,\n            fellowships and technical assistance, at the existing site\n            of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI). Four\n            professional specializations will be included: electrical,\n            mechanical, civil engineering, and management/economic\n            engineering. The National Polytechnic Institute Project will\n            also improve the higher technician training programs in\n            these fields. NPI will be placed under one administration.\n            Students will be admitted on the basis of an entrance\n            examination, primarily in mathematics and physics. As a\n            priority, staff training will be provided to upgrade\n            professional skills and train the teachers required.\n            Technical assistance will be provided for teaching, adapting\n            teaching materials and managing the project.
