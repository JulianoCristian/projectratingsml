The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) it is difficult to\n            address public university salary deficiencies outside the\n            broader context of public and private sector remuneration\n            issues; (ii) initial agreement by all parties on a set of\n            common standards, assumptions and objectives is essentialt o\n            smoothi mplementation; (iii) short-term academic training\n            requires careful attention to language issues and the\n            identification of appropriate technical assistance\n            providers; and (iv) frequent change of task management\n            defeats the purpose of supervision."}, "docdt": "1997-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
