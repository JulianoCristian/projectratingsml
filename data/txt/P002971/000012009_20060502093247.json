Lessons convey the following. Pilot\n            and demonstration approaches to reform implementation will\n            not automatically generate or document a learning process,\n            nor will such approaches necessarily lead to a fine-tuning\n            of reforms in light of experience, if they are not well\n            prepared and if they are not fully understood and owned by\n            Government and other stakeholders. Important ingredients to\n            a successful pilot include: the definition of the learning\n            agenda; the definition of the pilot process, including the\n            use of evaluation for scaling-up; a clear and coherent\n            monitoring and evaluation framework, including indicators,\n            tools and methodologies; the availability of essential\n            inputs; a realistic timetable; and strong social and\n            political commitment. The absence of a clear and coherent\n            results framework (clearly stated objectives, well-chosen\n            indicators and a well-defined results chain, linking inputs,\n            outputs, outcomes and impact) is likely to cause confusion\n            among national stakeholders and compromise national\n            understanding and commitment, especially when the project is\n            complex and is supporting far-reaching reforms. Importantly,\n            adequate attention must also be given to assessing the\n            political feasibility of projects."}, "docdt": "2006-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
