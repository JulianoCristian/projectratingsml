  About this Report
        The Independent EvaluationGroup assessesthe programs and activitiesof the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
  ensurethe integrity of the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank's work is producingthe expected
  results,and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthroughthe disseminationof lessons
  drawn from experience.As partof this work, IEGannually assesses about 25 percentof the Bank's lendingoperations. In
  selectingoperations for assessment, preferenceis given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are
  relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations;those for which ExecutiveDirectors or Bank managementhave
  requestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generateimportant lessons.The projects,topics, and analytical
  approachesselected for assessmentsupport larger evaluationstudies.
       A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion Report
  (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare PPARs, IEG staff
  examine project files and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit the borrowing country for
  onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the
  information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader IEG studies.
        Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and IEG management approval. Once cleared internally, the PPAR
  is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent to the
  borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
  Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


  About the IEG Rating System
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEG are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
  methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or sectoral
  approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition
  and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the IEG website:
  http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
  development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
  (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational
  Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial,Modest, NegIigible.
       Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
 opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Susfainabilify: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnsfitutional DevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region to
 make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a) better
 definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b) better
 alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these institutional
 arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a project. Possible
 ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and supported
 implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements for regular
operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the achievement of
development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.

 Preface

         This i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the District Health
 Services Pilot and DemonstrationProject (DHSP) inUganda. This project was financed
 through IDA Credit No, 2679 inthe amount o f US$45.0 million equivalent (30.9 Million
 SDR) with a planned government contribution o f US$6.9 million, andprojected cofinancing
 byKfW (US$ 9 million), SIDA (US$7.0 million), ODNDFID (US$2.2 million) and
 DANIDA (US$5.0 million). The credit was approved onFebruary 7, 1995, became effective
 on July 17, 1995 and closed on the originally scheduled closing date o f December 31,2002.
 The credit was 98 percent disbursed.

         The findings o f this assessment are based on an Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
 mission to Uganda carried out inFebruary 2005. This mission assessedtwo completed IDA-
 financed projects: (a) the Uganda Sexually Transmitted Infections Project (Credit No. 2603)
 on which a PPAR i s already published(World Bank, June 2005) and used as input to an
 evaluation o f the World Bank's assistance for HIV/AIDS control (World Bank, 2005); and
 (b) the DHSP, which is the subject o fthis report. The mission met inKampalawith
 authorities and staff of the Ministry of Health and the Uganda AIDS Commission; other

 Summary
         The main objective o f the District Health Services Pilot and Demonstration Project
 (DHSP) was to test, on a pilot basis, and demonstrate the feasibility o f delivering an essential
 health services package (EHP) to district populations within a prudent financial policy
 framework, through an integratedprogram o fpolicy, institutional and financial
 improvements inorder to improve efficiency and equity inthe provision o f health services.
 Specific objectives were to: (a) mobilizemore resources for the health sector; (b) improve
 efficiency intheir use; (c) decentralizehealth services; (d) restore the functional capacity and
 improve the efficiency o f essential existing government facilities; and (e) facilitate a greater
 role for the non-governmental sector. Project implementation was constrainedby
 inadequate Government counterpart financing, weak procurement capacity, and delays inthe
 support o f district activities due to bottlenecks indisbursements to districts and to an
 underestimation o f capacity constraints duringproject design.

         Uganda's highburden o f disease i s largely attributable to preventable diseases. Once
 considered to be one o f the best inAfhca inits earliest years o f independence, Uganda's
 health system was devastated by the civil conflict that occurred inthe 1970sand 1980s, and
 suffered as well from relative neglect by government. Inthe early 1990sthe Ministry o f
 Health (MoH) launched a reform o f the health sector, which aimed to place due emphasis on
prevention and promotion, mobilize additional resources, buildmanagerial capacity, promote
community participation, strengthen private/public partnerships, and decentralize the health
 sector.

        Prior to the DHSP, the FirstHealth Project (Credit 1934), approved inFY88,
supported the rehabilitation o f health infrastructure and the provision o fbasic health services,
including support to HIV/AIDS. Donor support focused on rehabilitation o f infrastructure,
but was largely uncoordinated. The initial design o f an IDA-financed follow-on operation
included support to health sector reform and to the fight against HIV/AIDS, but was later
split into (a) the Sexually Transmitted Infections Project, approved on April 12, 1994, on
which a PPARhas already been issued(World Bank, 2005); and (b) the DHSP, which i s the
subject o f this review.

        Pilot and Demonstration. The potential for learning under this project was
undermined by the decisions first in 1996to merge the pilot and demonstration phases, and
then in 1998 to extend project support from the 16pilot/demonstration districts to all 56
districts inUganda, without the benefit o f evaluating each phase, and fine-tuningsector
reformbefore its nationwide application. Political pressures to expand project support
rapidly to all districts duringa post-conflict period were formidable. While the fostering o f a
learning process through pilot and demonstration phases was negligible, some learning did
occur, nevertheless. First, about thirty studies were undertaken on various aspects o f sector
reform, although they were not organized for maximum learning, nor were the study results
fully exploited. Second, the experience o fimplementing reforms supported under this
project constituted a learning process inand o f itself, albeit limited and largely
undocumented.

        Mobilization of resources. Total per capita expenditure on health more than doubled
duringthe life o fthe project from an estimatedUS$7.74 in 1992/93 to about $18.31 in

                                                  X



  2000/01. However, the level o f per capita spending stagnated over the last few years o f the
 project, and falls short o f the estimatedUS$28 per capita needed to deliver basic services to
 Uganda's population. Government expenditure did not increase sufficiently to compensate
  for the 2001 Presidential decision to abolish users' fees. The project failed to mobilize
 private resources through experimentation inhealth insurance and other risk pooling
  schemes.

          EfJiciency in Resource Utilization. Project support has been instrumental ineffecting
 improvements inthe efficient allocation and utilization of health sector resources, but the
  financing o f EHP delivery to Uganda's population is still inadequate and spending patterns
 are still inequitable. Duringthe life o f the project health sector financing was increasingly
 allocated away from central-level M o H and referral hospitals infavor o f district health
  services and primary health care and this favorable trend has continued after the project's
 closing. Health services are still chronically underfinanced and the cost-effectiveness o f
 service provisionhas not been evaluated.

          Decentralization. Project support to health sector decentralizationhas culminated in
 a new organizational structure for M o H and redefinedroles and responsibilities for central
 and decentralized levels o fMoH. Project support has contributed to strengthened capacity at
 central and district levels to take on their newly assigned roles ina decentralized system, but
 there remain some issues o f accountability inthe management and use o f financial resources
 and inthe achievement o fresults.

         Essential Health Sewices. The project provided substantial assistance to the design
 and delivery o f the essential health package aimed at addressing Uganda's disease burden,
 initially in 13 pilot/demonstration districts and ultimately extended to all districts. K e y
 indicators on the delivery o f the EHP show mixed trends. While physical access improved
 somewhat, disparities persisted (urban-rural, regional, district and income), and chronic
 shortages o f drugs, human resources and recurrent financing undermined service quality.
K e y performance indicators inmaternal and child services remained virtually unchanged
 except for a notable decline inimmunization rates.

         Partnerships with the non-governmental sector. The project facilitated a greater role
for private not-for-profit agencies, both by ensuringthat they benefited from support
provided to districts, and by usingthem as contractual agents to carry out district-level
services and activities. Project experience did, however, reveal some reticence inassigning
significant roles to NGOs and the for-profit sector. Project support to community-level
health was limited and fell short o f its potential.

         Health Outcomes. The overarching goal o f improvinghealth status was not achieved.
Keyhealthindicators didnot essentiallychange over the life o fthe project and inequities in
health status persist. However, it i s important to note that (a) health sector investment is but
one o f many determinants o f health status; and (b) the counterfactual o fno project might
have resulted ina deteriorization o f health status.

         Ratings. The outcome o f the DHSP is rated moderately unsatisfactory, overall, based
on three project ratings o f substantial relevance, modest efficacy, and modest efficiency.
Institutional development is rated as substantial; and sustainability is rated as likely. The

                                               x i


Bank's performance was unsatisfactory because the pilot approach was insufficiently
developed and inappropriate to Ugandas's post conflict situation; and inadequate attention
was paid to monitoring and evaluation. The Borrower's performance was satisfactory.

Lessons

   0  Pilot and demonstration approaches to reform implementation will not automatically
      generate or document a learning process, nor will such approaches necessarily lead to
      a fine-tuning o f reforms inlight o f experience, ifthey are not well prepared and if
      they are not fully understoodand ownedby Government and other stakeholders.
      Important ingredientsto a successful pilot include: the definition o f the learning
      agenda; the definition o f the pilot process, including the use o f evaluation for scaling-
      up; a clear and coherent monitoring andevaluation framework, includingindicators,
      tools and methodologies; the availability o f essential inputs; a realistic timetable; and
      strong social and political commitment.

  0   The absence o f a clear and coherent results framework (clearly stated objectives,
      well-chosen indicators and a well-defined results chain, linkinginputs, outputs,
      outcomes and impact) is likely to cause confusion among national stakeholders and
      compromise national understanding and commitment, especially when the project is
      complex and i s supporting far-reaching reforms.

  0   Thoughtful project design, adequate implementation, and timely monitoring and
      evaluation are necessary, but not sufficient for project success. Adequate attention
      must also be given to assessing the political feasibility o f projects.

      Bank support o f the health sector has implications that extend far beyond the health
      sector alone. It can point the way toward successful decentralization, mobilize public
      resources, influence improved efficiencies inpublic expenditure, and encourage
      public private partnerships.

  1. Backgroundand Context

  1.1      As o f2003 Ugandahada population o f about 25.3 million, growing at an annual rate
 o f 2.7 percent (World Bank World Development Indicators 2005), o f which more than one
 thirdwas livingbelow the poverty line (MoFPED 2005). Uganda's humandevelopment
 indicators have lagged behind its good economic performance inthe 1990s, a remaining
 consequence o fpolitical and economic turmoil o f the 1970s and early 1980s.

 1.2       After independence in 1962 and throughout the 1960sUganda showed great potential
 as one o f the strongest economies in Sub-Sharan Africa. However, its performance was set
 back considerably duringthe subsequent periods o f military rule (1971-79) and civil war
 1980-85). In 1987the new National Resistance Movement (NRM)government under the
 leadership o f President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni launched a recovery program to restore
 financial stability, create conditions for rapid and sustained growth and develop human
 capital. It also embarked on policy and institutional reform to deregulate the economy,
 eliminate direct state involvement inall but essential public services, and improve
 institutional efficiency. These efforts put Uganda on a path o f recovery, but progress was
 slow through the early 1990s.

 1.3      In1996Museveni was elected as Heado fState inthe first Presidentialelectionunder
the new Constitution ratified in 1995. This new government sought to enhance the poverty
 focus o f national development objectives and policies. To this end it set out to maximize
growth, increase domestic resource mobilization, improve public sector management
(through decentralization,' civil service reform and efficient allocation and use o f resources),
promote private sector development, and protect the environment. Substantial progress in
'social and economic development has beenmade inthe 1990s, including: economic growth
averaging 6.5 percent per year since 1992, some improvement inquality and access o f basic
social services and a noticeable fall inincome poverty. However, income poverty has
recently risen from 34 percent in2000 to 38 percent in2003, inequality has increased,' and
conflict persists inthe north. Government's most recent Poverty Eradication Action Plan
(PEAP 2004/5 -2007/8) cites four core challenges: the restoration o f security andimproving
regional equity; sustainable growth inthe incomes o f the poor; human development; and
usingpublic resources transparently and efficiently to eradicate poverty.

1.4       The existence o f formal civil society organizations (CSOs) dates back to colonial
rule, duringwhich time they were established to promote economic and social interests o f
various groups and to resist colonial oppression and e~ploitation.~Colonial-era CSOs also
included welfare and charitable organizations such as national branches o f the Red Cross
Society, the Salvation Army, and other European-basedorganizations. However, duringthe
dictatorships o f IdiAmin and Milton Obote (1966-86), associational life inUganda was
severely repressed.

  1.5      The establishment o f the NRM Government in 1986 enabled a revival and rapid
  growth o f CSOs. As o f 2002 there were over 2000 registeredNGOsinUganda, and many
 more (unregistered) community-based organizations (CBOs) and other informal groups.
 NGOs and CBOs represent abroad and diverse range o f constituencies, motivations, roles
  and mandates, encompassing: promotiono f group interests, service delivery, advocacy,
 community development, culture and religion, networking and information dissemination.
 They are increasingly consulted inpolicy formulation and inmonitoring public expenditure
 at the district level, but needto further develop capacities inthese areas. Additionally, they
 are heavily concentrated inand around Kampala.

  1.6      In1997the Government ofUgandaprepareda first draft ofaPoverty Eradication
 Action Plan (PEAP), which was revised in2000 to cover the period 2000-2003. This
 document, which guides public action to eradicate poverty, was the first Poverty Reduction
 Strategy Paper (PRSP) to be approved by the World Bank and IMFinM a y 2000. A second
 PEAP covering the period 2004/5 -2007/8 was issuedby Government in2004.

 Health Sector4
 1.7       Health indicators inthe early 1990srevealed very highinfant, child and maternal
 mortality rates, high fertility, and high levels o fmaln~trition.~Uganda's highdisease burden
 is documented ina 1995 Burdeno f Disease (BOD) Cost-Effectiveness study, which found
 that over three quarters o f life years lost from premature deathwere due mainly to
preventable diseases. Some sixty percent o f the total national disease burden is attributable
to prenatal and maternal conditions, malaria, acute respiratory tract infections, AIDS and
diarrhea. Non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cancer, mental illness, and
chronic heart disease) are increasing inoccurrence.

 1.9        Country Assistance Strategy, The primary objective o f the Bank's strategy for
 Uganda inthe 1990swas to reduce poverty through efforts to: maximize labor-intensive
 economic growth, strengthen economic and social infrastructure, support humanresource
 development, enhance the provision o f public services, and measure effectively changes in
 poverty over time (World Bank 1995). Among the highestpriorities o f this strategy were
 improvements inhealth and education. Support to health sector development emphasized
primary and preventive care, decentralization, and HIV/AIDS. While lending for health and
HIV/AIDS was initially conceived under one project design inthe early 1990s, it was
 decided to split them into two separate operations to accelerate the availability o f financing
 for HIV/AIDS, which was considered urgent.6

  the construction and rehabilitation o fhealth infrastructure and the provisiono f essential
  inputs for service delivery and (increasingly) to the fight against HIV/AIDS. At that time
  donors were working inparallel and uncoordinated, although two (Austria and Swedish
  SIDA) didcofinance the first IDA-financed HealthProject inUganda.


 2.        Objectives and Design

 2.1       The District Health Services Pilot and Demonstration Project (DHSP) was financed
 through an IDA credit o f US$45.0 million equivalent,' approved on February 7, 1995 and
 declared effective on July 17, 1995, and a planned government contribution o f US$6.9
 million. Inaddition, anticipated cofinancing brought the total estimatedproject cost to
 US$75.1 million, including Swedish SIDA (US$7.0 million), DANIDA (US$5.0 million),
 KfW(US$9.0 million) andODA (US$2.2 millionequivalent).

 2.2       Objectives. Insupport o fthe CAS objectives o fhumanresources development and
 poverty reduction, the overarching goal o f the DHSP was to improve the health status o f the
 populations inthe project districts (World Bank, 1994 and World Bank, 1995). The main
 objective o f the project was to test, on a pilot basis, and demonstrate the feasibility o f
 delivering an essential health services package to district populations within a prudent
 financial policy framework, through an integratedprogram o f policy, institutional and
 financial improvements inorder to improve efficiency and equity inthe provision of health
 services. Specific objectives o f the project" were to: (a) mobilize more resources for the
 health sector (for improved sustainability), both through increases inpublic financing and
 through alternative/additional financing mechanisms; (b) improve efficiency inthe use o f
 these resources, reallocating expenditures towards the EHP; (c) support the implementation
 o f national decentralizationpolicy inthe health sector (including capacity buildingat central
 and decentralized levels o f MoH); (d) restore the functional capacity and improve the
efficiency o f essential existing government facilities; and (e) facilitate a greater role for
NGOs, the private sector andcommunities (experimentation w/ contracting out).

outcome or impact indicators were established during the design stage. As a part o f this PPAR exercise, an assessment o f
the various iterations o f goals, objectives and expected outcomes was undertaken to create a more systematic presentation o f
the hierarchy o f objectives that would serve as the framework for evaluating project performance. Annex C, Table C-1

 2.3        Components. Insupport o fthese objectives the proposedproject would (a) pilot and
 test/demonstrate new sector policies and strategies which would facilitate the implementation
 o f essential health services; (b) strengthen management and planning capacity at district
 levels so that they would be prepared to provide essential health services; and (c) restructure
 the M o H so as to build its capacity to provide healthpolicy leadership and to support the
 Government's decentralizationpolicy. Project components (with estimated costs at
 appraisal) are briefly presentedbelow.

 2.4        PilotActivities (US$8.2 million). This component was intended to support the
 implementation o f an essential package o f cost-effective health services inthree pilot districts
 (Soroti, Mukono and Masindi), which had (among other districts) carried out a burden o f
 disease analysis and prepared action plans. At the designstage, drawing on the results o f the
 burden o f disease analysis and cost-effective analysis carried out inUganda, M o H decided
 that the cost-effective package o f services (encompassing public health, preventive and

planning and immunization services; hygiene, water and sanitation interventions; nutrition;
 tuberculosis and STIcontrol;" treatment o f other common diseases and health problems; and
 surveillance/treatment o f special healthproblems.l2This component was designed to support
delivery o f this essential package o f health services (EHP), achieving a coverage of 60
percent o f district populations (from a baseline o f 20 percent), throughthe financing o f
critical inputs (drugs, equipment, supplies, rehabilitation works) and activities
(training/capacity building, supervision costs, social mobilization, maintenance, operational
research and monitoring and evaluation). It was also tailored to support learning inthe
following areas: innovative health financing; contracting out o f repair, maintenance and
rehabilitation; contracting out o f health services; motivational remuneration o f health
workers; assessment o f changes inhealth status attributed to essential health package. The
pilot phase would be concluded with an assessment o f the delivery, management and impact
o f the EHP inthe three pilot districts and inthree other districts that were also receiving
support to deliver the EHP.13

2.5        DemonstrationActivities (US$19.1 million). This component was intended to
continue support for the pilot districts and extend support to an additional seven districts for
the delivery o fthe EHP, which would have been fine-tuned inlight o f lessons learnedunder
the pilot phase. Coverage was also anticipated to increase from a notional 20 percent to 60
percent o f district populations. It also aimed to continue and deepen the learning process on
the five topics slated for the pilot phase and extend it to other topics, including community-
based health and quality monitoring and assurance. Districts were to be selected to
participate inthe demonstration phase based on their satisfaction o f a number of criteria,
which would ensure that they would: (a) be decentralized by the central government, (b) have
a healthpolicy and implementation plans satisfactory to IDA, (c) volunteer for inclusion in

  2.6     CapacityBuildingfor DistrictHealthAdministrations(US$36.7 million). This
  component was designed to be nationwide inits coverage, but phasedinits approach. Inthe
 context o f an ongoing process o f decentralization, it aimed to support strengthening o f
 districts' capacities for health management and administration through training and on-the-
 job advice and assistance inplanning, programming, supervision, monitoring and evaluation,
 financial management and financial reporting. To this end, computers, equipment, logistical
 support and some rehabilitation were also envisaged. The component also envisaged support
 to study and nurture innovations, including the development o fprivate health units, increased
 autonomy o f selected public facilities, improved effectiveness o f training inGovernment
 institutions, contracting out o f services, and new health financing mechanisms. Inaddition,
 this component aimedto strengthen the public health capacity o fthe NationalResistance
 Army.

 2.7      Restructuringand Capacity Buildingof MoH(US$S.O million). This component
 sought to reorient the structure o f central-level M o H to accommodate ongoing health sector
 reforms, particularly health sector decentralization and the integration o f health programs and
 services. A plan to consolidate and restructure M o Hto this end was to be developed and
 implement with project support. This component also sought to strengthen the Health
 Planning and Inspection Department through the provisiono f study tours, training, short-
 term technical assistance, and software systems for management and information. It was
 also designedto support the relocation and full establishment o f all M o H departments in
 Kampala, which hadbeen scattered between Kampala and Entebbe. To this end, the project
 provided for the rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping o f existing buildings inKampala,
 with no new construction envisaged.

 2.8      ProjectOrganizationandManagement,includingmonitoringand evaluation
 (US$3.1 million). The project aimed to support the costs o f a Project Coordinating Unit
 (PCU) (shared with the IDA-financed Sexually Transmitted Infections project14), including
 salaries, office, furniture, equipment, vehicles, supplies, technical assistance, supervision,
mission travel and other operating costs. This component also provided for a project launch
workshop and funds for the preparation o f a follow-on project. Implementation
arrangements and monitoring and evaluation are described briefly below.

2.9      ImplementationArrangements. The project was placed under the overall
responsibility o f the MoH, with the Permanent Secretary (PS) serving as Project Director in
charge o f coordination and implementation oversight. A PCU, headedby a senior Public
Health Specialist reporting directly to the PS, was given responsibility for day-to-day
management and coordination o f the project. Staffing o f the P C Uwas to include a small
professional staff(an administrator, three accountants, a procurement specialist, an engineer)
and support staff. The Project Coordinator would serve as Secretary to a Project Steering
Committee, established during the project design stage to act as an advisory body during
implementation. This Committee was chaired by the PS/MoH, with representation from
other departments inMoH, National Medical Stores, Ministries o f Public Service, Local

 Government (Decentralization Secretariat), Finance and Economic Planning, Justice and
 Constitutional Affairs, and selected local authorities. It was supposed to meet on a quarterly
 basis with the flexibility to invite wider participation from districts, NGOs and other
 interestedparties on an ad hoc basis.

 2.10    At the central level, M o H was to be involvedinproject management, oversight and
 implementation on a number o f fronts. The PS was assigned responsibility for the
 implementation o f capacity buildingactivities at central and district levels. Given the strong
 focus o f this project on district-level support and implementation, two district support teams
 drawn from the HealthPlanning Department staff were responsible for frequent travel to
 districts for close supervision and on-the-job training and support, both technical and
 managerial innature, inclose collaboration with the PCU. The HealthPlanning and
 Inspection Departments were given responsibility to carry out pilot activities and studies
 envisaged duringthe pilot and demonstrationphases. Inrespect o f their normal
 responsibilities, the Director General o f Health Services and other technical staffo f the M o H
 were supposed to provide technical support to the districts inline with the demands o f the
 project and their comparative advantages.

 2.11 At the district level, the district medical officer (DMO) was responsible for
 coordinating and implementing the EHP intheir respective districts, assuming lead
responsibility for planning, implementing and monitoring district-level activities supported
under the project. They were expectedto: undertake annual exercises to review and report on
implementation o f previous plans and to prepare plans and targets for the coming year in
light o fpast performance, carry out supervision activities, manage district healthteams, and
reach out to communities, district authorities, NGOs and other local level partners and
stakeholders inthe achievement o f project objectives. The districts were also encouragedto
contract out health services and outreach activities as well as non-health support services to
non-public local level actors, where feasible.

2.12     Project funds were supposed to be advanced to districts on a quarterlybasis, based on
funding requirements o ftheir annual plans which were to bereviewed and approvedby the
central level (PS). Initial disbursements would be deposited into accounts to be opened by
each district and subsequent disbursements would be made quarterly, on the basis o f
statement o f expenses and reports submitted to MoH/PCU. The DMO would thus be
accountable for the proper use o f financial resources and o f goods and services received
under the project. Reporting responsibilities would encompass both financial and plan
implementation aspects.

2.13    Monitoring and Evaluation activities planned under the project are discussed in
Chapter 4.

 3.       Implementation and Costs

 ImplementationExperience

 3.1      The project was approved on February 7, 1995, and declared effective on July 17,
  1995. It was implemented over a period o f seven and one half years, closing on December
 31,2002, as planned.

 3.2      Counterpart financingand legalcovenants. The Government didnot fully meet its
 counterpart obligations, a problem generic to virtually all projects inthe Bank's portfolio for
 Uganda. While a decision taken duringthe mid-term review to reduce the counterpart from
  10percent to 5 percent o f total project costs helped alleviate financial constraints, the timely
 release o f Government funds remained problematic. Still other financial pressures
 undermined smooth project implementation, most notably: (a) delays inthe payment o f taxes
 on goods imported with project funding, which caused MoHto pay substantial amounts in
 interest and demurrage charges and incurred major delays inthe release o f these goods
 essential to implementation; and (b) shortfalls and delays inthe payment o f health providers'
 salaries. The majority o f legal covenants were fully met by Government. A condition o f
 disbursement, banning expenditure on the demonstration phase until completion o f the pilot
 phase, was not met. No violation o f project safeguards was reported or observed.

 3.3      Procurementfor civilworks andmedical equipment was delayed by some three
 years. The mid-termreview raised a number o f underlying reasons for such delays: (a)
 confusion over the role o f the Central Tender Board and consequent delays inbid evaluation
 approval; (b) breach o f confidentiality inthe tendering process; (c) inadequate capacity for
 procurement at the PCO, including lack o f familiarity with IDAprocedures; and (d) the
 absence o f a viable procurement plan at the project's outset. Considerable procurement
 responsibility was decentralized to district tender boards, which met very rarely as districts
 often lacked funds to pay tender board allowances. District-level procurement was thus also
delayed, or, insome cases, didnot take place at all. Delays inthe purchase o f equipment and
goods: (a) underminedproject software efforts, especially service delivery, training and
supervision; (b) inflated their costs; and (c) tied up project funds. Inadequate capacity to
document fully the needs and technical specifications resulted insome acquired equipment
being inappropriate (e.g., electrical equipment ordered for health centers without electricity).
Informants at central and district levels noted that while procurement capacity has improved
through the experience o f project implementation, it is still inneed o f further improvement.

3.4      FinancialManagement. External audits andperiodic supervision o f districts bythe
PCO and the Bank have confirmed that overall the Government respected the exigencies o f
financial management and accounting requiredby IDA. However, as was the case for the
Sexually Transmitted Disease Pr~ject,'~the decentralized nature o f the project design was
innovative and thus caused complications and delays as central and district capacity was
slowly built through experience. Other bottlenecks to the smooth flow o f funds to districts
included: delays insubmitting district financial accounting reports, on which basis they
would receive a follow-on tranche o f financial support, turnover o fthe district accounting

                                                                  9


   staff, the (initial) small size o f the Special Account, and the closure in 1999 o f the
   commercial Bank holdingthe Special Account.16The PCO exerted considerable and
   sustained effort to improve financial flows to districts and to further develop district financial
  management and accounting capacity, including the provision o f technical assistance,"
   training and guidelines, and frequent and supportive supervision. A special World Bank
   disbursement mission culminated ina tripling o f the initial amount (US$750,000) o f the
   Special Account. A good indicator o f growing district capacity for financial management i s
  an increase indistricts' capacity to absorb all financial resources, from 78 percent in95/96 to
  96 percent in01/02 (Konde-Lule, et. al).

  3.5       Disbursements were slow initially due to issues cited above, notably: (a) major
  delays inprocurement; (b) the inadequate size o f the Special Account; (c) and delays in
  submission o f districts financial reports, which are required both for a replenishment o f the
  Special Account and for an authorization to release the next tranche o f funds. The
  disbursement lag ultimately disappeared as district absorptive capacity improved and
  procurement was carried out. Duringthe last years o f the project disbursements to districts
  had to be scaled down as remaining project funds became fully committed.

  3.6       Role of Civil Society Organizations/Subcontracting. The initial project design
  envisaged an identification at the district level o f services and activities that could be
  contracted out and award o f contracts to the most qualified bidder through a competitive
 process. Inpractice, however, districts chose to involve reputable NGOs already active in
  the health sector" inthe annual health planning exercises and to programjointly with them
 their continued (and/or expanded) support to district health sector goals inline with their
 capacities and comparative advantages. NGOs were also invitedto submit technical
 proposals for financing. It is reported that district-level contracts with NGOs supported
 under DHSP covered a range o f services and activities encompassing the delivery o f health
 services and a number o f support services, including: supervision, training, transport
 operation and maintenance, construction and social marketing. Informants fiom both central
 and district levels noted that partnerships with NGOs were modest, compared with those
 developed (by those same districts) underthe STIP project. Discussions with informants
 revealedthat the notion o f complementarity was more accepted for HIV/AIDS activities,
 while the notion o f competition was still an underlying factor indistricts relative reluctance
 to contract out health sector activities. Neither the DHSP nor the STIP evaluated the
 NGO/CBO activities they supported, nor were they systematic even inmonitoring activities
 or financial accountabilities o f NGOs. By the end o fthe project NGOs received some 12
percent o f district funding, falling short o f the project goal o f 30 percent. This shortfall
notwithstanding, a range o f informants confirmed that World Bank's support and
 encouragement o f partnerships with NGOs under DHSP and STIP were instrumental in


 16. The closing o f the InternationalCredit Bank right after replenishment o f the Special Account had been authorized by
IDA caused a considerable amount o fproject financingto be unavailable for a period o f time.
17. SIDA provided a full-time technical assistant to the PCO to support capacity buildingo f district-level accountants in
financial management and accounting. All districts visited and central level staff expressed profound appreciation for his
dedication and availability, which culminated in improved district capacity.

18. District-level informantsnoted that NGOswere solicited on the basis of: their location and target groups (with a view to
improving coverage and equity); implementationexperience and capacity; the nature and sustainability o f their activities;
their technical capacity; and their transparency.

  influencing the formal adoption o f this practice inthe context o f a new health policy. See
  also Annex D for more detail on support to NGOs.

  3.7         Project managementand oversight. The Project Steering committee didn't
  function, as planned. It met very infrequently and its role was not fully understood by its
  members. This issue was resolved towards the end o fthe project when the Department o f
  Planning was sufficiently strengthened to assume responsibility for oversight and
  coordination o f implementation.

  3.8        Risks. Three ofthe four mainrisks identified duringproject design didcome to pass.
 First, the implementation capacity o fthe central MoHand o f district-level institutions was
 weak vis-&vis the sweeping reforms proposed (especially decentralization), but mitigation
 efforts such as annual planning and reviews and quarterly monitoring and close, supportive
 supervision were effective inslowly buildingsuch capacity. Second,inadequate skills and
 compensation o fhealth personnel did limit the capacity to improve the quaIity and coverage
 o f essential health services. Solutions to this issue (recruitment and payment o f adequate
 salariedsalary arrears) were, however, beyond the mandate o f the project (or MoH) to
 address. Third,the starting point o f inequitable financial and other support to public vs.
 NGO services within a district were mitigatedbyproject support to district plans, which was
 holistic inits inclusion o fNGOs to benefit from essential inputs andprocesses (drugs,
 equipment, supportive supervision, training, support o f other activities and operational costs).
 While the risk o f conservative elements ingovernment and civil society blocking or slowing
 the process o f reformdidnot come to pass, anunanticipatedpoliticalrisk didemerge.
 Against the backdrop o f a post-conflict situation and a strong emphasis on equity, the notion
 o f a pilot approach was never fully accepted. Instead, there was a strong drive for
 immediately distributingthe resources o f this health project equitably across all districts.

 Plannedvs. ActualInputs/Activitiesby Component

3.9         Annex D provides a detailed inventory o f planned vs. actual project support by
component. Project inputs are also discussed inChapter 4 inrelation to the sub-objective(s)
they were supporting. Actual project support differed from plannedsupport inthree
fundamental ways. First, the pilot and demonstration phases were merged and project
support was extendednationwide without first evaluating pilot/demonstration experience, as
hadbeenplanned. Second, actual civil works cost almost double the initial estimates. Third,
monitoring and evaluation was not implemented as planned.

3.10        Merging of Pilot and Demonstration Components and Extension of Project
Support to all Districts: Duringa supervision missioninNovember 1996,more than a year
after effectiveness and some two years prior to the mid-term review, ajoint (Bank and
Borrower) decision to merge the pilot and demonstration phases was taken, prompted largely
bythe delays inproject startup (especially procurement), on the one hand, and the short
timeframe for the pilot operation on the other (internal supervision reporting). As a
consequence, project support was extended to an additional seven district~'~without the


19. A redrawing of administrativedistricts during project implementation increasedthe total number of districts from 39 to
56 andthe total number o f districts to be coveredunderthis project (from 13 to 16) as follows: pilot districts (3 to 4); pre-
pilot districts (3 to 4); demonstrationdistricts (7 to 8).

  benefit o f an evaluation o f an initialpilot phase. Subsequently, during a 1998 supervision
 mission, it was agreed to extend the project benefits to all districts (internal supervision
 reporting). While some operational research and studies were undertaken (itemized inAnnex
  C.), the project ultimately did not assess, as originally intended, the effectiveness and lessons
 o f implementing sweeping reforms ina few pilot and (subsequently) demonstration districts
 before expandingthemnationwide. Table 1below provides an overview o f the planned vs.
 actual approach for the pilot and demonstration phases.

 3 districts:     A decision to combine pilot and demonstration phases was          Some analyses/reviews of isolated pilot
 Gulu, Kabale,    taken during a supervision mission in 1996. Thus the              schemes on a range of topics, carried out in
 Tororo were      evaluation of the pilot phase was not undertaken. This            different localities, were undertaken, along

 under the First  districts as follows:                                             innovations. However, the consolidated
 Health           (4) Pre-pilot phase districts: Gulu, Kabale, Tororo, Busia        piloVdemonstration phase was not
operation with    (4) districts originally slated for pilot phase: Soroti, Katakwi, evaluated. Nevertheless, in 1998 a
 IDA and SlDA     Mukono, Masindi                                                   supervision mission determined that "...the
financing         (8) additional districts slated for demonstration phase: Apac,    benefits of the pilots should now be
                  Iganga, Bugiri, Kamuli, Kiboga, Lira, Mubende, Rukungiri,         expanded to all districts."



3.11       Planned vs. Actual Construction. The project financed a total o f about 150works at
the district level, including(a) the rehabilitationo f 125healthunits (more than double what
was planned), three local-level UPDFhealth units, and three district hospitals; and (b) the
construction o f nine district health offices and eight district drug stores (Annex D, Tables
D3-D6). A range o finformants indicatedthat there was considerable pressure to undertake
more works than initially planned because o f the post-conflict situation, which had left the
health infrastructure inshambles andplaced national equity as a highpriority. There were
also reports of strong lobbying by district politicians to increase civil works support intheir
respective localities. Some 40 percent o f completed health unit rehabilitations are located in
districts other thanthose originally slated to pilot test and demonstrate reforms inservice
delivery (Annex D, Tables D3-D6). At the central level, the project financed the
construction o f a new buildingto house the Ministry o f Health, as opposed to the original
plan to rehabilitate an existing buildingfor this purpose. The actual cost o f civil works for
central and district levels combined (about $23 million)20was almost twice the original
estimate (about $12 million).2'

 3.14       The IDA credit (US$45.0 million) and SIDA grant (US$7.0 million) were almost
 fully utilized, disbursing at 98 and99 percent, respectively. The US$9.0 millionKfW grant
 was fully utilized. The financing shortfall o f US$15 millionwas largely attributable to two
 financiers (ODNDFID and DANIDA)withdrawing from formal cofinancing arrangement^^^
 and the reduction of Government counterpart obligations (Annex E, Table E-1). In addition,
 a reduction inavailable IDA financing (as expressed inUS$) is attributable to the lower
 value o f the dollar inrelation to the SDR, compared with appraisal estimates.


 4.         Monitoring and Evaluation

 Design

 4.1       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities planned under the project were meant to
 determine the impact and cost-effectiveness o f health programs and to draw lessons for
 improved management and service delivery. While a few process indicators were defined
 duringproject design, the definition o findicators for assessingproject outcome andimpact
 was postponed into the first six months o f implementation. An evaluation o f the one-year
 pilot experience was planned to assess the costs and progress o f district plan implementation,
 the cost-effectiveness o finterventions andthe impact o f activities on health indicators, with a
view to fine-tuning interventions for the demonstrationphase. Baseline studies for pilot and
 demonstration districts would be conducted prior to credit effectiveness to (a) document
health status and disease burden indicators and expenditure on different health packages; and
(b) assessmanagerial capacity. Plansto monitor the delivery o fEHP would rely on the
(new) health management information system and sentinel surveys, as needed. Costs and

by cost category totaling an estimated US$58.39 million); (b) World Bank 2003 (which shows final costs by component

inthis regard. Inthe end, bothdecidedto channel their fundingthrough separate parallel projects.

 4.2     As a complement to these activities, research and in-depth studies were envisaged, to
 explore ways and means o f enhancing health status and health care delivery. Potential topics
 for deeper analysis included: cost and impact o f EHP; alternative approaches for health
 impact assessment; cost recovery schemes; and other studies defined under each component.

 4.3     Districts would be responsible for monitoring and reporting on their plan
 implementation, while the P C Uwould be responsible for M&E oversight, and analysis and
 compilation o f findings. Implementation reviews would be carried out on a semi-annual
basis, with every other review serving as a more in-depthannual review. Mid-term and final
 evaluations were also envisaged. The estimated cost o f M&Ewas US$1.2 million, or 2
percent o f the total project cost.


Implementation

4.4      The assessment o fproject outputs and outcomes has beenseriously undermined by a
number o f factors inherent inthe weak design andimplementationo fmonitoring and
evaluation. Project objectives were not clearly articulated, an impediment also noted by
many informants involvedinproject management and implementation. Indicators were not
specified untilwell after the mid-term review. Informants report that their many attempts to
establish such indicators were unsuccessful due both to the complexity o f the project design
and to lack o f guidance from the Bank. The final evaluation report o f the Government shows
the indicators finally selected to evaluate the project, but these do not capture the
leaming/experimentation inherent inthe project design(Annex C, Table C-2). Neither do
research and studies undertaken facilitate or document learning and experimentation. While
districts did not carry out evaluations o f the impact o f their activities, they did undertake
quarterly reviews o f their activities against those planned and used these as vehicles for
improved planning as well as for justifying a subsequent trance o f financial support. All pilot
and demonstration districts carried out baseline studies documenting their burden o f disease,
but changes inhealth status were not systematically tracked at the district level. NGO
activities were not evaluated. M&Ewas officially the responsibility o f the Health Planning
Department/MoH, but inpractice it was assumed by the PCO because o f the overall weak
capacity o f the former. While the project inits initial years concentrated on 13 pilot and
demonstration districts, for the most part data on relevant trends are only available at the
national level.


5.      Outputs and Outcomesby Objective
5.1     Notwithstanding weaknesses inM&Edesign and implementation discussed in
Chapter 4, this chapter draws on project and other available information and data to assess
whether or to what extent project objectives have been achieved, and the extent to which
changes documented can be attributed to project support (itemized inAnnex D). A results
matrix (Annex F) and other data and graphics (Annex G)provide more detail o n outcomes
discussed below.

                                                               14


  Main Objective: Test and demonstratethe feasibilityof deliveringthe EHP

   5.2      Thefostering of a learningprocess through pilot and demonstration phases that
  would ultimately fine-tune policy for nationwide application was negligible. Thepotential
 for learning under thisproject was undermined by the decisionsfirst to merge thepilot and
  demonstrationphases (in 1996) and then to extendproject support to all districts (in 1998)
  without the benefit of evaluating eachphase. These decisions were taken bothbecause the
  launch o fthe pilot phase was delayed by procurement and other initial implementation issues
  (Chapter 3) and because the politicalpressure to expand project support rapidly to all districts
  duringa post-conflict periodwas formidable.26Plannedevaluations, originally intended to
  enhance the understanding o f modalities and relative effectiveness o f various reforms to be
  tested, demonstrated and refined duringthe pilot and demonstrationphases, were not
  undertaken. Nevertheless, some learning did occur duringproject implementation, with
  caveats.

  5.3      First, some thirty studies were carried out to collect and document various pieces o f
  information and experience, covering a range o f topics, including: health costs and financing,
 private health sector development, training, supervision, management, contracting out o f key
 services, utilization rates, quality o f care, and community health. Annex D, Table D-2
 itemizes these studies and Annex F reflects the findings anduse o f study results byproject
 objective, where such information was available. However, there was no systematic
 framework for the planning, design, coordination and implementation o f these studies that
 would have addressed more deliberately and systematically the learning intended under the
 pilot and demonstration phases, nor were the results and use o f these studies assessedby the
 Borrower inthe final evaluation o f this                        Second, many informants from both central
 and district levels noted that the experience o f implementing reforms supported under this
 project (decentralization, delivery o f an essential package o f services, partnerships with the
 non-governmental sector) constituted a learning process inand o f itself. However, the
 learning which did occur through practical experience was ad hoc innature, and much o f it
 remained undocumented and underexploited.




26. A wide range o f informants, spanningnationals (policymakers, managers, technical staff at central and decentralized
levels), Bank staff and other partners, attested to this fact.

27. The final evaluation conducted by the World Bankdoes attempt to do this and provided a useful reference for this
analysis.

  5.5     Increasesinpublic andprivate expenditure can be attributed only inpart to project
  support, which fell short o f its potential: there is still considerable scope andneedfor further
  increasesinbothpublic and private financing.

  5.6     Public spending. While central government expenditure increased by almost half
 between 1994/95 and 2000/01 (from 91 billion shillings to 134billion shillings), the trend of
 government spending on healthi s very modest interms o f its share o f total government
 expenditure (from 8.0% in 1994/95 to 8.6% in2000/Ol).30 As a proportiono f total health
 expenditure, central government's sharehas remained low rangingbetween 17 and 18
 percent duringthe last few years o fthe project (1998/99 -2000/01), well below the donor's
 share o f 27 to 28 percent andhouseholds' share (ranging from 41 to 46 percent). The
 (modest) increase that did occur can be attributed inpart and indirectly to project supportY3'
 especially: its encouragement and facilitation o f donor collaboration and co-financing, its
 success inincreasing the absorptive capacity o fhealthdistricts (planning and financial
 management capacity and contracting with non-governmental sector - see paras. 5.14), its
 financing o f the burden o f disease and EHP studies which highlightedboth the need for
 incremental financing for healthand the potential for enhanced cost-effectiveness inthe use
 o f these resources, and its support o fthe production o f keypolicy and strategic documents
that have facilitated a SWAP approach (see para 5.15).

improving healthsectorperformanceandhealthindicators andto the creationof a Poverty Action Fundfor financing key
componentsof the PEAP, including the support ofprimary healthcare. (Republic ofUganda 1998). The BOD/EHP work
helpedshape the healthchapter of the PEAP; and the project's inputs to strengthen district capacity facilitated the use and
accountabilityof these funds.

 5.7     Out ofpocket expenditure. The project provided considerable support to implement
 cost recovery inpublic facilities, including the provision o f guidelines and tools on the
 collection andreinvestment o f user fees, training o fhealth workers and committee members,
 logistical support for records keeping, and a consultative process for policy development.
 Out-of-pocket expenditure as a share o f all health expenditure actually decreased inthe latter
 years o f the project from US$8.67 (or 46 percent o f all health expenditures in 1998/99) to
 US$7.41 (or 41 percent in2000/01). In2001, user fees were abolished by the Head o f State
 as a means o f addressing inequities inservice access. This decision didnot reduce household
 expenditure on health services (delivered byprivate and public services combined), but it did
 have a positive effect on the share o f spending across the different income quintiles, with the
 poor paying about half and the better o f fpaying almost double what they were paying
 previously (Annex G, Figure G.5). Government financing was never increased sufficiently
 after the decision to abolish user fees to compensate for (a) the consequent loss inincome for
 the healthfacilities andlow service quality; and (b) the increased utilizationo f free services.

 5.8     Health Insurance/Other Private Financing. The project financed a number o f studies
to explore the feasibility o f alternative/additional private financing mechanisms, including: a
new health financing systemproposal, a review o fthe health services cost-sharing scheme, a
review o f financial flows to the health sector, a health insurance feasibility study, exploration
o f drugrevolving funds, income generation andprepayment schemes. Findings emanating
from these studies pointed to issues and challenges. Insurancewas found to be economically
feasible, but not politically or financially viable. Drugrevolving funds were found not to be
feasible at the district level due to inefficient management and use o f drugs. Operational
research concluded that directly supporting income generation (to incite an increase in
private health spending) is not the role or comparative advantage o f the health sector. While
two prepayment schemes at the hospital level were initially successful, it was concluded that
more analysis and pilots were neededbefore firm conclusions couldbe drawn. Studies and
experimentation carried out with project assistance didnot culminate inincreasedprivate
financing. Private firms expenditure on health actually decreased from US$O.lO per capita in
1998/99 to US$0.6 per capita in2000/01. The fostering o f risk poolingmechanisms under
the project to generate more resources for health was very timid and modest at best, and
remains a critical activity for closing the health financing gap.

 a study to review staff motivationmechanisms for rural health units inthe Kabale district.
 Recommendations to improve staff motivation included: (a) their prompt payment; (b)
 performance-based rewards; (c) co-ownership o f motorcycleshicycles; (d) provisionof
 housing; (e) prompt and appropriate personnel action. While low staff motivationwas (and
 i s still) considered to be a chronic problem, this project did not pursue ways and means of
 addressing it, given that the Ministryo f Public Service hadthe responsibility for taking this
 on inthe context o f Civil Service Reform. The project also supported efforts to improve the
 effectiveness o f training inpublic institutions. It supported the drafting o f the training policy
 for the MoH, financed the construction and rehabilitation o f a number o f structures invarious
 medical training institutions, provided scholastic materials, supported tutor training in
 Mulago and Butabikahospitals and improvements to training curricula for laboratory
 technicians, nurses and medical assistants. The outcome o f these supports to improving
 training effectiveness was never evaluated, and government restructuring inthe interim has
 placed all training institutions under the direct responsibility o f the Ministryo f Education.
 While there was scope for reallocating staff more equitably duringthe project, even though
 they were inshort supply, inequities intheir distribution persist (Annex G,Table G.10). Of
 the 870 H C 11s inthe country, some 65 have no clinical staff, while 85 have 5 or more
 clinical staff (Annex G,Table G.11).

 Subobjective#3: Support health sector decentralization

 5.12      Project support to health sector decentralization has culminated in a new
 organizational structurefor M o H and redefined roles and responsibilitiesfor central and
decentralized levels of MoH. The new structure and roles are commensurate with national
decentralizationpolicy and supportive of an intensified focus on the integration, quality
and coverage of a cost-effectivepackage of basic health services. The project supported a
process o f reviewing and refiningthe structure o f MoH. As specified inthe NationalHealth
Policy, core functions o f central-level M o H now include: policy formulation, setting
standards and quality assurance, resource mobilization, capacity development and technical
support o f districts, coordination, monitoring and evaluation. The new organigramme o f
M o H (shown inAnnex G,Figure G.11) clusters three departments into a health services
directorate, responsible, respectively for: disease control, community health and clinical
services, thus encompassing prevention, public health, community health as well as
clinical/curative services. The (other) main directorate (Planning and Development) brings
together three strategic functions, each with its own department: planning, quality
assurance,33and finance. This Planning and Development Directorate i s responsible for
strategy formulation, sector coordination and the provision o f support and oversight to
districts intheir plan formulation and implementation. Uganda's national health policy also
specifies that the health districts have first-line responsibility for planning and policy
implementation within their jurisdictions. Their organization provides for local-level
leadership and interaction with political leaders and civil society inthe planning,
implementation and monitoring o f health sector activity, and it puts district hospitals under
the authority of district health administration.

 5.13      Project support has contributed to strengthened capacity at central and district
 levels to take on their newly assigned roles in a decentralized system, but there remain
 some issues of accountability in the management and use offilzancial resources and in the
 achievement of results. At the central level, the project has financed analytic work to review
 and streamline staffing inlight o f new roles and responsibilities. M o H staffing was
 downsized from over 400 staff to about 220 recommendedposts. As o f the project's end,
 151or 78% o f these posts were effectively filled, 78 posts remainedto be filled and 54 staff
 slated for retrenchment were still working inM o H (Konde-Lule et al. 2002). A number o f
 informants commented that the goal o f 220 posts may have underestimated staffing needs.
 Theproject supportedMaster's leveltraining for technical andmanagerial staff inpublic
 health, health economics andhealth management and administration, allowing many o f the
 newly defined M o Hposts to be filled with fully qualified staff. The construction,
 equipment, and furnishing o f a new M o H HQbuildingmade it possible for all departments to
 be housed inone buildinginKampala, rather than spread across two cities (Entebge and
Kampala) and many more buildings. Informants have noted how this input has contributed
to enhanced efficiency o f inter-departmental communication, coordination and collaboration.
Thanks to project-financed production o ftechnical guidelines, two-thirds o fM o Htechnical
units (15 o f 22) had technical guidelines by the end o f the project. Two departments in
particular benefited from project support: (a) the Planning Department, the weakest inthe
Ministryat the project's outset; and (b) the Quality Assurance Department, a newly created
department responsible for setting quality standards and overseeing their application.

5.14       At the district level the project financed master's leveltraining (public health, health
economics, health management) for many district medical officers so that by the end of the
project most DMOs heldMaster's degrees. The project supported the construction,
equipment and furnishing o f 9 district medical offices. All districts received computers,
office equipment and other support to facilitate district management, including the
establishment o f a health management information system. The project financed inputs for
strengthening o f financial management capacity, including: guidelines, management tools,
technical support, training and close pedagogical supervision o f district                                         Bythe
end o f the project 77 percent o f district health teams were trained inmanagement (short o f
100% target, but significant increase over the baseline o f 35 percent). Thanks to intensive
pedagogical support provided by central M o H and the PCO, health was the first sector to
effectively decentralize. Before any other sector, health led the way indeveloping regular
work plans at district level, which were approved by district councils inaccordance w/
decentralization policy. However, there remain important goals for consolidating gains made
inhealth sector decentralization. These include transparency indistrict financial
management and accountability; district accountability for local-level results; adequate
supervision; equity within and across districts; andmeaningful public participation inhealth.

5.15      Project support has culminated in apolicy and strategicframework for health
sector development that hasfacilitated the transition to a Sector-wide approach.

did cause disruption to the districts that lost these skills to others.

  This coherent policy framework, developed thru a participatory process involving donors and
  a broad range of stakeholders, provided the groundwork for moving towards a sector-wide
  approach.

  Subobjective#4: Restorefunctionality and improveefficiency of publicservices

  5.16      Theproject provided substantial assistanceto the design and delivety of the
  essentialhealth package aimed at addressing nine of the 10 diseases with the highest
  burden,j5initially in 13pilot/demonstration districtsand ultimately extended to all districts.
 Financial support was largely channeled directly to the districts and accounted for about 40
 percent o f their total expenditures for implementing their health plans (net o f salaries,
 hospital costs and drugs) (Konde-Lule, 2002). The project rehabilitated, furnished and
 equipped over 110primary health units, two thirds o f which were inpilot/demonstration
 districts. It rehabilitated and equipped three district-level military health                             and provided
 them with logistical support and training to strengthen health education, immunizationand
 outreach. It also supported the rehabilitation o f the Soroti district hospital, rehabilitated the
 sewer system o f Mpigi district hospital, and provided essential materials and supplies to
 district facilities necessary for the delivery o f the EHP (vitamins, bednets, wells, IEC
 materials and services). As a complement to the DANIDA-financed Uganda Essential Drugs
 Program, the project financed the construction o f 8 district drug stores, the training o f drug
 store assistants, the regional supervision o f pharmacies, health education about druguse and
a study to assess districts' drugs needs. Inaddition, the project provided extensive support to
the technical training and continuing education o fhealthpersonnel on the delivery o fthe
EHP. Training on EHP delivery was also provided to community volunteers (traditional
birthattendants and communityhealthworkers). The impact o f service delivery training was
never evaluated. A number o f studies supported under the project assessed service quality
anddemand-side aspects ofser~ices.~'

5.17      ,Key indicators on the delivery of the EHP show mked trends.Improvement has
been slow and modest, at best, and currentperformance levels are still inadequate to effect
any notable improvement in health status. Prior to the issuance o f the HSSP, which
provides baseline data fkom about 1999/2000, with updates for the subsequent years,
performance trends inhealth service delivery are scarce. Trends detected duringthe life o f
the project and duringthe few years thereafter canbe attributable at least inpart to the
significant resources and inputs provided by the project.

35. The ten diseases with the highest burden o fmorbidity and mortality are: malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, maternal
conditions, AIDS, injury, measles, tuberculosis, neonatal conditions and cardiovascular disease. This project supported all
elements o f the EHP except for those addressing STDslHIVlAIDS, for which a standalone IDA operation (Sexually
Transmitted InfectionsProject) was approved in 1995 and implemented inparallel with this project (see reference on STIP
PPAR).

   5.18    GeneralIndicators. Betweenthe late 1990sand 2000 the share o f the population
   livingwithin 5 kmo f a health facility increased from 49 percent to 57 percent (project target
  was to achieve a 60 percent coverage), although disparities ingeographical access persisted
  (urban-rural, regional, district and income). In 1999/0070 percent o f district facilities
  experienced stockouts o f chloroquine, oral rehydration salts, cotrimoxazole and measles
  vaccines. Stockouts were only slightly reduced to 67 percent o f district facilities by 2002/03
  and to 60 percent by 2003/0438for primary health care units (HC 11,111, and IV). Despite the
  training provided under the project, health service personnel were not providing a minimum
  quality o f care. In2000/01,42 percent o f women 15-49interviewed (DHS) cited the
  negative attitude o fhealth providers as a constraint to their access to health services.
  Another indicator of the inadequate quality o f health personnel i s the fact that only 53
 percent o f approved posts were filled with adequately trained staff as o f 2002/03. While this
  i s up from the low levels in 1999/2000(33 percent), it is still far below what is needed to
  ensure a minimum quality o f care. Utilizationrates (number o f new visits per person per
 year) declined inpublic facilities during 1995-2000 (Humphreyet a12000), but are noted to
 have risen from 0.40 inFY1999/2000to 0.79 inFY03/04. (World Bank 2004). This rise i s
 attributable insignificant part to the abolition o fuser fees inpublic units (except for private
 wings o f hospitals) which took effect inMarch 2001 andto decreased fees insome PNFP
 units. However, utilization patterns show that people inall income quintiles still are willing
 to pay for services o f quality. Almost 70 percent o f the top income quintile abandoned the
 public sector facilities andmore than 40 percent o f the lowest quintile also use private
 providers, despite the availability o f free public services. This i s yet another indicator that
 quality inpublic facilities i s not adequate.

 inadequate for achieving needed improvements ininfant and child mortality. As is the case
 for reproductive health services, richer, urban, better educated segments o f Uganda's
 population benefit disproportionately fi-om child health services.

 5.21       Theproject supported efforts to accordfinancial and managerial autonomy to
public tertiary and regional hospitals, but onlyfinancial autonomy was granted by the end
 of theproject. The project financed a study on "How to Make National Hospitals
 Autonomous," as well as study tours to Africa and Latin America which provided exposure
 to well-functioning autonomous hospitals. Training o fhealth committees, equipment,
 supplies were provided to Mulago and three other hospitals to explore andtext various
 options for autonomy. While a phased approach was envisaged, starting with national
 hospitals and subsequently extending to regional hospitals, a decision was later taken
 Ministry o f Finance to grant financial autonomy to all referral hospitals at once. Mulago
 Hospital didnot achieve managerial autonomy by the end o f the project. Mulago's full
 autonomy, once achieved, is expected to provide lessons and guidance for others. National
Medical Stores now fully autonomous.

Subobjective #5: Facilitate a greater role for the non-governmental sector

5.22       Theprojectfacilitated a greater rolefor PNFPs'~                     both by ensuring that they
benefited from supportprovided to districts and by using them as contractual agents to
carry out district-level services and activities. Project experience did, however, reveal some
reticence in contracting significant rolesfor NGOs. By design, NGOs were involved in

   ~           ~          ~            ~




39. There i s a range of PNFP agencies which carry out health activity, those that are facility-based and those that are not. Of
the 2731healthfacilities inventoried in2004, 600 (or one-fifth) are PNFP. Their share of total health facilities is especially
remarkable at the hospital level, where they make up 42 percent of all hospitals inUganda (MoHHealthFacility Inventory,
2002).

 project activities at the district level. They participated inannual exercises to review the
 performance o f previous district health plans andto prepare the plans for the forthcoming
 year. They were invitedto benefit from training provided under the project, and were
 covered by the various supervisions which were carried out duringthe life o f the project.
 They received a portion o f goods provided under the project (drugs, medical and lab supplies
 and equipment, other supplies and materials. Some NGO health units were repaired or
 expanded with project assistance (Kamuli and Vira Maria hospitals and a faith-based facility
 inSorotiwere cited as examples, among others). Withthe benefitofguidelines and
 technical assistance, districts usedproject financing to contract out services to NGOs. Some
 NGOs were contracted to perform specific tasks and/or deliver specific services, while others
 received grants for small projects. As is the case for the Sexually-Transmitted Infections
 Project (World Bank, 2005), records o fproject-financed contracting with NGOswere
 incomplete at central and district levels, which made impossible the compilation and analysis
 o f data (interms o f numbers o f contracts, geographic area o f intervention, nature o f
 intervention, costs, duration). Available data indicate that contracting with PNFPs did
 increase over the life o f the project. The proportion o f district health expenditure which
 financed contracted services inthe pilot/demonstration districts increased from 6 to 12
 percent, but fell far short o f the project target o f 30%. Government subsidies to NGO health
 facilities increased from 5% o f the total recurrent expenditures to 11% and are expected to
 grow to 14 % inthe next 3 years, based on MTEFprojections. As financing agents, facility-
 based and non-facility basedPNFPs made up a full one third (34 percent) o f all financial
 transfers in2000/01, up from 26 percent in 1998/99 (MoH NationalHealth Accounts).

 5.23     Interviews and documentation reveal some reticence incontracting NGOs to take
 over government services. The project envisaged experimentation incontracting out o f
 district hospitals and health centers to NGOs inKamuli and Kampala districts. Despite the
 presence o f a PNFP hospital that would have been capable o f being contracted as a district
 hospital, Kamuli district opted to build a new public district hospital. The project financed a
 strategic health plan for Kampala, which envisaged the contracting out to PNFPs o f health
 services provision, given their strong presence. However, contracting out o f health centers
was never carried out. While the design document specifies that monitoring o f NGO
participation would be contracted out to an independent agency that would assess the nature
and effectiveness o f the framework for NGO participation and the effectiveness o f NGO
performance, this was not carried out.

5.24     Theproject's efforts to encourageprivate health sector developmentfell short of
originalplans, and did not culminate in any noticeable change. The project financed a
study to identifybarriers to private health sector development and to recommend ways to
overcome them. One decision emanating from this study was the opening up o f private
practice to categories o f health workers such as registered nurses, previously not allowed to
do so. The main support envisaged under the project was the provision o f grants (maximum
o f US$25,000) to already established private health units inunderserved areas for the
purchase o f equipment to enable them to better serve the primary health care needs o f their
clients. No grants were ever made under this component. Fears o f creating artificial demand
for services were cited as the main reason for inaction. A few informants noted that inaction
might also havebeen attributable to reticence on the part o fpublic sector actors, who were
feeling the pressure to use the project funds to support the enormous agenda o f improving
public services.

  5.25     Project support to community-level health was limited andfell short of the
  community mobilization necessary to equip communities with the knowledge, support and
  means to take a moreproactive role in managing their own health more effectively.                      The
  project supported the training and provision o f kits to community-basedhealth workers
  (CHW) and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) (quantities not available), and provided
  guidelines, logistical and other support for their supervision. It also supported a number o f
  studies on community health.40Inaddition, some outreach and mobilization activities were
  carried out, focusing on malaria control, water and sanitation, and maternal and child health.
  Community participation inthe planning, management and oversight o f local health activity
  is still weak.

  5.26     The overarching goal of improving health status was not achieved. Key health
 indicators did not essentially change over the liye of theproject and inequities in health
 statuspersist. However, it i s important to note that (a) there are many determinants o fhealth
 status (and inequities therein) that are beyond the mandate o f the health sector to effect
 directly (water supply, sanitation, food security, income, education, place o f residence,
 conflict situations, to name a few); and (b) the counterfactual o f this project needs to be
 considered (it is very possible that health status might have been worse inthe absence o f this
 project, which was by far the most important source o f external financing for district health
 services inthe country.

  6.2       The overall relevance o f the project i s substantial. For the most part project
  objectives are supportive o f Government and World Bank development objectives for
 Uganda which are appropriate to Uganda's health sector challenges. Two o f the five pillars
 o f action articulated inUganda's second Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) (2004/05 -
 2007/08) are human development and good g~vernance.~~Under the human development
 pillar the PEAP seeks to improve the equity, coverage, quality and effectiveness o f basic
 health services to improve health outcomes. Itplaces emphasis on prevention andpromotion
 andon enhanced multi-sectoral actionto this end. The good governance pillar aims at
 improving the efficiency, transparency and accountability o f public resource use for
 enhanced impact, decentralizing essential services, and strengthening partnerships with the
 non-governmental sector, both to enhance participation and to expand limited public sector
 capacity. The Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy4' supports the PEAP, but will focus on
 certain areasjudged to be especially important for achieving results, and all o f which are
relevant to the project's objectives: (a) strengthening the budget process and public sector
management; (b) promotingprivate sector development; (c) strengthening governance; (d)
improving health outcomes; and (e) fostering social and economic development o fthe north.

6.3        The project objective to test and demonstrate EHP delivery i s relevant to national and
World Bank development objectives o f improved efficiency inhealth service delivery.
However, the relevance o f this project objective was (and still is) considered by government
to be at odds with its drive to support an equitable process o fhealth sector development, a
process whereby all health districts would benefit from available financial and technical
assistance at the same time, rather than insequence.



41 Uganda'sPEAP is composedof five pillars for supportingpoverty reduction: (1) economic management; (2) enhancing
   I
production,competitivenessand incomes; (3) security, conflict resolution and disaster management; (4) governance; and (5)
humandevelopment.

  6.4       The project design was relevant to MoHpolicy and strategy, which sought to
  implementfar-reaching reforms (decentralization, resource allocation, partnerships with civil
  society) as a means o f improving service delivery and health status. The design also
  incorporated the new thinking, approaches and tools emanating from WDR 1993 for
  improvingthe cost-effectiveness o f investments inhealth. Yet at the same time these two
  aspects o f the project design (its pilot nature and analytic work to determine the BOD/EHP)
  were never entirely clear to many responsible for project oversight, management and
  implernentati~n.~~This confusion was further undermined by the project's weak results
  framework (unclear objectives,             44 absence o f indicators untilwell after the MTR, inadequacy
  o f indicators finally chosen, poor articulation o f learning agenda, tools and processes, ill-
  defined operational research), which was further weakened when the pilot and demonstration
  phases (and their evaluations) were eliminated and cost-effectiveness studies o f service
  delivery were never undertaken.

  6.5       Overall project efficacy is modest. The project failed to test and demonstrate the
  delivery o f the EHP to populations inselected districts and to evaluate experience with a
  view to fine-tuning reform and improvingefficiency and equity inservice delivery. While
 the PEAPprocess is the mainforce for givingthe health sector a moreprominent position in
 government's budget allocation, the project also contributed, indirectly, to the mobilization
 o f more public resources: highlightingthe financing gap and potential cost-effectiveness o f
 service provisionthrough BOD analysis and EHP preparation; developing and strengthening
 sector absorptive capacity, especially at the district level; mobilizingproject co-financing;
 and supporting the development o f a coherent policy and strategic framework that facilitated
 a SWAP approach. Project efforts to strengthen cost recovery mechanisms didnot culminate
 inincreased income for health facilities through this financing source because ofthe
 abolition in2001 o f cost recovery inpublic health facilities. The project was ineffective in
 mobilizingmore resources through health insurance and other private financing schemes.
 Total health expenditure (public and private combined) falls short o f what is needed to
 deliver the EHP to Uganda's population, and government's contribution to health
 expenditure remains modest and was not increased to compensate for the resources lost when
 cost recovery was abolished. The project was successful inits efforts to achieve a more
 efficient allocation o ffinancial resources. Budgets and expenditures have beenreoriented
 away from hospitals and central level administration towards primary care facilities and
 district administration, although there is still considerable scope for improved efficiencies,
 and levels o f financing at the district level are still inadequate. Project investment inhuman
 resources management and training was modest inscope and didnot culminate inimproved
 allocation and utilization of this scarce resource.

 6.6       Thanks to the project's support health was one of the first sectors to amend its
structure and to reassign roles and responsibilities commensurate with national
decentralization policy. Within a new organigramme, central level M o H role i s focused on
policy formulation, coordination, regulation and oversight, and districts assume primary
responsibility for policy implementation. Project capacity buildinginplanning, financial

   management, supervision and monitoring enabled the health sector to be the first to prepare
   and implement local level action plans with the involvement o f local authorities and civil
   society. Despite extensive investment indistrict level health services, there has been little
   improvement inhealth service delivery. Chronic shortages o f drugs, qualified health
   personnel and other essential inputshave undermined quality. Increases inutilizationrates in
   public facilities are largely attributable to the new policy o f free services and many clients
   frequent non-public facilities, which charge fees, but which are perceived to provide better
   quality services. Except for slight improvements incontraceptive use and A N C attendance,
  performance indicators for keymaternal and child health services have remained stagnant4'
   or even slightly deteri~rated.~~         And there is a persistent gap between knowledge and practice
   o f healthy behavior and self-care. Finally, the project underachieved with regardto its
  facilitation o fmore important roles for NGOs, the private sector and communities. While
  some contracting with NGOs was camed out by some districts, the level o f district
  expenditure fell far short the objective. No grants were provided to private sector practices to
  encourage them to deliver essential health services inunderserved areas. Efforts to
  strengthen and support communities' capacities to participate inlocal level planning and
  management, to carry out public health activities and to improve safe behavior and home
  health care fell far short of the potential.

  6.7      The overall efficiency o f this project i s modest. Although it was a fundamental
  objective o f the project, the learning that took place under this project was inefficient.
  Despite major reforms and the pilot/demonstration design, (a) the learning objectives were
  not framed, (b) there was no evaluation o f experimentatiodexperience on a small-scale
  before extending project benefits to the whole country, (c) research was ad hoc and
  somewhat supply-driven; and (d) no cost-effectiveness studies were undertaken.

  6.8      Support to decentralization was somewhat efficient. District capacity buildingwas
  grounded inpractical experience, supported by: guidelines, training, and pedagogical
  supervision. Turnover o f staff, especially accounting staff, didundermine the efficiency o f
  district strengthening. Inefficiencies inreporting and accountabilities, both on the financial
  resources and on results, are being corrected with ongoing supervision and refinements to
  guidelines and systems. The BODand EHP concepts have provided a new framework which
  has prompted more efficient allocation o f financial resources infavor o f front-line priority
  services. There i s still scope for correcting inequities inper capita spending.

  6.9     Support to EHP delivery was inefficient on a number o f fronts. Politicalpressure to
  extend project benefits nationwide caused project resources to be stretched across all
  districts. While the original design was to focus investments inservice delivery on about one
 thirdo fUganda's districts, the project's actual support to services was ultimately extendedto
  all distri~ts.~'This fact, combined with the US$... millionworth o f expected cofinancing that
 fell through, culminated inan underfunding o f EHP delivery. Numerous informants and
reports document the consequences o f this decision: (a) investments ininfrastructure were
canied out inmany more districts thanplanned, compromising both the costs and quality o f

   originally planned works; (b) disbursements to districts to finance their annual healthplans
   peaked in 1997/98 and were reducedthereafter, at a time when district action plans and
   absorptive capacity were improving annually. The paucity o f qualified health service
   delivery staff is yet another factor inthe inefficient delivery o f the EHP. There is still a
   misunderstanding among some about planning and resource allocation for EHP delivery; and
   there is still scope for inefficiencies inallocation within the EHP. Two examples noted were
   (1) misunderstandingabout formula for allocation o fresources;48and (2) an apparent
   imbalance inthe allocation o f resources within EHP that favors curative over preventive and
  promotional activities. Underlyingthese inefficiencies i s the project's failure to assess the
   cost-effectiveness o f the delivery o f the EHP.

   6.10    The EHP could have been delivered more efficiently with better coverage hadthe
   support to the non-governmental sector beenmore successful. Contracting the district
  hospital function to a functioning PNFPhospital inKamuli would have been much more
  efficient than the choice to construct and operate a new public hospital for this purpose.
  Contracting out service delivery to the numerous private facilities inKampala (both for-profit
  andnot-for profit) would also have improved efficiencies inservice delivery. Finally,
  inadequate emphasis on nurturingthe critical role o f communities, households and
  individuals inthe management o f their own health i s a lost, low-cost opportunity for
  improving health status.

  6.1t    The institutionaldevelopmentachieved under the project is rated as substantial.
  The reorganization o f central-level M o H provided for a better alignment o f its staff and
  services with national decentralizationpolicy. Its new mandate o fpolicy formulation,
  coordination and oversight and provision o f technical backstopping to districts is well
  accommodated by the establishment and strengthening o f a Policy Unit and a Directorate o f
  Planning andDevelopment that houses 3 departments incharge, respectively, o f planning,
  quality assurance and finance and administration. The new structure is also well aligned with
  M o Hpolicy to integrate health services. A Directorate o f Clinical and Community Health
  Services houses three departments incharge of, respectively: disease control, community
  health and clinical services. Districts have been strengthened to assume their newly assigned,
  primary responsibility o f health policy implementation at the local level. The financing o f
  master's level training inrelevant health sector disciplines, both technical and managerial,
  have permittedthe filling o f more key (central and district) positions with suitably qualified
  staff. The provisiono f guidelines, on-the-job training, technical assistance and supervision
  have helpedbuild capacities and establish procedures inthis newly decentralized
  organization for district-level strategic planning, implementation and monitoring o f
  performance and financial management, as well as for central-level oversight and
  backstopping o f districts'efforts.

  6.12    The project strengthened institutional capacity for policy formulation and strategic
  sector management. With a coherent policy and strategic framework inplace and with
  growing experience ineliciting and coordinating partnerships with donors, the M o Hwas by
 the end o f the project capable o f the leadership, vision and coordination skills required for a
viable SWAP arrangement. Inparticular, the Planning Department was extremely weak at
the project outset, but duringthe course o f the project was considerably strengthened inthis

 regard. Institutional development was less than desired with regard to the strengthening and
 nurturingo fpartnershipswith civil society.

 6.13      Project sustainability i s likely. While initially they were not well understoodby
 some and resisted by others, the notions o f the B O D and EHP are firmly imbedded in
 national policy and strategy. As such, it forms the basis for sector planning, resource
 mobilization and goals o f sector effii~iency.~'However, the current level o f sector financing
 (US$18 per capita) falls short o f needs for delivering this package (US$28 per capita).
 Recent trends show that government financing i s still inadequate (despite modest increases
 over the years); and the gap i s not likely to be met, especially given the abolition o f user fees,
 which hadbeen an important source o f financing o fpublic facilities. Inthe context o f the
 PEAP and the SWAp there i s considerable momentum for further increasing public
 (government and donor) financing. Evenifsome increase inpublic spending were achieved,
 financial sustainability will also depend on a more vigorous and successful pursuit o f
 alternative financing sources through health insurance and other risk pooling schemes. Two
 other factors will ensure the sustainability o fproject investments: (a) the mobilization o f
 adequate numbers and skills levels o f health personnel and their appropriate allocation and
 remuneration; and (b) the constant availability o f essential drugs, vaccines, and other
 commodities necessary for EHP delivery. Finally, partnerships with PNFPs and the private
 sector will only be consolidated and sustained with the stronger support and conviction o f
 health authorities, both central-level and decentralized, about their role and potential to
 contribute to health sector objectives, rather than beingperceived as competitors for scarce
 funding.

 6.14     Prospects for the sustainability o f the restructured MoH and certain critical functions
are strong. The quality assurance function and staff were transformed from a temporary,
project status into full-fledged department. Staff became civil servants and the costs o f
runningthis department were fully assumedbyGovernment. Personnelwho were trained in
the healthmanagement information system also were given civil service status inrecognition
o f the importance o f this function inall districts.

6.15     Bank Performance. The Bank's performance duringpreparation was unsatisfactoy.
Quality at entry was mixed, at best. Among the strong points o f the project design are: (a) its
consistency with Government policy and Bank strategy; (b) its technical quality and attention
to cost-effectiveness o f the investment (drawing on new BOD, EHP tools o f the WDR 1993);
(c) its support to M o H restructuring and institution building; and (d) its success inmobilizing
co-financing and collaboration among donors. However, the design was weakened by a
number o f factors. The project's objectives lacked clarity and indicators were inappropriate.
Government ownership was mixed: it strongly supported this large source o f financing for
implementing its health sector reform program, yet it didnot fully understand, or agree with,
the pilot nature o f the design, under which selected districts would benefit from the bulk o f
project support for health services, as opposed to nationwide coverage.5o The Bank didnot
appear to be listening to the client regarding its strong discomfort with the pilot approach.

  Neither was there strong ownership o f the methodology and rationale o f calculating the
  burden o f disease and defining the EHP.jl The specific learning objectives of the pilot and
  demonstration phases were never fully framed, nor were studies/operational research
  deliberately designedto address learningobjectives systematically. The design supported
  health as one means o f achieving poverty reduction inUganda, but it didnot address
  inequities inservice provision or inhealth status. Delays inproject start-up revealed that the
  project was not ready for implementationupon effectiveness. Particular areas o f weakness in
  this regardwere inadequate capacity inthe areas of: procurement, and financial management
  at both central and district levels.

  6.16      The Bank's performance during implementation was also mixed, but unsatisfactory
  overall. Two supervision missions per year were carried out throughout the project's life. A
  decision towards the end o f the project to hire a health expert to task manage this project
  from the field considerably enhanced the Bank's presence and ability to supervise the project
  more closely. Two features o f the Bank's supervision o f this project were particularly
 positive and appreciated by the Borrower. First, the Bank provided reliable the support and
  appropriate guidance throughout the life o f the project to address and resolve issues
 constraining smooth implementation. One example i s the special mission carried out by the
 disbursement analyst to unblock the flow o f funds to the districts. Second, the Bank
 supervision missions served as a catalyst for donor coordination. Concerted efforts by the
 Bank's team enabled the missions to bejoint innature, including most major donors, thus
 facilitating a coordination and communication among donors as well as between donors and
 Government, a precursor to the SWAPapproach which was adopted toward the end o f the
 project.

 6.17      The Bank's supervision support was deficient with regard to its focus on the
 development objectives. The learning objective was neglected. Because o f political pressure
 inaresource-poor, post-conflict country, the Bank agreedto extendtheproject support to all
 districts. However, it did so without clarifying/revising the learning objective. Learning
 could have been more effectively achieved had it beenbetter framed and supervised and had
 monitoring and evaluation been adequately revised and implemented. The Bank was not
 clear or rigorous inits provision o f guidance and supervision o f operational research and
 monitoring and evaluation. Informants noted that Bank missions didnot include adequate
 monitoring and evaluation expertise, and that, furthermore, turnover inmission members
 made for conflicting and inconclusive advice on M&E. Internal supervision reporting was
 not sufficiently rigorous. Achievement o f development objectives was rated satisfactory
throughout the project, with the exception o f one report (June 1997); andmonitoring and
 evaluation was rated satisfactory throughout with one exception (December 1999 report).
Neither did the Bank seize the occasion o f the mid-term review to refocus efforts on the
redefinition and monitoringo f the project's development 0bjectives.j'

accepted by a considerable number o f stakeholders and not well applied. (Okuonzi 2000 andmany respondents).
52. Inits Aide-Memoire to Government on the MTR the Bank restated the original project objective (to pilot test and
demonstrate EHP delivery) despite the decision that same year to extend Project benefits to all districts (not recorded inthe
A- M). Furthermore, rather than usingthe MTR as a vehicle for establishing outcome indicators, the A-M recommends that
the PCO "finalize its indicators... andbegin monitoring DHSP's performance.

 6.18      Borrower performancewas satisfactory overall. Duringthe preparation process it
 provided a good framework within which the project was developed (health policy and plan
 for 1993-96 and White [strategy] Paper on Health, and Letter o f Sector Development Policy,
 1994). It assumed leadership infacilitating a participatory approach to project preparation,
 including donors, local authorities and civil society, and it was active inraising project
 cofinancing from other donors. However, interviews with many government informants
 made it clear that (a) there was never a strong consensus on the pilot/demonstration approach
 and (b) nor was there a full understanding/appreciationo f the methodology and rationale for
 calculating the BOD and definingthe EHP. Rather it was seen by many as Bank-driven and
 a conditionality for IDA financing.

 6.19      Duringimplementation government commitment to the project objectives was mixed.
 While it strongly supported the specific objectives o f its health sector policy, its
 understanding o f and commitment to the pilot and demonstration learning objectives became
 weaker inthe wake o f mountingpolitical pressure to spread the benefits o f the project
 nationwide. Even after its counterpart obligation was reduced, Government failed to meet its
 financial obligations, both interms o f amount and timing o f these contributions. Over and
 above its counterpart obligations, Government allocations o f its public budget for health have
 grown inactual amounts, but remained stable duringthe life o f the project interms o f
health's share o f the total public budget. While resources and political commitment were
modest, the M o H didprovide an enabling policy and strategic framework, and gradually
assumed leadership inthe implementation o f this project.

6.20      The implementing agency (Ministry o fHealth) and the PCO were satisfactoy intheir
overall performance with some caveats. Despite weak capacity at the project's outset, the
M o H Planning Department and the PCO put together district support teams that would travel
to the field often to work with districts insupport o f their intensive training and start-up
activities, related to planning and financial management. Districts have noted that this was
highlyusefuland appreciated. Goodmonitoring and evaluation were plagued by lack o f
guidance (from the Bank) on the choice o f indicators, andby inadequate M&E capacity
within MoH. Delays inprocurement and disbursements caused major setbacks inproject
start-up and implementation inthe early years, but inthe end the project managed to close as
scheduled.


7.       Findings and Lessons

LessonsEmanatingfromPilot/DemonstrationApproach

7.1      Pilot and demonstration approaches to reform implementation will not
automatically generate or document a learningprocess, nor will such approaches
necessarily lead to aflne-tuning of reforms in light of experience, ifthey are not well
prepared and ifthey are notfully understood and owned by Government and other
stakeholders. At the end o f this project little knowledge about the "modalities and relative
effectiveness o f various reforms"53has been generated. K e y questions remainunanswered.


53. Taken from statement of project objective.

                                                    32


  H o w can resources be mobilizedthrough health insurance and other riskpooling schemes?
  What is the current cost-effectiveness o f EHP delivery? H o w should resources be more
  efficiently allocated across various services within the EHP, and across curative, preventive
  and promotional activities? The experience gained under this project provides much insight
  about critical factors that can undermine the success o f a pilot and demonstration operation.

  7.2     A pilot operation will not reach itsfull potentialfor learning if the learning agenda is
  not well defined. The learning agenda was not fully articulated inthe project design
  documents, nor was it fully appreciated by those responsible for implementing it. A high
  level official o f M o H was o f the opinion that there was no reason for a pilot, since Uganda
  knew where they were and where they wanted to go inthe health sector. Studies and
  research that were undertaken were primarily ad hoc (topic and geographical region) and
  supply-driven innature. They provided thus an incomplete, fragmented framework, at best,
  for learning.

  7.3     Nor will apilot operation reach itsfull potential   if itsprocess is not well defined.
  The design document noted that the pilot would take one year and would be evaluatedbefore
 moving on to the demonstration phase. However, it does not propose terms o f reference for
 the evaluation, nor does it explain the process for its use indesigningAaunching the
  subsequent phase (process for discussion o f findings, assimilation o f lessons, fine-tuning o f
 reforms, wider application o f lessons, establishment o f a new agenda for addressing
 newhnanswered questions). Furthermore, the criteria for moving from the pilot to the
 demonstration phase, specified inthe development credit agreement as a condition o f
 disbursement, required only that: 60 percent o f funds for the pilot be disbursed, financial
 reports o f pilot districts be satisfactory and management training for district health teams be
 completed. No conditions were specified for completion o f an evaluation or for
 documentation and wider application o f lessons.

 7.4     The absence of a clear and coherent monitoring and evaluationframework, including
 the specification of indicators and a menu of tools and methodologies, will undermine the
 learningpotential of apilot operation. The logframe for the pilot was weak at best, with
 unclear objectives and the absence ofindicators reflective of a learning agenda. Informants
 noted that operational researchwas largely supply-driven and neither planned nor properly
 budgeted for at the outset. Research carried out was thus neither systematic nor deliberately
 oriented around key questions. Duringthe project design and implementation it was reported
 that there was no real interest or motivation among M o H officials for carrying out
 operational research. Rather, it was considered by most to be academic and irrelevant,
especially given the urgency o f upgrading health services nationwide ina post-conflict
country.

7.5     Pilots cannot be effectively launched when critical operational inputs are not in
place. Critical inputsrequired for pilot and demonstration phases were not defined at the
outset. This both delayed the launch o fthe pilot phase and compromised the abiIity to test
different innovations and hypotheses. Among essential elements not defined or provided for
at the outset are: critical technical and managerial capacity (staff, skills, tools, systems,
processes), infrastructure, equipment, drugs, other essential supplies, vehicles. Furthermore
these inputs were provided late and their quality/availability throughout the project was
inadequate.

                                                 33


 7.6      Pilot operations need a realistic, reasonably long timetable to ensureproper design
 and readinessfor implementation. The design envisaged a one-year implementation plan for
 the pilot phase, which turnedout to be a serious underestimate.

 7.7      A pilot approach to health sewice delivery may not be appropriate in countries in
 desperate need of basic health care across the entire country, especially countries in apost-
 conflict situation. Throughout project implementation there was tension between the needed
 time and technical requirements o f the pilot and demonstration phases inselected districts
 and the political pressures to spread the benefits o fproject nationwide. Informants noted that
 the pilot/demonstration approach was not politically feasible, as people were dying inall
 districts, health investments were urgently needed inall districts. Under these circumstances
 the spending o fproject resources on a selected few districts and on studies was
 uncomfortable and strongly resisted. Striving for equitywas (and still is) such a priority in
 M o H that one official noted that under any circumstances, ifmoney for health sector i s a
 constraint then MoH's response should be to scale down planned interventions and cover the
 whole country with some support, even ifinadequate. The Bank failed to convince MoH o f
 the benefits o f a pilot approach, which can contribute to improved health services and health
 status inthe whole country. More fundamentally, the Bank failed to assess the social and
 political context o f Uganda which was not amenable to a pilot design. And it failed to adjust
 the project inaway that mighthaveprovided abetterbalancebetweenlearning and
 coverage, without overextending project resources.


 Other Lessons

 7.8     The absence of a clear and coherent resultsframework (clearly stated objectives,
 well-chosen indicators and a well defined results chain, linking inputs, outputs, outcomes
 and impact) is likely to cause confusion among national stakeholders and compromise
national understanding and commitment, especially when theproject is complex and is
supportingfar-reaching reforms. Bythe same token the absence o f a clear planand system
for monitoring and evaluation and the failure to carry out critical evaluation and cost-
effectiveness studies have undermined opportunities for learning and improvement.

7.9      Thoughtjidproject design, adequate implementation, and timely monitoring and
evaluation are necessary, but not sufficient for project success. Inadequate attention to
assessing thepoliticalfeasibility of project objectivesand componentscan undermine
project success.

7.10     Bank support of the health sector has implications that extendfar beyond the
health sector alone. I t canpoint the way toward successful decentralization, mobilize
public resources, influence improved efficiencies inpublic expenditure and encourage
public-private partnerships. Not only was health the first sector to decentralize planning,
implementation, and financial management o f decentralized funds, it provided a reference
and experience on which many other sectors drew as they attempted to decentralize. The
World Development Report 1993 provided a new vision and a new set o f tools for improving
the cost-effectiveness o f health sector investment. N o w the EHP is at the core o f Uganda's
healthpolicy and strategy, andprovides the basis on which (increasingly more efficient)
resource allocation decisions are made. Observed successful public-private collaborations

                                                34


 seemed to flourish where they shared common (district) objectives to which they were both
 contributing, inline with their comparative advantage.

 7.11    Inequities in health services access and utilization and in health status will not
 change ifthey are not overtly targeted. Project objectives and indicators were not
 sufficiently targeted to vulnerable groups (rural populations, those with no education,
 women), whose access to services and knowledge o f self care left them disadvantaged and
 consequently with poorer health status than the country norms). Over the life o f the project
 inequities inknowledge, access and health status persisted.

 Challenges and Future Directions

 7.12   M o Hhas made great strides since the closing o f this project inconsolidating a SWAP
 approach, whose features are an improved vision o f sector goals and targets and improved
coordination among its multiple partners. Its Health Sector Development Plans are rising to
the challenges implicit inthese lessons. Inequities inservice access and inhealth status are
receiving more attention inannual plans, human resources issues are highlighted as crucial to
improved service quality and availability, monitoring and evaluation have become more
routine and more rigorous, as well as more decentralized. Efforts to achieve a stronger
results focus are underway. The lessons emanating from DHSP also point to opportunities
for further strengthening efforts on the following fronts: reconciling the need (and strong
politicalpressure) to improve coverage with the need to improve the quality and viability o f
existing services; strengthening overall government support and commitment to health
through the provision o f financing and other support needed to improve service access and
quality; underpinning a learning process to document and enhance cost-effectiveness o f
service delivery; stepping up efforts to mobilize resources through
experimentatiordpromotiono fhealth insurance and risk poolingschemes; improving
accountabilities through greater rigor and transparency; and more proactive contracting with
the non-governmental sector for service provision and other components o f health sector
development.

cited inTable    ... above. Differences are likely attributable to timing and basis o f calculating exchange rates of the different
