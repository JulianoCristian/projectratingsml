Despite the problems with the project, and the\n            resultant mixed outcomes, the sustainability of the project\n            activities - from the programmatic as well as the financial\n            perspective - is rated as likely. This assessment is based\n            on the fact that the institutions in Uganda, helped by the\n            DHSP, are now stronger and the donors  are working\n            collaboratively with the government of Uganda and each\n            other, within an overall development framework. Given the\n            unsatisfactory performance of the Bank at project\n            identification, preparation, appraisal and for  part of the\n            supervision, and despite the observed improvement in project\n            supervision in the latter half of the  project, the\n            Bank's overall performance must be rated as\n            unsatisfactory. Overall Borrower performance is assessed as\n            partially satisfactory. The project was co-funded by the\n            Government of Sweden and the Government of the Federal\n            Republic of Germany: partner performances were both rated\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned included the following: 1) The\n            project was implemented at a time when Uganda was just\n            recovering  from conflict and internal strife, and\n            furthermore had embarked on an ambitious decentralization\n            agenda that sought to devolve the responsibility for the\n            planning and implementation of essential public  services,\n            including health, to district administrations. Such\n            devolution of power presents several  unique challenges for\n            the design and implementation of Bank supported sectoral\n            projects, that need to  be recognized and effectively\n            managed, but which were underestimated by the project. 2)\n            The project was conceived and designed as a  traditional\n            project, but ended up providing broad programmatic support\n            and gradually developing a  larger group of development\n            partners. The absence of a clear government sectoral policy\n            compounded the situation. This raises substantial questions\n            about the use of a traditional project as the instrument for\n            major sectoral and institutional reform. 3) To be fully\n            effective, reform efforts within the health sector need to\n            explicitly recognize the politics and political economy of\n            the sector; the potential constraints imposed by other\n            ongoing reforms; and the need for early and extensive\n            consultations with relevant stakeholders in order to ensure\n            wide ownership. 4) The project worked with decentralized and\n            community-based  organizations, which was a strong\n            achievement. However, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\n            were constrained by having to work  through Local Tender\n            Boards. 5) Projects such as this one that work with multiple\n            implementing  partners, such as districts, sub-district\n            entities, and community-based organizations, faith-based\n            organizations, and NGOs need to make multiple advances to\n            those implementing partners and thus require correspondingly\n            larger Special Accounts. 6) A viable and effective\n            monitoring and evaluation framework mutually agreed upon at\n            the time of project  preparation is essential. 7) Effective\n            donor coordination is vital for the improved performance of\n            the health sector."}, "docdt": "2003-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
