The project is designed to support the\n            Government's strategy of decentralizing health\n            services. It plans to increase the efficiency of the\n            existing health infrastructure and institutions through\n            consolidation and improved management with increased local\n            accountability, while simultaneously supporting cost\n            recovery and budgetary policies that will enable the health\n            care system to move toward long term sustainability. It\n            supports the Government's efforts to reorder priorities\n            within the exisitng health care system through efficiency\n            improvements and by reallocating financial and human\n            resources toward ensuring the provision of a package of\n            essential health services for all Uganda's citizens.\n            Accordingly, the proposed project will: 1) pilot and test\n            new sector policies and strategies which will facilitate the\n            implementation of essential health services; 2) strengthen\n            management and planning capacity at district levels so that\n            they are prepared to provide essential health services; and\n            3) restructure the Ministry of Health so as to build its\n            capacity to provide health policy leadership and to support\n            the Government's decentralization policy."}, "docdt": "1994-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
