Firstly, it would\n            finance the foreign exchage cost for two years of the\n            five-year program of expansion of the electricity\n            distribution system in and around Djakarta, at an estimated\n            cost of $13.6 million, providing distribution and power\n            system equipment, materials and supplies, and engineering\n            services. Secondly, it would meet the foreign exchange costs\n            over a two-year period of management consulting services, in\n            an amount of $1.4 million, to improve the organization and\n            efficiency of the entire power sector and provide assistance\n            and training in operations, engineering, finance and management."}, "docdt": "1969-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
