Overview 
 
This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has the purpose of protecting the 
environment and the quality of life of the population and is based on the objectives of 
the environmental strategy and law in general. It relates to the environmental 
mitigation actions that will be taken during and after then construction of a transfer 
station in Anabta to collect solid waste from surrounding areas and transfer these to 
the existing newly constructed landfill at Zahrat Al_Finjan. The plan complements, 
and is to be read along with, the report 
“West Bank and Gaza Solid Waste 
Management Project (SWEMP): Solid Waste Management Study, Volume 2: 
Environmental Analysis of the Zahrat Finjan Site. In this latter report, the 
environmental mitigation actions required for the larger project area were defined and 
have been implemented. This latter report was disclosed in West Bank and Gaza, at 
the project sites and in the Bank’s INFOSHOP in March 2000. 
 
This EMP requires persons engaging in possible polluting activities to prevent 
environmental degradation and adverse risks to human and ecosystem health, make 
progressive environmental improvements, achieve effective integration of 
environmental, economic and social considerations in the decision making process, 
promote shared responsibility for the environment, and promote the principles of 
ecologically sustainable development. The primary purpose of the EMP is to provide 
information to the EQA on the proposed project within the local and regional 
framework, with the aim of emphasizing how the project may impact on the relevant 
environmental factors and how those impacts may be mitigated and managed so as to 
be environmentally acceptable. The EMP addresses the following areas: 
 
·
The proposed Project; 
·
The receiving environment; 
·
The potential impacts of the proposed project on factors of the environment; and, 
·
The proposed management strategies to ensure those environmental factors are 
appropriately protected; and 
 
2
Objectives of the Environment Management Plan 
 
The objectives of this EMP are to: 
 
•
place the proposed project in the context of the local and regional environment; 
•
Adequately describe all components of the proposed project, so that the EQA can 
consider approval of a well-defined project; 
•
provide the basis of the proponent’s environment management program, which 
shows that the environmental impacts resulting from the proposed project, 
including cumulative impact, can be acceptably managed; and 
•
provide a document that clearly sets out the reasons why the proposed project 
implementation and operation should be judged by the EQA to be 
environmentally acceptable.

Scoping Process 
 
It should be noted that the proposed disposal site, Zahret Al Finjan has gone through a 
detailed Environmental Impact Assessment study which was approved by the Donor 
and the Environmental Quality Authority.  
The proposed transfer station was subject to a screening exercise carried out by the 
consultant and the results of the screening were as shown in 
Table 11
 below:

Based on the above, and based on the Palestinian Environmental policy, the site 
should go through an initial environmental assessment leading to a mitigation and a 
monitoring plan which are the components of the Environmental management plan.

Environmental Monitoring and Mitigation Plan 
The project consists of collection and transfer of the collected waste to Jenin landfill 
(Zahrat Al-Finjan) site through a transfer station to be constructed at the previously 
proposed disposal site. Based on above requirements and on the field survey and 
analysis of potential impacts, the following is proposed to the proponent for 
submission to EQA for approval consideration and future monitoring of the project 
implementation: 
 
5.1 Adverse 
Impact 
Description
No significant adverse impacts are expected if the listed mitigation measures are 
considered at all implementation steps by the authorized and experienced staff, given 
budgets are allocated for each proposed action. 
 
Page  8
The possible impacts of a similar project and activities might include: 
-
Public resistance/ acceptance, 
-
Loss of habitat at storage or transfer stations sites 
-
Ground water pollution, especially if liners at the storage sites are not done well 
-
Hazardous waste disposal, if uncontrolled or not being segregated  
-Surface run off, if contaminated leading to soil pollution 
-
breading environment for rodents and flies at the transfer station leading to health 
hazards 
-
Soil Contamination from flying waste, Leachate, and  
-
Workers safety at all or any stage of the waste cycle. 
 
5.2 
Key Consideration for a Successful Implementation of the Plan
-
Budget allocation 
-
Trained staff 
-
Committed management team 
-
Regularity of the monitoring process 
-
Good book keeping system for the monitoring results and proposed actins.
