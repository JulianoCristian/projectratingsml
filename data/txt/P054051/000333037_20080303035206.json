Key negative impacts and corresponding mitigation\n            measures follow. A high standard of leachate containment and\n            management is a fundamental aspect of the proposed site\n            design. The risk of exposure to an explosion of landfill gas\n            is minimized through site design which should include\n            passive venting and landfill gas monitoring. The potential\n            impacts from noise, dust, and odor at the site will be\n            minimized by erecting sound barriers, using waste\n            compaction, daily covering the landfill site with crushed\n            and sorted inert construction waste to prevent prolonged\n            exposure of potentially odorous wastes to the atmosphere,\n            disallowing open burning on site, damping down roads as well\n            as covering material stockpiles and transport vehicles,\n            ensuring that all vehicles pass through wheel washes when\n            departing from the site, and controlling haulage routes and\n            traffic flows and patterns to reduce dust and vehicle\n            emissions. Litter impacts can be controlled by operating\n            small waste cells and litter screens. Landscaping and buffer\n            zone works should be used to provide the maximum possible\n            screening of the landfill site. Loss of visual amenity\n            during site operation will be corrected by replanting the\n            site and allowing it to progressively restore itself."}, "docdt": "2007-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
