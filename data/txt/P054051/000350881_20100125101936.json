satisfactory outcome and moderate risk to development\n            outcome. Both the Bank and the borrower performances were\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned were: (1) in conflict\n            situations, it is advisable to seek out and build upon the\n            common interests that often exist beneath the heat and\n            rhetoric. This can sometimes open up previously unforeseen\n            possibilities for cooperation. (2) Local ownership is more\n            critical for project success than is often recognized. Local\n            ownership is often taken for granted as a self-evident\n            prerequisite for project success. (3) Individuals can and do\n            make a major difference to project success; thus seeking out\n            and strongly supporting capable local professionals is\n            advisable. (4) Effective channels of public communication\n            and feedback support sustainability and can and should be\n            built into project design. (5) Investment in changing the\n            culture is often as important as physical investments, and\n            sometimes more so: Though difficult to specify before hand\n            and often the result of luck\u0097as partly in this case - these\n            investments make it difficult for a return to bad habits and\n            practices and thus strongly support project sustainability.\n            (6) SWM can serve as an effective entry point for improving\n            municipal management and service delivery: The sector is\n            highly visible, often neglected, and the potential negative\n            impacts obvious to the public. (7) Early preparation,\n            consensus building and \u0093learning\u0094 can pay significant\n            dividends. Early investment in donor participation also paid\n            significant dividends in later support. The Bank preparation\n            team\u0092s efforts in bringing in other donors very early in the\n            project preparation cycle later helped in burden sharing and\n            mobilizing necessary financial and technical support for the\n            project. (8) Consistent, thoughtful, and dedicated on-ground\n            Bank supervision support can be the difference between\n            success and failure."}, "docdt": "2009-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
