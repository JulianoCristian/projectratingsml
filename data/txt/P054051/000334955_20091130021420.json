Therefore, the Wadi Shaer\n            Joint Service Council (WSJSC) social committee concerns to\n            compensate the waste pickers through alternative work\n            opportunities that are safe and financially rewarding; and\n            2) waste pickers do not have any legal right on the basis of\n            which they can bring a claim for compensation for loss of\n            income before a court. That does not mean that they cannot\n            try to do so, but it is unlikely that a court will be able\n            to assist them. Therefore the social committee is to be set\n            up under the WSJSC to hear any concerns/ disputes with waste pickers."}, "docdt": "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
