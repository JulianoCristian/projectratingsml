Drawing on World Bank Group financing and\n            expertise since 2001, the Palestinians were able to improve\n            solid waste management and environmental conditions in 80\n            communities in Jenin Governorate, with a population of\n            200,000 people. They achieved this by establishing a new\n            sanitary landfill, closing and rehabilitating 85 dumpsites,\n            and improving waste collection services. Towards the end of\n            the project, the new landfill was expanded to serve all five\n            governors that comprises the northern West Bank (population\n            600,000), providing for further cost saving and enhancing\n            public-private partnerships."}, "docdt": "2010-11-08T03:41:03Z"}
