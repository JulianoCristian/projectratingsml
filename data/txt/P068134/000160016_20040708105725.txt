3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

        In response to the Bolivian economic, political and social crisis, the World Bank offered
support through a "Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit for Decentralization" (PSAC I)
in the amount of 60 million USD. In light of Bolivia's advanced decentralization process, the
objective of the PSAC I was as follows: "The program will support the Government in its
efforts to improve the delivery of public services to the poor through increased efficiency,
transparency and accountability of Bolivia's decentralized government system and through
improving the capacity of the decentralized system to deliver these services." To accomplish
this general objective, the PSAC I established five specific objectives:
i.      Improving the regulatory and institutional framework for decentralization;
ii.     Enhancing community participation, particularly of poor and excluded groups, such as
women and indigenous peoples, in municipal affairs and expenditure;
iii.    Restoring fiscal discipline;
iv.     Strengthening financial and institutional capacity of all levels of government to support the
delivery of local public services;
v.      Improving the availability of credit financing for municipal investments.

        In 1999, Bolivia had entered into economic crisis. While the average annual growth in the
nineties was of 4.3 percent of GDP, in that year the economy grew at only 0.6 percent. Adverse
conditions in the world economy, particularly the crises in Brazil, Argentina and Russia,
contributed to this situation. In response, the government prepared an Economic Reactivation
Plan with the aim to create short-term demand through its expenditure policies. Departmental and
municipal governments were included in this program because they carry out an increasing share
of public expenditures. Improving the quality and efficiency of spending at subnational levels was
expected to aid in reactivitating the economy. This placed decentralization in the context of a
national effort to restore economic growth.

        The decentralization strategy to be supported by the PSAC I supported the government's
approach to improve spending efficiency at the local level. It also sought to eliminate the factors
that contributed to a deteriorating fiscal balance, in particular irresponsible fiscal management by
local governments. After 1999, there were nine municipal governments--including such larger
ones as La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz--that were bankrupt. A prompt response was
necessary to curb accelerating indebtedness.

        Along with economic reactivation, the PSAC I sought to support the nation's poverty
reduction policy. Following the consensus achieved within the National Dialogue process and the
Bolivian Poverty Reduction Strategy (EBRP, initials in Spanish), municipalities acquired a leading
role in achieving poverty reduction objectives. Pro-poor policies were to be implemented at local
level through improved education, health and infrastructure services.

        The PSAC I operation was scheduled for one and one-half years (first operation).
However, the goals of the operation were far too ambitious to be achieved so rapidly or easily.
Even a period of five years (including subsequent PSACs) is an abreviated time frame to make



                                                 - 2 -

broad improvements in both institutional capacity and public services. First, decentralization is a
complex process, and implementing such a reform is made even more difficult under adverse
political and economic conditions. Second, decentralization cannot simply be assumed to be an
efficient poverty-fighting tool. Rather than reducing horizontal imbalances between regions,
decentralization policies may intensify them, and transferring resources to the regions reduces the
capacity of the central government to address imbalances. Third, the effectiveness of market
incentives to tackle the problems of weak fiscal responsibility is very limited in a country with
persistently low investment. In short, the role that the PSAC I was to play in economic
reactivation and poverty-reduction should have been reviewed both more critically and
realistically.

        The ambitious goals of PSAC I also created difficulties for the administration of the
program. At the central level alone over 20 entities participated in project management, posing a
challenge for the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Finance and the Fiscal Decentralization
Unit (UDF, initials in Spanish). Over 300 municipalities from around the country also participated
indirectly, along with ten donors. In short, it can be said that although the PSAC I was highly
consistent with the objectives in the CAS, the Bolivian Comprehensive Development Framework,
and the needs of the country, it challenged the capacity of counterparts in charge of its
implementation.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the operation were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
The original components (labeled "issues" in the PAD) of the PSAC I were as follows:
·       Component 1: Redefinition of roles and responsibilities across levels of government.
·       Component 2: Reform of intergovernmental transfer system.
·       Component 3: Reform of investment funds.
·       Component 4: Access to information regarding government programs for local and
community development.
·       Component 5: Accountability of the public sector.
·       Component 6: Participation of indigenous people.
·       Component 7: Political representation and jurisdictions.
·       Component 8: Citizen participation in large urban municipalities and efficient municipal
administration.
·       Component 9: Fiscal discipline and debt control of local governments.
·       Component 10: Institutional capacity for financial management and service delivery.
·       Component 11: Availability of municipal credit.

        In general, the components of the PSAC I supported and were consistent with the overall
project objective. The following comments are nonetheless relevant: First, the high number of
components made implementation especially difficult: the PSAC I tackled 11 issues, establishing a
very complex framework. Particularly, the components related to popular participation
(components 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) could have been aggregated into a single component so as to facilitate
project management. Second, problem analysis was deficient, especially with regards to



                                                - 3 -

components 1 and 2. The underlying causes of poorly-defined responsibilities by level of
government was not analyzed properly (see comments below).

3.4 Revised Components:
The components have not been revised.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

        The Project was consistent with the CAS and government priorities. Moreover, the
innovative design of the Project deserves attention. The PSAC I established a centralized and
pooled funding mechanism ("basket fund") financed by various donors. It was also innovative to
use an adjustment program to support decentralization. A programmatic approach has been useful
in complex political environments, such as decentralization. The design allowed for managing the
risks associated with an operation of such complexity.

        However, the operation also had design flaws, which perhaps is not surprisingly given that
it was an innovative and early programmatic project. No baseline or proper indicators were
developed to allow for suitable monitoring. There is imprecision and ambiguity concerning
"indicators", "results", and "objectives". The reforms envisioned remained too general in many
components. In particular component 1, aimed at establishing a more coherent division of roles
and responsibilities across levels of government, focused only on proposed legal reforms. Here,
problem analysis was deficient so as to eliminate the underlying causes of blurred responsibilities
across national and municipal tiers. The intermediate (departmental) level of government--which
which today is a bottleneck in Bolivia's decentralization process--was not considered. Meanwhile,
reforms related to social participation were spread across four components. Also, the total
number of components (11) is too high to allow for proper monitoring and management of the
reform process.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

        An evaluation of the achievement of the PSAC I Project Development Objective (PDO)
must take into account the following: (i) the project was meant as a first step within a
medium-term program. It was therefore not intended to solve all the issues and problems at hand,
but rather to set the framework for further reforms; (ii) formal monitoring and impact indicators
were missing for the Project Development Objective; and there was imprecision and ambiguity
concerning the "indicators", "results", and "objectives"; (iii) there is still no valid and accepted
methodology regarding the evaluation of the impacts of decentralization; this dilemma is not
directly related to the PSAC I design, but that does limit the possibility of evaluating whether the
project has achieved the desired impact; and (iv) the difficult economic and political situation in
Bolivia undermined the sound application of decentralization policies.

        Despite these limitations, the PSAC I has been rated unsatisfactory. The Project
Development Objective has not been achieved. It is clear that most decentralized services are still


                                                - 4 -

inefficient; and that the transparency and accountability at local levels are still poor. Although
there has been an increase in government capacity at the national level to design decentralization
policies, particularly that of the Ministry of Finance, the overall institutional impact has been
modest, particularly at the local level. The main accomplishment of the operation has been the
increased fiscal responsibility and the control of over-indebtedness by several municipal
governments, although this may prove temporary in many cases, and the rescheduling of
subnational debt still has shortcomings.

         This rating is also based on an individual and differentiated analysis of the specific
objectives of the operation. The level of accomplishment of the specific objectives varied:
·        "Improving the regulatory and institutional framework for decentralization": The PSAC
I set up a national decentralization program, with rules and objectives that have been accepted by
many, though certainly not all, of the actors involved.
·        "Enhancing community participation, particularly of poor and excluded groups, such as
women and indigenous peoples, in municipal affairs and expenditure": There is some
improvement in popular participation, but substantial impediments remain.
·        "Restoring fiscal discipline": PSAC I has succeeded in slowing the indebtedness of a
number of mid-size and large municipalities. Although the program did not eliminate the pressure
and origins of subnational indebtedness, it has brought about some fiscal discipline. The fact that
the central government was able to harness the over-indebted municipalities under a debt
restructuring program has established a precedent in intergovernmental relations in Bolivia.
·        "Strengthening financial and institutional capacity of all levels of government to support
the delivery of local public services": The PSAC I has not been able to improve institutional
capacity significantly. In terms of practical implementation, this project focused more on the
central level than on the local level. Institutional capacity at the departmental and municipal levels
is still poor.
·        "Improving availability of credit financing for municipal investments": The objective
was to create a credit market mostly for the private sector. This objective has not been achieved.

4.2 Outputs by components:


Objective A: Increase efficiency, transparency and accountability of decentralized system
in Bolivia.

Objective A.1.: Improve the institutional and regulatory framework of decentralization, in
accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.

Component 1: Redefinition of roles and responsibilities across levels of government.

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

         Many Latin American countries immersed in decentralization are struggling to clarify
responsibilities at the various levels of government. If regional and municipal governments adopt
new responsibilities in an uncoordinated fashion, then responsibilities among the different agencies
involved in providing services may become blurred. Bolivia encountered just such a problem. One
of the key objectives of the PSAC I was to correct this situation.

        Unfortunately, Component 1 of the PSAC I failed to eliminate the origins of blurred
responsibilities across levels of government. The reforms proposed were limited to legal reforms.
But clearly the introduction of legal reforms alone is not enough to improve the framework of
responsibilities; and political opposition made it impossible to adopt a new draft law to redefine
responsibilities for levels of government (a waiver was conceded for this conditionality).

        With the proposed comprehensive reform of the intergovernmental system, the operation
should have attacked the origins of the problem of blurred responsibilities. The reasons for this
blurred division of responsibilities include, among others, the fact that local governments cannot
manage human resources autonomously as the center continues to hire and fire personnel
necessary to delivery municipal services; the flow of funds and transfers does not establish a link
between levels of government; the electoral system creates incentives for interventions in urban
areas; municipal capacities are extremely heterogeneous, requiring flexible solutions in terms of
service delivery; decentralization reforms are introduced separately by levels of government,
rather than by following a sectoral strategy; and the intermediate or departmental level of the
government is excluded from the decentralization process. Unfortunately, none of these problems
were attacked systemically, albeit the PSAC I was an opportunity precisely to do this. As a result,
early in 2004 the intergovernmental system still displayed the same pathologies. Responsibilities
among the national, departmental and municipal responsibilities still overlap. Bolivia has not yet
been able to find a clear accountability system with regards to expenditure responsibilities.

Component 2: Reform of intergovernmental transfer system.

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

        The component sought to promote an intergovernmental fiscal system with a coherent
framework for service delivery ("finance follows functions"). It sought the reduction of vertical
fiscal imbalances (the measure for the ability of subnational government to cover their expenditure
needs through own revenues as opposed to intergovernmental transfers) and the reduction of
horizontal imbalances (the gap between "rich" and "poor" regions, either in their fiscal capacity or
in terms of expenditure needs).

        Data availability in Bolivia makes it impossible to measure progress with regard to vertical
fiscal imbalance after the year 2000. This precludes confirming whether the PSAC I component
has had the desired impact in reducing vertical fiscal imbalances.

        With respect to horizontal fiscal imbalances, the most recent data available are for the year
2002. When measuring differences in departmental per capita GDP, no significant improvements
in fiscal capacity can be observed between years 1999 and 2002 (Figure 1). In other words, the
ranking of departments with respect to the national average in fiscal capacity remains unaltered
and significant horizontal imbalances remain.

                                         However, the intergovernmental transfer system in Bolivia seems to favor municipalities
situated in departments with higher expenditure needs (see Table 1). The resources of the HIPC
initiative entering the intergovernmental system in the year 2002 have had a distributive effect,
though not necessarily a redistributive effect. In terms of per capita transfers: (i) municipalities in
all departments receive more resources; and (ii) the increase in per capita transfers is higher in
departments with higher expenditure needs, such as Oruro, Pando, Beni and Potosí.

                                         Still, it is important to take into account that distribution of HIPC resources has been
financed by transfers from the central government, thereby increasing considerably municipal
dependency rates. These resources were made available without additional expenditure
responsibilities attached. This breaks with one of the key principles of decentralization, namely
that revenue and expenditures should be transferred together. For some departments this increase
in transfers amounts up to 75% (see Figure 2), a reform that in the future will most likely weaken
fiscal responsibility on subnational levels.

Component 3: Reform of Investment Funds

Rating: Satisfactory.

              The reform of investment funds was a central objective of the PSAC I. The purpose was
to combine under a single roof a series of different funds that were operating without coordination
-- a trend fostered in great part by external donors. The component is rated as satisfactory given
the implementation of this path-breaking financial tool that will enable the government to
rationalize its investment policy.

              The reform entailed the application of a transparent formula to support the anti-poverty
policy of government, implemented through the "National Compensation Policy" (PNC in
Spanish). A system of "relative prices" was established to guide local governments in their
decision-making process. The system requires less counterpart financing from municipalities for
investments in sectors that the national government has designated as priorities. Conversely, in
sectors considered less essential by the national government, municipal counterpart financing must
be higher. This formula is certainly a step in the right direction.

              However, implementation of this reform is flawed and incomplete. The National
Productive and Social Investment Fund (FPS in Spanish) applies a formula that takes into account
poverty levels, but there is still no clear strategy in terms of allocation of funds among the
departments (see Table 2). For instance, the department of La Paz, one of the fiscally strongest
jurisdictions, received 8% of the aggregate FPS funds in 2002. In 2004 it stands to receive 25%, a
sizable increase. On the other hand, less favored departments, such as Potosí, are expected to see
a reduction in their participation. Although investment data is always subject to year-to-year



                                                    - 8 -

variation, it seems that the FPS has still not found its intended level of redistribution.

                Nonetheless, a certain level of reallocation can be observed by considering the investment
percentage among "poor" and "rich" municipalities. Comparing the destination of the funds before
and after their reorganization shows a trend towards allocation to groups 4 and 5, which are
precisely the poorer municipalities. These two groups of municipalities receive 45% of the
investment executed through FPS, while groups 1 and 2 (the "richer" municipalities) receive a
25% of total investment (see Figure 3).

                 In this context it is important to verify whether the investment funds have served as a
means to signal municipalities the investment priorities of the national government. At the national
level a change in investment priorities was taking place. For instance, while 51% of the

investments were directed to the education sector in 2002, the share dropped to 12% (projected)
for 2004 (see Table 3). As of yet, similar changes cannot be observed in municipal budgets.
Sectoral allocation in municipal budgets remain largely unaltered between 1999 and 2003 (see
Table 4), and it is not possible to verify whether this was related to different investment priorities
of the national government and the FPS Fund.

         Some indicators that have been impossible to verify. First, there is no recent data
confirming that municipal spending has increased vis-à-vis overall public spending. Second, it was
impracticable to verify whether municipal governments have had access to timely information
regarding the distribution of the investment funds for providing public services, including
allocation criteria. Although there is anecdotal evidence that the access to information has
improved, due to the lack of a baseline and of updated information, this unfortunately cannot be
verified objectively.

Component 4: Access to information regarding government programs for local and
community development.

Rating: Satisfactory.

        The goal was to facilitate access to local development funds, in particular by the poorer
parts of the population. It was found that large part of the population and community groups did
not have the necessary knowledge in how to apply for funding. Therefore, this component sought
to increase information about the menu of services offered by the investment funds. Improving the
information flow was supportive of Bolivia's anti-poverty agenda.

        The government has made an effort to disseminate the operational rules of the FPS. In a
survey conducted in 2002 it could be verified that the level of knowledge among key
policy-makers at the local level, in particular among community oversight groups (comités de
vigilancia), was high (study conducted by MKT-Marketing). However, the absence of a baseline
makes it difficult to verify the degree of improvement. An anti-corruption system was also
established with a toll free (1-800) telephone number to report cases of corruption. However,
deep-seated communication problems with communities--in terms of language barriers and
others--still exist in large parts of Bolivia.

        It is impossible to verify whether resources were channelled towards the poorer segments
of the community. Although there has been a slight shift towards the poorer municipalities (see
issue 3), it is not possible to conclude that these resources reached the poorer sectors in those
jurisdictions.

Component 5: Accountability of the public sector.

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

        The objective of the component was to make the use of public resources more transparent
and thereby contribute to efficient and effective expenditures. To this end, the creation of a public
procurement system and the introduction of an integrated financial system (SIGMA system) were
proposed. The aim was to introduce the system in all of the ministries, investment funds and
subnational government. Implementation is still ongoing and so evaluation of its benefits and
impacts remain somewhat premature.

        This component is rated unsatisfactory given its limited implementation progress at the
municipal level. The PSAC I was too optimistic with regard to the political and technical obstacles
implied by introducing such an information system in the country's local public administration.
Only the La Paz municipality has been included in SIGMA on a pilot basis. The government,
however, remains committed to rolling out the system nation-wide, a plan supported by the
Inter-American Development Bank. Also, government has advanced with the introduction of
SINCOM and SIMGOP, municipal and departmental accounting systems, respectively. However,
these reforms were not considered in the PSAC I. Once fully implemented they will, in synergy
with SIGMA, improve the transparency and accountability of subnational government.

        Implementation progress is better at the central level. To date, SIGMA has been
implemented in a critical mass of central government agencies, including 14 government
ministries. At the central level, the system has improved the efficiency and reliability in the central
government's financial management practices. These benefits include: (i) improved recording of
financial information; (ii) greater access to timely financial information; (iii) improved efficiency
and flexibility in the use of budgetary resources; (iv) increased transactional efficiencies; (v)
strengthened financial management controls; and (vi) improved integration within and among
central government financial management functions (budget, accounting, treasury, etc.).

        It is also clear that measuring the degree of accomplishment by using indicators of PSAC I
will be a difficult undertaking. First, the proposed indicators are unrealistic. Second, the
corruption perception surveys have not been conducted, and therefore no baseline exists to
measure progress against.

Objective A.2: Strengthen Community Participation.

Component 6: Participation of Indigenous People

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

        The objective of the component consisted of facilitating access by indigenous and poor
communities in government decision-making. Although Bolivia adopted participation mechanisms
in 1994, those proved too rigid and inflexible for a large part of the population. This undermined
allocative efficiency at the local level through the misalignment of public services with the
priorities of citizens. One of the objectives of the PSAC I was to introduce the changes necessary
so that participation mechanisms would be functional and effective.

        The component is rated unsatisfactory given that implementation has not progressed
beyond conceptualization. Although various documents analyzing the possibilities of increasing
social participation by indigenous peoples were prepared, none have been implemented. It was not
until after the PSAC I was completed that the Ministry of Sustainable Development commenced
various pilot projects to incorporate the demands of indigenous peoples in municipal planning.
This work has not been concluded. The results are expected to be presented by the end of 2004,
which shows how excessively optimistic the component has been in estimating progress.

Component 7: Political representation and jurisdictions.

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

        Part of the governance problems in Bolivia result from an incompatibility between
political-administrative divisions and indigenous territories. This undermines self-determination
and social participation by indigenous peoples, and negatively affects the legitimacy of the overall
political system. The reforms considered in PSAC I aimed at establishing a system of political
representation that would cater to the needs of indigenous peoples in particular.



                                                 - 12 -

         This component is rated unsatisfactory given the limited advances in implementation. The
most significant improvement was achieved in the mapping of jurisdictions of indigenous
territories   in  the    country,   which     demonstrated    their  incompatibility    with   the
political-administrative divisions. Yet no adjustment to the jurisdictions was effected; and
indicators demanding that "the indigenous peoples be more satisfied with their representation at
the local governments" could not be monitored. The reforms and indicators were
overly-optimistic and failed to recognize that the adjustment of political-administrative
jurisdictions is a highly-complex political process, requiring time periods that exceed the short
cycles of such adjustment programs.

Component 8: Citizen participation in large urban municipalities and efficient municipal
administration.

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

         The component aimed to solve two problems: (i) the lack of social participation in large
cities, which undermined allocative efficiency and led to governance problems; and (ii) the
existence of a number of excessively small municipalities, which cannot realize economies of scale
in delivering key services.

         The component has been rated unsatisfactory. The PSAC I did not establish reforms to
stimulate popular participation in large cities and merely mandated legal reforms to the status of
municipal associations (mancomunidades). It is impossible to verify whether there has been an
increase in popular participation.

         Reforms to the status of the municipal associations are set out in the Municipalities Act
Regulatory Decree, where they are recognized as public entities. This has triggered the creation of
a series of such municipal associations. It is estimated that as of the year 2004, some 280
municipalities (of a total of 311) have formed some 75 associations. Although their institutional
development is unequal and their efficiency varies considerably--that is, not more than 15
municipal associations are operational--it is clear that an important process is underway.
However, it is premature to measure an increase in efficiency, due to the lack of a baseline, the
time required to operationalize the associations, and the considerable cost that a consistent
monitoring would entail.

Objective B: Improve the Capacity of Local Governments to Deliver Public Services.

Objective B.1.: Restoring Fiscal Discipline.

Component 9: Fiscal discipline and debt control of local governments.

Rating: Satisfactory.

         Debt control and restoring fiscal discipline were among the primary objectives of the



                                                - 13 -

PSAC I. The accelerated indebtedness of 9 municipalities, including three of the largest (La Paz,
Cochabamba and Santa Cruz), had a negative impact on public finances. Municipalities faced a
solvency problem, which implied that some public services could not be provided. In response, the
PSAC I established that debt control could be achieved by: (i) intercepting intergovernmental
transfers originating in the general revenue-sharing arrangement; and (ii) rescheduling debt
payments. The conditionality aimed at bringing municipal debt back to sustainable levels,
improving solvency, fostering fiscal discipline, and safeguarding macro-economic stability.

         The Debt Restructuring Program (PRF in Spanish) has been successful and the component
is rated satisfactory. Acute indebtedness has been controlled, thereby averting a larger fiscal crisis.
The component also has served to prevent the development of a moral hazard situation among
municipal governments that speculate on bailouts from central government. By applying effective
sanctions, the central government was able to build up a reputation as being consistent at
imposing fiscal discipline.

         This positive development is reflected in the PSAC I indicators. The trend in primary
current account balances (total revenues minus total expenditures, without interest payments) is
positive and municipalities are capable of generating a surplus. This is evident when comparing
the primary current account balances at the time of signing up to the debt restructuring program,
the annual targets that were set for each individual subnational government, and the targets that
were reached (Table 5). Although several municipalities--including Cochabamba and Santa
Cruz--have not reached the set annual targets, the PRF has succeeded in realigning fiscal
management at the local level when measured against this indicator.

        The "20/200 Rule" states that the current value of the debt ("stock") relative to current
revenues must not exceed 200%, and that the proportion of the debt service relative to current
revenue must not exceed 20%. Great variations exist across municipalities as to the compliance
with this rule. With regard to the "200%-rule" (debt stock relative to current revenues) there is
some improvement in some municipalities. But some subnational govermments, among them
Cochabamba, Guayaramerin and Tarija, have increased their debt stock and adopted new debt
obligations (see Table 6). Also, several municipalities have not reached the proposed annual goals,
and today are still above the target-value of 200%.

        In terms of the "20% rule," which measures debt service relative to current revenue, the
trend is positive but several municipalities have been unable to meet their goals (see Table 7). In
fact, most of those municipalities today are above the maximum 20% level. This result is
debatable, however, as it may show that most subnational governments within the debt
rescheduling program are servicing their debt more coherently and promptly, which was precisely
one of the desired outcomes of this component of the PSAC I.

         As a result of the effective sanctions that were imposed, the Debt Restructuring Program
(PRF) has established a precedent in intergovernmental relations. But at least three deficiencies
exist.
·        First, the cost of restructuring has been paid by external credits. Close to US$ 12 million
have been contributed by the resources disbursed by the PSAC I. However, the lion's share has
been assumed by a US$ 50 million credit from the Andean Development Corporation (CAF).
Although these resources are freely available and the country is not accountable to the Bank for
their use, the PSAC I has had some negative secondary effect in relaxing the budget constraint. In
other words, financial rescue of municipal governments should have been paid through treasury
funds rather than through new credits.
·        Second, the reforms proposed in the PSAC I have not attacked the roots of
over-indebtedness: The sources of unsustainable debt are, among others, inefficient expenditures,
oversized and unconditional transfers (community association and HIPC resources) and spending
rigidities. Although the PRF was able to momentarily control the "credit push", there could be
another similar crisis at any time in the future. In this sense, the reforms have not contributed to
their own sustainability. This is also reflected by the existing pressure for municipal indebtedness
seen in early 2004.
·        Third, prefectures have been excluded from reforms relating to subnational
over-indebtedness. This is unfortunate, as the lack of fiscal discipline is fostered by the
departmental governments. There is evidence that, for political reasons, these governments have
regularly provided bailouts to municipalities. As of September 30, 2003, many Prefectures were
on the edge of over-indebtedness, or had acquired excessive debt. The current value of debt in La
Paz, with respect to current revenues, is 194.2%, in Santa Cruz 196.3%, in Chuquisaca 199.9%,
and in Tarija 560%. In other words, although municipal indebtedness data shows an improvement,


                                                      - 16 -

in truth, part of the debt is being absorbed by the departmental governments, thereby perpetuating
the lax fiscal discipline.

Objective B.2.: Strengthening the Financial and Institutional Capacity of the Decentralized
Public Administration to Deliver Services.

Component 10: Institutional capacity for financial management and service delivery.

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

         The project sought to address the limited local capacity to deliver public services. As a
core tool, the PSAC I relied on Institutional Adjustment Plans (PAI in Spanish) that list the
institutional reforms that would assure efficient and fiscally responsible management by
municipalities. Prepared annually, these may be considered a "road map" to better municipal
management. The reforms were intended to set a framework through which municipalities would
acquire the skills needed to manage their finances responsibly and deliver services more
efficiently.

         To measure the level of municipal capacity, the PSAC I proposed a series of indicators,
most of which require close and constant monitoring. Unfortunately, there is no baseline to reflect
initial conditions. This makes it difficult to monitor: (i) whether the poorer segments of the
population believe municipal and departmental services have improved; (ii) whether the
participation of civil society in providing local services has increased, and (iii) whether the
provision of local services is in fact better. However, it is possible to measure (iv) whether there
has been an increase in local tax collection (but not for all municipalities). All these deficiencies
prevent monitoring and evaluating (v) allocative efficiency, which measures the extent to which
local public services are aligned with the priorities of citizens.

         Although the elaboration of institutional development plans is justified, the strategy
proposed and supported by the PSAC faced a series of problems:
·        Some goals established in the PAI were incompatible with a decentralization process. For
instance, setting the desired proportion of expenditures to the level of own revenues in each
municipality (vertical fiscal imbalances) is impracticable, as they tend to change as the
decentralization process unfolds. Higher intergovernmental transfers deteriorate the vertical fiscal
imbalance indicator, a trend that needs to be addressed at the national level, and not necessarily at
the level of each individual municipality.
·        The FNDR as implementing agency, responsible for elaboration of the PAI plans and, in
part, for providing technical assistance, has not had the neccessary incentives to apply the tools
that were developed. The institution worked exclusively with the 70 municipalities to which it
provided credit. Most other municipalities were left unattended by the institutional strengthening
program.
·        The PAI was an instrument that worked with a "top-down" logic and with interventions
from outside the municipality. The assimilation of the recommendations varied significantly; but in
general assimilation was poor. It is no coincidence, therefore, that today central government
gives municipalities more space to manage their own institutional strengthening programs. This



                                                 - 17 -

change is not directly related to the PSAC I.

        Placing the PAI at the center of institutional strengthening efforts has not proven to be the
most effective way to increase local capacity. The component is rated unsatisfactory.

Objective B.3.: Improved Access to Financial Credit for Municipal Investments.

Issue 11: Availability of municipal credit

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

        The objective of the component was to increase local governments' access credit,
especially in private capital markets. The strategy consisted of creating and transmitting market
incentives for the management of subnational debt, in order to complement a debt control system
that relies mainly on administrative, top-down controls and supervision. The conditionalities
aimed at fostering fiscal discipline by introducing market incentives.

        This objective was not accomplished. At the present time, private capital markets do not
play a more important role than they did prior to PSAC I. The FNDR, the main source of
municipal credits, does not compete with private banking but rather with non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) offering resources under less demanding conditions. Fiscal responsibility
has not improved, and the Prefectures still provide financial aid to the municipalities.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The Project has not been assigned an economic rate of return.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
The Project has not been assigned a financial rate of return.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
        The PSAC I had the specific objective of improving institutional capacity for
decentralization. Its main contribution toward this goal was in fostering greater fiscal
responsibility. By establishing effective sanctions applied to over-indebted governments, the
central government has prevented moral hazard situations, and the accelerated indebtedness that
negatively affected national public finances has been slowed.

        However, the institutional development impact has less significant with regard to human
capacities due to institutional instability at the national, departmental and municipal levels of
public administration. No formal training or technical assistance program was designed parallel to
the adjustment operation. Therefore, a high number of central government agencies were involved
in the program but none are formally included in capacity-building measures. In addition, key
institutions that were in charge of institutional strengthening (for instance, the FNDR as the
agency responsible for the elaboration of municipal strengthening plans), did not face adequate
incentives to involve a vast majority of municipalities in their training programs. These factors
contributed to the weak institutional development impact.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

        The long preparation phase of the operation involved the authorities from three
government administrations. This affected continuity during the preparation phase. The instability
of personnel in municipal administrations also presented problems. Finally, there was pressure to
move forward the operation to meet funding gaps of the government, which may have affected
loan design.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

        The economic crisis sustained mid-program (early 2002) substantially reduced the cash
flow towards co-executing agencies. This precluded passing on the incentives--mostly financial
and fiscal--that were crucial to the PSAC program. This has been particularly important for the
FPS and FNDR, which reduced their program due to the shortness of funds. The difficult
economic situation has, time and again, affected the ability of authorities to design and implement
sound decentralization policies they have envisioned.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

        A positive factor was the ownership on behalf of the Fiscal Decentralization Unit (UDF in
Spanish) as implementation agency of the Ministry of Finance. This safeguarded coordination of a
complex program. On the downside, the large number of agencies participating in the
operation--some 40 institutions--required a sizable coordination effort and weakened their
ownership as co-executors of the credit.

5.4 Costs and financing:

        There were no deviations from the finance plan, representing an aggregate amount of US$
207 million. The project was financed through: (a) co-financing, in the form of a "basket fund",
provided by various multi- and bilateral agencies, including the World Bank; and (b) "parallel
financing" that was coordinated with the "basket fund".

        Financing for the "basket fund", for an aggregate amount of US$ 80 million, is broken
down as follows: (i) the IBRD contributed US$ 60 million; (ii) Netherlands US$ 10 million; (iii)
DFID US$ 7 million; (iv) Sweden US$ 3 million. "Parallel financing", totalling US$ 127 million,
is broken down as follows: (i) IADB US$ 47 million; (ii) KfW US$ 15 million; (iii) GTZ US$ 10
million; (iv) Denmark US$ 10 million; (v) USAID US$ 5 million; and (vi) CAF US$ 40 million.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability rating: Unlikely

        The sustainability rating of a project supporting decentralization policies must begin by
acknowledging the character of the process. Decentralization is highly complex, driven by the
interests and incentives of political and social actors. It is often unstable and unpredictable, and


                                                     - 19 -

may suffer explicit reform reversals. Making the process of decentralization sustainable requires
that actors have both the interest and the incentives necessary to sustain their actions.

        In the short term, the PSAC I became a sort of an umbrella for coordinating the actions of
various actors in the decentralization process. In 2001, 2002, and mid-2003 the financial and fiscal
incentives established by the program constituted a reference for all domestic actors involved.
However, by the time a follow-up operation, the single-tranche PSAC II, was approved and the
funds disbursed, the relevant incentives vanished. As a result, actors did not maintain their
previously-assumed commitments. After June 2003, the subject of decentralization had lost
importance with central government. As decentralization policy was uncoordinated across
different central agencies, controls were loosened, and technical assistance to municipalities
declined. In this sense, one main objective of the PSAC I, which was precisely to build a
framework for the actions of decentralization actors, was not sustained over time.

        To be fair, certain reforms brought about by the PSAC I may be sustained. There is no
doubt that the Debt Restructuring Program (PRF) has established a precedent in the Bolivian
decentralization process, as it has shown the municipal governments that the central government
is capable of imposing effective sanctions. Although monitoring of subnational debt is no longer
as tight as it was been at the beginning of the operation (in particular at the departmental level),
municipalities know that the central government is capable of intercepting intergovernmental
transfers as well as regulating and controling excessive subnational debt. The capacity of the
central government to prevent another debt push hopefully will be sustained as a policy tool.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

a)      Evaluation of Transition Arrangements

        Since the beginning of project preparation, the Bank team and counterparts thought that a
reform of the decentralization process could be accomplished over a period of five years.
Therefore, the PSAC I was designed as the first of three programmatic operations offering
policy-based lending. The operation established benchmarks for a PSAC II (scheduled for January
2004, but pulled forward to June 2003), and for a PSAC III (initially foreseen for January 2005,
but ultimately not in the 2004 Bolivia CAS). The operation was divided into two tranches (which
later became three). Thus, there were ongoing incentives to enact the reforms set out in the PSAC
I, which have given way to the reforms proposed in the PSAC II.

b)      Performance indicators to be applied in the future and which allow monitoring and
evaluation of the project

        The operation suffered from two basic problems in the area of performance indicators: (i)
it did not establish a baseline showing conditions at the beginning of the operation, at least not for
all reform areas; (This was especially true of the reforms pertaining to civil society and popular
participation.) and, (ii) it did not include indicators covering all the component areas.

c)      Recommended follow-up by the Bank, including the ongoing monitoring of the operation;
discussion of follow-up projects; priority and timing of the evaluation by the OED.


                                                  - 20 -

        The date for conducting the ICR, one year after the operations are finished, is ideal as
most of the impacts of the PSAC I can begin to be seen. The ongoing monitoring must start with
the PSAC II follow-up operation, closed in January 2004. An evaluation by the OED would only
make sense if a proper methodology for decentralization evaluation were available and there were
more refined indicators to evaluate the decentralization process in Bolivia itself. Neither are
presently available.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The diagnostic made by the Bank concerning the underlying problems of decentralization in
Bolivia was, in general terms, correct. The analysis stressed that weak intergovernmental relations
were at the heart of the development problems in Bolivia. The theory that fiscal problems largely
determine the development and impact of decentralization has also proven to be correct.

        The analytical work done by the Bank was accompanied by an extensive, in-depth
investigation of various subjects. Some 30 studies were shared and coordinated among the
bilateral agencies. Although some complained the analytical work was too extensive, the
coordination and close work among the donors was a very positive aspect, allowing donors to
overcome largely isolated interventions in the decentralization process.

        Despite this work, the matrix of policies and recommended actions were not well targeted.
This is particularly clear in component 1. The reforms supported should have attacked the roots
of the problem, including (i) a centralized human resources management which gives the national
government considerable leverage over local government; (ii) a flow of intergovernmental
transfers that fails to establish a tie between the departmental and municipal levels; and (iii) a
flawed political representation system at the departmental and municipal levels. The project only
recommended narrow legal reforms, not fully addressing the origins of the problem.

        Additionally, the project focused on the central and municipal levels and did not take into
account needed reforms at the intermediate level of public administration, which is a key piece in
the state structure. The lack of transparency in the departmental management of funds, the
inability to generate coordination at the municipal level, and inefficiency in investment all seriously
affect decentralization and its fiscal sustainability. At this time, establishing a functional
intermediate level is essential for decentralization to progress in a timely fashion. Although clearly
there is considerable political resistance to departmental reform, the project should have
attempted to tackle the problem or at least experiment with various reform initiatives.

        A contributing factor to the poor performance was that the policy matrix was negotiated
with a number of participants at the national level, as well as among a dozen bilateral and
multilateral donors. Although this fostered ownership among the parties involved, it slowed
project preparation and diluted the reform focus. There was a significant trade-off between
creating a consensus among the participants and effectiveness in preparation.




                                                 - 21 -

        In spite of these deficiencies, it is important to note that the participants from the Bolivian
government and the bilateral donors acknowledged the technical capacity of World Bank
personnel in preparing and carrying out the operation. In an evaluation conducted at the request
of the Ministry of Finance (Fiscal Decentralization Unit, or UDF), with the help of the
Netherlands Cooperation and the Swedish Cooperation, the Bank's high level of performance has
been expressly recognized (see document: "Evaluation of the PSAC-I: Support to
Decentralization", published in October 2003, page 89. The document argues that the operation
could not have been implemented without the Bank's technical leadership.).

        The Bank also deserves recognition for creating and testing a new and innovative product,
in particular with regards to the basket funding. As a pilot operation, it was to be expected that
both the Bolivian government, the bilateral agencies, and the Bank itself would face a learning
process.

        Finally, it is important to mention a tranche release issue. A partial waiver was required
for the third tranche to address the sole outstanding condition of the credit, namely, passage of a
procurement law. The Government prepared a draft law, acceptable to the Bank, which was
widely discussed with civil society. Political developments early in 2003 made the enactment of
such a law impossible. Instead, the government enacted a Supreme Decree to regulate and reform
procurement procedures.

7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision on balance is judged satisfactory. The Project Status Reports reveal the
problems that emerged. Five supervisory missions were conducted. There has been good dialogue
with the counterpart and with other donors. The task managers have been proactive.
Nevertheless, the heavy project focus on legal changes, adoption of action plans, poor
performance indicators, deteriorating macro-economic circumstances, and turnover of task
managers led to overly-optimistic estimates of progress achieved or potential results.

        Additionally, the implementation unit, namely the Fiscal Decentralization Unit (UDF in
Spanish) at the Ministry of Finance, has expressed its opinion that the Bank needed to invest more
time and resources in supervision, and to establish a closer dialogue. It may have been advisable,
therefore, to have a technical assistance project associated with the adjustment operation.
Additionally, as a dozen bilateral agencies were directly involved in the operation, they should
have played a more direct role in providing technical assistance.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Rating: Unsatisfactory.

        As a result of the poorly designed operation the Bank's rating is unsatisfactory. The
policies agreed with the government of Bolivia have not eliminated the roots of blurred
responsibilities across levels of government, weak fiscal discipline, and inefficient services. The
operation should have emphasized other areas, including the subnational civil service regime, the
intermediate level of government, and capacities to generate own revenue. This has clearly
undermined the effectiveness of the operation.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

        The preparation was led by the Ministry of Finance, and by the Vice-Ministry of Public
Investment and External Finance (VIPFE) in particular. Commitment during the preparation of
the Project was deep. Roughly 10 individuals from the MoF were devoted, directly or indirectly,
to the project.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

        The performance of the Government is difficult to evaluate, as it involves a number of
participants with various interests, and because some 24 agencies participated in implementation.
It can nonetheless be concluded that the highest performance was seen during the administration
responsible for preparation of the project, which showed a deep commitment to decentralization
and to the reforms proposed. In contrast, commitment to decentralization and the PSAC I
waivered during the subsequent administration.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

        The performance of the implementation agency, the Fiscal Decentralization Unit (UDF),
within the Ministry of Finance, was satisfactory. It became the administrator of the PSAC I funds
and the coordinator of all the agencies involved in the decentralization process. It was exposed to
various resource demands, sometimes from outside the decentralization sector, and did not always
have the political support and leadership necessary to implement the Project efficiently.
Nevertheless, UDF management was essential to accomplish the limited reform advances that
were attained.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Rating: Unsatisfactory

        Overall borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. Commitment in the course of
implementation waivered. With a few exceptions, implementing agencies were not able to
establish a clear and coherent policy framework for decentralization.

8. Lessons Learned

        The timing of the evaluation, with a mission conducted in February 2004, was particularly
favorable for drawing lessons from the implementation of the PSAC I. First, because the
follow-up operation, PSAC II, has also been completed, the two operations may be compared.
Second, various reforms proposed by the PSAC I required a longer term to materialize, which
may not have been recognized as clearly if the evaluation had been carried out within the time
frame established by the OED (six months). To describe the lessons learned, however, it must be
remembered that the PSAC I was a first operation in a medium-term framework, and it was not
intend to solve all the underlying problems of Bolivia's decentralization process.

        The lessons from the PSAC I may be grouped in four areas: (i) objective, content and
approach of the operation; (ii) design and management of the operation; (iii) impact; and (iv)



                                               - 23 -

sustainability.

Objective, Content and Approach:
·       The objectives set by the operation were too ambitious. Making decentralization the main
tool in anti-poverty policies was risky. As shown by more and more experiences in Latin America,
decentralization can increase differences in socioeconomic development among regions.
Additionally, responsiveness at the local level is low and municipal performance (in spite of some
positive exceptions) is limited. Countries must be more realistic about anti-poverty programs at
the local level, at least in the short term.
·       The scope of the operation was too limited by excluding the intermediate level of
government. The departmental level is a key piece, which must be included in a project of this
kind. Reforming only the municipal level limited the potential impact of this programmatic
adjustment program.
·       It would have been better to introduce and strengthen a sectoral logic in the reforms. The
project focused solely on trying to establish a general policy framework. This left out identifying
and attacking the allocation of responsibilities in education, health and other sectors that are the
essence of all decentralization processes. Responsibilities among agencies delivering those
services concurrently should be clarified; and the civil service should be reformed to facilitate the
transfer of personnel from the national level to the departmental and municipal levels. Therefore,
the project fell short in identifying those sensible areas that impede the advancement of
decentralization. Establishing a general framework and "rules of the game" is not enough.

Design and Management of the Operation:
·       A programmatic adjustment operation is not ideally suited for all problems associated
with a decentralization process. It is particularly effective to address fiscal problems and
over-indebtedness. It is less effective when it comes to broad reforms aimed at social
participation, which are generally subject to different timing and dynamics.
·       It is essential to maintain two tranches in adjustment operations. This assists in keeping
the involved participants committed to the reform until the operation is completed.
·       "Basket funding" is a valuable tool in coordinating the actions of donors in the field of
decentralization, but only if this is constrained to a limited number of participating agencies.
"Basket funding" helps to attune the actions of various agencies to common goals. Nonetheless, it
is not a substitute for effective coordination of ongoing activities. Preparation times may also
suffer due to the agreements required in the design phase of the operation. Also, there is a
practical limit to the number of agencies and donors that can be included in a "basket fund".
Management of the policy matrix requires closer attention during the preparation phase, so that
the aim of the reforms remains clear.
·       It is important to maintain a balance between investment resources and unconditioned
resources, and clarify the use of each. The project formally provided budget support to the
government. The allocation of resources after entering the treasury of government, however, was
based on a series of "gentlemen's agreements". A series of reforms of doubtful effectiveness were
thus financed, including the rescheduling of the subnational debt in the amount of nearly US$ 11
million (Table 9). The resources provided under an adjustment credit may be used to relax the
hard budget constraint, shifting the cost of adjustment into the future. It is important to strike a
balance between ear-marked investment resources and unconditioned budget support, as the



                                                 - 24 -

resources made available can be used precisely to finance undesirable actions, even though all
benchmarks and triggers are accomplished.
·       With several successive adjustment operations it is important that the counterpart
institutions remain the same. This lesson was drawn after completing the follow-up operation, the
PSAC II. That operation established a change in the counterpart -- from the Fiscal
Decentralization Unit (UDF) to the Vice-Ministry of Investment and External Finance (VIBFE) --
that considerably affected the continuity of the reform actions. All PSAC II resources were aimed
at budget support.

Impact and Monitoring:
·       Monitoring decentralization and the impact of reforms requires a considerable amount of
time. The monitoring and assessment of this operation suffered significantly due to the lack of
data that could have illustrated the impacts achieved more clearly. Additionally, generating the
proposed monitoring indicators would have implied considerable costs. It is also essential to
establish a baseline when commencing the operation, a requirement which did not exist and has
negatively affected the possibilities for a more accurate evaluation.
·       There are significant secondary impacts not covered by the operation. Some reforms
unleashed a gradual change process that has not yet had visible results, and which cannot be
measured during the effective term of the project. Reforms associated with making the territories
of the indigenous peoples compatible with the political-administrative divisions of the country is a
long-term process.
·       There is still no accepted methodology for evaluating the impact of decentralization.
Future projects must consider that a clear relationship cannot be established among all elements of
decentralization and poverty reduction.

Sustainability:
·       To ensure sustainability it is imperative to study the framework of incentives for
participants in the decentralization process. Upon reviewing the Bolivian experience with this
programmatic adjustment operation, it is not clear who, aside from the donors, the World Bank
and the implementation agency (UDF), has had a real interest in implementing the proposed
reforms. Political mappings are required to reveal the interest of the actors involved before
commencing the operation. It is that commitment that must continue beyond the close of the
operation.

            "COMENTARIOS DE LA UDF A LA EVALUACIÓN DEL PSAC-I"

Descripción del Programa

El Programa PSAC surge como necesidad de retomar la reforma de descentralización, ya que
desde 1993 cuando se formuló la Ley de Participación Popular el tema había perdido vigencia y
compromiso político.




                                                 - 25 -

El PSAC-I surge basado en los siguientes 3 componentes:

ü       Componente Político: Reflejado en la necesidad de definición de roles y competencias en
los tres niveles de gobierno.

ü       Componente Fiscal: Referido al manejo y distribución de recursos en los tres niveles de
Gobierno.

ü       Componente Funcional: Que demanda una Reforma institucional, que asegure que los tres
niveles de Gobierno, estén capacitados para ejercer sus facultades como actores del proceso de
descentralización.

        El PSAC-I fue un crédito de ajuste estructural de apoyo a las reformas y profundización
del proceso de descentralización en Bolivia; compuesto con recursos de la operación IDA
3507-BO y del convenio TF-028328 con la cooperación bilateral.

        El PSAC ha sido y continúa siendo ejecutado directamente por entidades públicas
beneficiarias, mediante convenio y bajo la coordinación de la Unidad de Descentralización Fiscal
(UDF), que se constituye en la unidad ejecutora y de monitoreo del proceso de reforma y ha sido
la encargada de verificar el cumplimiento de las metas.

        Los recursos del programa provinieron del contrato de préstamo IDA 3507-BO; crédito
por aproximadamente 60 millones de Dólares USA y del Convenio TF-028328; transferencia no
reembolsable por aproximadamente 20 millones de Dólares USA de la Cooperación Bilateral del
Reino Unido, Holanda, Suecia y Dinamarca. El Programa estuvo ligado además a programas
financiados por el BID, Alemania, Dinamarca, USAID y la CAF bajo convenios específicos.

        El PSAC como programa de ajuste estructural ligado a un proceso de reforma tan
complejo y dimensional como la descentralización, es un fenómeno único. Su particularidad se
inscribe en la innovadora, y en algunos casos, inédita forma de generación de políticas públicas,
que como parte del proceso de reformas estructurales, modernización y democratización del
estado, se han venido implantando en Bolivia en las dos últimas décadas con el apoyo de la
Cooperación Internacional.

Evaluación de sus objetivos.-

        De acuerdo al Convenio de Crédito, el avance del programa estaba sujeto a determinados
resultados por gestión, los mismos que permitirían medir el avance en el proceso de
descentralización. El cumplimiento de compromisos y resultados por gestión se constituyó a su
vez en condición de los desembolsos del Crédito. Al cierre del programa PSAC-I, el Gobierno de
Bolivia ha cumplido con todos los compromisos asumidos y se han desembolsado la totalidad de
recursos, tanto de la operación con IDA como de los comprometidos por la cooperación bilateral.

        El Programa apuntó a la adaptación del marco institucional y profundización de las
reformas que permitan incrementar la eficiencia, transparencia y responsabilidad del gobierno para



                                               - 26 -

una adecuada prestación de servicios públicos, que contribuya de esta manera en la
implementación de la Estrategia Boliviana de Reducción de la Pobreza (EBRP). En este marco se
fijaron cinco objetivos referidos a:         (i) implementar regulaciones y marcos de trabajo
institucionales para descentralización; (ii) incrementar la participación de la comunidad
particularmente pobre y grupos excluidos como ser de mujeres y grupos indígenas en la gestión
municipal y el control de recursos; (iii) restaurar la disciplina fiscal; (iv) la consolidación financiera
y la capacidad institucional en todos los niveles del Gobierno para mantener el funcionamiento de
los servicios públicos; e (v) implementar la disponibilidad de créditos financieros para inversiones
municipales.

        Por otra parte, la complejidad del proceso de descentralización le impide ejecutarse por
decreto, por lo que consideramos que la principal dificultad para su aplicación es de orden
"cultural" antes que "administrativa". En el caso boliviano en particular con su profunda crisis
social y la lucha reivindicatoria de grupos mayoritarios, este tema es fundamental para
comprender los atrasos y dificultades de la aplicación del proceso. Lograr la voluntad y decisión
política de gobernantes y gobernados es condición primordial para trabajar con éxito en la
profundización de la reforma de descentralización en Bolivia.

Evaluación de resultados y de impacto.-

        De manera general, es importante destacar que el PSAC-I se constituyó en el marco
referente para el proceso de descentralización del País, en ausencia de una estrategia consensuada
con todos los actores involucrados, debido principalmente a la falta de continuidad institucional
de la instancia gubernamental cabeza del sector, llamada Ministerio Sin Cartera de Participación
Popular.

En cuanto al avance logrado en los tres componentes con los que se inició el PSAC se puede
mencionar:

l Ley de Roles y Competencias. Una ley de roles y competencias era y es crucial para retomar
    el proceso de descentralización en Bolivia, porque es el instrumento que sienta las bases del
    cambio y delimita el accionar en los tres niveles de gobierno. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha esta
    ley no ha sido concertada, aprobada ni promulgada, el proyecto de ley continúa sin
    apropiamiento político.

    En el proceso de ejecución del Crédito, si bien la Ley del Diálogo Nacional se consideró como
    cumplimiento en este tema, no puede ser considerada como suficiente para responder a la
    verdadera necesidad de una ley.

l Manejo y distribución de recursos. En el tema de recursos se tuvo un avance importante con
    la Política Nacional de Compensación, que permitió encarar el tema de la distribución desde
    una óptica de equidad en lugar de una de igualdad.

    El tema de eficiencia en el manejo y distribución de recursos es un tema que queda pendiente,
    debiendo considerarse la definición de una Ley de Responsabilidad Administrativa a nivel



                                                 - 27 -

    prefectural y municipal, una Política de Crédito Subnacional y, entre otras, una Política de
    Recaudaciones.

l Reforma institucional. En este tema los avances fueron pocos, sin embargo se logró introducir
    "la institucionalidad" en el gobierno central, como un aspecto de discusión y análisis, que
    necesariamente debe ser replicado en el nivel subnacional.

    Queda pendiente la tarea de construcción de una cultura política de gobernantes y gobernados
    que cambie la visión de la prestación de servicios, la política y la relación estado-sociedad.
    Esto implica necesariamente llevar adelante procesos de institucionalidad en todos los niveles,
    la definición del funcionamiento de los partidos políticos y el levantar el obstáculo cultural al
    proceso.

        En el marco de estos tres componentes puede afirmarse que el proceso de
descentralización boliviano no ha sido efectivo porque no se ha logrado llevar adelante los tres
aspectos simultáneamente. Siendo el proceso esencialmente político, porque afecta relaciones y
cuotas de poder en los diferentes niveles de gobierno, si no hay uno de los tres componentes
señalados, siempre será un proceso incompleto y finalmente limitado.

        El impacto y los resultados esperados del Programa se deberían haber logrado en el marco
de un norte estratégico sobre el proceso de descentralización. Sin embargo, tanto la debilidad
institucional del sector público, la coincidencia del inicio de ejecución del Programa con el cambio
de Gobierno y la falta de visiones estratégicas sectoriales en los actores públicos fundamentales,
han debilitado el impacto global del Programa. A pesar de ello se alcanzaron importantes logros
específicos entre los que podemos destacar:

ü       El freno del endeudamiento acelerado de municipios medianos y grandes en todo el país.

ü       La introducción del concepto de disciplina fiscal buscando incrementar las
responsabilidades sobre el manejo de los recursos, en el Gobierno Central. Esperando que esta
experiencia sea replicada en los niveles de gobierno subnacional.

ü       El incremento de la participación de la mujer y el desarrollo de instrumentos de
organización, como Mancomunidades Municipales, Asociaciones Municipales y la participación e
inclusión de la comunidad indígena en la toma de decisiones Municipal.

ü       El fortalecimiento de las capacidades institucionales y técnicas del gobierno central en el
diseño de programas y políticas y en el cumplimiento de sus roles normativos. Esto ha posibilitado
que en el proceso de ejecución se realicen los ajustes necesarios como emergencia del cambio de
gobierno y de acuerdo a aspectos coyunturales que exigían adecuación, siempre en el marco de
los objetivos del PSAC.

En el ámbito subnacional no hubo cambios significativos, pero el Gobierno de Bolivia continúa
trabajando en este campo, ya que reconoce la importancia de su fortalecimiento como principal
desafío para dar continuidad al proceso de descentralización.          En este afán el gobierno ha

ü       El primero, D.S. No. 27431, referido al fortalecimiento de los consejos departamentales
como un instrumento político para lograr un trabajo conjunto con el prefecto, asignándoles
capacidad de fiscalización y decisión., en un marco de independencia total.

ü       El segundo, D.S. No. 27457, referido a la Gestión Prefectural que pretende desarrollar
niveles de responsabilidad sobre la base de criterios de eficiencia, transparencia y austeridad. Se
proponen modelos de gestión que consideran políticas de planificación, resolución de conflictos y
desconcentración. Este decreto se manifiesta en la necesidad de poder contar con una estructura
organizacional ágil y dinámica que pueda adaptarse a las diferentes necesidades y perspectivas de
los distintos departamentos del país.

Evaluación de los supuestos y los riesgos.-

        En el proceso de ejecución y luego de dos años de vigencia podemos concluir que el
diseño del Programa parece haber sido ambicioso, en una coyuntura altamente compleja. Se han
considerado      todas la    dimensiones   del   proceso     descentralizador (relaciones   fiscales
intergubernamentales, sistemas de control y rendición de cuentas, participación ciudadana,
fortalecimiento de capacidades locales, etc.), y en este sentido es destacable su integralidad y
coherencia. Sin embargo, este diseño exige un alto involucramiento de las autoridades de
gobierno, un liderazgo de política que se traduzca en la existencia de un norte estratégico y la
constitución de un mecanismo de decisión política estable. Aspectos últimos ausentes en la
ejecución del PSAC.

        Una evaluación general de la ejecución del Programa y del avance de los Subprogramas
respecto a los Planes de Trabajo inicialmente presentados y aprobados, muestra retrasos que son
atribuibles principalmente a los aspectos críticos ya identificados en el documento de convenio del
Crédito IDA 3507-BO: i) Falta de capacidad institucional del Gobierno para implementar la
agenda de reformas, ii) Deterioro de la situación económica como resultado de la inestabilidad
política, y iii) Cambio de administración resultante de las elecciones generales de 2002, situación
agravada con el inesperado cambio de gobierno en Octubre de 2003, producto de las revueltas
sociales. Por lo tanto, los riesgos fueron bien definidos en el programa

Desempeño del Prestatario y lecciones aprendidas.-

        Las condiciones y compromisos fijados para el desembolso de los recursos del Programa
han sido cumplidos íntegramente por el Gobierno de Bolivia. Los indicadores definidos eran tan
amplios y generales que no requerían avances específicos en los distintos temas.

        En cuanto a su Unidad Ejecutora es importante destacar: i) que el mandato limitado de la
UDF, unido a la falta de un liderazgo de política sobre descentralización, ha debilitado las
posibilidades de alcanzar de manera más exitosa los resultados esperados, y ii) el hecho de que
tenga dependencia del Ministerio de Hacienda, ha derivado en que el Programa se lo conceptúe en
muchas oportunidades como un instrumento de soporte presupuestario más que como un

programa de apoyo a la reforma de descentralización.

        En relación a las Unidades Co-ejecutoras, su debilidad institucional impidió la
presentación de Propuestas que contribuyan significativamente a los objetivos del PSAC y
determinó una ejecución que, en muchos casos, suplía sus actividades de línea.

Existen importantes lecciones aprendidas del PSAC-I a ser enunciadas:

ü       Es necesario establecer indicadores de medición de impacto y desempeño más específicos
y precisos, que definan un norte para los involucrados y permitan determinar el grado de
cumplimiento de los objetivos.

ü       Debería asegurarse que el inicio y ejecución del Programa coincidan con una gestión de
gobierno para impedir el cambio de visión y prioridades y asegurar la voluntad y decisión política.


ü       Un Programa de estas características debe concebirse dentro de un modelo de desarrollo
capaz de crear las condiciones para generar el crecimiento económico y no como un instrumento
de "Lucha contra la Pobreza". Esta visión se constituyó para el PSAC en una limitación, porque
se atacaron los temas fiscales acuciantes en la economía nacional de ese momento, acompañados
de propuestas en el orden social, como los instrumentos principales de reactivación del proceso de
descentralización y de lucha contra la pobreza, pero estos fueron insuficientes para al crecimiento
económico. Era necesario concebir el proceso no como "un manejo de la pobreza", sino más bien
con un enfoque capaz de "crear las condiciones para generar el crecimiento".

ü       El gozar de mayor autonomía en su ejecución, le permitió al Gobierno llevar adelante
políticas públicas y realizar los cambios estratégicos necesarios en el proceso de descentralización.
Sin embargo estos dos temas impusieron también más exigencias a los actores, no solamente en
términos de coordinación, sino también en el diseño y sostenimiento de instrumentos de definición
de políticas con alto rango de jerarquía en el Gobierno y el establecimiento de unidades ejecutoras
con independencia técnica.       Estas exigencias fueron una experiencia valiosa para todos los
involucrados.

ü       En cuanto al PSAC como instrumento, es importante destacar que Bolivia ha sido uno de
los pioneros en el uso de este tipo de Programas de Ajuste Estructural para la Descentralización.
La característica que le dio mayor valor innovativo al Programa fue la estructura y el diseño de un
basket fund que funcionó en base a un pool de fondos de diversos donantes. El Gobierno de
Bolivia considera que el basket fund ha demostrado ser eficiente, considerando que el proceso de
descentralización de los últimos años ha operado en un contexto político de alta complejidad
donde los riesgos han sido más altos de los previstos.

ü       El PSAC por ser un programa de recursos de libre disponibilidad permitió, posterior a la
ejecución del PSAC I, adecuar la ejecución de sus recursos a las nuevas condiciones de un país,
en el cual los problemas sociales habían derivado en el debilitamiento de la democracia, y las
prioridades económicas se centraban más bien en el financiamiento del déficit fiscal, antes que en



                                                - 30 -

la profundización de reformas estructurales.

Desempeño del Banco y los Donantes.-

        El PSAC exigió en su concepción, el desarrollo de una acción sinérgica entre los
cooperantes bilaterales y multilaterales y las entidades del sector público, mediante la cual se
incorporaron programas y proyectos específicos en el marco de políticas públicas y estrategias de
gobierno de carácter más global y sostenible.

        Asimismo en su ejecución, los cooperantes acompañaron y siguieron el proceso,
participando en grupos de trabajo para la evaluación del avance de los issues. Esta accionar
continuó incluso para la preparación del PSAC II. Sin embargo, el cambio de responsables del
Programa en el Banco y la rotación de personal en los donantes ha debilitado el seguimiento y la
evaluación de los resultados.

        Es destacable el apoyo que ha recibido el gobierno boliviano de los cooperantes, en los
mayores momentos de crisis social durante el año 2003. En esos momentos en los que la
estabilidad democrática del país estaba en juego y se cambiaron las prioridades nacionales en
términos de reformas por una respuesta a las demandas sociales, la cooperación apoyó al gobierno
en sus nuevas políticas y no obstaculizó el uso de recursos en el financiamiento del déficit fiscal.


Recomendaciones para operaciones futuras y visión para continuar con el proceso de
descentralización

        Si bien el proceso de descentralización boliviano es incompleto, se ratifica y manifiesta la
decisión firme del Gobierno de profundizarlo porque es una de las mejores opciones para el
desarrollo del país a largo plazo, en este sentido se debe hacer hincapié en los siguientes puntos:

ü       Aunque parezca paradójico, el gobierno y el PSAC, como instrumento de profundización
de la reforma, deben dejar de conceptuar la visión del proceso de descentralización desde un
punto de vista aún centralista. Se hace imperioso generar un proceso de descentralización que
parta desde los sectores, siendo ellos los conocedores de sus demandas y necesidades y por ende
artífices de los cambios requeridos, deben ser los principales convencidos de la necesidad de la
reforma para alcanzar mayores niveles de inversión y menor gasto Municipal

ü       Se debe apuntar a desarrollar capacidades de gestión en los Municipios, traducida en
consejos de vigilancia cuyo papel fiscalizador responda al voto y a la legitimidad que le de la
ciudadanía a quien hace el proceso de vigilancia.

ü       En el ámbito prefectural se plantea la creación de Gobiernos Prefecturales autónomos,
para ello el presidente ya propuso la modificación de los artículos 109 y 110 de la Constitución
Política del estado, en la Asamblea Constituyente para poder hacer efectiva la demanda de una
elección directa del prefecto así como la elección directa de los Consejos departamentales.




                                                 - 31 -

ü       Es necesario asegurar la administración del programa mediante la misma Unidad Ejecutora
(UDF), ya que esta última cuenta con la estructura organizativa, Sistemas de Monitoreo y
seguimiento desarrollados, experiencia y capacidades necesarias para asegurar la continuidad del
cumplimiento de los objetivos del PSAC I y II, en sus próximas fases.

ü       Finalmente consideramos que sería conveniente incluir en este tipo de Programas de libre
disponibilidad, un componente de inversión dedicado a financiar actividades de apoyo e impacto
directo a la descentralización, distinguiendo entre resultados esperados sin consecuencia de gastos
y resultados esperados que estén sujetos a proyectos específicos que demanden programas
específicos de gasto. Esto permitiría asegurar el cumplimiento de los resultados previstos.
