Second,\n            various reforms proposed by PSAC I required a longer term to\n            materialize, which may not have been recognized as clearly\n            if the evaluation had been carried out within the time frame\n            established by the OED (six months). While analyzing the\n            lessons learned, however, it must be remembered that the\n            PSAC I was a first operation in a medium-term framework, and\n            it was not intended to solve all the underlying problems of\n            Bolivia's decentralization process. The lessons from\n            the PSAC I may be grouped in four areas: (1) objective,\n            content and approach of the operation; (2) design and\n            management of the operation; (3) impact; and (4)\n            sustainability. They include: setting overly ambitious\n            objectives; limiting project scope too narrowly and\n            neglecting to include the intermediate government level;\n            needing to remove impediments to decentralization by\n            reforming civil service and clarifying responsibilities\n            among agencies delivering services recognizing that two\n            tranches in adjustment operations should be maintained;\n            realizing basket funding is not a substitute for effective\n            coordination of ongoing activities; maintaining a balance\n            between investment resources and unconditioned resources,\n            and clarifying the use of each; continuing the participation\n            of the same counterpart institutions; need to acquire data\n            to assess impacts more clearly, particularly need to set a\n            baseline at the beginning of the operation; recognizing that\n            significant secondary impacts are not covered by the\n            operation; recognizing that there exists no acceptable\n            methodology for evaluating the impact of decentralization;\n            and ensuring sustainability by studying the framework of\n            incentives for participants in the decentralization process."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
