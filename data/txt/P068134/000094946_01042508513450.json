The comprehensive\n            decentralization reform program, already underway, aims to\n            adapt the existing institutional framework for improved\n            decentralized public service delivery, and governance to\n            implement the Government's poverty reduction strategy.\n            Specifically, the program will support the Government's\n            efforts in improving the delivery of public services to the\n            poor, through increased efficiency, transparency, and\n            accountability of Bolivia's decentralized government\n            system, and through improved capacity within the\n            decentralized government system for delivery of these\n            services. The reform program will improve regulatory, and\n            institutional framework for decentralization; enhance\n            community participation, particularly the poor, indigenous\n            populations, and women; restore fiscal discipline;\n            strengthen the government's financial, and\n            institutional capacity to support delivery of public\n            services; and, improve availability of credit financing for\n            municipal investments. However, associated risks include the\n            inherent lack of institutional capacity in a reform process\n            already underway; socioeconomic deterioration due to\n            political instability; and, potential lack of commitment to\n            reform of the upcoming new administration in 2002."}, "docdt": "2001-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
