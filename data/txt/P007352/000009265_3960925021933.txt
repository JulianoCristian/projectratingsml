GUAYAPE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Ln. 1576-HO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Completion Report on the Guayape Regional Development
Project in Honduras (loan 1576-HO), for which a loan of US$10.5 million was
approved tn May 1978. The legal documents were signed on June 16, 1978 and
the project became effective on December 18, 1978. The original Closing Date
for the loan was April 30, 1983. Two extensions were granted, and the final
Closing Date was December 31, 1984. An amount of US$177,459.29 was cancelled
effective on Septertber 19, 1985.
The project is the fourth agricultural project financed by the Bank
in Honduras.  The three previous prtjects were:  The Livestock Development
Project (Credit 179-HO), financed by a 1970 credit of US$2.6 million, was
completed in January 1975; the Second Livestock Development Project
(Credit 434-HO), financed by a 1973 credit of US$6.6 million, was completed
in December 1979; and the Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 628-vl),
financed by a 1976 credit of US$14.0 million, was completed in June 1983.
Those projects focused on country-wide credit for medium- and long-scale
farms while the emphasis of this fourth project was on credit and support
services for small farms in the Guayape Valley.
This report was prepared by Agriculture Division A of the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of country visits in
May 1984 and and September 1985 and a Completion Report prepared by the
Agricultural Directorate for the North East Region (DARNO) of the Honduran
Ministry of Natural Resources (MRN) delivered to the Bank on October 2, 1985.
Other sources of information for the Completion Report were: the Appraisal
Report No. 1953-HO dated May 5, 1978; the Project Loan Agreement No. 1576-HO
dated June 16, 1978; supervision reports; correspondence with Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda, as contained in relevant Bank files.
Following a review by OED, it was decided not to audit the project,
and the PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments on April 17, 1986.
Comments received have been attached to the report.

HONDURAS
GUAYAPE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. EVALUATION SUIMARY
Introduction and Objectives
1.        This project was the fourth agricultural project financed by the
Bank in Honduras. The project included agricultural credit and production
support in the form of agricultural machinery, feeder roads, extension and
research services (para. 2.04). The objectives of the project were to:
(a) improve incomes of individual small-farmers and agrarian reform groups;
and (b) accelerate growth of agricultural production (para. 2.03).
Implementation Experience
2.        Despite the fact that the project started slowly and faced major
political, financial and managerial problems from its inception, it is
considered successful because of its significant contribution to the
improvement of production, particularly basic grains. Financially, the
project suffered from insufficient counterpart funds. Main managerial
problems were delays in organizing the Project Unit, delays in recruitment of
key staff, heavy staff turnover, and procurement delays. Gradually, a great
number of bottlenecks were overcome. Extension, credit and marketing systems
are now in place (para. 7.01).
Results
3.        A key objective of the project was to support the small-farms
subsector and improve farm incomes for lower income groups. This objective
has been attained since all the subloans were made to individual
small-farmers and agrarian reform groups considered to be among the poorest.
Despite    about two years of delay in completing the project, actual
spending under the project (computed in US dollar equivalent) is a little
less than the appraisal estimate; the lower than anticipated counterpart
funds contributed to this (para. 7.01). At year three of development the
project reached almost three times the production of maize envisaged at
appraisal to be reached for year nine (para. 6.01). The yield of maize at
year three      reached the level envisaged for year four (para. 6.03).  The
project's re-estimated economic rate of return was about 17% compared with
the appraisal estimate of 21%. Average net farm income of beneficiary
households at full development is estimated to be about twice the level that
would prevail in the without-project situation (para. 6.04).



-v-
Sustainability
4.        The prospects for sustainability of benefits from the project's
infestments do not appear so good. Credit activities are expected to
continue utilizing the recovery of project credit funds and other credit
funds furnished by an on-going IDB-assisted project for basic grains. The
marketing system could also continue under this arrangements. Feeder roads
maintenance and the provision of extension and research services will suftier
considerab3e delays depending almost entirely from public funds. The Bank
has appraised the second stage of the Guayape Project but has no immediate
plans to negotiate the loan (which has the same level of Bank-funds as this
one) at this time.
lindings and Lessons
5.        The main lessons to be learned are that:  (a) DARNO provad to be an
appropriate agency for implementing the overall coordination function;
(b) provision of credit in the form of a trust fund, where the Government and
not BANADESA (the public bank) assumed the credit risk, proved also to be
appropriate because small farmers usually do not have titles to their land or
other astets suitable to guarantee regular bank loans; (c) the project's
informal marketing program, not anticipated at appraisal, proved also to be a
good tool to assist project beneficiaries to sell their grains and to obtain
better farmgate orices. It also helped to obtain better subloan recovery
rates; (d) the team of consultants hired under the project proved essential
to its success; (e) despite the successful implementation of the irrigation
infrastructure of the credit component, additional gravity irrigation, and
particularly irrigation by pumping of underground water, cannot be
economically justified on the basis of basic grains production at present
prices. For irrigation to be economically viable, a large degree of
diversification into higher-value products such as fruits and vegetables
would have to be achieved in the irrigated areas. Further studies would be
needed to assess the technical, financial and economic feasibility of such
diversification; and (f) the Bank appears to have been too flexible
concerning submission of audit reports.

GUAYAPE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT ODMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01.     At project appraisal in October 1977, Honduras' GNP per capita was
about US$390, one of the lowest in the Western Hemisphere. The agricultural
sector was the most important sector in the economy. It accounted for about
one-third of GDP, provided employment for approximately two-thirds of the
economically active population, and generated close to 80% of export
earnings.  Bananas, coffee, timber, sugar, and beef were the principal
sources of foreign exchange, and wheat, maize, fats, oils, and milk products
were the principal food imports. The total population was estimated at about
3.2 million, and the rural population numbered 2.1 million. About 70% of the
rural population received less than US$111 per annum and therefore fell
within the poverty target group as defined by the Bank. The Government's
agricultural development strategy was to improve the agricultural incomes of
lower income groups, and to accelerate agricultural production and export
growth by financing projects which expanded agricultural production and
productivity through increased availability of credit and improved research
and extension services. The project was designed to support this strategy.
1.02      Over the past eight years, no dramatiZ changes have occurred in the
structure of the economy: agriculture still is the most important sector in
the economy accounting fir about 30% of GDP; the sector's share of total
exports and labor force is 77% and 54% respectively. Bananas, coffee, timber
and beef continue to be the major sources of agricultural exports; and food
imports account for about 10% of total imports. The population is now about
4.4 million, and the most recent Bank estimate of GNP per capita is
US$670 (1983). The country is now going through severe economic
difficulties. As in the rest of the economy, the rate of growth of
agricultuLal production has declined in recent years, although the sector has
performed better than She economy as a whole. The Government is now giving
high priority to projects that would improve the balance of trade,
particularly those that would increase and diversify agricultural exports.
The Bank 's helping to support this strategy and has financed, subsequent to
this project, two credit projects: first, the Second Agricultural Credit
(Cr. 1005-HO/Ln. 1833-HO) signed in April 1980, and completed in June 1985;
and second, the ongoing Third Agricultural Credit (Ln. 2284-HO), signed in
S,ptember 1983, and expected to be completed by June 1987.

2.01      The project was identified in September 1973 by a FAO/CP mission
and preparation was completed by another FAO/CP mission in August 1977. It
was appraised by the Bank during October 1977.
B. Negotiations and Board Approval
2.02      Loan negotiations took place in Washington D.C., during the period
April 18 to 21, 1978. The Loan was approved by the Board, without
discussion, on May 23, 1978.
C. Project Objectives and Components
2.03      Objectives.  The objectives of the project were to: (a) improve
incomes of individual small-farmers (i.e those with 3.5 to 20 ha) and
agrarian reform groups; and (b) accelerate growth of agricultural
production.
2.04      Components.  The project included: (a) short- and medium-term
agricultural credit (accounting for about 56% of total project cost);
(b) production support in the form of an agricultural machinery and
equipment pool (4X), construction of an addition to the agricultural research
station at Catacamas (1x), and construction and maintenance of feeder roads
(8%); (c) technical assistance for the project unit and the preparation of
studies related to the Aguan Valley (11%); and (d) strengthening of extension
services in the project area, operation of the Catacawas research station,
and project administration expenses (20%).
D. Project Cost and Financing
2.05      At appraisal, total project cost was estimated at US$14.6 million,
of which the Bank was to contribute US$10.5 million (72%) to cover the
foreign exchange costs estimated at US$7.6 million (52%) and US$2.9 million
(20%) of local currency costs. The Government was to contribute
US$3.8 million (26%); and farmers the remaining US$0.3 million (2%).
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Introduction.  This chapter compares actual performance with the
targets e tablished at appraisal, ine:luding an analysis of implementation of
the different components (credit, production support, iechni4al assistance
and project extension and administration), assessment of project cost,
disbursements, procurement, reporting and auditing, and compliance with loan
covenants. Annex 1 presents a table of key performance indicators.



A. Implementation Schedule
3.02      Effectiveness.  The Loan became effective ott December 18, 1978,
seven months after it was approved by the Board. Six more months were
needed, to set up the organizational structure of the project unit and to
establish the Project Account. The credit component was especially affected
by the delay, and lending operatio.ns started only by September 1979, thus
missing the main growing season of that year. / Considering the relatively
straightforward nature of this project, it would appear that the amount of
time necessary to get it underway was unduly long.
3.03      Implementation Period.  According to appraisal projections, the
project was expected to be completed by October 31, 1982 and the Closing
Date to be April 30, 1983. Completion was delayed by about twenty months due
mainly to a shortage of counterpart funds. Additionally, project implementa-
tion was delayed in the early years of the project because of organizational
and managerial problems.
B. Implementation of Project Components
3.04      Agricultural Credit.  The project was to finance investments and
incremental working capital for independent small-farmers (1,200) and farmer
groups (70). Out of the 70 farmer groups, 16 were to receive credit to cover
investment costs related to irrigation works (both on-farm and off-farm).
The project financed a total of 1,240 independent farmers and 51 farmer
groups (including 17 small-irrigation sphemes), almost as expected at apprai-
sal. The smaller number of farmer groups financed under the project was due
to INA's lack of resources to organize the farmer groups.
3.05      For the entire project period about US$1.3 million (13%) of the va-
lue of subloans were granted to finance investments and about US$8.7 million
(87%) to finance operating inputs. This contrasted with the appraisal report
assumptions that 71% of the value of subloans would finance investments and
29% operating inputs. The reasons for these divergences were: (i) small far-
mers, such as those in this project, may be less willing to incur long-term
debts than expected at appraisal; (ii) the project extended to a lesser
extent than envisaged at appraisal into areas requiring land clearance and
levelling, which was an important item of fixed invertments in the appraisal
projections; and (iii) the diversification into soybean, cotton and sorghum
envisaged at appraisal, which would have required the use oi more capital-
intensive farming technologies, did not take place.
3.06        The implementation of the credit component was successful be-
cause: (a) the Agricultural Directorate for the North East Region of the
Ministry of Natural Resources (DARNO) filled the gap left by the National
Development Bank (BANADESA). -which did not assign local office personnel in
the numbers and qulality that were nseded to fulfill the roll of financial in-
termediary; it functioned instead as a mere credit window; / (b) one inter-
nationally recruited credit consultant was retained until March 1985 to orga-
nize the supervised credit service and to train project staff; and (c) the
project established an informal marketing system, not anticipated at apprai-
sal, to assist project beaeficiaries to market their output of basic grains.
1/   See Attachment I, BANADESA comments to this paragraph.

3.07      The functioning of the marketing system was assisted by farmers and
animal-feed companies entering into future purchase agreements. DARNO staff
facilitated these actions. Under these agreements, the animal-feed companies
acquired part of the project's production, and, since they did not have
enough capital to pay cash for the purchases, the project provided short-term
credit at commercial interest rates to facilitate the transactions. This
did not affect the availability of credit funds for production purposes,
because marketing subloans were granted for short periods (3-6 months),
between the end of the first crop season and the beginning of the subsequent
year's first crop season, when there was excess liquidity in the project
trust fund. Marketing credit was introduced in 1981 with an amount disbursed
of about US$0.6 million. In the subsequent years, this figure gradually
increased to US$4.7 million In 1984.
3.08      As was stated above, the project was expected to finance under the
credit component small gravity irrigation schemes to serve about 1,200 ha.
By the end of the agricultural year 1984/85, project staff had completed the
design of 23 schemes out of which 17 had already been built to serve about
400 ha at a cost of US$0.6 million financed by project long-term subloans to
farmer groups. Taking into account the limited experience with irrigation
in the country, the results so far obtained are fairly satisfactory. The
main reasons for these successful results are: (a) DARNO organized an
irrigation department with an internationally recruited irrigation specialist
who was retained until March 1985; (b) local technical staff were trained
on-the-job; and (c) the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
helped to assess the availability of gravitj irrigation and assisted in the
training of local technicians.
3.09      Sub-loan recovery performance under the project has been relatively
good. The accumulated arrears rate for productive credit principal at the
end of August 1984 was 19.4X calculated as the ratio of accumulated amounts
in arrears as of that date (US$1,241,000) over the difference between
accumulated disbursements (US$7,048,000) and amounts disbursed but not yet
due for repayment (US$655,000), (see Annex 1). For comparison, the
accumulated principal arrears rate for BANADESA's overall portfolio has been
about 40-50 in recent years. The reasons for the better recovery
performance under the project have been: (a) better selection and supervision
of beneficiaries than is generally the case in Honduras in credit operations
for small-farmers; and (b) the withholding by the project unit of payments
due through the mechanism of the marketing assistance component.
3.10      Extension Service.  This component is closely linked to the
project's research and supervised credit components.  The MRN's Project Unit
for project implementation, was integrated into DARNO in February 1983. The
project provided salaries and allowances for local staff, utilities, vehicles
and equipment, operating costs and training to the extensionists. However,
the recruitment of the extensionists was done with some difficulty because of
the yearly contracts that took several months to renew. In those months
without a contract, the extensionists did not receive salaries. For this
reason, the project suffered heavy staff turnover, but eventually a stable,
core project team emerged and has been retained until now. One



- 5 -
internationally recruited consultant was retained until March 1985 as an
adviser to the Project Director and to train the extensionists to carry out
the project's extension work. Currently, a simple technology transfer
program for rainfed grain crops is in effect.
3.11      The average proportion of farmers to extensionists has increased
yearly from about 9 to 1 in the first year to 45 to 1 during the 1983/84
agricultural year as shown below:
Agricultural Years ---

Extensionists
a/   For the purposes of this table, each beneficiary farmer group has been
counted as one beneficiary.
This proportion of farmers to extensionists, though very low, can be regarded
as acceptable at least in the short-term, taking into account that project
beneficiaries were, to a great extent, subsistence farmers.
3.12      Under the project, it was expected that the National Agrarian
Institute (INA) would organize 70 farmers' groups. However, INA lacked the
necessary resources to carry out this task, and additional resources were not
provided under the project. The project extension service partially filled
the gap, with some assistance from INA, and by 1983/84 there were about
60 organized farmers' groups in the project area (of which 51 were project
beneficiaries). Overall, the project extension service is gradually
improving its performance and, in spite of its relatively inexperienced
staff, is now working reasonable well.
3.13      Research Service.  The project provided complementary funds to the
Catacamas Research Station to finance construction of facilities, and to
purchase equipment and hire additional staff so that DARNO could carry out an
effective production-oriented research program. The project retained an
internationally recruited consultant until March 1985 to direct the basic
grains research and train the project extensionists. Applied research on
maize, beans and rice is being conducted both at the Catacamas Research



- 6 -
Station (15%) and on farmers' fields (85%). For maize and beans, researchers
have been successful in technology transfer, particularly by using trials on
farmers fields which involves the farmer directly. Training of extensionists
has also been adequately carried out under the research program.
3.14      Machinery Pool Equipment.  The project financed the purchase of
heavy equipment to support PROMECA's machinery pool unit to ensure that
farmers in the project area would have access to heavy machinery services.
In spite of the fact that the project machinery and equipment have not been
adequately maintained, that spare parts were lacking, and that the workshop
staff has not been adequately trained, the contribution of PROMECA's
machinery services was important in the early stages of the project, when
private machinery contractors in the area were not present in sufficient
numbers. PROMECA's equipment also enabled DARNO to carry out the small-scale
irrigation schemes in the project area. Starting in 1984, PROMECA's services
improved. Rowever, lack of funds has been its main problem.
3.15      Feeder Roads.  The project was to finance the construction and
maintenance of about 35 km of all-weather roads by SECOPT force account as
well as the purchase of equipment for road maintenance work in the project
area. By the end of 1980, almost twice as many kilometers (65) had been
built or improved as compared to appraisal projections. This had been
possible because of the considerably lower-than-expected road construction
costs resulting partly from lowered standards. Moreover, there was no
maintenance of project area roads in spite of the fact that in July 1982 the
MRN transferred to SECOPT the road maintenance equipment procured under the
project in order to permit SECOPT to carry out the maintenance. SECOPT's
stated reasons for not maintaining the roads were that the equipment was in
bad shape by the time they received it (because it had been diverted to other
uses in the interim), and that counterpart funds were not available.2/
C. Cost Estimate
3.16      The total cost of the project at completion is estimated at about
US$13.6 million equivalent compared to an appraisal estimate of
US$14.6 million. Except for the credit, equipment and vehicles and technical
assistance categories where the actual cost is virtually the same, the actual
costs of the other categories are lower than appraisal estimates as shown
belcw. The lower cost of the civil works component was because the project
unit did not build the PU's headquarters building at Juticalpa, mainly
because of lack of counterpart funds. The lower cost of the administration
component was because fewer resources were provided for extension, research
and general administrative support than envisaged at appraisal.

a/   Excluding the wunallocated' category.
3.18      Up to the end of FY79, only US$0.9 million of the loan (9%) had
been disbursed. At the end of FY83, US$7.2 million (69%) had been disbursed
(the original closing date was 04/30/83) and it took almost two more years to
disburse the remaining 30% of the loan. The slow pace of disbursement during
the whole life of the project was mainly caused by lack of sufficient
counterpart funds.
B. Procurement
3.19      Procurement of equipment and vehicles took more time than
anticipated. In one case the Proveeduria General (National Procurement
Office) delayed a large bid for over six months because of its reluctance to
comply with the Bank's procurement guidelines regarding the incorporation in



the bidding documents of technical specifications prepared by the project
unit and approved by the Bank. In other cases, award and signing of
contracts were slow. Delays were also experienced in the processing of
letters of credit. Selection and appointment of the consulting firm for the
technical assistance component of the project took about one year. However,
goods financed under the subloans were procured directly by the beneficiaries
and no serious problems were encountered. The project staff helped to
establish in the project area a fairly efficient system of marketing of
inputs run by independent merchants.
F. Reporting
3.20      The initial Project Unit, and later DARNO, were to submit quarterly
progress reports. These reports were always delivered to the Bank with a
three to six months delay. Although not envisaged at appraisal, the
conr.,u tant team providing technical assistance to the project staff also
produced annual progress reports for the first four years of implementation.
However, since quarterly reports were largely prepared by the consultant
team, the consultant team's reports did not add much to the quarterly
progress reports. In general, reporting of progress in project
implementation was satisfactory. A separate project Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit had been envisaged at appraisal. However, in practice these
functions were performed by DARNO's credit department under the guidance of
the credit consultant.
G. Auditing
3.21      Because of lack of funds, no audit reports were submitted during
the first three years of project implementation. The first audit report,
covering 1979, 1980, and 1981 was received by the Bank on March 3, 1983. The
audit reports of 1982 and 1983 were received, but each had an eight to nine
months delay. The audit report of 1984 has not yet been received.
3.22      A private firm (Price Waterhouse) audited all the project
components. In addition, the Superintendencia de Bancos (CB's General
Auditor of Banks) audited the trust fund of the credit component.
H. Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.23      MRN did not fully comply with the conditions of Section 3.01 (a)
and (c) of the Loan Agreement concerning the provision of sufficient funds
and the supporting staff, especially the extension agents. Provision of the
extension agents has been based on yearly contracts, the renewal of which
took from three to six months and the staff was not paid during this time.
Starting in 1984, the problem of the renewal of the contracts was solved (see
para. 3.10).
3.24      INA did not fully comply with the condition of Section 3.05 of the
Loan Agrement concerning the provision of support and assistance to farmers
groups in the project area. Starting in 1983, DARNO provided the necessary
resources to INA to organize the groups (see para. 3.12).



- 10 -
3.25      SECOPT did not comply with the condition of Section 4.03 of the
Loan Agreement concerning the maintenance of project roads. The road
maintenance equipment financed by the project was transferred to SECOPT.
However, SECOPT has not started the implementation of the maintenance program
because the equipment is in bad condition and also because of lack of
sufficient funds (see para. 3.15).
3.26      PROMECA did not fully comply with the condition of Section 4.04 of
the Loan Agreement concerning: (i) train PROMECA's workshop staff;
(ii) establish a snare parts stock; and (iii) keep a separate account to be
used exclusively for the machinery pool equipment (during the first five
years of project implementation PROMECA did not comply with this condition).
Since 1984, PROMECA has been carrying out its agricultural machinery services
satisfactorily and has opened an accounting system for controlling project
income and expenses. However, lack of local funds prevented it from
acquiring the spare parts and training its workshop staff (see para. 3.14).
3.27      Another condition not fully complied with was Section 4.02 (c) of
the Loan Agreement concerning submission to the Bank of audit reports (see
para. 3.21). The Bank has not yet received complete audit reports on the
project for 1984.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      A Project Unit was established within the MRN with sufficient
autonomy for efficient project implementation and was headed by a Project
Director who was also in charge of DARNO. This unit was assigned its own
budget, accounts, staff, geographic area of operation and clientele. Because
the institutional capability of DARNO was being poorly developed and a strong
regional organization was needed, with authority over individual projects,
the Bank suggested, and the Government agreed, to integrate the Project Unit
into DARNO to prevent any possible competition between the Project Unit and
DARNO. Starting 1983, DARNO assumed full responsibility for project
implementation and its effectiveness has been gradually improving. The
performance of DARNO has been satisfactory in spite of the fact that from
1979 to 1981 it suffered from political problems and staff turnover, but in
early 1982 a new administration took over in Honduras and since then the
project received full support from the Minister of Natural Resources.
4.02      BANADESA's services have been unsatisfactory since project incep-
tion, and the Project Unit through its credit department, has therefore pro-
cesoed farmers' subloan applications, handled accounting and recovered sub-
loans. However, starting £n 1984, BANADESA started to take a much stronger
role in the execution of the project's credit component.l/ SECOPT's and
PROMECA's performance was unsatisfactory for the reasons discussed in
para. 3.25 and 3.26, above. Finally, INA's performance was also unsatisfac-
tory because it did not organize the agrarian reform groups of small-farmers
as planned.
1/   See Attachment I, BANADESA comments to this paragraph.



- 11 -
4.03      DARNO's satisfactory performance was enhanced by the fact that it
developed an informal marketing system. Also, during the last project year
DARNO finally succeeded in its coordination efforts with other project
implementation agencies. The impact of the project in institution builiiag
has been increasingly positive. To a great extent, the success can be
attributed to the consulting firm which provided the four consultants in
credit, research, extension, and irrigation. The consultants arrived in July
1980, when the project was suffering from rapid staff turnover and political
interference and the structure of the Project Unit (and DARNO) was weak. The
consultants filled the gap. Their performance was highly satisfactory.
V. ROLE OF THE BANK
5.01      The role played by the Bank throughout the execution of the project
was satisfactory. Relations among Bank, MRN, and DARNO were cordial at all
times, and the Bank acted supportively and flexibly in responding to the
Government's requests for reallocation of the proceeds of the loan, extending
the closing date for the loan to allow completion of the project, approving
the project marketing program, and organizing a seminar on Bank disbursement
procedures. The appraisal was overly optimistic about the time needed in
organizing the Project Unit, in recruitment of key staff and in establishing
effective systems of work. It took almost one year after the Loan Agreement
was signed to start up the project. The Bank could have taken a stronger
position early on to ensure satisfactory performance of all the Government
institutions involved in the project, and proper compliance with the
conditions of the loan. However, the Bank supervision missions provided
useful advise and guidance in technical areas.
VI. AGRICULTULfL IMPACT
6.01      The basic strategy pursued during project implementation was to
increase the production of basic grains under rainfed conditions. At year
four of development, the project reached almost three times the production of
maize envisaged at appraisal for year nine, as shown below:

6.02      Although successful in increasing production of maize, the project
did not achieve the degree of crop diversification envisaged at appraisal.
In the before-project situation land was used overwhelmingly for the
production of maize and beans. The anticipated major shift away from maize
towards soybeans and cotton did not occur. However, there was substantial
diversification from maize and beans to rice and sorghum, and a small degree
of diversification into vegetables and fruit trees.
6.03      A substantial improvement in yields was achieved as shown below:

Increases in yields were achieved through the promotion of the use of modern
inputs of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and improved seeds. Also
tractors are now widely used for land preparation in the project area. The
average intensity of land use of beneficiaries increased from about 80% to
125% compared with appraisal estimates of 140%. The increase was achieved
mainly through two interventions. First, the introduction of a
pest-resistant variety of sorghum in 1980/81 agricultural year provided
farmers with an attractive second crop, better suited than maize to rain
conditions during the latter months of the year. Secondly, the organization
of the project's marketing component, through which a substantial proportion
of first-crop maize could be sold undried by farmers, made possible a
reduction in the practice of maize field drying and a consequent increase in
the availability of land that could be planted to a second crop.
6.04      The analysis of the impact of the project was based on field work
conducted by DARNO staff at the end of the 1983/84 agricultural year (four
years of project development). The mission followed the evaluation method of
comparing situations before and after the project. The total value of annual
incremental production in 1983/84 at current economic farmgate prices was
about US$5.0 million. The economic rate of return for 25 years, estimated on
the basis of results thus far, is about 17%. The appraisal estimate was
21%. Average net farm income of beneficiary households at full development
is estimated to be about twice the level that would prevail in the
without-project situation.

VII. SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      Summary.  A key objective of the project was to support the
small-farms subsector and improve farm incomes for lower income groups. This
objective has been attained since all the subloans were made to
individual small-farmers and agrarian reform groups considered to be among
the poorest. Despite the fact that the project started slowly and faced
major political, financial and managerial problems from its inception, it is
considered successful because of its significant contribution to the
improvement of production, particularly of basic grains. Financially, the
project suffered from insufficient counterpart funds. Main managerial
problems were delays in organizing the Project Unit, delays in recruitment of
key staff, heavy staff turnover, and procurement delays. Gradually, a great
number of bottlenecks were overcome. Extension, credit and marketing systems
are now in place. Despite about two years of delay in completing the
project, actual spending under the project (computed in US Dollar equivalent)
is a little less than the appraisal estimate; the lower than anticipated
counterpart funds contributed to this. The performance of the implementing
agencies has been mixed. Only DARNO did well; the other agencies did not
receive the support of their managers and did not have the funds to comply
with the project objectives.3/
7.02      Lessons Learned.
(a) DARNO proved to be an appropriate agency for implementing the
overall coordination function. Future projects of this kind in
Honduras should use MRN's Regional Directorates as the executing
agencies with direct responsibility for the extension and marketing
components and for general project implementation;
(b) provision of credit in the form of a trust fund, where the
Government and not BANADESA assumed the credit risk, proved also to
be appropriate because small farmers usually do not have titles to
their land or other assets suitable to guarantee regular bank
loans. For future projects of this kind in Honduras, credit funds
should be provided also as a trust fund in order to permit access
by small farmers to institutional credit. Further, an arrangement
should be made to help farmers obtain the collateral required for
regular bank credit (e.g., title to land) in order to permit them
to graduate from trust fund to regular credit lines.
(c) the project's informal marketing program, not anticipated at
appraisal, proved also to be a good tool to assist project
beneficiaries to sell their grains and to obtain better farmgate
prices. It also helped to obtain better subloan recovery rates.
For future projects of this kind in Honduras, marketing services
should be provided to project beneficiaries;

(d) the team of consultants hired under the project proved essential to
its success. Because most of the project operational procedures
are well established by now, in a possible second phase of the
project technical assistance should be substantially reduced, as
the local project team has by now acquired a good level of
competence. However, a full-time marketing consultant should be
recruited to strengthen DARNO's informal marketing program;
(e) despite the successful implementation of the irrigation
infrastructure of the credit component, additional gravity
irrigatien, and particularly irrigation by pumping of underground
water, cannot be economically justified on the basis of basic
grains production at present prices. For irrigation to be
economically viable, a large degree of diversification into
higher-value products such as fruits and vegetables would have to
be achieved in the irrigated areas. Further studies would be
needed to assess the technical, financial and economic feasibility
of such diversification; and
(f) The Bank appears to have been too flexible concerning submission of
audit reports.

Dear Mr. Maiss:
I refer to your memorandum of April 17, 1986, in which you ask for
comments on the preliminary version of the Project Completion Report for the
Guayape Regional Development Project (Loan 1576-HO).  I have the honor to
submit a number of observations bearing on Banco Nacional de Desarrollo
Agricola (BANADESA)'s participation in the Project so that these can be taken
into account in preparing the final version of the report.
Very truly yours,

COMMENTS BY BANADESA ON THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FOR THE GUAYAPE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (IBRD LOAN 1576-HO)
Bancd Nacional de Desarrollo Agricola (BANADESA) wishes to make the
following comments on certain statements contained in the Project Completion
Report for the Guayape Regional Development Project (IBRD Loan 1576-HO) dated
January 9, 1986, prepared by Agriculture Division A of the Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office of the World Bank.
(a)       In Chapter III, Section A "Implementation Schedule," para. 3.02
states that "The credit component was especially affected by the delay, and
lending operations started only by September 1979, thus missing the main
growing season of that year."
Comments. Although BANADESA was responsible for the credit component, it had
to comply with a series of preconditions before it could start to make loans.
For example, the Credit Committee first had to be set up, having as its main
function to determine the creditworthiness of project beneficiaries
(subborrowers) and the feasibility of their investment plans, and also to
decide on each subloan application. Consequently, as is stated in para. 3.02,
six months were needed after the effective date of the loan (December 18,
1978) to set up the organizational structure of the project unit as the body
responsible for general project implementation.  Another condition required
for the project was to make the necessary arrangements between the Ministry of
Natural Resources (MRN) and BANADESA to allow Part A of the project to be
carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan
Agreement. In addition, the Government (acting through the Secretariat of
Treasury and Public Credit) was required to sign a Subsidiary Agreement with
BANADESA designed to make available to BANADESA the funds needed to carry out
Part A of the project pursuant to the arrangements described in Clause
3.01 (d) (ii) of the Loan Agreement. Both agreements, i.e. the Implementation
Agreement and the Subsidiary Agreement, were signed on August 24, 1979.
However, it was not until November 5, 1979 that the Government transferred the
first tranche of counterpart funds (L 104,477.00) to BANADESA. That same day
saw the formal signing of fifty subloans totalling L 120,176.00 -- L 15,699.00
higher than the amount received from the Government. It is evident from the
above that BANADESA was not the prime cause of the delay in starting up the
credit component in the early days of the project.
(b)       As regards Section B "Implementation of Project Components,"
para. 3.06 states: "The implementation of the cred5.'; component was successful
because: (a) the Agricultural Directorate for the North East Region of the
Ministry of Natural Resources (DARNO) filled the gap left by the National
Development Bank (BANADESA), which did not assign local office personnel in
the numbers and quality that were needed to fulfill the role of financial
intermediary; it functioned instead as a mere credit window."
Comments. Under Art. 9 of the Implementation Agreement, BANADESA was
obligated merely to assign three Credit Department employees to work full time
in the Project Unit until the project was completed. However, as a result of
the volume of loans involved in this project, BANADESA had to hire temporary
staff in addition to the three permanent employees to speed up loan
processing; for budgetary reasons, it was unable to add to the permanent



ATTACHMENT I
-19 -                        Page 3 of 5
staff. Another factor that caused delays in dealing with customers quickly
was the large number of disbursements to each subborrower -- between 20 and 30
disbursements per person, sometimes for as little as L 10.00 at a time. These
multiple disbursements add greatly to the work load. Under normal
circumstances, BANADESA may make up to six disbursements.  The slowdown in
lending, brought about by the events described above, prompted DARNO to take
over certain credit responsibilities, as it already 'iad the resources needed
to carry out these tasks; accordingly, it set up a Credit and Marketing
Department, which had not been anticipated in the Implementation Agreement.
(c)       In Chapter IV "Institutional Performance," para. 4.02 states, and I
quote: "BANADESA's sarvices have been unsatisfactory since project inception,
and the Project Unit through its credit department, has therefore processed
farmers' subloan applications, handled accounting and recovered subloans.
However, starting in 1984, BANADESA started to take a much stronger role in
the execution of the project's credit component."
Comments. Under the Implementation Agreement, BANADESA was indeed responsible
for processing subloan applications in coordination with the Project Unit and
handling recoveries in the project area. DARNO took over these
responsibilities as a result of the large volume of loan applications
submitted to the Juticalpa and Catacamas agencies, which BANADESA was unable
to handle with the necessary dispatch due to lack of manpower; as explained
above, DARNO had both the necessary staff and sufficient resources for this
task. Despite its budgetary constraints since the beginning of the project,
BANADESA sought to find a better solution to the problems raised in the
supervision reports prepared by the various World Bank missions.
BANADESA has, however, handled the accounting function since project
inception. It hias submitted monthly reports on the financial situation of the
trust fund (Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account), in accordance with
Art. 22 of the Implementation Agreement.
SUMMARY:
In short, BANADESA, in its capacity as trustee, considers that, in
concert with the Ministry of Natural Resources, it has complied with the terms
of the Implementation Agreement. As a result, BANADESA's performance has been
satisfactory, if one takes account of the fact that, for budgetary reasons,
there have been constraints on its ability to secure resources beyond its
means. It should also be noted that the Guayape Project was the first such
trust operation carried out by BANADESA and that this enabled it to gain
important experience in administering the funds of later trusts it has
assumed. Despite what has been stated earlier, the project's objectives have
been achieved, as the volume of lending activity rose steadily from year to
year, as is evident from the following figures:

Under the Implementation Agreement, the total amount of financing
earmarked for the credit component was L 13,611,940.00, of which L 9,600,000
was to be provided by the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), while the Government of Honduras was to furnish
L 4,011,940.00 in counterpart funds. As can be seen from the table above, the
actual amount of funding provided was L 13,593,800.00, with the Bank
contributing 100% of its share and the Government of Honduras falling short
(due to unavailability of funds) by an insignificant L 18,140.00.
