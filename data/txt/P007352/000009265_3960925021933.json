This\n            project was the fourth agricultural project financed by the\n            Bank in Honduras. The project included agricultural credit\n            and production support in the form of agricultural\n            machinery, feeder roads, extension, and research services.\n            The objectives of the project were to: (a) improve incomes\n            of individual's mall-farmers and agrarian reform\n            groups; and (b) accelerate growth of agricultural\n            production. The main lessons to be learned are that: the\n            project's informal marketing program, not anticipated\n            at appraisal, proved also to be a good tool to assist\n            project beneficiaries to sell their grains and to obtain\n            better farm gate prices. It also helped to obtain better sub\n            loan recovery rates; and the Bank appears to have been too\n            flexible concerning submission of audit reports."}, "docdt": "1986-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
