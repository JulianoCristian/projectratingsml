innovation versus broad acceptance of\n            the status quo, persistence versus reluctant adaptation to\n            changing circumstances and information, and strategic reform\n            versus technical reasoning. The slow start and\n            implementation of the project indicate an apparent lack of\n            full ownership on the part of the government. This pilot\n            program was one of the most far-reaching and innovative Bank\n            projects initiated in China at the time. Differences in\n            project impact and implementation results between project\n            cities can be a valuable tool in the interpretation and\n            assessment of experimental project models as used in this\n            project. As Liaoning was selected to pilot certain aspects\n            of the social security reforms, it would have been desirable\n            to have the national government and possibly other provinces\n            more closely involved in the preparation and evaluation of\n            the various studies, as well as in the performance of the\n            automation exercise of a number of important social benefits."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
