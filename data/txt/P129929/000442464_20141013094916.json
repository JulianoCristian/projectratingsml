moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: by quickly\n            responding to the client's request for assistance, the\n            Bank continues to be regarded as a valued partner. It was\n            important to maintain sufficient flexibility to adapt and\n            respond to client needs and economic realities in the\n            country. Bank assistance and support in simply initiating\n            difficult reform actions through the operation facilitated\n            the client\u0092s ability and momentum to continue the full and\n            complete implementation of reform actions, even after the\n            operation closed, albeit at a slower pace. The slowdown in\n            implementation of some key policy actions after the release\n            of the FSSC funds implies that the scope of the reforms was\n            ambitious in the context of Nepal's political\n            circumstances. The implications of the short time frame for\n            the closure of the FSSC oblige the need for a more realistic\n            timeframe in the follow-on programmatic operations and\n            secondly, for a more narrowly defined project development\n            objective (PDO) and set of outcome indicators for the\n            planned programmatic operations. Cooperation among\n            international agencies (that is, Department for\n            International Development (DFID), International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF), and Asian Development Bank (ADB)) proved\n            essential, since extensive technical assistance has been\n            provided and coordinated with this operation and aligned\n            with the country\u0092s priorities and strategic goals. The\n            broadening of the DFID technical assistance program over the\n            coming years should also allow expansion of the scope of\n            forthcoming development policy credit (DPC) operations and\n            Bank-DFID cooperation is continuing as the preparation of\n            additional DPCs moves forward."}, "docdt": "2014-09-30T00:43:04Z"}
