Sector\n            Stability Credit Program for Nepal is to support the\n            implementation of the financial sector reform program\n            initiated by the Nepalese authorities to reduce the\n            vulnerability of the banking sector and increase its\n            transparency. The credit recognizes the important progress\n            made so far by the Nepalese authorities to tackle financial\n            sector vulnerability and supports the acceleration of a\n            medium term reform strategy which commenced implementation\n            in 2011. This program document describes a stand-alone,\n            single tranche, financial sector stability credit of US\n            dollar 30 million to support the Government's efforts\n            to address financial sector vulnerabilities that remain\n            critical to macroeconomic stability and economic growth. The\n            actions supported under the Development Policy Credit (DPC)\n            form part of a broader, medium term Government program aimed\n            at reinforcing banking sector stability and paving the way\n            for the development of a robust and more inclusive financial\n            sector. The key components of this medium term program are\n            also described in detail in the document. Sufficient overall\n            progress towards the objectives of the medium term program\n            would allow the Bank to provide additional support in the\n            form of a second DPC within about 18 months."}, "docdt": "2013-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
