F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Financial Sector Stability Credit Program for Nepal is to support the
implementation of the financial sector reform program initiated by the Nepalese authorities to
reduce the vulnerability of the banking sector and increase its transparency. The credit
recognizes the important progress made so far by the Nepalese authorities to tackle financial
sector vulnerability and supports the acceleration of a medium term reform strategy which
commenced implementation in 2011. This program document describes a stand-alone, single
tranche, financial sector stability credit of US dollar 30 million to support the Government's
efforts to address financial sector vulnerabilities that remain critical to macroeconomic stability
and economic growth.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. Nepal faced serious financial sector challenges in recent years, reflecting a decade of
political instability, a lax bank licensing regime, a poorly performing large public banking sector
and a rapidly growing private financial sector. Moreover, the regulatory and supervisory
framework was not up to the new challenges, and bank supervision had been chronically under-
resourced and compliance-based, without an enforcement culture to make bad practices
accountable for their deeds. Solvency problems, especially in the lower license classes (B and C
Class institutions), were suspected in the banking sector, which were partially hidden due to
common ever-greening of non-performing loans.

1.1.2. Since 2005, the number of Class A banks almost doubled (with 13 new commercial
banks licensed since 2007) and their assets almost tripled. Private commercial banks accounted
for all of this growth, while the size of the two capital impaired State-owned banks, Rastriya
Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) declined as a share of the sector’s total
assets. However, RBB remained the largest bank, representing 8.5 percent of total commercial
bank assets and NBL the fifth largest bank, with 5.6 percent of assets at mid-January 2014.

1.1.3. While a large number of new banks were licensed, beginning in mid-2011, a financial
sector crisis was poised to unfold in Nepal. Withdrawals of deposits from smaller financial
institutions and severe liquidity constraints across the banking sector exposed the vulnerabilities
of the financial system and required the urgent intervention of Nepal’s central bank and its bank
regulatory authority, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB).

1.1.4. The 2011 liquidity crisis was a symptom of significant underlying weaknesses affecting
the banking sector. Financial institutions became highly vulnerable to shocks transmitted
through delays in Government expenditures, rising NPLs, and a downturn in remittances. The
liquidity shortages of a number of institutions were further compounded by the loss of inter-bank
funding, as banks protected their own financial positions by withdrawing wholesale funding
from those institutions identified as being (or rumored to be) in trouble.

1.1.5. The true financial condition of many banks was not fully known. The World Bank,
together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the UK’s Department for International
Development (DFID), was called on by NRB and the Government of Nepal (GoN) to provide
assistance. The three institutions partnered together to develop a comprehensive joint program
of assistance. As an immediate measure, technical assistance was provided to support efforts to
contain the developing crisis. This helped the Government to implement a series of regulatory
and supervisory measures, starting in 2011, which were designed to provide a first response to
the weaknesses in the financial sector and begin the process of identifying systemic and
institution-specific risks. The joint technical assistance from the Bank, IMF and DFID also
helped NRB to intervene effectively to avert a full-blown financial crisis in 2012.



                                                1
1.1.6. Despite the complex political environment prevailing at that time, the Government and
NRB realized the need to also undertake a long term strategy and identify the broader reforms to
address the existing financial sector vulnerabilities. To develop that strategy and to support the
implementation of the broader reforms, the Government requested further support from the
Bank. The Bank responded by launching with DFID a robust dialogue with the authorities that
culminated in the formulation of a medium-term program to address the underlying
vulnerabilities of the financial sector.

1.1.7. Key areas of this medium-term Government program, as listed in Annex 3 of the
Program Document, included: (i) formulation of a financial sector development strategy; (ii)
restructuring of Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) and Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB); (iii) assessment
of the condition of class A, B and C financial institutions and potential restructuring; (iv)
strengthening institutional arrangements to support the bank restructuring process; and (v)
increasing transparency of the financial system. Once this comprehensive medium-term reform
program was developed, the Government recognized the need for sustained support from the
Bank over a long period of time to allow for proper implementation of the agreed reform in
phases.

1.1.8. In the context of the presentation of the Interim Strategy for Nepal in the fall of 2011, the
Bank’s Board was informed of the troubled status of the financial sector and of the Bank’s
readiness to provide support through development policy lending to help stabilize the situation.
However, in the absence of a Parliament and a government, a longer term engagement was not
deemed feasible at that time and the Bank considered offering more modest policy support,
aimed at simply initiating key activities, the implementation of which would then be continued
by the authorities until an elected government was in place to trigger further support by the Bank.

1.1.9. With key technical inputs coordinated with DFID, the Bank prepared a list of nine prior
actions for the presentation of the Financial Sector Stability Credit (FSSC) to the Board. These
nine prior actions, as listed in Box 8 (page 42) of the Program Document, were the following:

   (1) The first phase of a time bound recapitalization plan for RBB has been approved by NRB
       and completed, including a cash injection from GoN of NPR 4.32 billion and the
       conversion of a loan of NPR 3 billion from GoN into capital;
   (2) The first phase of a time bound recapitalization plan for NBL has been approved by NRB
       and completed, including: (i) a cash subscription from GoN of NPR 1.37 billion in
       advance payment for rights offering shares, (ii) the publication of a notice for tenders
       from the public for the sale of non-banking assets of NBL with an estimated value of
       NPR 1 billion; and (iii) the initiation of a rights offering for private shareholders to
       purchase NBL shares with a value of up to NPR 2.2 billion;
   (3) NRB has approved a program of in-depth (solvency) diagnostics for a list of financial
       institutions whose aggregate assets represent over 50% of the total banking assets in
       Nepal, including approval of the terms of reference of the diagnostic and the initial list of
       the institutions on which diagnostics will be performed;
   (4) NRB has established a bank resolution desk and approved a bank resolution manual;

 .
1.1.10. After the above prior actions were fulfilled, the World Bank’s Board approved a stand-
alone, single tranche Financial Sector Stability Credit (FSSC) of US$ 30 million equivalent on
June 27, 2013. The focus of the FSSC was on putting in place building blocks for banking sector
stability, while the medium-term Government reform program aimed at consolidating banking
sector stability and paving the way for the development of a robust and inclusive financial sector.
The Government agreed to continue the implementation of the medium-term program with DFID
inputs to achieve satisfactory progress so that the Bank could provide additional support in the
form of a second DPC within the next 18 months or so. Such support is currently under
consideration by the Bank.

1.1.11. This credit operation was initially conceived as the first phase of a programmatic series of
DPCs supporting the Government’s broader medium-term reform program. However, the
uncertain political situation in 2012 and early-2013, and the absence of a Parliament resulted in
the Bank developing a stand-alone DPC to minimize risks, to be followed by a series of DPCs to
support the continuing reforms. Doing so enabled the Government to receive sufficient
assistance in the preparation and subsequent delivery of the FSSC to preempt a possible financial
crisis and strengthen financial sector stability against a continuously evolving political
environment. Moreover, in close collaboration with DFID the team was able to continue
deepening its policy dialogue on further reforms to be supported by a follow-up operation now
under preparation.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1. The objective of the FSSC program, as stated in the ‘Credit and Program Summary’ (page
6) of the Program Document, was to support the implementation of the financial sector reform
program initiated by the Nepalese authorities to reduce the vulnerability of the banking sector
and increase its transparency. As stated before, this Credit was aimed at supporting the initial
steps of the medium-term reform program, which the Authorities found difficult to implement
due to resistance from vested interests. Therefore, a critical contribution of this Credit has been
the concerted technical support provided by DFID, underlying the policy dialogue led by the
Bank with the authorities, to initiate the actions identified under the DPC Policy Matrix. It was
presumed that once the activities were initiated, the authorities would complete their
implementation after the end-2013 closing of this Credit.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification
None.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

1.4.1. The FSSC operation supported six main policy areas1: (i) formulation of a financial sector
development strategy; (ii) restructuring of Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) and Rastriya Banijya
Bank (RBB); (iii) assessment of the condition of Class A, B and C financial institutions and
potential restructuring; (iv) strengthening institutional arrangements to support the bank
restructuring process; (v) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for effective bank
resolution; and (vi) increasing the transparency of the financial system.

The details on each of the six policy areas included in the Program Document of the DPC
operation were the following:

Formulation of a financial sector development strategy.

1.4.2. This was designed to help the authorities and financial sector stakeholders reach a
consensus on a vision for the Nepalese financial sector in five to ten years’ time and to lay out
the key steps required to transform that agreed vision into reality. This strategic exercise,
supported by DFID, assessed the current structure of the financial sector (Class A, B, C and D

    As stated in Section B: Policy Areas (page 42) of the Program Document.

institutions, insurance, financial cooperatives, capital markets, merchant and investment banking,
and contractual savings) to determine whether this structure remains relevant to Nepal’s needs,
as there is a growing recognition that a consolidation of the financial sector is required. This
comprehensive exercise was jointly led by the Joint Secretary of the MoF and an NRB Deputy
Governor.

Restructuring of NBL and RBB.

1.4.3. This action was crucial to establish a level playing field and require all banks (public and
private) to meet all prudential norms, in particular regarding capital adequacy and single
borrower limit requirements. Allowing state controlled banks to remain insolvent signaled that
lack of compliance with prudential regulation was acceptable. It also undermined the
authorities’ credibility to tackle problem banks. The first phases of the NBL and RBB
restructuring and recapitalization plans were to be followed by strengthening corporate
governance, credit underwriting and risk management as part of the NBL and RBB business
plans.

Assessment of the condition of Class A, B and C financial institutions and potential
restructuring.

1.4.4. The NRB authorized 54 comprehensive Special Inspections of financial institutions (A, B
and C class) representing at least 65 percent of total banking assets to be undertaken by external
auditors in two phases, led by a “Big Four” international accounting firm2 based outside Nepal.
The World Bank, DFID and NRB agreed on the Terms of Reference (including criteria on the
selection of banks) for these in-depth solvency diagnostics prior to December 2013. The first
phase diagnostic assessments of 27 financial institutions was initiated in early 2014, by the
KPMG (Portugal) assisted by PWC with DFID financing. Phase II assessments of the remaining
27 financial institutions are scheduled to start in early 2015. In the event undercapitalized banks
are identified, the NRB is committed to initiate prompt and corrective actions to remedy the
situation.

Strengthening institutional arrangements to support the bank restructuring process.

1.4.5. The Nepalese authorities initiated key reforms to strengthen the bank restructuring process
through the issuance of regulations and by-laws to facilitate merger and acquisition of financial
institutions, continuation of the moratorium on new licenses, preparation of a bank resolution
manual and Prompt Corrective Action framework, and preparation of a Bill to formalize the
deposit insurance (or pay-box only) mandate of the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Corporation
(DCGC). It remains essential for the DCGC legislation be enacted before the NRB receives the
solvency diagnostics, as a number of problems financial institutions could be identified which
require resolution. The NRB Board established its new Bank Resolution Department, to which
DFID provided TA to train staff and support preparation of a Bank Resolution Manual, which
has been formally adopted by the NRB board.

Strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for effective bank resolution.

1.4.6. The legal framework for declaring a bank insolvent is complex, lengthy and subject to
interference by creditors, the judiciary and shareholders alike. The NRB Board approved
amendments to the NRB Act on May 22, 2013, which have since been reviewed by the MoF (in
light of the IMF, World Bank and DFID comments). The revised amendments to the NRB Act,
as regards Article 86 on bank resolutions, were endorsed by MoF and submitted to the Ministry
of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs in September 2014. Under the medium-term
Government program, MoF will ensure that the amendments to the NRB Act have been
submitted to Parliament by December 2014. Upon approval, the legal framework for bank
resolution would be modernized to allow the more effective and speedy resolution of failing
banks.

Increasing the transparency of the financial system.

1.4.7. The authorities demonstrated their commitment to act against money laundering and
terrorist financing with the approval of several key ordinances (e.g., the Legal Assistance Bill,
Extradition Bill and Organized Crime Bill). The Institute of Chartered Accountant of Nepal
(ICAN) has decided to mandate IFRS as adapted for Nepal from July 2015. NFRS compliant
regulations will allow a more accurate picture of the performance of financial institutions and
training for regulators has been initiated in early-2014 with Nepalese counterparts utilizing DFID
support.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
None.


1.6 Other significant changes
None.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

2.2.1. While there have been relatively recent setbacks in the path towards a stable democracy,
Nepal is making progress on consolidating peace and building a new political system. Emerging
from a ten year armed conflict that ended in 2006, the country continues through a protracted and
difficult political transition. This transition entails two inter-related processes: promulgation of a
new constitution and the completion of the ongoing peace process. Nepal has made good
progress on the peace process — notably by formally concluding integration of former ex-
combatants into the armed forces in August 2012 — but the country’s political transition is
taking longer than expected.

2.2.2. The ten month political impasse that followed the dissolution of the first Constituent
Assembly in May 2012 ended on March 14, 2013, when the Chief Justice was sworn in as
Chairman (Prime Minister) of the Interim Election Government. The Interim Election
Government held new Constituent Assembly elections on November 19, 2013.

2.2.3. After the FSSC was taken to the Board, Parliamentary elections on November 19, 2013,
considered largely free and fair, improved the prospects for political stability. The new
Constituent Assembly mandated to draft a new constitution within one year, provided the ability
to pass new or amended legislation required to support and implement reforms. On February 25,
2014, exactly 98 days after elections to a Second Constituent Assembly and 15 days after his
election as Prime Minister, Sushil Koirala formed a coalition government with cabinet
composing of politicians from Nepali Congress and CPN-UML. Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat was
appointed the Finance Minister, his sixth stint in the job intermittently since 1996. Known to
have both a political and technocratic background, a rare combination in Nepali politics, Dr.
Mahat has advocated sweeping policy changes in the economy with greater role of the private
sector in economic activities.

                                                 10
2.2.4. In spite of the political uncertainty of recent years, Nepal has demonstrated a remarkable
ability to achieve development results, and moreover, advance a key set of long overdue
financial sector reforms. Thus, even before the November 2013 elections, the authorities had
agreed to restructure the two State-owned banks, began injecting funds to increase their capital
and issued bylaws to facilitate mergers of financial institutions. Political instability is bound to
remain a concern for the foreseeable future. The progress achieved to date by the Nepalese
authorities in tackling key financial sector vulnerabilities, as illustrated through the FSSC
operation, has demonstrated the capacity of the authorities to implement critical reforms despite
political uncertainty. At the same time, the challenges posed by the transitional political
environment may have had a negative impact on the pace of implementation of the policy
actions.

2.2.5. As a fragile state, Nepal stands out for its relatively stable economic performance, good
development results and maintenance of financial stability, even during the height of the conflict.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

2.3.1. The Ministry of Finance was responsible for overall implementation of the FSSC
program, in close coordination with the NRB. MoF strengthened its capacity to oversee the
financial sector by forming the Financial Sector Management Division (FSMD). Both the
Financial Sector Management Division and NRB monitored the progress towards the Key
Outcome Indicators on a regular basis.

2.3.2. Design: There were ten outcome indicators in the FSSC, for which targets were
established for each to capture the results achieved by end-2013. The baselines and outcome
indicators were objective and cumulatively formed the basis of a results chain demonstrating,
inter alia, both the regulator’s and financial sector’s performance. Given that the program was
designed in the midst of a global financial crisis and high domestic political uncertainties,
concerted efforts were made with the authorities to define mostly quantitative indicators to
facilitate monitoring. As originally planned, these actions were meant to initiate the
implementation of the broader set of medium term reforms, the completion of which was to be
pursued by the Government after the FSSC operation closed. The medium-term Nepalese
financial sector reform program will take several years to be fully realized.

2.3.3. Implementation: The NRB Regulations Department together with the newly created
Financial Sector Management Division in the Ministry of Finance carried out the implementation
and monitoring of the Key Outcome Indicators. They were assisted by DFID advisors.

2.3.4. Utilization: The quantitative nature of the indicators helped in monitoring progress of
implementation. Thus, the Capital Adequacy Ratio of the two state-owned banks was regularly
monitored by NRB and FSMD and after they turned positive, efforts were directed to increase
the ratio so as to meet the regulatory capital. The consolidation of the financial sector was
regularly monitored by tracking the number of financial institutions that merged. Similarly, the
other indicators were easily monitored to follow the progress in their implementation.



                                                11
2.3.5. Fiduciary Aspects: The strengthening of the public financial management systems and
processes continued after the completion of the Phase I program in 2013. The Public
Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) Secretariat, Nepal, continues to lead the PEFA
agenda and institutionalize the reform process. The Treasury Single Account has now been
rolled out to all the 75 districts in Nepal.

2.3.6. The Bank is currently undertaking a ROSC of the Accounting and Auditing (ROSC-
A&A) standards. The PEFA Secretariat will be leading from the Government with the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN) as co-leader. The main purpose of the ROSC-A&A
is to provide findings and recommendations in support of the strengthening of corporate
accounting and auditing practices in order to foster the quality and reliability of corporate
financial reporting, thereby contributing to improved business environment and investment
climate in the country.

2.3.7. The ROSC-A&A will specifically address the systemic and governance requirements that
are necessary for improved competitiveness in world markets, an enhanced financial sector, and
a strengthened corporate accounting and auditing practice in the country. It aims to provide
policy recommendations for necessary actions towards implementation of international corporate
accounting and auditing standards; strengthening the profession and improving the capacity of
professional bodies; introducing appropriate mechanisms for ensuring compliance with corporate
accounting and auditing requirements; and developing arrangements for high quality accounting
and auditing education and training. The policy recommendations from the ROSC-A&A review,
expected by November 2014, will provide a framework for preparing an Action Plan for the
reform of accounting and auditing practices in Nepal.

2.3.8. Disbursement and Auditing: The full amount of the Credit was disbursed in SDR in
October 2013, which amounted to US$30.80 million due to exchange rate fluctuation. The
Government maintained accounts and records showing the funds were received and made
available for budget expenditures. As stated in the Program Document, no audit was required
under this DPC.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

2.4.1. The Government’s program for the financial sector now focuses on the second phase of
reforms stemming from preparatory work done in 2011-13, as supported by the stand-alone
FSSC operation. The Government’s 2014-15 program for the financial sector focuses on reforms
designed to achieve two overarching policy objectives: (i) ensure the stability of the financial
system by improving the quality of regulation, supervision, and transparency to levels closer to
international norms; and (ii) improve access to financial services.

2.4.2. The 2014-15 financial sector reforms supported by the envisaged second Financial Sector
Stability Credit include:
  Completion of the long term financial sector development strategy based on wide
     consultation with stakeholders.
  Approval of a National Payments System Development Strategy.


                                              12
    Completion of restructuring of two state-controlled banks through recapitalization to above-
     minimum prudential ratios. RBB, with 100 percent state ownership, will remain with a
     commercial banking license, but will follow a development-focused strategy, while the
     tender for divestiture of state owned shares in NBL will have been launched.
    Completion of a program of in depth solvency diagnostics of all at-risk and systemic banks
     covering at least 50 percent of banking system assets, followed by appropriate measures to
     ensure that all banks are in regulatory compliance.
    Putting in place a fully functional financial sector safety net through enactment of the
     DCGC Bill and operationalization of the deposit insurance system.
    Adoption of amendments to NRB Act and BAFIA to give supervisors stronger legal tools
     for bank resolution and issuance of new regulations reflecting the enhanced bank resolution
     framework.
    Adoption of amendments to BAFIA and NRB regulations to strengthen bank governance
     and to bring State-owned banks within the new governance framework.
    Improvements to the transparency of the financial system through a staged adoption of
     Nepal Financial Reporting Standards (NFRS) and issuance of NFRS-compliant regulations
     by the NRB.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. The former Nepal Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY12/13 notes the vulnerabilities of
the financial sector. At the time of the Board presentation of the ISN, the World Bank Executive
Directors noted the emerging weaknesses in the financial sector and urged the Bank to assist the
Government of Nepal (GoN) in addressing them, inter alia, through the potential use of
development policy lending. This was achieved through this operation.

3.1.2. The new Nepal Country Partnership Strategy for FY14-18, presented to the Board on
May 29, 2014, underlines persistent financial sector weaknesses and the risks this poses to
macroeconomic stability and economic growth, as illustrated by the liquidity crisis in 2011. The
new strategy aims to consolidate the World Bank Group’s current engagement in basic services
while shifting focus on the binding constraints to growth that includes, among others, a poor
investment climate and a fragile financial sector. The document also recognizes the pivotal role
of private sector to deliver economic growth and to generate much needed jobs in Nepal.

3.1.3. In this context, IFC is ramping up both investment volumes and advisory support and is
also issuing a local currency bond to stimulate investments in Nepal. A stable financial sector is
crucial for attracting private investments necessary to facilitate economic growth. The progress
achieved through this operation has played a critical role in the implementation of the medium
term reform program which continues to be implemented by the Government.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

3.2.1. The Policy Areas supported under this DPC were designed to be implemented through a
programmatic series of Development Policy Credits supporting financial sector stability and

                                               13
reform. However, the fluid political situation and the lack of a Parliament during project
preparation prompted the processing of the FSSC as a stand-alone operation focused on initiating
the ten Policy Actions stated in Annex 2 under the Policy Matrix. These ten Policy Actions have
both Baseline Indicators and Outcome Indicators for each, thus providing a quantitative basis for
assessing their achievement. This ICR assessed the inputs, outputs and outcomes of the ten
Policy Actions in the FSSC Policy Matrix against the Outcome Indicators mentioned therein.
Both the outcomes at the end of the FSSC program (end-2013) and at the end of the Nepali fiscal
year 2014 (mid-July 2014) are noted below along with the status of the relevant policy area:

       1) Policy Area: Formulation of a financial sector development strategy. Policy Action:
          The Government has taken a decision to prepare a comprehensive strategy to support the
          development of an inclusive financial sector. Outcome Indicator: The NRB and MoF
          have initiated technical consultations with stakeholders for the elaboration of the
          financial sector development strategy for Nepal and a roadmap has been developed.
          Actual achievement: The MoF in coordination with NRB and other regulatory bodies
          have initiated consultations with relevant stakeholders. Sub-committee has been formed
          which is headed by the Deputy Governor of NRB. Key pillars have been identified that
          forms the basis of the road map. This indicator has been fully achieved with the
          initiation of the technical consultations and the development of the roadmap. The FSDS
          is being developed through inputs provided by five sub-groups (banking, capital markets,
          insurance, contractual savings and cooperatives/micro-finance). Critical support to these
          groups as well as to the Technical Committees is being provided by DFID through an on-
          site advisor.

           As a part of this multi-stakeholder exercise, a review of the current structure of the
           financial sector is being undertaken to assess how each portion of this structure is
           relevant to Nepal’s medium- to long-term needs. There is widespread recognition that a
           consolidation of the financial sector is required, containing fewer categories of financial
           institutions but with sharper differentiation among those remaining, as well as increased
           capital requirements and more stringent licensing regulations, limitations on the types of
           funds which can be mobilized, and identification of the level of applicable supervision
           according to risk, etc. The five sub-groups provided written contributions in May 2014,
           for integration by the Technical Committee into the initial full-draft FSDS which was
           circulated to stakeholders for comment in early-July 2014. The full draft of the
           consolidated FSDS has been submitted to MoF, which has sought further assistance from
           the Bank for review and feedback prior to finalization. The ICR team considers that the
           formulation of the FSDS will require more time, but it should be approved by the Cabinet
           prior to the next DPC.

       2) Policy Area: Restructuring of NBL and RBB. Policy Action: The first phase of a time
          bound recapitalization plan for RBB has been approved by NRB and completed,
          including a cash injection from GoN of NPR 4.32 billion and the conversion of a
          loan of NPR 3 billion from GoN into capital4. Outcome Indicator: RBB CAR is

    Bolded actions are also the prior actions for the disbursement of the DPC.


                                                           14
   positive and RBB’s performance (including governance) is monitored by the MoF
   Financial Sector Management Division and NRB. Actual achievement: RBB’s CAR is
   +4.54 % as of 13 December 2013 and its performance is regularly monitored by the
   Nepal Rastra Bank and FSMD of Ministry of Finance. This indicator has been fully
   achieved as the capital turned positive through the injection of NPR 7.7 billion in
   common equity of RBB by the Government. The recapitalization of RBB continues
   through retained profits and the bank’s CAR increased to 5.6 percent in mid-July 2014.
   The medium-term Government reform program aims at ensuring that, following the
   Special Inspections RBB remain in compliance with their approved recapitalization
   plans. RBB is to remain a fully state-owned bank. The ICR team considers that RBB
   should be able to meet the regulatory CAR prior to the next DPC.

3) Policy Area: Restructuring of NBL and RBB. Policy Action: The first phase of a time
   bound recapitalization plan for NBL has been approved by NRB and completed,
   including: (i) a cash subscription from GoN of NPR 1.37 billion in advance payment
   for rights offering shares, (ii) the publication of a notice for tenders from the public
   for the sale of non-banking assets of NBL with an estimated value of NPR 1 billion;
   and (iii) and the initiation of a rights offering from private shareholders to purchase
   NBL shares with a value of up to NPR 2.2 billion. Outcome Indicator: NBL CAR is
   positive and NBL’s performance (including governance) is monitored by the MoF
   Financial Sector Management Division and NRB. Actual achievement: NBL’s CAR is
   +0.93 % as of 15 December 2013, and its performance is regularly monitored by the
   Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and FSMD of Ministry of Finance. This indicator has been
   fully achieved, as the capital turned positive through the injection of more than NPR 3
   billion in common equity of NBL by the Government. The recapitalization of NBL
   continues through retained profits and increased further to 5.26 percent in Mid-July 2014.
   Thus, while both public banks are now solvent, neither fully meets capital requirements;
   as well, their lending and deposit taking has been subject to added NRB scrutiny.
   Following the NRB Special Inspections, the Nepalese authorities intend to divest their
   stake of NBL to a reputable strategic investor. NBL will remain under special
   supervisory control of the NRB to ensure that suitable governance and risk management
   functions remain in place until it is privatized. The ICR team recognizes that the
   resolution of NBL is to be a long drawn process and will benefit from inclusion under the
   next DPC.

4) Policy Area: Assessment of the condition of Class A, B and C financial institutions and
   potential restructuring. Policy Action: NRB has approved a program of in-depth
   diagnostics for a list of financial institutions whose aggregate assets represent over
   50% of total banking assets in Nepal, including approval of the Terms of Reference
   of the diagnostic and the initial list of the institutions on which diagnostics will be
   performed. Outcome Indicator: The NRB program of in-depth diagnostics has been
   initiated to provide comprehensive information on problem institutions. Actual
   achievement: The NRB has initiated a multiple phase program to conduct in-depth
   solvency diagnostics (or ‘Special Inspections’) of 54 banks and financial institutions in
   close coordination with DFID, which is responsible for hiring the international
   consulting firm. This indicator has been fully achieved with the identification of the 54
   financial institutions representing 65 percent of total assets and finalizing the Terms of
                                           15
   Reference. Through the preparation of the FSSC program, the NRB has recognized the
   need to undertake an in-depth assessment of financial institutions which are either
   considered to be at risk or systemic, to better understand the true situation of the financial
   sector.

   With support from DFID and the World Bank to design suitably robust terms of
   reference, the NRB launched the first phase of a comprehensive Special Inspection of 27
   financial institutions (representing about 24 percent of banking system assets) utilizing
   external auditors led by one “Big Four” accounting firm (some NRB on-site supervisory
   staff are joining this inspection led by KPMG (Portugal) as part of their annual inspection
   of the financial institution and to receive training under this program). The first-phase
   program is to be completed by end-September 2014 and the second phase of an additional
   27 banks’ Special Inspections (covering about an additional 41 percent of the banking
   sector by assets) is to be initiated by early 2015. Therefore, the inspection of all the 54
   financial institutions will not be completed prior to the next DPC.

   If the Special Inspections, which are also a part of NRB’s annual inspection program,
   identify undercapitalized banks, then the NRB is required to promptly take necessary
   prudential and/or enforcement measures, which could involve seeking recapitalization
   from private sources for viable banks and/or the orderly liquidation for non-viable banks.
   In the case of undercapitalized systemic institutions, if sufficient private capital is not
   available, then state intervention may be necessary. The medium-term government
   reform program will ensure that the Special Inspections of financial institutions are
   completed and moreover, that corrective actions are implemented for undercapitalized
   institutions.

5) Policy Area: Strengthening institutional arrangements to support the bank restructuring
   process. Policy Action: NRB has established a Bank Resolution Unit and approved a
   bank resolution manual. Outcome Indicator: The NRB Bank Resolution Unit
   operates and undertakes bank resolution. Actual achievement: Resolution Unit and
   Bank Resolution Manual approved by NRB Board in May 2013. The three (A, B & C)
   supervision departments are in position to undertake bank resolutions. This indicator was
   partially achieved at end-2013, as the by-laws to make the Unit operationally effective
   were only approved by the NRB Board in July 2014. The Bank Resolution Unit within
   NRB took longer than expected to be established and staffed by NRB to manage the
   resolution of troubled banks. The Resident Advisor financed by DFID is providing
   training to staff in this Unit.

6) Policy Area: Strengthening institutional arrangements to support the bank restructuring
   process. Policy Action: NRB has, in May 2011 and October 2012, issued,
   respectively, a by-law and amendments to the by-law, as provided for under the
   NRB Act, to facilitate mergers of financial institutions so as to consolidate and
   strengthen the financial sector. The moratorium on new license applications for
   class A, B and C financial institutions, as defined in BAFIA, and evidenced by no
   acceptance of banking license applications in 2012, has been maintained. Outcome
   Indicator: Consolidation of the financial sector underway through a decrease in
   number of financial institutions (down to 175 institutions, for Class A, B and C).
                                            16
   Actual achievement: The total number of financial institutions (Class A, B & C) reduced
   to 176 as of 31 December 2013. No new financial institutions have been licensed in
   Class A, B & C except for 4 Development Bank institutions which were processed prior
   to the moratorium being put in place or were allowed under the moratorium being in
   remote areas outside the Kathmandu valley. This indicator has been fully achieved with
   the implementation of the moratorium on new licenses for class A, B and C institutions
   and bringing down the number of financial institutions. The number of financial
   institutions was further reduced to 167 at mid-July 2014 through voluntary mergers
   supported by the NRB’s more consistent prudential posture towards supervision and
   enforcement. Additional reductions in the number of banks are envisaged by end-2014.

7) Policy Area: Strengthening institutional arrangements to support the bank restructuring
   process. Policy Action: The draft Bill on Deposit and Credit Guarantee Trust
   (DCGT) Bill has been endorsed by the Ministry of Finance for submission to
   Cabinet. Outcome Indicator:         The legal and operational framework for deposit
   insurance is ready for implementation (pending legislative approval). Actual
   achievement: The Deposit and Credit Guarantee Corporation (or DCGC, renamed from
   the DCGT) has completed amendments to the draft Deposit & Credit Guarantee Fund
   (DCGF) bill, consistent with the IADI Core Principles for an effective deposit insurance
   system. The draft Bill was approved by the DCGC for onward transmission in December
   2013 to Ministry of Finance and to Ministry of Law & Justice. This indicator has been
   partially achieved, as the draft amendment of the DCGF Bill was not accepted by either
   the international consultant provided by DFID to the DCGC or the FSAP mission. This
   led to another round of stakeholder consultations on the revised draft, which was
   approved again by the DCGC Board in July 2014, and sent to MoF for finalization and
   submission to the Cabinet. MoF is still conducting further consultations with stakeholders
   now. It is critical for the draft Bill to be approved before receiving the results of the
   Special Inspections, which might trigger the need to initiate enforcement actions or
   otherwise resolve a number of problem financial institutions.

8) Policy Area: Strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for effective bank
   resolution. Policy Action: Amendments to the NRB Act providing NRB with
   modernized tools for bank resolution have been approved by the NRB Board and
   further endorsed by the Ministry of Finance. Outcome Indicator: The legal
   framework for effective bank resolution is finalized (pending legislative approval).
   Actual achievement: Amendments to the NRB Act have been approved by the NRB Board
   and endorsed by the MoF. However, the early 2014 FSAP mission recommended
   additional amendments to Banking and Financial Institutions Act (BAFIA) and the
   DCGC draft Bill.) This indicator has been partially achieved, as both GoN and NRB
   have decided to place all three amendments in a package to Parliament, once all the
   consistency checks against other relevant laws and draft amendments have been properly
   carried out. The Central Bank’s resolution authority will be materially strengthened upon
   approval by Parliament of the proposed amendments to the NRB Act.

9) Policy Area: Increasing the transparency of the financial system. Policy Action: ICAN
   has taken the decision to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in
   July 2015 for the financial sector. Outcome Indicator: The date agreed to adopt IFRS

                                          17
       for the financial sector reflects the time required to build the capacity of the
       stakeholders to implement IFRS. Actual achievement: There has been no change in
       ICAN decision with regards to the date. Efforts to build regulatory capacity on NFRS are
       proceeding as per plan. DFID has provided assistance in establishing a regulators’
       NFRS training center and mobilization of experts to assist with the transition to NFRS.
       This indicator has been fully achieved with technical support from DFID and the World
       Bank. A set of new Nepalese Financial Reporting Standards (NFRS), compliant with
       International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were formally authorized in
       September 2013 to be effective mid-2015. Adoption of such reporting standards will
       provide a more accurate understanding of the performance of financial institutions and
       will facilitate more effective supervision and capital market debt and equity listings going
       forward. DFID is providing extensive support to train regulators in the application of the
       new NFRS in supervision and to aid in the transition of regulations and financial
       reporting to the new accounting standards.

   10) Policy Area: Increasing the transparency of the financial system. Policy Action: The
       President of Nepal has promulgated the Mutual Legal Assistance Ordinance,
       Extradition Bill Ordinance and Organized Crime Ordinance. Outcome Indicator:
       Nepal retains grey or better FATF classification which allows normal external
       financial relations (trade finance, remittance inflows and Foreign Direct
       Investment). Actual achievement: As of December 31, 2013 Nepal was retained in
       FATF’s grey list with a possibility of removal from its regular oversight subject to
       enactment of five AML/CFT related ordinances by the parliament and implementation of
       FATF recommendations. This indicator has been fully achieved with the enactment of
       five key pieces of legislation (Anti-Money Laundering Act, Mutual Legal Assistance Act,
       Proceeds of Crimes Act, Extradition Act and Organized Crime Control Act). Moreover,
       as of June 29, 2014, Nepal was removed from FATF’s watch-list, following adoption of
       these five Acts.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3.1. The Financial Sector Stability Credit was a financial sector focused, high-risk operation
prepared against the backdrop of a dynamic and uncertain set of political circumstances. That is
why the operation was initially envisaged as part of a medium-term program supported by a
series of stand-alone operations. Crucially, the Nepalese financial sector stability was
maintained through a very difficult environment: the liquidity crisis of 2011 and 2012 was well
managed by the NRB and MoF, as it did not spill over to the good banks, which continued to
operate successfully through the crisis situation. The overall progress made in adopting key
financial sector reforms in the preparation of the FSSC and thereafter in 2014 has been
commendable.

3.3.2. Given the political uncertainties, the approach adopted by the Team to prepare the FSSC
as a stand-alone operation was entirely appropriate, as it provided space to enable results to be
seen from the early actions undertaken by the authorities in the FSSC operation to mitigate risks,
and permitted the further deepening of the policy dialogue on a broader set of financial sector
reforms which could be supported by a series of follow-on operations.
                                               18
3.3.3. To that end, it is evident that the ten sets of policy actions had an important catalytic
effect upon sectoral reforms towards public bank recapitalization and restructuring, codifying the
deposit insurance framework, strengthening the prudential regime towards bank restructuring
and resolutions, AML and financial reporting. Cumulatively, the reforms put in place through
the FSSC served to strengthen financial stability, minimize the threat of a financial crisis and
moreover, prepare stakeholders for a series of essential financial sector reforms to follow.

3.3.4. Thus, given the prolongation of achievement of some FSSC policy actions, it will be
important to prepare the next DPC operation fairly quickly to build on the momentum generated
by the first operation so as to complete the remaining work in progress. While the vulnerability
of the financial sector has been substantially reduced by improving the liquidity situation of
banks, the true financial condition of some key banks remains to be ascertained. Therefore, the
Overall Outcome Rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.4.1. There was no measured poverty impacts specifically related to this operation.
Nevertheless, by averting a costly banking crisis, which has cost some countries up to 10 percent
of GDP, the DPC averted a potential increase in poverty and vulnerability stemming from a
banking crisis and its proposed reforms are expected to have overall positive poverty and social
impact. The deteriorating conditions in the economy, manifested in the banking sector instability
and the 2011 liquidity crisis, were very likely to have had an adverse impact on growth,
employment, and poverty if they had not been properly managed by NRB.

3.4.2. This operation helped mitigate the negative effects of the crisis on poverty as it broadly
aimed to: (i) increase the financial authorities’ capacity to anticipate and address risks in the
banking sector, thus avoiding a systemic crisis that could be very costly to depositors; (ii)
enhance the financial authorities’ capacity to deal with troubled banks and thus help preserve
taxpayers’ money; and (iii) facilitate the resumption in credit activities as economic growth and
political stability are better realized.

3.4.3. This ICR does not report on environment as the planned policy areas have no negative
impact on environment. Although the Policy Actions did not include any gender aspects, the
issue of access to finance by women entrepreneurs is likely to be addressed in the FSDS.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.4.4. The NRB and MoF adopted a pro-active stance with the on-set of the 2011 liquidity crisis,
having recognized its potential implications for liquidity and solvency of the banking system.
Thus, in a bid to tackle the liquidity constraints and improve prudential compliance, especially
towards systemically important public banks, the authorities moved resolutely forward with a
robust set of near-term prudential measures and launched the High Level Financial Sector
Coordination Committee (HLFSCC) to develop a strategy for the sector’s long-term


                                               19
development.    Although several hurdles have slowed down the pace of progress in
implementation, none of the reform activities have yet been halted or rolled back.

3.4.5. The newfound coordination, especially between the MoF and NRB, has proven especially
useful to their prioritizing financial sector policy changes, e.g., towards the establishment of a
deposit guarantee fund, bank consolidation, prudential compliance of public banks, undertaking
diagnostic assessments, etc. The implications of these measures in Nepal in the coming years is
likely to prove transformative to the development of a more sustainable and inclusive financial
sector.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

3.4.6. There are several very positive, indirect outcomes from the FSSC operation, which
overarch the financial sector reform agenda in Nepal.

3.4.7. Firstly, the financial sector authorities, while formulating the FSDS, have worked
extensively together through the HLFSCC in the preparation of their respective contributions to
the medium-term development and stability of the sector. The depth and breadth of this
collaborative approach to financial sector reform is without precedence in Nepal.

3.4.8. Secondly, the recent initiation of the long overdue consolidation of the banking sector has
served to signal key stakeholders and the public alike that the status quo will not be maintained.
This will have a positive knock-on effect upon NRB’s constrained on-site supervisory resources,
as the supervisors will have fewer financial institutions to supervise and inspect.

3.4.9. Thirdly, the potential fiscal implications emanating from the deposit guarantee fund and
State- controlled banks are for the first time incorporated into the policy dialogue through the
assessment of fiscal sustainability.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.1. The risk-to-development outcome is assessed as moderate for several reasons. The ICR
team is of the view that despite the quantum of policy discussions, decisions taken, and related
technical work required to fulfill the prior actions, the implementation of the actions relating to
the legal and regulatory framework for effective bank resolution, and the institutional
arrangements for bank restructuring process have not proceeded at the pace envisaged at project
approval. These two sets of actions are critical to further the consolidation of the Nepalese
financial sector and resolve any remaining problem financial institutions. As long as these
actions are not fully completed, the financial sector remains vulnerable to any shock such as
another liquidity crunch. Moreover, the results and recommendations coming out of the in-depth
solvency diagnostics will face severe challenges in implementation in the absence of these
necessary legal and regulatory framework reforms.

4.2. Although the reforms are on-track and pursued by the Ministry of Finance with the
assistance of DFID consultants and the Nepal Rastra Bank, and the sustainability of the reforms

                                                20
could be ensured by supporting the continuation of their implementation under the follow-on
DPC II, the delay in the preparation of the second DPC faces risks of further slowdown in
implementation progress. The strengthening of the legal and regulatory reforms remains
incomplete pending enactment of the laws, and the final resolution of the Nepal Bank Limited is
still uncertain. Combined with the uncertainty in the political arena, the full and complete
implementation of all the reforms initiated under this operation could face substantial risks.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.   Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1. The comprehensive design of the FSSC operation, developed over nearly two years, in the
absence of a Parliament, reflects a robust, well-conceived set of prior actions and key expected
outcomes. It is noted that, while a number of the Indicators chosen were of a high level (e.g.,
formation of a road map for the FSDS, positive capitalization of the public banks, launch of the
bank diagnostics) each represents a key dimension of public and investor confidence in the
financial sector. As such, this set of indicators served as a reasonable proxy for continuing
financial stability, essential to the ability of the banking sector to fulfill its intermediation role.
Considering the banking sector’s sharply deteriorating financial performance during the project
preparation phase, the quality at entry of the Bank is assessed as Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.2. The Bank devised an effective, concerted approach to working with counterparts in the
development of the financial sector reform program. The Bank cooperated effectively with the
MoF, which served as coordinator of activities on the Borrower’s side and maintained very close
cooperation with the NRB and other key stakeholders, namely the State-controlled banks and
DFID, as the latter’s technical assistance provided substantial key inputs in the development and
implementation of the FSSC reform program.
5.1.3. The Bank provided assistance through a number of challenging reforms with persistence
and delivered with DFID and the IMF high-level support in all policy areas. Key counterparts in
the Government of Nepal and the NRB were very satisfied with the technical support and the
concerted approach to developing and prioritizing reforms. The Bank Management’s decision to
make this a stand-alone DPC due to the uncertain country context was appropriate given the
results achieved and the government’s continued commitment to the reforms. The completion of
the Prior Actions enabled the Bank to disburse the funds under the Credit two months prior to
project closing. However, the rather short end-2013 closing of the FSSC program did not
provide the time needed to complete the work on the three partially achieved Policy Actions.
Therefore, this work continued beyond the closing date and has materially advanced to a final
stage at the time of writing this ICRR. Therefore, the quality of supervision has been assessed as
Moderately Satisfactory.


                                                  21
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.4. The overall performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory since the Bank performance in
Ensuring Quality at Entry is Satisfactory and in Quality of Supervision is Moderately
Satisfactory, and the overall outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.


5.2.   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2.1. Crucially, the authorities maintained financial stability through a very difficult political
transitional environment. They completed all the Prior Actions and their commitment to the
policy reforms continued as: they requested for the FSAP which was scoped out in December
2013 and carried out in February 2014; submitted the five laws relating to AML/CFT to the new
Parliament for ratification; and converted the Special Inspections into NRB’s regular annual
supervision. The authorities also continued their work on the partially achieved Policy Actions,
although they are not hard pressed for budgetary support from the Bank, given their budget
surpluses. The delay in achievement of some of the expected outcomes of the policy actions,
were in part due to Bank and DFID inputs to improve the draft amendments to the legislation.
Moreover, the establishment and operation of the bank resolution unit at the NRB was delayed
owing to internal challenges to be overcome and the resolution of the NBL is now underway, but
is likely to be protracted. Therefore, the quality of Government Performance has been assessed
as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2. The declining performance of the financial sector, the liquidity crisis of 2011, and the
insolvency of the two leading State-controlled banks together played a critical role in driving the
pace of implementation of the reforms. The Government attached due consideration to the
consultation process, which also has had the effect of prolonging the approval processes.
Nevertheless, it is apparent the consultations with the bankers’ association and key banks did not
include a robust discussion on the full range of envisaged reform actions expected as some banks
the ICRR team met with did not appreciate the achievements to date or the direction in which the
reform program was moving. In sum, the authorities’ commitment to key financial sector policy
reforms continues, as is evident from their work in 2014 to advance the partially achieved Policy
Actions.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1. This operation was designed in response to the client’s expressed need during a period of
impending crisis in the financial sector and has worked reasonably well to withstand the crisis
situation and bring the financial sector back to a more stable condition. In the process, some
important lessons have been learned. Some of these lessons are:

   (i)     By quickly responding to the client’s request for assistance, the Bank continues to be
           regarded as a valued partner. It was important to maintain sufficient flexibility to
           adapt and respond to client needs and economic realities in the country. Parliament
           was non-existent throughout the project preparation phase, and moreover, the external
           environment was rather negative during this period, adding urgency to the need to
           adopt financial sector-related reforms. Good coordination among the authorities and
           the timely provision of necessary technical assistance provided better, more informed
           decision making by all parties involved.
   (ii)    Bank assistance and support in simply initiating difficult reform actions through this
           operation facilitated the client’s ability and momentum to continue the full and
           complete implementation of these reform actions, even after the operation closed,
           albeit at a slower pace. Moreover, it has also generated the momentum to continue
           the implementation of the medium-term government program.
   (iii)   The slowdown in implementation of some key policy actions after the release of the
           FSSC funds implies that the scope of the reforms was ambitious in the context of
           Nepal’s political circumstances.
   (iv)    The implications of the short time frame for the closure of the FSSC oblige the need
           for a more realistic timeframe in the follow-on programmatic operations and secondly,
           for a more narrowly defined PDO and set of outcome indicators for the planned
           programmatic operations.
   (v)     Cooperation among international agencies (i.e., DFID, IMF, ADB) proved essential,
           since extensive technical assistance has been provided and coordinated with this
           operation and aligned with the country’s priorities and strategic goals. This
           cooperation was underscored by the central role played by the Government of Nepal
           through the Ministry of Finance, SEBON, the Insurance Board, and the NRB.
           Further, the reforms in the financial sector in which the Bank had a comparative
           advantage, were designed in cooperation with the IMF, with key TA support provided
           by DFID.
   (vi)    The cooperation of the Bank with DFID should be specifically noted as an example of
           how two development partners can work together to contribute to the success of a
           complex and challenging operation. Starting in early 2012, the Bank and DFID
           established working arrangements which provided “seamless” coordination between
           their two teams, with DFID contributing experts to work as part of the Bank team and
           all missions identified to the authorities as joint missions, while the Bank team
           provided inputs for the design of DFID support. In parallel, DFID technical
           assistance support to the authorities was linked explicitly to support the
           Government’s efforts to help implement the FSSC’s prior actions in key areas.
           DFID’s willingness to commit large-scale resources to capacity building has
           undoubtedly increased the authorities’ confidence to move ahead with highly

                                              23
            demanding medium term reforms, such as the NRB’s Special Inspections program
            and the transition of the regulatory community to NFRS. The broadening of the
            DFID technical assistance program over the coming years should also allow
            expansion of the scope of forthcoming DPC operations and Bank-DFID cooperation
            is continuing as the preparation of additional DPCs moves forward.

Subject: RE: Invitation: Decision Review Meeting for the ICRR: NEPAL: Financial Sector DPC
(P129929) on September 22, 2014, at 8AM (DC) and 5:45PM (Kathmandu)

Dear Shams:

Thank your for the opportunity to comment on the ICRR. I have managed to read the document
now. My comments are based on reading it and my involvement with this work mostly in this
year. I am not aware of internal process at the Bank and thus am not sure if they can be
addressed in the ICRR or somewhere else.

   a) I just did a quick search on the acronym, DFID, in the document. There are 40 instances
      of that word in the document, interspersed through the text. DFID’s role and its
      contributions have been nicely captured in the document. Thank you for this
      acknowledgement and making it visible. I think this reflects the degree of collaboration
      and partnership that we have maintained throughout this support and hope it will continue
      in the future. I wonder if there can be a sub-section within Section 5 to note the Donor
      Collaboration and Performance.
   b) The document gives a brief but good background on the programme at the beginning and
      the evolution to how the DPC was taken up. The meaty section in my view (Assessment
      of Outcomes) describes the latest status quite well (though I have some questions below).
      I particularly noticed a section on page 16 where the connection between SIP and DCGC
      reform is nicely interlinked. Similarly, the section on unintended outcomes on page 21 is
      a nice value addition.
   c) As informed by Sabin dai, you and Andrew, the performance rating has been upgraded.
      It would be good to know how the ratings are assigned and what has driven the change in
      ratings. This brings to one of my questions which is to see if a particular indicator is
      judged more important (have more weightage) than others. This would help us
      understand questions like which indicator is more resource intensive, risky and/or a
      priority as well.
   d) My major concern, which is similar in line with Miguel’s, is on describing and assessing
      the risks to the programme. On page 3, the report suggests that the government faced
      resistance from vested interests. On page 11 and page 22, the document notes that the
      programme could face substantial risks due to uncertainty in the political front. On page
      15, it notes that the resolution of NBL will be a long-drawn process. Several hurdles for
      implementation have been mentioned on page 21 without pointing what they are. I
      suggest that the risks section be elaborated in order to capture key risks (its nature,
      implications to programme) not only to execution but also to sustaining the reforms,
      which can then help develop appropriate risk mitigation measures. I am also concerned
      that if there are vested interests, which is likely, what and to what extent we as donors


                                             40
      can influence the risks to reforms. It would also be nice to link these risks especially in
      the context of laws and regulations that are being undertaken.
   e) In the context of risks, the document can add value if it can point to practicalities
      involved in some reforms. For example, on NFRS training (page 18) it would be good to
      note how practical and likely is the ICAN’s date for promulgation of NFRS. We have
      been informed by the high ranking NRB officials that this would be a staged approach as
      the ICR notes on page 13. On a slightly different context, as the report notes on page 22, I
      wonder what can be done to mitigate the risks from slowdown in reforms post
      disbursement of the fund. I assume that a series of DPCs is perhaps the kind of
      motivation to the government to continue with reforms. But is it how this will be?
   f) On page 20, the report notes that the gender analysis is not relevant. However, if we look
      at the Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS) from the point of a long-run road
      map, the access to financial services for women is an important aspect. Should we not
      include a gender component as part of FSDS?
   g) From a readability perspective, the report could add value if some small changes are
      made such as a) explaining upfront what a two-stage approach is; I found some reference
      to what it meant only on page 24; b) including a summary (perhaps a couple of sentences)
      of total indicators at the beginning of Section 3.2; c) Include the M&E findings reported
      on page 22 in annex; and d) note the latest status (up to September) of indicators on
      section 3.2 as footnote.

As I informed before, I will be conducting a review from our side in the near future. I would pass
them along once completed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
