REPORT AND RFCOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
'1 THE EXECUTIVE DIRECMORS
ON A PROPOSiD LOAN MID CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
and a proposed development credit, each for the equivalent of US$3 million,
to the Republic of Honduras to help finance an education proj,ect.  The loan
would have a term of 30 years,including 10 years of grace, with interest
at 7 1/4 percent per annum.   The development credit would be on standard
IDA terms.
PART I - TME EC aWOMY
2.        The economy of Honduras was discussed in paragraphs 2-11 of the
President's Report dated September 25, 1973 on a proposed credit to the
Republic of Honduras for the Second Livestock Developnent Project (Report
No. P-1293a-HO).   These paragraphs, together with a country Data Sheet,
are attached hereto as Annex 15 they cover among other things the reasons
for regarding Honduras as a blend country for purooses of Bank/IDA lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATICMS IN HONDURAS
3.        Beginning with a loan oC US$U.2 million for roads in 1955, Honduras
has to date,ieceived ltelve Bank loans totalling US$89.2 million and six
IDA credits totalling US$30.6 million, both net of cancellations. The
proposed loan and credit would raise the total of Bank and IDA assistance
from US$119.8 million to US$125.8 million; they cover among other things
4.        Execution of Bank Group financed projects hns, on the whole, been
satisfactory.  Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of August 31, 1973, and notes on the execution
of on-going projects.
5).       In the past, Bank and IDA lending has been heavily concentrated
on transport and powTer, where inadequate facilities hampered the development
of the country. The livestock development credit approved in 1970,
however, marked a first step towards diversifying lending. In our future

Lrzuer 5t parl by givinr  -;c.:ea-d em-ohasis to investment ir tre social
coinmodity -rodlc:-m s,--ctors while continl;ing to lend for o'hysical
;- structure, --where there are still substantial deficiencies to oe overcome.
As the agricultural sector remains the decisive element in the
coi-r tryj's econoaaic and social development we intend to expand our activities
rn the sector.  The objectives of lending for agriculture will be to assist
in d:iversifyving the economy, (ieveloping con-petitive exports in high-vplue
rodrlcts, and sutpporting the Government's efforts in agrarian reform and
marpol:er training.  The livestock sector will be further supported by an IDA credit
appro.-v euy the Executive Lirectors in October 1973. Also, the iBRD/FAO
Cooperative Program has begun assisting the Government in the preparation of
tle oroposed first phase of the Comayagua Valley integrated rural develooment
project.  In furtherance of our objectives in the agricultural sector, the pro-
posed project includes an agricultuiral education component.
In transport, we hope to continue to assist the Government to
complete the highway links between the main regions of the country, but would
in the future place greater emphasis on assistance in the construction of a
netwo-o '<if of ieeder and access roads to sup-ort the Government's agricultural
prograrm.
8.        We plan to assist industry in Honduras as well as in the other
Central American countries by lending to the Central American Bank for
ILconomic Integration (CABEI).  Lending for industry through a multinational
institution such as CABEI would support the Central American integration
effort; foster rational industrialization in the area wThere nationnl markets
are too small to permit effir ±ent industrial development; and assist in
diversifying the region's economy.  The appraisal mission for a first lending
operation to CAEEI is now preparing its report.
9.        IFC has participated in two projects in Honduras.   A total of
US$387,000 was invested in a leather tanning project in 196` and 1966. A
second operation was a pilot project for the pulp and paper industry to
utilize the wood resources of the Olancho Reserve. A pilot company, Compania
Pino Celulosa de Centroamerica, A.A. (COPINO), was established in^ June 1968,
under the leadership of International Paper Company (IPC), to investigate
and possibly carry out a project.  IFC invested US$75,ooo in COPINO in 1969
and 1970. In March 1971, iPC discontinued its participation in COPDaO0, and
efforts to find other technical partners have so far been unsuccessful.   The
new Govermment, which took office in December 1972, wishes to exploit the
Olancho forest, but specific plans are still being formulated.

PART III - EDUCATION IN HONDURAS
10.       The Honduran education system has undergone rapid growth in the
last ten years.  Fnrollments between 1962 and 1972 increased annually by
about 65 percent in primary education, 12 percent in secondary education,
and 15 percent in higher education. The sector, however, still suffers
from major weaknesses. Imbalances favoring urban areas have not been
corrected, nor has the expansion stressed the training of middle-level
technical manDower to meet the needs of the economy.  Moreover, the system
still operates with inadequate curricula and a shortage of trained teachers
and physical facilities. There are also deficiencies in education management
stemming from an over-centralized administrative structure.   The lack of
educational opportunities, both formal and non-formal, has created a work
force with a very low level of education and training which seriously
affects productivity. Fewer than 1 percent of the labor force has had
higher education, about 3 percent has had secondary education, and only 12
percent has completed primary education.
Education Administration
11.       The Ministry of Education has the major responsibility for fonmulat-
ing policy and administering formal public education and training in Honduras.
The Ministry also has control over some types of literacy programs, but rmost
of the non-formal education and training activities are under the control of
the Ministries of Labor and Natural Resources and vprious autonomous insti-
tutions and private organizations.   Higher education is in the hands of the
National Uni--ersity and one private and three public institutions.
12.       Educational administration suffers from an overcentralized, slow
decision-making oroceEs, dl½etLon of services, weak planning, and inadequate
financial and accounting procedures. Lines of authority and responsibility
are poorly defined, as is personnel policy in general, and there is a clear
lack of coordination between the Ministry of Education and the other agencies
dealing with education and training.   There is, therefore, a pressing need
to improve educational administration and decentralize responsibility to the
regional level.
The Formal System
13.       The formal education system consists of six years of primary
education, five to six years of secondary education, and post-secondary
education varying in length from two to seven years. Primary education,
covering ages 7-13, is provided free in public schools and is compulsory.
In spite of some recent gains, primary education is still inefficient. Enroll-
ment, at 412,000 in 1972, represents 81 percent of the relevant age group,
but wastage is high, and only about 36 percent of the students entering the
system in urban areas and about 8 percent in rural areas finish primary



- LI -
::icc-vi-  As-ic.e from deficient teaching facilitias anc ir.adequate curricula,
..zgn r_ S -.as-age ra-e canl e at'trib'uted to the rigid exam'natior, system, non-
ic- rorcemne.t of the attendance law . and the fact tihat a large number of rural
E '*o  of'fer fewer than six grades, thus preventing the r-Lral children from
ccn2 hneir educatiDn.  The supply of primary teschers, while above
re`eui-Ed levels from a quantitative point of view, has been qualitatively very
iL        AboIIt 71 percent of the students completirng primary education
enroll in-j secondary schools.  Public secondary education is free, but not
comlpu sory.  In 1972 the total enrollment in secondary education amounted to
L,000, representing 14 percent of the relevant age group.   Secondary
education comprises a three-year lower cycle of general subjects followed
by two to three years of upper secondary education with courses in the
humanities, sciences, technical and vocational subjects, as well as primary
tieacher traininog and agricultural education.  Most secondary education is
conducted by private institutionis.  In 1972 only 26 percent of the total
enrcllmen- was in Dublic secondary schools.  In general, the quality of
secondary level education is deficient, particularly in the areas of
primary teacher training, technical and vocational education, and agricul-
tural training, all of which suffer from a lack of qualifi-ed teachers,
outdsted programs and inadequate facilities.
15.       Honduras' higher educa`ion system includes the National University
anrd four institutions specializing in forestry, agriculture, social services
ana secondary teacher training.   The University of Honduras has considerably
expanded in recent years, and, with IDT support, has established the newe
Faculties of Agriculture and of Mechanical, Electrical and Chemical Engineering.
The National School of Fores-try, the Pan-American Agricultural School and
the School of Social Services offer three-year post-secondary courses in their
respective areas, The UNDP and FAG are presently assisting the School of
Forestry, and USAID has in the past provided techrical and financial assistance
to the Agricultural School.  The Secondary Teacher Training College prepares
secondary school teachers through a four-yenr program. Although the annual
recuirement of new teachers is about b00, the school's output has averaged
only 55 during the past five years.  The Government has obtained technical
assistance from the UNDP to reorganize the college, introduce modern educational
techniques and establish new areas of training.
Non-Formal Education and Training
16.       Honduras has few non-formal education and training programs, and
toose that exist -- for the training of skilled workers, artisans, super-
visors and managers -- have had so far little impact on the economy.   The
creatiorn in December 1972, however, of the Instituto Nacional de Formacion
Prof.sional (INFOP) as an autonomous agency to promote the training of in-
dustrialt workers is expected JO lead to an improvement in the cjuality of the
work fo.ce and to provide new training opportunities for aduits and out-of-
school youlths. N_,FC* is currenrtly receiving technical assistance from UNDP/
KO a!d bilateral sources to h elp set up its training programs. 7he upgrading
of existuin  workers and the estsblishment of vocational training centers are
some of 1,-.:-'s mriost immediate concerns.



Education Finance
17.       The Central Government has the major resDonsibility for financing
public education, although local governm-nts help by meeting the costs of
some primary school construction and maintenance. The Government also provides
private secondary schools with sibsidies, which account for about 17 percent of
Central Government recurrent expenditures for secondary education. The National
University is autonomous and entitled by law to receive 2 percent of the national
budget.
18.       Public expenditure ir. education ha.s increased in recent
years and now stands at 18 percent of total public expenditure and 4 percent
of GDP. On a per capita basis, zentral government expenditure in education
grew from US$6.6 in 1967 to US$10.5 in 1972, but this latter figure is still
low0 when compared with similar expenditures in other Central American and
Caribbean countries.
19.       The Ministry of Education's share of central government investment
grew from 4.5 percent in 1967 to 9 percent in 1972, indicating increasing
attention to fixed investment in the education sector. Major investments
in the sector have included the CARE-supported primary school expansion
program, the construction of secondary schools with AID assistance,
and the expansion of the National University with IDB financial support.
With recurrent expenditures increasing at about 12 percent per year,
however, the share of fixed investment still represented only 10 percent
(excluding investment in non-formal training) of total public expenditures in
education in 1972. One of the principal reasons for the rise in recurrent
expenditures has been a rather liberal Government policy with respect to
teacher's salaries, which account for about 97 percent of recurrent expenditures
in primary schools, 93 percent in secondary general schools, and 73 percent
in secondary vocational schools. This leaves an inadequate proportion of
expenditures for educational a.ids and teaching equipment.
Development Program
20.       The Government is anxious to improve the quality and efficiency of
th.e educational system by modernizing teaching methods and curricula; by upgrading
the teaching staff and improving physical facilities; by correcting existing
imbalances through providing increased educationnl opportunities in the rural
areas and in public secondary schools; and by reforming technical education
and expanding non-formal vocational training.   To carry out these plans in
an effective manner, it proposes to regionalize the administration of
education, giving local governments and communities greater responsibility
for management and school supervision while retaining policy-making functions
in the Ministry of Education. The Government wants also to consolidate primary
teacher training - now offered at 47 institutions - in four schools located
in key areas of the country. The Government has already enlisted the support
of the UND? and UNESCO to help in strengthening educational planning, and is



-6-
also receiving CARE and USAID financial and techrnical assistance in the
constr'cction of additional school Lacilities. The new facilities are
expected to provide some 200,000 additional student places in rural
zriiaary schools and about 20,000 new places in secondary schools.  This
dould micrease the percentage of age group enrollment by 1980 to 93 percent
at the primary level and 25 percent at the secondary level, and change the
present ratio of enrollment in public secondary education from 26 to h6
percent of total secondary enrollment. The proposed project, which would
hrelp in improving and rationalizing the training of primary and secondary
school teachers as well as in strengthening technical and vocational
education, would be a suitable complement to the above efforts.
21.       Implementation of the above plans would require an investment
expenditure of about US$6 million equivalent a year up to 1980, about one-
half of which the Government hopes to obtain from external sources. Current
expenditure would increase at an annual rate of about 12 percent, which is
similar to the growth rate during the past five years. As a result, total
public expenditure in education is expected to grow from 3.5 percent to 5
percent of GDP by 1980. To carry out its education development program
as a whole the Government will need to adopt new revenue measures in tne course
of the next few years. We have reviewed this matter with the Government during
negotiations and we intend to continue our dialogue in the context of our country
economic work. Moreover, the Goverment has agreed to undertake periodic reviews
of its plans and targets at the primary and secondary education levels to
ensure that these plans and targets are compatible with its financial capacity.
These reviews will also highlight the need for additional revenue measures.
PLRT IV - THE P13DJECT
22.       A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in Honduras"
(No. 2h7-HOa, dated December 7, 1973) is being distributed seperately. The
main features of the project and of the proposed loan and credit are summarized
in Annex III.
23.       The proposed project, which would be the Bank Group's first for
education in Honduras, was identified by a UNESCO mission which visited
Honduras at the request of the Government in July/August 1971. The mission's
report served as a basis for discussions between the Bank/IDA and the
Government in the second half of 1972 regarding the items to be considered
for possible financing, and for the subsequent preparation of the project
by the Government with UNESCO assistance. The project was appraised in the
field during March/April 1973, and negotiations were held in Washington from
October 29 to November 1, 1973.   The Honduran delegation was led by the
Minister of Finance, Mr. Manuel Acosta-Bonilla, and included the Honduran
Ambassador in Washington, Mr. Roberto Galvez, and representatives from the
Ministries of Education and Natural' Resources, the Planning Office and INFOP.

Project Description
24.       In line with the Government's develonment strategy, the proposed
project would aim a.t (a) alleviating the present shortage of qualified
tea.chers and improving and broadening the training of primary teachers to
include rura.l community leadership; (b) increasing tr2ining opportunities
for middle-level agricultural manpower and for industrial workers to meet
regional needs and upgrade the labor force; (c) establishing experimental
rural tra:Lning centers that would provide, in addition to farmer trairing,
training of women in home economics and of youths in rural development
schemes and rural community leadership.  Many of the project institutions
would be located outside urban centers, thus contributing to a more equitable
distribution of educational opportunities throughout the country. The
following would be constructed, funished and equipped under the prolect:
(a)  Two new and two extensions of primary teacher training
schools,and twelve new rural primary schools for pract:ce
teaching ("application primary schools").
(b) One secondary teacher trainin)g college and one "application
secondary school";
(c)  Two vocational training centers and one industrial training
development center; and
(d) Three new agricultural training centers and the expansion
of the existing agricultural secondary school.
The project would elso include related technical assistance and training.
The project institutions would provide a. total of 5,080 student places,
including 4,480 new, places of which more than 50 percent would be for
teacher training.
25.       When completed, the four primary teacher trajning schools, located
in the capital city of Tegucigalpa and in the -western, central and eastern
regions of the country, would have an enrollment capacity of 2,000 and an
annual output of about 600 teachers. The schools would also have facilities
for upgrading the training of unemployed teachers,thus helping to meet the annual
demand of about 800 trained primary teachers. The schools' new curriculum
would be improved and broadened to orient the teacher training towards the
needs of the rural areas for which purpose special facilities would be con-
structed in all four schools. Trainees would practice in twelve application
primary schools to be constructed in selected rural areas. Present teaching
staff of the primary teacher training schools would be trained to implement
the new curriculum.  The Government has agreed to commence the in-service
training program for the teaching staff not later than December 31, 1974,
so that the upgrading will have been accomplished by the time the schools
are completed.



26.       The new secondary teacher training college, to be built in Tegu-
cigalpa, would help satisfy the demand fs secondary school teachers created
by the expansion Df secondary education. The college would replace an
existing unsuitable one and, operating on a doub3e shift basis, would have a
total enrollment of about 1600 and an output of about 350 teachers per year.
It would provi:e pre-service training courses of four year's duration, and
short courses to train university graduates for entry into teaching.   Pro-
spective teachers would gain practical teaching experience in the appli-
cation secondary school to be annexed to the college. The college curriculum
woula be revised under a UNDP technical assistance programn.
27.       The two vocational training centers - one in Tegucigaloa and the
other in the principal industrial city of San Pedro !ula - would have a
total capacity of 510 student places. With a two-shift system, they would
upgrade some 7,200 workers and train about 1,200 new entrants to the work
force each year in line with estimcLted manpower needs. In addition, some
2,000 to 3,000 workers woulct be trained on the 1ob throueh i-liit programs.
INFOP would be responsible for the centers and the Government has agreed to
have INFOP (i) adopt occupational analysis as the basis for the curriculum,
(ii) use short, self-contained training modules as a means of ensuring
flexibility of the curriculum, and (iii) carry out short, supplementary
training courses for graduates of ->he technical schools to prepare them for
employment. A placement service recently established by the Govennment in
the Ministry of Labor will, in cooperation with INFOP, help trainees from
the above centers find suitable employment.
28.       Incorporated in the Tegucigalpa Vocational Training Center would be
an Industrial Training Development Center to help plan and implement the
above program and to assist enterprises to identify their training needs and
undertake in-plant programs.
29.       The expansion of the agricultural secondary school at Catacamas
would help increase agricultural productivity by meeting the requirements
for agricultural technicians.   The capacity of the agricultural school would
be increased from 100 to 240 student places with an annual output of about
70 technicians. The school would be completely reorganized under the Direc-
torate of Agricultural Development in the Ministry of Natural Resources, and
the curriculum would be revised to include a greater share of practical courses.
A management board chaired by the Minister of Natural Resources and repre-
senting institutions in the agriculture and education sectors would set
policy and oversee the school reorganization and activities.    Tne reorgani-
zation of the school, to be carried out in consultation with the Bank/IDA,
would commence not later than December 31, 1974, aid would be finished by
the time of the completion of the expansion of the school.



- 9 -
30.       The three new agricultural training centers - one each at Catacanmas,
La Lujosa and La Esperanza - would offer courses to farmers and homemakers
with emphasis on improved farming methods, organization of cooperatives, home
management and community leadership.  The centers would also train extension
workers and youths in rural development activities. It is estimated that
with an overall capacity of 150 places a total of about 2,000 persons would be
trained each year. The centers, which would be also under the control of the
Ministry of Natural Resources, would be experimental in nature and would be
evaluated during project implementation with a view to nationwide expansion.
31.       The project would include 23.5 man/years of technical assistance
and 46 man/years of fellowships. The technical specialists, to be employed
under terms and canditions satisfactory to the Bank and IDA, would assist
the Government in the administrative reform of education (2 man/years); ir.
implementing the reorganization of primary teacher training and upgrading
the teacher trainers (6 man/years); implementing the national vocational
training scheme (8.5 man/years); carrying out the development program. of
the, agricultural secondary school (6 man/years); and reinforcing the
project unit (1 man/year). In addition, UNDP will finance 7 man/years of
specialist services for the improvement of the secondary teacher training
program. Under the fellowship program, local counterparts would be -trained
abroad in various disciplines related to the project.
32.       To assure that quantity and quality improvements are met in the
most efficient manner, the Government would periodically review the relation-
ship between new students and in-service trainees to be acditted to the
primary and secondary teacher training programs. The Government would also
establish in all project institutions a system to trace student dropout,
graduation and subsequent employment. This systematic follow-up would permit
an assessment of the success of the project in attaining its objectives.
Costs and Financing
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated a1; US$8.7 million, of
which US$5.o million, or 58 percent, represents foreign exchange costs.
Construction costs make up 48 percent of the total cost; furniture and
equipment, 20 percent; technical assistance, 11 percent; and physical and
price contingencies, 21 percent. The proposed Bank loan and IDA credit
totalling US$6.0 million would finance about 69 percent of total project
costs, US$5.0 million of foreign exchange and US$1.0 million equivalent
of local costs. Local currency financing is justified in Honduras on the
grounds that, in spite of its efforts to mobilize local resources for
development, the Government must still rely upon external financing in excess of
the foreign exchange component of individual projects to carry forward an
effective development program. The balance of the project costs, equivalent
to US$2.7 million, would be financed by the Government. 'While the implementation
of the education development program as a whole will be dependent on the adoption
of new fiscal measures (paragraph 21). the execution of the proposed project
would be needed and is feasible even in the absence of sudh measures. Ihe teachers



'trained under the project should be fully utilized even if enrollment
rat-.os memained at current levels rather than being increased in accordance
with the plan.  The Government has agreed to make adequate annual budget
provisions for the construction and subsequent operation of the project
and should have the financial capacity to do so even in the abpence o.
new fiscal measures.
Project Ehtity
34.       The Government will establish a project unit within the Technical
Secretariat of the Consejo Superior de Planificacion Economica (CONSUPLAN)
to be responsible for overall administration of the project and to coordinate
activities within the Government and provide liaison with the Bank/IDA.   The
unit would have a full-time director, appointed in consultation with the
Bank/!DA, who would report to the Executive Secretary of CONSUPLAN but
would be empowered to make all day-to-day decisions relating to the operation
of the unit.  The unit would also have a full-time architect or engineer
experienced in school con struction, an accountant and a procurement officer,
all appointed in consultation with the Bank/IDA. The Ministries of Education
and Natural Resources and INFOP each would appoint a project liaison officer
who would, in cooperation with the project unit, be responsible for organizing
within their institutions technical work required in project imple,nentation.
The Government would enter into a contractual arrangement with INFOP, satis-
factory to the Bank/IDA, providing for the latter's participation in the
project; the execution of such a contract would be a condition of disbursement
of the loan and credit for INFOP activities. The establishment of the project
unit and the appointment of the project director and architect (or engineer)
would be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan and credit; all
others mentioned above would be appointed within three months from the date
of effectiveness of the loan and credit agreements.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.       Furniture and equipment would be procured on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank/IDA procurement
guicelines, the exception being contracts costing less than US$5,000, which
would be procured in accordance with Honduras' normal procurement procedures
and which in the aggregate would not exceed the equivalent of US$170,000.
Contracts for civil works wouli also be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. However, because of their small size and dispersed
location, constracts for the twelve rural primary application schools are
not likely to attract foreign companies.   Therefore, since there would be
little, if any, advantage derived from international advertising, these
contracts would be advertised locally only. Architectural and engineering
design work not done by the Kinistry of Education's own design group would
be contracted to consulting firms under terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank/IDA. For purposes of bid comparisons and contract awarding
and at the request of the Government, Honduran manufacturers of furniture
and equipment 'would be granted a preference of 15 percent-of the c.i.f.
price or tne currently applicable import duty, whichever is lower.



- 11 -
36.       For furniture and equipment the loan and credit would be dis-
bursed against 100 percent of foreign expenditures of imported goods or
100 percent of the ex-factory cost of domestically manufactured goods.
Disbursements would also be made against 100 percent of foreign expenditures
for specialistst services, 100 percent of total expenditures for fellowships,
and 52 percent of total expenditures for civil works and architectural and
engineering design work.  The disbursement schedule is indicated in Annex III.

EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S REPORT DATED SEPTEMER 25, 1973, ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS FOR A
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (REPORT NO. P-1293a-HO)*
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Recent Developments and Prospects
2.        A report entitled "Basic Report on the Economy of Honduras"
(CA-19a) was distributed to the Executive Directors in June 1972 (R72-19O).
The main recarnmendations of this report stress the importance of policies
to diversify the econamy, especially through Government action to encourage
forestry, the necessity of negotiating a reasonable basis for renewed ful'l
participation of Honduras in the Central American Common Market (CACM), and
the desirability of increasing tax revenues. A mission to update econornic
information visited Honduras in August 1973. Its findings are reflected in
this summary; an Updating Economic Report is scheduled for distrib-ution to
the Executive Directors late this year. *A country data sheet is attcched
as Annex I.
3.        Honduras has a small open economy, heavily dependent on the export
of bananas, although a modest degree of diversification has taken place in
the last decade through the development of new export products such as meat,
simple manufactures, cotton and tobacco. Its limited resources consist
mainly of the fertile coastal plain in the north, a few fertile valleys in
the east, and extensive but largely unexploited natural pine forests. Known
mineral deposits are not extensive; they include silver, lead and zinc, which
have been exploited on a small scale for decades, and low-grade iron ore.
Although the average population-to-land ratio is favorable, population has
traditionally concentrated in the mountainous west, the poorest agricultural
area of the country, and on the north coastal plain. In the future, as
population pressure increases in these areas, heavy investment in physical
infrastructure will be necessary to facilitate the movement of population to
less heavily settled areas further to the east. This process has already
started as the road network was improved and expanded in recent years.
4.        With per capita income of about US$290 in 1971,-/ Honduras is the
poorest country in Central America. Real GDP rose at an average annual rate
of 4.7 percent during 1965-72, but much of this expansion took place during
the first three years of this period, as a consequence of substantial invest-
ment and large increases in output and export of bananas. From 1969 through
1972 economic growth has been quite low, real per capita income growing at
a yearly rate of 1.2 percent.  Inflation has been limited:   the consumer price
index rose at a rate of 2.1 percent per year from 1965 to 1972. Several
factors contributed to the slow growth of the economy during the last few
years, including severe hurricane damage to banana and other crops in 1969,
I/ Calculated according to World Bank Atlas methodology.
* Distributed under covering memorandum IDA/R73-103 of September 26, 1973.
-  Distribution has been delayed to permit a review of the findings with the
Government; the report is now expected to be distributed in February 1974.

coiinciding -aitth the armed conflict between Honduras and El Salvador and the
consequent reduction in private investment and the withdrawal by Honduras
from the free trade arrangements of the Central American Common Market
(CACY), a move which adversely affected a number of export industries.
Wide-spread drought in 1972, and storms and floods in the banana plantations
in 1973 have resulted in a large loss in agricultural production. By mid-
1973, however, there were signs that the economy was pulling out of this
period of relative stagnation. Export prices were improving and the
Government's budgetary position was stronger.  Following the severe
deterioration in the balance-of-payments in 1969-70, the net international
reserves' position improved during 1971-72, a move which will probably
be continued in 1973. The rate of inflation in 1973 will, hiowever, be
above the historical rate and may be of the order of 5 percent, both
because of the production problems in the agric-ultural sector and
because of higher import prices.
5.        The CACM was an important element in the growth of the Honduran
economy during the 1960's. The CACM absorbed Honduran exports of staples
which have no ready market elsewhere, and it provided the additional markets
necessary for the establishment of factories making textiles, clothing,
chemiicals and metal products. The Honduran authorities felt, however, that
the benefits of integration, etspecially in terms of industrial investment,
were unequally distributed among the member countries.  The other CACM
members recognize the basis for the Honduran comnplaints, and during the past
two years have sought solutions to the problem.  As an interim solution to
basic Cormon Market problems, Honduras has nego-tiated bilateral trade agree-
ments with all its CACM partners except El Salvador. In the meantime, the
Common Market Secretariat (SIECA) has prepared a study which proposes solu-
tions to existing problems, and makes recommendations geared to the formation
of a Central American Economic Community. The report has been well received
by the CACM member governments, including Honduras. Once a political settle-
ment is reached between Honduras and El Salvador -- which the two governments
have indicated they expect to reach in early 1971 -- there should be more
rapid progress toward integration objectives.
6.        During most of the 1960's the Governmrent sharply increased its
investment in development projects.  Among the major achievements in this
period were the establishment of a basic transport network connecting the
main population centers, the expansion of electric power and telecommuni-
cations services, and the doubling of primary school enrollment.  Until
196QW there were no financial difficulties in carrying forward these schemes,
mainly because of the fast growth of government revenues based on the intro-
duction of a general sales tax and higher income tax rates in 1964, and larger
tax payments by the banana companies.  After 19669, however, the public sector
experienced a sharp deterioration in its finances, initially because of
defense and other emergency expenditures connected with the 1969
conflict with El Salvador, andl later because the normal growth of government
current expenditures outstripped the current revenues,  Public sector
savings declined from an average of 2.7 percent of GDP in 1966-68 to 1.6
percent of GDP in 1969-71.  In spite of this, the public sector maintained
an impressive investment effort with the average investment ratio rising from
3.6 to 6.2 percent of GDP over the same period. A large increase in net
foreign financing did not cover the overall public sector deficit, and the
Central Bank was required to finance the gap, equivalent to about 1.3 percent



ANIN E X I
T      of 7
of GDP in 1969-71.  In 1972 the Central Goverrment was able to improve its
financial position, but this was in large part the result of a 20 percent
drop in investment expenditures. In the first half of 1973, the Government's
financial position continued to improve, but this year it uras the result of
an increase in current revenues and tight control over current expenditures.
Investment expenditures, although not being further reduced, continued at
relatively low levels in the first half of 1973. This low level in both
1972 and early 1973 results from the small number of new project starts in
the preceeding years. One of the Governmentts major concerns at present is
building up a new pipeline of sound development projects responsive to the
country's development objectives.
7.        The military Government that took power in December 1972 announced
its intention to pursue progressive development policies, and to tackle the
country's fundamental economic and social problems. The new Government's
development plan -- mainly a definition of objectives and policies rather
than specific projects -- is expected to be ready in December 1973. Pending
its completion, the new Government has been working closely with international
agencies in an effort to revise and accelerate the execution of a tentative
investment program prepared last year. The program provides for continued
investments in physical infrastructure, especially power and transport, and
a substantial increase of investment in the social sectors, particularly
education and water supply and in directly productive sectors, giving special
emphasis to agricultural diversification.   The forestry sector offers the
best opportunity for the medium-term diversification of production w,ith
good export potential. Since the first of the year, the Government has taken
a numnber of important actions, among them the enactment of agrarian reform
measures designed to resolve emergency land tenure problems while a long-term
agrarian plan is designed, the formation of the long-awaited skilled labor
training center and steps towards the development of fDrest-based industries.
The new Government has indicated that it intends to introduce any necessary
tax measures when the financing needs of the revised development and public
investment plans are fully established.
8.        Over the next five years or so, the economy is expected to recover
from its recent stagnation. Banana exports, which still constitute slightly
more than 40 percent of Honduras' total exports, will grow only moderately,
but this is expected to be more than offset by rapidly rising exports of coffee,
meat, timber and cotton.  Total export growth may be of the order of 8 percent
per year, thus strengthening Honduras' balance-of-payments and contributing
to a faster rate of growth of GDP. The more intensive development effort
expected in the public sector, along with the renewed private sector expansion
(stimulated by Government activities, favorable export markets and the expected
re-establishment of regional integration arrangements) will add to both import
demand and development financing requirements. Thus in the medium-term the
favorable prospects also mean an increased need for external assistance.
External Assistance
9.        The external lending agencies have strongly supported public invest-
ment in Honduras. Outstanding external public debt, including undisbursed,
amounted to US$252.4 million as of December 1972. Of this total, more than
32 percent is repayable in local currency, and the ratio of debt ser-v-ice



ANNEX I
Page 6 of 7
payable in foreign exchange to export earnings is very low - 3.4 percent.
Excluding the large proportion of the extenial debt repayable in local
currency, the Bank's share of external debt - including undisbursed - is
34.3 percent and the IDA's share if 14.6 percent. During 1972, the per-
centage of Bank Group debt service in total debt service renavablp in
foreign currency was about 50 percent.
10.       Apart from the Bank Group, external financing is provided by USAID,
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration (CABEI).   USAID has been active in education, health,
feeder road construction, water suipply and agriculture; it was also instru-
mental in the formation of a private industrial finance company. IDB has
been involved in housing, education, water and sewerage, and highways. It
also supports agricultural and industrial projects by means of general credit
lines to the government-owned development bank. CABEI is financing projects
with a regional impact, primarily in transport, industry and telecommunica-
tions. Past lending of these agencies is summarized below.

IDB and CABEI are expected to continue financing projects in the sectors
which they have financed in the past, although CABEI will focus increasingly
on tourism.  USAID, on the other hand, may concentrate its future lending in
agriculture, depending on the results of an ongoing sector survey which it
is financing.
11.       Since-its poverty, meager resource endowment and balance-of-payments
performance have made it difficult for Honduras -- one of the least developed
countries in Latin America -- to borrow substantial amounts on convenvional
terms, external agencies have extended financial assistance on Lairly soft
terms so that debt service, while it has risen significantly in the last few
years, is still low.  Honduras does have some margin for borrowing on con-
ventional terms; assuming that the average terms of external borrowing were
to remain more or less the same as in the past, the debt service ratio would
rise to about 6.5 percent by the! end of the decade, which is manageable for
the Honduran econcmy. *However, in view of Honduras' poverty, it is desirable
to maintain reasonably soft average terms of assistance in the future in
order to limit the burden of debt service upon both the budget and the balance-
of-payments;.further IDA credits are accordingly being planned.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 2
Ln. No. 495   Wxestern Highway Paving Project:  US$8.6 million Loan of May 26, 1967
Closing Date: September 28, 1973.
The project has been completed and final disburst3ment applications
are being processed. A balance of $5,900 has been cancelled.
CR. No. 179 Livestock Development Project: US$2.6 million Credit of K.arc-h 2 1970A
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The credit has been fully committed and disbursements are now prc-W
ceeding on schedule.
Ln. No. 692   Fourth Power Project: US$5.5 million Loan and US$5.5 million
Cr. NCo. 201 Credit, both of June 24, 1970; Closing Date:    June 30, 197T.4
Engineering studies carried out after the signing of the Loan/Credit
suggested, partly because of the proposed interconnection with Nicaragua, 2 number
of changes in tZie design of the project which made necessary amending the origirnal
project description. These changes have delayed bid preparation for and constiruction
of the project's transmission and sub-transmisslon components by about six months.
Hlowever, disbursements may still be completed on schedule by June 30, 1974.
Ln.  No. 767  Second Port Project:  US$6.0 million Loan of June 25, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project provides for tne expansion of Puerto Cortes in the north
of Honduras, and the construction of the new port of Henecan in the South. After
loan signing, the Honduran Congress, partly for political reasons associated with
the border issue with El Salvador, expressed reservations about the construction
of a port at Henecan. However, the Government that took office in December 1972
and the Port Authority decided to proceed with the construction of Henecan. As a
result of these delays, and in spite of reasonable progress in the construction
work for the expansion of Puerto Cortes, execution of the project as a whole is
about 18 months behind schedule.
2/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

In addition to the installation of diesel generating equipnent,

the power systemns of Honduras and Nicaragua.  Installation of the diesel units
is proceeding on schedule.  Iriitial delays in the negotiations with the

PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS:         Contracts for civil works would also be
(continued)                   awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding, except for the twelve
rural primary application schools. Because
of their small size and dLspersed location,
contracts for the latter are not likely
to attract foreign companies and would be
advertized locally only.   Architectural and
engineering design work not done by the
Ministry of Education's architectural unit
would be contracted to consulting firms
under terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank and IDA.
