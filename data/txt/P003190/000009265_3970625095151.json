extension services to farmers, particularly smallholders.\n            The project provides for staff training, technical\n            assistance, civil works, equipment and other facilities to\n            strengthen existing institutions and infrastructure in\n            support of adaptive and applied research programs and\n            extension services.  It also supports reorganization of\n            extension services in three of Zambia's nine provinces,\n            and improvement in the linkages between research and\n            extension services that are more responsive to\n            smallholders' needs and constraints.  The project\n            further aims to promote more efficient utilization of\n            agricultural resources, better coordination of external\n            assistance, and improvements in the institutional framework\n            and manpower resources."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
