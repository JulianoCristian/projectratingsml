     at: 1) improving public finance management, settling the\n            domestic debt; and 2) restructuring the financial sector.\n            The public finance component will enhance fiscal revenues\n            through reduction of exemptions and improved tax\n            administration, and incorporate improvements in the tax and\n            incentive system that will encourage environmentally\n            sustainable growth and resource use. Budgetary expenditures\n            on priority development sectors (health, education,\n            agriculture, road maintenance, tax administration, and\n            justice) will rise. Civil service reform will increase both\n            its efficiency and the quality of public services. The\n            financial sector component will reform the regulatory\n            framework and restructure key banks and insurance companies.\n            A revised institutional framework will support an\n            acceleration of the privatization program. Public\n            enterprises will be required to operate with hard budget\n            constraints. Finally, continued regulatory reform will\n            improve the business environment."}, "docdt": "1996-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
