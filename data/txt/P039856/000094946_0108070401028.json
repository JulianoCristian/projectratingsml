outcome is\n            satisfactory, and sustainability likely, though the\n            institutional development impact is negligible. Among the\n            lessons learned, it is suggested that a bold approach may be\n            required to help a country overcome problems stemming from\n            inadequate performance, poor track record, and lack of\n            international support. Taking this into account, the project\n            proved valuable in that it constrained allocations, to be\n            disbursed against actual implementation of the critical\n            reforms designed to address the problems at the core of poor\n            performance, and, subsequently, reforms would test the\n            Government's determination to re-build external\n            confidence. This highly risky operation required the close\n            collaboration between the International Monetary Fund, and\n            the Bank, given Cameroon's extremely tight financial\n            situation, and the different timelines of the policy reform\n            agenda, supported by the two institutions. This approach\n            forged a constructive dialogue with the Government, and\n            built a mutual understanding of the challenges ahead, which\n            despite the policy dialogue's difficulties sector-wise,\n            such collaboration strengthened the country team, and placed\n            sectoral issues in a proper perspective. In addition, the\n            decline of budget allocations to priority sectors, was a\n            major factor in the deterioration of economic, and social\n            infrastructure, but the critical, though minimum level of\n            funding, initiated the recovery process, which set the stage\n            for a deeper analysis of issues pertaining to service\n            delivery, and the time-consuming process of reform."}, "docdt": "2001-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
