The project has three\n            components.  a) The infrastructure and equipment investment\n            component will support the construction of the rail\n            connection between the two CPTM suburban train systems.  b)\n            The air quality component will support the construction of a\n            vehicle emission and noise laboratory along with hardware\n            and software, in order to develop the capacity for air\n            quality modeling and emissions investigation within the\n            Environmental Technology Company (CETESB).  c) The\n            institutional and policy development component will assist\n            in carrying out the concession of CPTM, establishing a\n            Regional Transport Coordination Commission for the SPMR (Sao\n            Paulo Metropolitan Region), and preparing an integrated\n            transport, land use, and air-quality management strategy for\n            the SPMR."}, "docdt": "1998-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
