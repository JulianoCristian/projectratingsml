high-priority public sector investment\n            subprojects in the transport and education sectors.  The\n            transport sector subprojects, including rehabilitation and\n            upgrading of roads and construction of wharves in the\n            northern part of the country, will provide support to\n            agriculture and strengthen the economic base of the country.\n            Investments in the education sector will help reconstruct\n            nine cyclone-damaged primary schools.  The subprojects have\n            been identified and appraised in general terms by a joint\n            ADB/IDA mission.  They include (1) rehabilitation and\n            upgrading of roads on the islands of Vanuatu Lava, Ep,\n            Poama, Maewo and Ambae; and (2) construction of six wharves\n            along the coasts of the islands where the road\n            rehabilitation/upgrading work will take place. Other\n            subprojects focus on (3) detailed engineering for Santo port\n            development which handles a large volume of the export and\n            import trade for northern Vanuatu; and (4) reconstruction of\n            nine primary schools in the islands of Espiritu Santo,\n            Ambae, Maewo and Pentecost which suffered heavy cyclone\n            damage in January 1985."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
