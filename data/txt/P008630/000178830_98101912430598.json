restructuring, modernization and expansion\n            of selected SMI; (ii) to generate or save foreign exchange\n            by promoting SMI exports and efficient import substitution;\n            (iii) to maintain jobs in existing SMI and to create new\n            ones at a moderate capital cost per job; (iv) to develop\n            industrial estates in a number of less developed regions;\n            (v) to assist the Government in developing technological\n            support to industry in particular to SMI; and (vi) to help\n            prepare a rationalization and investment plan for the\n            textile subsector. To attain these objectives, Banco de\n            Portugal, will refinance credits to eligible SMI out of a\n            subsidiary loan; EPPI will build industrial estates with the\n            help of another subsidiary loan, and rent them to SMI;\n            LNETI's technology institutes and laboratories will be\n            equipped to provide better technological support to\n            industry; the export promotion component will provide\n            technical assistance to devise marketing arrangements and to\n            review incentives; the textile and technology studies will\n            recommend development programs, rationalization measures and\n            future projects in their respective areas."}, "docdt": "1979-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
