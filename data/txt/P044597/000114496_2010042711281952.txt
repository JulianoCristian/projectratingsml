Re: GEF Trust Fund No. 028310  
 
(Brazilian Biodiversity Fund Project) 
 
Amendment to the Grant Agreement
Dear Mr. Leitão Filho: 
 
Please refer to the Global Environmental Facility Trust Fund Grant Agreement 
(the Grant Agreement), dated June 5, 1996, between the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), acting as an Implementing Agency of the 
Global Environmental Facility (the GEF), and Fundo Brasileiro para a Biodiversidade 
(the Recipient) for the above referenced Project, as amended on February 9, 2000. 
 
As you know, the GEF Council and the Board of Executive Directors of the Bank 
have approved a proposal to re-denominate GEF grants from Special Drawing Rights 
(SDRs) to U.S. Dollars ($).  As a consequence, the grant, in the amount of SDR 
13,400,000, provided under the Grant Agreement, could, if you agree, be re-denominated 
to $20,000,000, which would result in an additional amount of $1,955,794.06 of such 
grant available for withdrawal by the Recipient.  In order for the Recipient to utilize the 
unwithdrawn amount of such grant, we need to extend its Closing Date and to update 
certain disbursement provisions of the Grant Agreement. 
 
Therefore, we propose to amend the Grant Agreement as follows: 
 
1.  Section 2.01
is amended to read as follows in its entirety: 
 
“Section 2.01.  The Bank agrees to make available to the Recipient, on the 
terms and conditions set forth or referred to in this Agreement, the GEF Trust 
Fund Grant in the amount of twenty million Dollars ($20,000,000).” 
 
2.  Section 2.03
is amended to read as follows in its entirety: 
 
“Section 2.03.  The Closing Date shall be February 28, 2004, or such later date 
as the Bank shall establish.  The Bank shall promptly notify the Recipient of 
such later date.”

3.  In Schedule 1, paragraph 1
,
a
new subparagraph (c) is added to read as 
follows: 
 
“(c)  notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) above, the amount of 
$1,955,794.06 may be fully withdrawn by the Recipient for deposit in the 
account referred to in (a) above." 
 
If you agree with the foregoing amendments, please sign and date the two copies 
of this letter in the space provided below, and return to us one copy of the letter 
countersigned by you.  This amendment letter will become effective as of the date of your 
countersignature, upon receipt of a signed copy of this letter by us. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
