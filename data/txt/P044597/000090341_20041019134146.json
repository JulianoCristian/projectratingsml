The lessons learned indicate that experience\n            with biodiversity projects also indicates the importance of\n            facilitating biodiversity conservation activities by\n            communities or groups of people who have a vital interest in\n            conservation, either because their livelihoods depend\n            directly on biological resources, or because their quality\n            of life depends significantly on use and existence values of\n            biodiversity. Brazukuab Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO's)\n            design reflected learning from the earliest generation of\n            GEF supported trust funds for biodiversity conservation. A\n            lesson identified in GEF's global portfolio of trust\n            funds was that trust funds can promote decreases in\n            government funding of protected areas by substituting trust\n            fund financing for regular appropriations. At the time the\n            project was designed, there was an expectation that the\n            companion project would support definition of clear\n            priorities and targets for biodiversity conservation\n            outcomes, and that FUNBIO would incorporate the objectives,\n            indicators, and measurement systems related to those\n            outcomes into the monitoring and evaluation system for its\n            own projects."}, "docdt": "2004-10-13T00:00:00Z"}
