The project would include:  (i) the\n            procurement of input supplies and the strengthening of input\n            distribution management; and (ii) the provision of civil\n            works, vehicles, equipment, technical assistance, training\n            and operating expenses for research and surveys of fisheries\n            resources, tsetse fly control, and agricultural adaptive\n            research.
