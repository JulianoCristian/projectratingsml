                       GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
            HAITI - EMERGENCY DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION

Recipient             Republic of Haiti

Implementing Agency   Ministry of Economy and Finance

Financing Data        IDA Grant Terms: Grant
                      Amount: SDR20.3 million (US$30 million equivalent)
                      [with a US$25 million co-financing from the Haitian Reconstruction
                      Fund]

Operation Type        One tranche, stand-alone operation

Main Policy Areas     The proposed operation supports policies aimed at strengthening
                      checks and balance mechanisms in view of the negative impact of
                      the earthquake on governance and oversight institutions. It also
                      supports consolidating the gains achieved in governance over the
                      past few years. The operation supports the government's capacity to
                      manage public resources efficiently and transparently. More
                      specifically, the operation supports the following measures: (i)
                      increasing transparency in budget transfers to the electricity sector;
                      (ii) reinstating budget controls and external and internal audit
                      processes; (iii) improving enforcement of the Law on Declaration of
                      Assets; and (iv) reinforcing public procurement regulation and
                      enhancing transparency in procurement practices

Key Outcome           The following outcomes are expected to be achieved by the end of
Indicators            the proposed operation (September 2011):

                      Transparency in Transfer Management

                      (i) All invoice payments by the Ministry of Finance (MEF) to the
                      Independent Power Providers (IPP) follow the rules described in the
                      joint-memorandum signed by the MEF and the Ministry of Public
                      Works (MTPTC).

                      (ii) Payments to IPPs published on the Ministry of Finance's website
                      are reconciled with actual payments. The MTPTC and the MEF
                      carry out this reconciliation.

                      Budget Control

                      (i) Improved compliance of external audits and the Budget review
                      Law submission within the statutory timeframe: first, the MEF


                                          i
                      submits to the Court of Accounts the 2009-10 government accounts
                      no more than 8 months after the end of the FY2010; and second the
                      Court of Accounts communicates to the MEF the results of audits of
                      the 2008-09 and 2009-10 government accounts by September 30,
                      2011.

                      (ii) All IGF activities comply with the plan of action adopted by the
                      Ministry of Finance (2010-14). The following reports will be given
                      to competent and concerned authorities: (a) an inventory of
                      government and NGOs' projects; (b) the audits of subsidies in the
                      education sector and the transfers by the MEF to the MOE; (c) the
                      analysis of audit reports issued by the Court of Accounts; and the (d)
                      audits of public accountants' activities in the MEF.

                      Anti-Corruption

                      The anti-corruption unit (ULCC) sends a report to the Court of
                      Accounts showing that compliance rate with the Declaration of
                      Assets Law of the members of the government increased from 87
                      percent (as of May 2010) to 100 percent.

                      Public Procurement

                      (i) The share of non-competitive procurement in total procurement
                      decreases from 56 percent (as of 2008) to 45 percent. This indicator
                      is measured by the value of contracts awarded without competition
                      as a percentage of all contracts that do not fall under the accelerated
                      procedures invoked by the State of Emergency Law.

                      (ii) The Prime Minister has given prior authorization to all contracts
                      awarded by invoking the Emergency Law's accelerated procedures.

Program Development   The objective of the proposed operation is to strengthen support
Objective(s) and      enhanced accountability and transparency in the management of
Contribution to CAS   public resources in the context of the reconstruction.

                      The proposed operation contributes to the CAS objectives
                      supporting to the government's institutional strengthening agenda,
                      the main expected outcome of which is an improvement in the
                      effectiveness, transparency and accountability of public sector
                      institutions. This involves activities to consolidate economic
                      governance reforms and strengthen core institutions.

Risks and Risk        The expected outcomes of the proposed operation are subject to a
Mitigation            number of substantial risks. There are four main risks related to:
                      macroeconomic framework stability; political and security situation;

                                           ii
               natural disasters; and institutional capacity constraint. The
               macroeconomic risks associated with the operation reflect the
               potential negative impact of the low domestic revenue mobilization,
               which could derail the macroeconomic program. The political and
               security risks are related to the institutional void created by the
               postponement of the legislative election, and the difficulty in
               managing the organization of the upcoming the legislative and
               presidential. Natural disaster risks reflect the exposure of the
               country to natural disasters, including potential serious after-shocks
               as well as hurricanes and flash floods. The risks related to weak
               capacity reflect capacity constraints to prepare, implement, and
               oversee reforms. These could jeopardize the government's efforts
               and undermine the expected impact of the Grant.

               To mitigate macroeconomic risks, the government has demonstrated
               ownership and a credible commitment to enhance the efficiency of
               the meager domestic resources in an effort to compensate for low
               revenue collection. In addition, the international community has
               pledged to increase its aid in the form of budget support to
               supplement government resources. The presence of UN forces and
               the strong commitment of the international community are expected
               to support the stabilization process and security situation. Support
               from the Bank and other donors in the area of disaster management
               will be a mitigating factor for natural disaster risks, in particular, the
               Bank's emergency recovery projects in the ongoing portfolio. To
               reduce the risk posed by weak institutional capacity, the operation
               focuses on sustaining government reforms that have started
               generating positive results. Lastly, several technical assistance
               programs supporting government capacity, including Bank technical
               assistance, are being implemented.

                          I.     INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW


1.      This Program Document presents a proposed Emergency Development Policy Grant
(DPG) for the Republic of Haiti in the amount of SDR20.3 million (US$30 million equivalent).
This is the fourth DPG supporting the Republic of Haiti, after its successful reengagement with the
donor community in 2005. The proposed Grant is a single-tranche operation supporting the
FY2009-10 budget, with an additional co-financing of US$25 million by the Haiti Reconstruction
Fund (HRF), of which the Bank is the partner agency. The US$25 million co-financing has been
authorized by the Steering Committee of the HRF.

2.       The proposed operation supports maintaining sound economic governance in the post-
earthquake period and strengthening the reforms started before the earthquake. First, the
operation supports the implementation of the Government Action Plan for National Recovery and
Development of Haiti presented to the international community in March 2010, aimed at re-
building the country. The Government Action Plan puts emphasis on decentralization presents
economic and social reforms as well as the institutional strengthening strategy of the authorities in
the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated Haiti on January 12, 2010. Second, it supports the
government's program for enhancing transparency and accountability mechanisms, especially in
view of the massive pledges made by donors to support the reconstruction process. The
Government Action Plan and governance program are in line with the strategy contained in the
country's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS/DSNCRP) for the period 2008-2010, of which one
pillar aims at strengthening state capacity and management of public resources.

3.      The proposed Grant also supports the main pillars of the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), which was discussed by the Board in June 2009. The CAS builds on a two-pronged
approach, combining longer-term institution building (including economic governance reforms)
with support for the government in the delivery of quick and visible results to the population. The
CAS identifies development policy operations as a key instrument to foster ownership, alignment
with the country's development program, and domestic accountability. Programs supported by the
proposed development policy operation seek to strengthen public sector and economic governance
with reforms spanning public expenditure management, procurement and anti-corruption.

4.     The Grant helps in meeting urgent financing for reconstruction. Financing needs have
been exacerbated by revenue shortfalls following the earthquake. The damages and losses caused
by the earthquake are estimated to be nearly US$8 billion, according to the Post Disaster Needs
Assessment (PDNA) carried out in February 2010. The destruction of the Tax Directorate offices
and the impact of the earthquake on economic activities have caused tax revenue to be projected at
80 percent of the pre-quake projections for fiscal year 2009-2010. At the same time, expenditure
needs to support the reconstruction have increased significantly. The Grant provides resources to
finance essential outlays in the last quarter of 2010. The Grant complements the benefits of the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative
(MDRI) achieved in 2009 as well as further debt cancellation and additional financing announced

5.      The specific reforms supported by the proposed Grant are expected to help strengthen
the legal and regulatory frameworks and systems and enhance accountability and
transparency in the context of reconstruction and beyond. The proposed operation complements
the overall package of IDA assistance aimed at supporting governance reforms and institution
strengthening. It focuses on the implementation of the legal institutional frameworks and on a
number of priority areas including fiscal transparency in the electricity sector, budget controls, anti-
corruption and public procurement. Reforms in these areas had started under the series of Economic
Governance Reform Operation (EGRO) approved in 2005, 2007, and 2009 respectively. While
building on the institutional foundations created under the past series of EGRO, the proposed
operation also takes into account new challenges emerging after the earthquake. As such, the
proposed operation serves as a bridge toward a possibly new series of budget support operations.

6.       The proposed Grant also complements efforts under various Bank technical assistance
programs, namely: (i) the Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grant (EGTAG) series
which provides capacity-building and technical assistance to strengthen governance and economic
management systems; (ii) the economic and governance components of the Infrastructure and
Institution Emergency Operation approved in March 2010 aimed at reinstating the economic and
financial functions of the government; and (iii) the Electricity Loss Reduction project (PREPSEL)
in the electricity sector aimed at strengthening management capacity of the state-owned company
(EDH).

7.      The effective implementation of the measures supported by the proposed operation
will assist progress in: (i) strengthening fiscal transparency in the electricity sector; (ii) reinstating
and strengthening budget controls through reinforcement of external and internal audits; (iii)
enforcing the declaration of assets to reduce corruption; and (iv) putting in practice public
procurement regulation.

8.      The proposed operation also draws on the government's governance reform program,
which has been supported by partners involved in budget support. A framework governing the
harmonization of budget support operations has been in place since April 2009 with the
participation of donors providing budget support, including multilateral institutions (IDA, AIDB,
EU) and key bilateral partners (France, Spain), and in collaboration with the IMF. A joint-matrix
containing economic and public sector governance reforms was drafted in May 2009 and updated in
May 2010. This operation supports policies included in this matrix.

           II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT AND THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

POLITICAL AND SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS

9.      On January 12, 2010, an earthquake hit Haiti and caused widespread damage and
massive loss of life. The earthquake particularly affected the capital, Port-au-Prince, Petit Goâve,
Grand Goâve and Léogâne (West Department), Jacmel (South-East Department), and Miragoâne
(Nippes Department). According to the government of Haiti, the estimated death toll was 222,570
while thousands of people were injured or permanently disabled. Million and a half people were left
homeless. The capacity of the Haitian State was seriously affected because critical staff in various
ministries perished and because important official buildings collapsed or were damaged.

                                                    2
Government buildings that were destroyed or seriously damaged include the National Palace, the
Supreme Court, the Law Courts, the Parliament and police facilities, and all but one line ministry.
Other affected key public entities include the Tax and Customs Administrations, the National
Statistical Institute, the National Procurement Commission, the Court of Accounts (CSC/CA), and
the Road Maintenance Fund (FER). Major economic, financial and governance activities and
functions were disrupted--which represents a major setback for the country following sustained
progress in macroeconomic stability and public sector governance in the five years preceding the
earthquake.

10.     On April 15, 2010, the Senate approved an 18-month extension of the state of
emergency that the President of Haiti decreed after the January-12 earthquake. The law
significantly expands the powers of the Executive branch to implement the reconstruction plan,
authorizing the President to approve contracts without bids, to requisition private land and build
camps for people displaced by the earthquake, and to evacuate the displaced from their camps in
case of emergency.

11.     The earthquake has created a substantial political uncertainty. Progress had been made
in the functioning of democracy before the earthquake, including the political process towards
legislative, presidential and municipal elections previously scheduled to be held in 2010. Haiti
returned to constitutionality in 2006 with the election of President Préval, which marked the end of
a vicious cycle of political instability. The 48th legislature was inaugurated in May 2006, ending
three years of legislative paralysis. Municipal elections were held in December 2006 and April
2007. Although delayed, due to the restructuring of the electoral council, elections for twelve of the
thirty Senate seats took place in April 2009, with a run-off in June 2009. Both rounds were peaceful
in general and the results gave Lespwa (President René Préval's party) six additional seats,
strengthening its Senate presence. Progress in political democracy was marked by increasing used
of constitutional and democratic procedures to deal with political challenges.1 In September 2009,
both legislative chambers of Haiti approved a proposition in favor of constitutional amendments,
which, if ratified, would simplify the electoral calendar and improve the investment climate,
including by providing for dual citizenship for Haitians living in the diaspora. In late November
2009, around sixty-nine political parties and alliances registered with the Provisional Electoral
Council, Conseil Electoral Provisoire (CEP), in anticipation of the elections. Of these, the CEP
approved fifty-three. These processes have stalled following the earthquake and the legislative
election is now set for November 2010 together with the presidential ballot. However, it is not clear
whether such a date is realistic given the challenges ahead.

12.     The risk of political instability has increased. The elections need to take place but the
process will be costly and logistically difficult. In view of such challenges, the Haitian Parliament
modified article 232 of the 2008 electoral law so that if new presidential elections cannot be held
before end-November 2010, the current President would remain in office until May 14, 2011.
Officially, his five-year term ends on February 2011. This situation may be difficult to manage as it
may fuel political instability and civil unrest as previewed by a series of protests that have taken

  Haiti has handled with a high turnover of Prime Ministers by employing democratic processes. The current Prime
Minister, Jean Max Bellerive, was sworn in office on November 12, 2009, replacing incumbent Michèle Pierre-Louis
after a vote of censure against her government. Previously, in April 2008, Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis was
forced to resign due to mounting public discontent triggered by the difficult economic circumstances following the food
crisis.

place in Port-au-Prince and in several secondary cities against such disposition. Demonstrations
have been organized by a coalition of opposition groups known as Tet Kole, 2 which accuse the
President of overstepping his authority by remaining in office beyond his term and have called for
his resignation. Most of the Tet Kole parties have indicated their intention to participate in the
elections upcoming elections to take place in the fall of 2010.

13.    There have been increasing security threats in the months following the earthquake.
Although volatile, the security environment had improved significantly prior to the earthquake.
With the help of the UN Peacekeeping mission (MINUSTAH), the Haitian Police regained control
of the two most dangerous slums in Port-au-Prince (Cite Soleil and Martisant) following the
dismantling of gangs. Public demonstrations related mainly to poor living conditions, were peaceful
and small. Recently, security has deteriorated. Former gang leaders escaped from prison, in some
cases with uniforms and weapons stolen from the Haitian National Police, pose a threat to security.
There has been increasing numbers of kidnappings. The National Police is substantially weakened
and has not been able to respond appropriately because of limited law-enforcement capability.

14.     The earthquake has created serious public safety concerns. The challenge is related to
ensuring security, including prevention of violence against women, in large settlements for
internally displaced persons, where deteriorating living conditions, overcrowding and poor lighting
are expected to contribute to a rise in crime. Physical damage to institutions protecting the rule of
law further compounds this problem.

15.     The government is facing significant challenges associated with the need to make
progress on various fronts. First, the likelihood of a social unrest is substantial under the current
circumstances. The population affected by the earthquake is living in barely-human conditions,
crowded in tent camps that fill the spaces in-between collapsed buildings, overflowing onto almost
impassable streets clogged with mounting piles of trash and debris. Second, the private sector
expects strong support from the government to assist entrepreneurs in their efforts to resume
economic activity. However, the country's capacity to absorb and support large private investment,
either with basic infrastructure or working institutions is limited and requires significant supporting
activities of domestic entrepreneurism in the short term. Lastly, progress in transparency with
respect to the use of public resources is critical for creating a climate of confidence and trust
between Haiti's partners and the government. It requires evidence that the government is committed
to enhancing accountability and governance, which would also help mobilize external resources for
reconstruction.

16.    The government is benefiting from strong support of development partners. On
February 18, 2010, the government launched a post disaster needs assessment to measure
damage/losses and reconstruction needs arising from the earthquake. Led by the government of
Haiti and supported by the international community, the needs assessment included consultations
with Parliament, civil society, the Haitian Diaspora, the private sector and the population. Damages
and losses are estimated at approximately US$8 billion. The government developed an Action Plan

  Before the emergency law came to the Senate and was enacted, a number of opposition parties - including the Lavalas
Family (FL) of former President Jean Bernard Aristide, the Union party, the Union of Democratic Haitian Citizens for
Development and Education (UCCADE), and the alternative coalition ­ announced the formation of a new coalition Tet
Kole.

for the Reconstruction and the Development of Haiti, which was presented to international donors
at the United Nations in New York in March 2010. In a powerful show of support, donors pledged
nearly US$10 billion, of which US$5 billion were pledged for the period 2010-2011.

17.     In order to ensure efficiency and coordination of reconstruction funds, the government
has created new institutional arrangements (See Box 1). The Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF),
for which the World Bank is the fiscal agent, was created under the Emergency State Law of April
2010. It is one channel for donors to commit funding. The government of Haiti indicated that it
would also manage funds through the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission--also created by the
Emergency Law. A Steering Committee made of government officials at the ministerial level and
representatives of various stakeholders will ensure that projects are in line with the Government
Action Plan. The Commission will scrutinize project concepts and oversee project implementation
funded by the nearly US$10 billion pledged by Haiti's partners. The Prime Minister and the UN
special envoy will jointly chair the Commission until a Haitian development authority is established
in eighteen months.

                       Box 1: Haiti's Reconstruction and Development Architecture

 The government of Haiti has established a structure to oversee and coordinate reconstruction efforts following
 the devastating earthquake of January 12.

 Reconstruction will be directed by the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), which was created in
 April 2010 by a vote of Parliament to implement the Government's Action Plan during the 18-month state of
 emergency. The commission will be co-chaired by former U.S. President Bill Clinton (the U.N. special envoy
 for Haiti) and by Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. The President of Haiti will retain veto power.
 The Commission's decisions would be guided by a 20-member board comprised of government, private
 sector, civil society and the donor community. Over the next 18 months the IHRC will identify priorities and
 projects that best support the objectives of the Government's Action Plan. At the end of the emergency
 period, the Commission is expected to become the Haitian Development Authority (HDA), a more permanent
 development entity that would plan, sequence and coordinate projects over 10 or more years.

 The Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF) is one of several mechanisms that will provide funding for rebuilding
 Haiti based on priorities set by the IHRC. The HRF is a multilateral financing mechanism in which donors will
 pool their resources to finance reconstruction projects and programs as well as provide budget support to the
 Government in a coordinated manner. The HRF has been established at the World Bank as a Financial
 Intermediary Fund (FIF). The World Bank will serve as a trustee for the FIF. The HRF is expected to channel
 as much as possible of the aid pledged by the international community for reconstruction over the next two
 years. In May, the fund received its first contribution from Brazil. The HRF will finance investment to
 support reconstruction and development in accordance with the Government's Action Plan for Reconstruction
 and Development. Projects will be supervised by partner entities such as the Inter-American Development
 Bank, UN agencies and the World Bank. Implementation will be carried out by a variety of stakeholders
 including the Government, UN agencies, NGOs, and the private sector.

 Governance of the HRF will be led by a high-level Steering Committee chaired by a ministerial-level
 government representative and comprising of representatives from key donors, partner entities and the trustee,
 will be responsible for approving all allocations of trust fund funds for projects and programs based on the
 Government's Action Plan for Reconstruction, and Development, among others.

POVERTY TRENDS AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

18.     Haiti is the poorest country in the Latin America and Caribbean region. The latest
Household survey available (2001) indicates that 76 percent of the population lives below the
US$2-a-day poverty line and 58 percent below the US$1-a-day poverty line. A provisional
employment survey carried out by the Haitian Institute of Statistics and Information (IHSI) in 2007
shows a significant increase in poverty in the metropolitan area, in comparison to the figures in the
last household survey. While urban poverty has increased, the incidence of poverty in rural areas is
still much higher.

19.     Poor access to infrastructure, minimal ownership of assets, low education and literacy
levels, and high levels of child malnutrition were identified as the most important causes of
poverty in the World Bank's 2006 Country Economic Memorandum. Inequality is high, with a
Gini coefficient of 0.5. A marked gap exists between the rich and the poor in access to economic
opportunities and social services. It appears that inequality has not changed much in the last 20
years. Furthermore, unemployment was high at an estimated rate of 30 percent in 2009.

20.    Haiti has an IMF program since 2006, which is on track. The sixth and final review of
the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) was completed on January 27, 2010. In late May 2010, an IMF
mission reached agreement with the Haitian authorities on a new three-year ECF-supported
program.

21.     The Haitian economy performed well in 2008-09 (FY2009), despite the global economic
crisis. Whereas the GDP of Caribbean nations shrank by 2.2 percent on average during 2009, the
Haitian economy grew by 2.9 percent in real terms compared with an average growth of 0.9 percent
between 2004 and 2008.3 Almost half of the growth was concentrated in the agricultural sector,
which was hit hard by the 2008 hurricanes. Government reconstruction programs after the 2008 and
2009 hurricanes further buttressed growth in the construction and public works sectors. The
manufacturing and retail sectors grew strongly at 3.7 and 2.5 percent, respectively. The limited
integration of the domestic financial sector in global markets shielded the economy from direct
impact of the global financial crisis. Meanwhile, falling global commodity prices relieved pressure
on the high cost of living experienced at the height of the food and commodity price crisis in 2008,
bringing annual inflation down to -4.7 percent in FY2009, from 19.8 percent in FY2008. Falling
commodity prices, a 10 percent expansion of the textile export sector (despite the global slowdown)
and a resilient level of remittances contributed to an improvement in the current account deficit
from 4.5 percent of GDP in FY2008 to 3.2 percent of GDP in FY2009. International reserves
remained at 2.9 months of imports. The overall fiscal deficit worsened from 3.1 percent to 4.4
percent of GDP because revenues were lower than expected--although expenditure was contained
through cuts in capital outlays.

22.    The economic cost of the earthquake has been estimated at over 115 percent of FY2009
GDP. The Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) estimates the damage to physical assets at
around US$4.3 billion and to economic flows (lost production, fall in turnover, job and salary

 This includes a 3.5 percent contraction in 2004 due to domestic political turmoil. Excluding 2004, the average was 2.0
percent.

losses, increased production costs) at US$3.6 billion. The private sector has sustained over 70
percent of total damages, including US$2.3 billion to the housing stock.

23.     As a result of the earthquake, GDP is projected to contract by 8.5 percent and
employment to decline by 8.5 percentage points in FY2010. Most of the decline in growth will
be in the commercial and infrastructure sectors which are projected to fall by more than 25 percent
in FY2010. Overall production costs have risen and the collapse of structures has hampered the
operation of many businesses. The formal retail sector was particularly affected following the
collapse of 90 percent of the commercial centre of Port-au-Prince. The industrial sector is set to
contract by 10 percent. Although some damage was sustained to irrigation systems and storage and
process facilities, the agricultural sector is anticipated to grow by 7 percent. Annual inflation was
projected to rise to 6.9 percent in FY2010 before the quake, but is presently set to rise to 8.5 percent
due to the decline in supply, rising transportation costs and inflows of international aid. The Central
Bank has expanded the monetary base through the purchase of dollars to counter appreciation
pressures on the gourde and provide liquidity to the banking sector.

24.      The overall fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate, from an initial projection of 2.0
percent to 3.0 percent of GDP. The FY2010 projection of total revenues has risen from 16.2
percent to 24.4 percent of GDP. Underlying this rise is an increase in grants from the 6.0 percent
predicted before the quake to 14.5 percent of GDP, which has helped mitigate a 1.4 percent of GDP
fall in anticipated domestic revenues. However, expenditures are expected to rise even further, from
an initial projection of 19.4 percent to 27.4 percent of GDP.

25.   The earthquake is expected to reduce fiscal revenues for FY2010 and has exposed the
disadvantages of relying on a narrow tax base, with more than 85 percent of revenues
                                                       8
collected in Port-au-Prince. Domestic revenues are predominantly collected from large enterprises
and from import tariffs on goods. The collapse in economic activity has reduced income taxes,
while customs revenues are also down because much of the inflow of goods has consisted of
humanitarian aid (which exempt). The capacity of fiscal entities to collect taxes has been
significantly reduced due to the loss of personnel, the collapse of several tax offices and damage to
information systems.

26.     By contrast, expenditures have risen due to earthquake response activities and the
start of reconstruction efforts. Most of the increase will come from increased capital expenditures
from a pre-earthquake projection of 8.6 percent to 15.8 percent of GDP, as the government
reconstructs its buildings. The remainder will mainly originate from increased expenditures on
transfers and subsidies.

27.      Concessional financing will cover the government's financing needs for FY2010. The
remaining financing requirements are expected to be met by external financing and domestic
borrowing from the Central Bank (BRH) and through the issuance of T-bills, in a new financing
initiative undertaken by the BRH with IMF support. For FY2011 and FY2012, the financing needs
are expected to rise to 3.9 percent and 4.9 percent of GDP respectively, which are equally expected
to be covered by external financing and the issuance of T-bills.

28.     The current macroeconomic projections are subject to considerable uncertainty given
the size of the shock to the economy and the risks associated to the speed of recovery. The rate
of real growth, the level of inflation and the composition of the balance of payments is highly
dependent on how quickly reconstruction activities progress, the timely inflow of foreign aid, as
well as the ability to import necessary reconstruction materials.

29.    Haiti is vulnerable to external shocks stemming from imports constraints, which
combine with a narrow production and export base. First, a large proportion of capital and
goods consumed are imported, particularly food, exposing the country to volatility in global food
markets, as observed in 2007 and 2008. Second, remittances have averaged around 20 percent of

                                                  9
GDP between 2000 and 2009 and have contributed significantly to the financing of the import of
goods and services, averaging 41 percent of GDP over the same period, while exports have covered
roughly a third of the import value. Remittances are estimated to support the livelihood of over 4
million families. Remarkably, and unlike in other Caribbean countries, remittances have remained
resilient during 2009 despite the global recession. Third, the export sector is characterized by
limited diversification, with over 80 percent of exports produced by the textile sector.

30.      These vulnerabilities will remain for the near future. The current account deficit is
expected to fall from a pre-earthquake projection of 2.6 percent to 2.1 percent of GDP, driven by a
significant increase in current transfers. Exports of goods and services would fall from a previous
projected 13.6 percent to 11.6 percent of GDP, while the imports of goods and services are
expected to rise from an initially projected 40.7 percent to 61.6 percent of GDP. The FY2010
projection of current transfers is projected to rise from 24.4 percent to 47.9 percent of GDP,
predominantly due to increased official transfers, and remittances to a lesser extent. The capital
account balance would be slightly worse than previously expected, down from 2.6 percent to 1.8
percent of GDP. The overall balance of payment deficit is expected to improve from an initial
projection of 2.1 percent to 0.2 percent of GDP. The Central Bank has been purchasing dollars to
sterilize inflows and counter appreciation pressures on the gourde but FY2010 projections of
reserve coverage have nevertheless fallen from 3.8 months of imports before the quake to 3.1
months, because of the significant rise in imports.

31.      In the financial sector, non-performing loans (NPLs) have risen to an estimated 12.3
percent of total loans in March 2010 and are likely to increase further, impairing the system's
ability to lend. The banking system, comprised of nine banks, was well capitalized and
conservatively run before the earthquake with a capital adequacy ratio of 16.4 percent and a NPL to
gross loans ratio of 8.6 percent in December 2009 (with the exception of the 2 state owned banks
which had low capital adequacy ratios before the quake and high NPLs). Lending portfolios mostly
comprised of low risk short term loans (rarely exceeding 1 year) to the trade and industrial sectors,
with limited exposure to agriculture. After the earthquake, NPLs have risen although the full extent
of the rise remains to be determined as loans are only classified as non-performing after 90 days
past due. However, most of the aid flows thus far have passed through the banking sector, which
has strengthened the position of the banks. For the insurance sector, an assessment carried out by a
Bank consultant at the request of the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank of Haiti concluded that
out of the US$200 million estimated gross cost for insurers, reinsurers would assume about 75
percent, leaving about US$50 million to be borne by the sector itself. As a result, some failures of
insurers may occur. Supervision of the insurance sector is almost non-existent but several
institutions have indicated their willingness to work on the supervision of the sector (CARTAC, US
Treasury).

32.     The Central Bank is supporting the banking sector by relaxing capital requirements
and by preparing a Partial Credit Guarantee Fund. Capital adequacy rules have been relaxed
for up to two years to provide relief to the banking sector as it restructures loans and consolidates
its assets position. The Partial Credit Guarantee Fund is a fund covering affected loans and new
loans, and will be supported by the donor community. This mechanism will share risks with banks,
encouraging the restructuring of viable loans that have been affected by the earthquake, and support
the provision of new loans to SMEs and housing for the reconstruction. The World Bank is working
together with the IADB, IMF, IFC and the US treasury on the specifics of the scheme. The Minister

                                                 10
of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank have set a target of doubling the lending portfolios
of the banking sector over the coming five years.

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK

33.    The Government Action Plan for Reconstruction and Development lays out a multi-
year development strategy aiming to "build back better" through decentralization, economic
stimulus, social sector reform, and strengthening of institutions. To reduce the vulnerability
created by the concentration of 65 percent of the nation's economic activity in Port-au-Prince, a
major renovation of population centers outside the capital is envisaged. The development centers, in
addition to Port-au-Prince include: in the North, the axis between Cap Haïtien and Ouanaminthe for
tourism, textile and agriculture; the region around Gonaïves for agriculture and tourism; and the
South for agriculture, textiles and tourism. Incentives will be provided to encourage both foreign
and domestic investment in these sectors, including the creation of new special economic zones.
Central to the government's strategy will be the upgrading of infrastructure by widening the
connectivity of the road network with rural areas and the Dominican Republic, and by building two
new international airports and two new deep-water ports.

34.     Growth is expected to rebound to 9.8 percent in FY2011 and 8.4 percent in FY2012,
driven by the reconstruction efforts and growth in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors
(Table 4). The rebuilding of 66 percent worth of GDP of structural damages will buoy the
construction sector to a 45 percent growth in FY2011 and a further 30 percent growth in FY2012,
provided that bottlenecks in the supply of construction materials can be avoided. The electricity
sector is also set to expand rapidly.5 Steady growth is expected in the agricultural and
manufacturing sectors, averaging 3.7 percent and 4.0 percent between FY2011 and FY2015
respectively as the benefits of the growth policy are realized.

  Planned electricity projects include the restoration of the Péligre power plant, building the Artibonite C-4
hydroelectric dam, and restoring the power plants at Sault-Mathurin and Caracol-Nord.

                                                               11
35.      Agriculture remains a key component of the growth strategy. Over 500,000 people have
fled the capital after the earthquake putting increased strain on rural resources. Before the
earthquake, the sector employed over 40 percent of the labor force. The government is targeting the
sector for job creation that will allow for the integration of displaced people and concurrently
reduce the country's dependence on food coming from abroad. Planned government programs will
fund: (i) the provision of agricultural inputs; (ii) an expansion of the drainage and irrigation system;
(iii) an extension of the road network to improve market access; (iv) improved access to credit; and
(v) investments in food processing activities.

36.     Expanded preferential market access for textiles to US markets under the new Haiti
Economic Lift Program Act (HELP) will provide opportunities for export-led growth. In May
2010, the US Senate and Congress passed an amendment to the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity II
Ac (HOPE II) Act, the HELP Act, which is more than doubling Haiti's export quota, broadening
the range of products that qualify, and extending preferential access to 2020. The HOPE II Act had
spurred a 10 percent expansion of the textile sector in FY2009. A pre-earthquake study concluded
that the textile sector is highly competitive in US markets, although high electricity costs are a
constraint. The World Bank and IFC are providing technical assistance to attract foreign direct
investment in the textile sector. Some production sites were damaged in the earthquake; however,
textile exports have resumed to US$25 million compared to the average monthly export value of
US$40 million before the earthquake. A post-earthquake damage assessment of the industrial park
Parc Industriel Metropolitain, where most of the factories are located, concluded that 1 out of 49
factories will have to be demolished and 10 others will require major repairs. A bottleneck to the
resumption of exports has been the damage sustained to the port of Port-au-Prince, through which
the majority of textiles are exported, although presently the port has recovered to 80 percent
capacity.

37.     During the challenging period of reconstruction, it is imperative that the government
focuses on securing sufficient revenue and ensuring the effectiveness of it expenditures. The
overall deficit is expected to worsen to around 4 percent of GDP in FY2011 and 5 percent in
FY2012. Total revenues and grants would rise as domestic revenue returns close to FY2009 levels
and grants remain near projected FY2010 levels, but remain insufficient to outweigh the increase in
expenditures, driven by a rise of capital expenditures to close to 20 percent of GDP. The
government would rely on grants to finance the majority of its capital expenditures and a portion of
its operating costs in the foreseeable future. Significant external financing will be needed if the
reconstruction program and the projected growth path are to be realized. Improving revenue
mobilization capacity is a priority, although the return of domestic revenues to pre-earthquake
levels will depend also on the recovery of taxpaying businesses. The government is working on a
strategy to revamp the Tax Directorate with IMF assistance. Furthermore, in the long run a return of
domestic revenues to the historical level of 10 percent of GDP would constrain the government's
ability to achieve its development objectives once aid inflows fall. Expenditures would increase
significantly and in view of the considerable aid inflows, public financial management (PFM) will
require strengthening to ensure efficiency and an adequate return on investment.

38.     The current account deficit (excluding grants) is expected to remain above 15 percent
of GDP in the medium term, highlighting the importance of external aid flows to sustain the
level of imports and the need to stimulate the export sector. The overall current account deficit

6
  Total public debt refers to the legal situation prior to the formal implementation of the majority of the US$965 in debt
forgiveness pledged following the earthquake. Including the debt forgiveness total public debt to GDP is projected at
13.8 percent in FY2010, 18.1 percent in FY2011, in 21.1 percent FY2012, and 22.9 percent in FY2013.

                                                                           13
(including grants) would rise to around 4 percent of GDP due to a more rapid fall in current
transfers than in imports, and a slight fall in exports. The capital account surplus is anticipated to
rise to close to 4 percent of GDP driven by rises in public sector loan disbursements and foreign
direct investment (FDI). A slight increase in reserves in months of imports of goods and services is
predicted.

39.    A Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted in June 2010 classified Haiti as at
high risk of debt distress on the grounds of a high debt-to-export level. This assessment is
based on the legal external debt situation that excludes post-earthquake debt forgiveness pledges,
which remain to be formalized with the exception of that of the World Bank. Under this framework,
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is the one indicator that protractedly exceeds the prudential
thresholds for debt sustainability, remaining over 165 percent between FY2010 and FY2015, before
eventually falling below the threshold of 100 percent in FY2023. After a nominal debt reduction of
US$1.1 billion achieved upon reaching the HIPC completion point in June 2009, the nominal
external debt stock stood at US$1.24 billion at end-September 2009. By March 2010, external debt
had risen to US$1.48 billion due to the IMF emergency augmentation of January 2010 for post-
earthquake balance of payments support, new IADB borrowing, and further PetroCaribe financing.

40.     Most of Haiti's external creditors including the multilateral and bilateral partners
have pledged that all outstanding debt will be forgiven. However, this will only temporarily
ameliorate high debt-to-export levels. The post-earthquake external debt forgiveness, once
implemented, would reduce the nominal external debt stock by US$965 million to US$515 million.
This would lower the PV of debt-to-exports ratio to 39 percent in FY2010, well below the 100
percent risk threshold. Nevertheless, the anticipated government deficits during the reconstruction
period would necessitate new external borrowing (assumed to be concessional) that could push the
debt to export ratio above the threshold in FY2014, reaching a peak of 115 percent in FY2015, and
then drop below the threshold by FY2018, despite export growth exceeding 10 percent annually.

41.    Continued emphasis on grant financing, debt management and export promotion will
be important to mitigate risks. Given the substantial rise in the PV of the debt-to-export ratio
through new borrowing, the securing of concessional financing should remain a priority for the
government. Also measures further promoting exports would help reduce the risks of foreign
exchange bottlenecks.

42.     Haiti's debt sustainability remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. Stress tests with
shocks to export revenues, growth and non-debt creating flows indicate a worsening outlook across
all indicators but the debt-to-export ratio remains the only indicator to exceed acceptable levels in
the single shock scenarios. Haiti is most vulnerable to a combination of these shocks, which could
push the PV of debt-to-exports ratios up to 400 percent in FY 2012, and lift both the NPV of debt-
to-GDP and PV of debt-to-revenue above prudential levels. Similarly, the combination shock
scenario under the debt forgiveness assumptions would prolong the breach of the debt-exports ratio
to FY2027, after reaching a peak of 297 percent in FY2012, highlighting Haiti's continued external
debt vulnerability, in part stemming from its very narrow export base.

43.    Notwithstanding the significant challenges posed by the post-earthquake situation, the
macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate for the purposes of the proposed
operation. The supported policy actions aim to improve transparency and accountability in the

                                                 14
management of substantial aid inflows. If adequately used, these inflows will strengthen the
framework for sustainable economic recovery and growth. The sustainability of its fiscal program
and balance of payments has been assessed using projections of Haiti's macroeconomic outlook. In
deeming the macroeconomic policy framework as adequate, Bank staff considered (i) views of IMF
staff, (ii) the final review of the IMF ECF program in place since July 2007, and (iii) and the
support by the May 2010 IMF mission for a new three-year ECF. The operation's support, together
with the budget support provided by other donors will help assure full financing of the budget and
external financing needs.

           III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND REFORM AGENDA


44.    The government has prepared an Action Plan for National Recovery and Development
of Haiti, drawing on the PDNA, to guide the reconstruction process after the earthquake. The
Action Plan is built around 4 pillars and lays out a long-term vision to rebuild Haiti by turning the
January 12 disaster into an opportunity for development:

   (a) Geographical Planning of the rebuilding strategy, including identifying, planning and
       managing new development centers; rebuilding affected areas, including economic
       infrastructure required for growth (roads, energy and communication); and managing land
       tenure, in order to protect property and facilitate the advancement of large projects.
   (b) Economic rebuilding which at: modernizing the various components of the agricultural
       sector; providing export potential for fruits and tubers, livestock farming and fishing, in the
       interests of food security; developing the professional construction sector with laws and
       regulations relating to earthquake-resistant and hurricane-resistant materials and
       implementation and control structures; promoting manufacturing industries; and organizing
       the development of tourism.
   (c) Social rebuilding which consists in prioritizing an education system that guarantees access
       for all children; offering vocational and university education to meet the demands of
       economic modernization; and creating a health system that ensures minimum coverage
       throughout the country and social protection for the most vulnerable.
   (d) Institutional rebuilding focused on rebuilding the capacities of affected government
       departments by prioritizing the most essential functions; redefining the legal and regulatory
       framework in line with national requirements; implementing an institutional structure that
       will oversee the reconstruction process; and establishing a culture of transparency and
       accountability that deters corruption.

45.     The government is putting particular emphasis on governance reforms, the key aspects
of which are described in the governance program presented by the government at the New
York conference in March 2010. The note on governance lays out the priority measures in the
short and medium term to ensure that fiduciary standards are in place, budget controls and
procurement are effective, and anti-corruption measures are reinforced. The governance program's
objective is to create governance conditions and capacity for an efficient management of the
massive aid inflows pledged by Haiti's partners to support the reconstruction strategy (see Annex
5). It also intends to demonstrate that the government is actively taking steps to reassure the
population that the reconstruction fund will be used in a transparent and credible manner.


                                                 15
46.      These strategies are in line with the DSNCRP that presents the government's long-
term vision to foster growth, reduce poverty, and raise living standards, through an ambitious
program of institutional reform and public investment. The DSNCRP was prepared through a
participatory process consisting of consultations with civil society, government officials, and
development partners. The overall strategic priorities of the DSNCRP are structured around three
pillars: (i) enhancing human development, with a focus on improving delivery of basic services; (ii)
improving security and the justice system; and (iii) promoting vectors of growth through agriculture
and rural development, tourism, and infrastructure. The DSNCRP also includes as one of its cross-
cutting policy priorities a strategy to build state capacity, including state modernization and civil
service reform. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of a stable macroeconomic framework and
sound management of public resources.

47.     The damage caused by the earthquake represents a major setback to progress
achieved under the DSNCRP's growth pillar. The government started implementation of the
DSNCRP in January 2008. An assessment of the government's first Annual Progress Report
conducted by Bank and Fund staff in June 2009 concluded that progress during the first year of
implementation was satisfactory to meet the HIPC completion point triggers. The assessment
highlighted in particular the progress made in the areas of agriculture, infrastructure, social sector
policies and economic and public sector governance. In 2009 new investment and construction
strengthened the infrastructure network. Projects included the rehabilitation of irrigation systems,
school construction, the rebuilding of bridges, the construction of new roads, the installation of new
power plants, and the rehabilitation of the two main airports. The earthquake caused major damage
to the nation's main port and airport. Around 70 km of main roads have been damaged and several
bridges have collapsed. Telecommunication infrastructure by contrast emerged relatively
unscathed.

48.        Progress in improving basic social service delivery before the earthquake has
suffered a major reversal. In education, before the earthquake, a tuition support program for
disadvantaged families had been expanded; a new teacher-training program had implemented
transfer mechanisms for tuition waivers (subsidies) to schools; and the government had started a
US$4.5 million emergency school reconstruction and rehabilitation plan. The earthquake had a
devastating impact on the educational sector by destroying or rendering unusable an estimated 1300
schools and killing many teachers. Many schools reopened in April, having staying closed for 3
months after the earthquake. In health, some progress had been made before the earthquake.
Tuberculosis and HIV incidence rates were falling, and there had been a rise in medically assisted
births. In October 2009 and with support from the Carter Center, Haiti and the Dominican Republic
launched a program to eliminate malaria and lymphatic filariasis through providing free diagnosis,
treatment, and mosquito nets. The earthquake has severely disrupted healthcare provision in the
affected areas with 30 of 49 hospitals damaged or destroyed and half of the capital's medical staff
living in tents. However, nine out of ten health centers and clinics remain intact.

49.  Significant efforts are needed to sustain the progress made in public finance
management and procurement. In public expenditure management, progress includes:

       (i) Modernization of the legal framework for public expenditure management--including
           the strengthening of budget controls with the creation of the internal audit body (IGF)


                                                 16
             and actions to reduce the backlog and delay in submitting the Court of Accounts' legal
             opinion on the Budget Review Law to Parliament;

         (ii) The strengthening of budget execution, which resulted in a substantial reduction in the
              use of discretionary accounts by line ministries, from approximately 60 percent to 3
              percent of current expenditures; and

         (iii) Improved tracking of public expenditure management through the operationalization of
              an integrated financial management system (SYSDEP), and the publication of quarterly
              budget execution reports.

50.     With respect to revenue, significant progress was made in tax and customs administration,
which helped sustain tax revenue performance over the recent past. The government had
implemented a comprehensive package of reforms including: (i) the adoption by Parliament of a
new Customs Code; and (ii) the modernization of the information systems in both the Directorate of
Customs and Taxes to enhance the effectiveness and transparency in revenue management. A new
computerized information system (ASYCUDA World) under UNCTAD assistance was installed in
the main customs offices. Similarly, a computerized information system (Systeme de Gestion des
Informations) was installed in the Directorate of Taxes and in the metropolitan zones7 as part of the
Strategic Plan to strengthen the Directorate of Taxes for the 2006-11 period. In addition, the
customs process was formalized, customs personnel capacity was enhanced, and the operating pre-
inspection company had started working in the provinces to help ensure effective customs revenue
collection.

51.     In the fight against corruption, since the beginning of the 2000's, there has been progress in
strengthening the legal anti-corruption framework. Haiti has ratified the Inter-American Convention
against Corruption (March 29, 1996), the United Nations Convention against Transnational Crimes
(December 19, 2000), and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (May 2007)8. The
signing of these international conventions was followed by the creation of the Anti-Corruption Unit
(ULCC) in 2004, the adoption by Parliament of a law requiring the disclosure of assets for Haitian
civil servants in February 2008 enforcing the relating provision of the Constitution (Article 42)9,
and the adoption of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy in 200910.



7
   Petionville, Carrefour, Croix-des-Bosquets, Delmas, Tabarre, Service de l'Immatriculation des véhicules, unité de
gestion et de contrôle fiscal des grands contribuables.
8
   These international conventions contain a comprehensive series of norms and regulations, which all countries must
enforce in order to strengthen their juridical and statutory regimen to fight corruption. These provisions establish the
foundations for a closer cooperation between governments in preventing and detecting corruption, as well as in
recovering stolen assets.
9
  According to this law, any individual participating or exercising public authority, or who is in a position whereby he
or she is presented with the opportunity to misappropriate public funds must disclose his or her assets at entry and exit.
It should be noted however, that the asset declarations are not disclosed to the public (common practice in other
countries with such a law) due to the high risk of kidnappings and insecurity, which limits the purpose of the law in
promoting transparency and accountability. Rather, the asset declarations are submitted to the ULCC and the
information remains confidential.
10
   The National Anti-corruption Strategy was informed by the governance and corruption survey as well as other key
analytical pieces on governance and corruption. It included recommendations from various stakeholders. It provides an
overview of governments priorities for policy reform. The document was completed with the Bank's support under the

                                                           17
52.      Lastly, in public procurement, progress includes the strengthening of the legal framework
for procurement with the adoption of a Procurement Law and the key implementing decrees in
2009. 11 These steps were expected to consolidate the progress achieved prior to 2009 as a result of
the creation of the procurement regulatory body (CNMP), which helped regulate procurement
practices and brought about a significant reduction of the percentage of noncompetitive
procurement (defined as contracts awarded "sole source" or after "restricted bidding"). According
to the latest statistics available, the use of such noncompetitive procurement methods (gré-à-gré
and appel d'offres restreint) declined from an estimated 85 percent of contract awards in 2004 to 56
percent in 2008. The CNMP also created a website (www.cnmp.gouv.ht) to publish invitations to
bid, a list of suppliers, and awarded contracts. As a result of these efforts, procurement practices in
Haiti today are much improved compared to those in place prior to the 2005 reform effort. Five
years ago, the procurement system was characterized by an inadequate legal framework and almost
total lack of transparency and oversight. Line ministries and agencies were virtually free to adopt
their own methods for procuring goods and services, and sole source (gré-à-gré) contracts and
unadvertised bidding were the norm. Chronically slow payments to contractors, combined with a
lack of legal recourse, also resulted in higher prices, liquidity problems for vendors, and the
potential for additional abuses.

                IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS

53.     The FY2009-12 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board on
June 2, 2009. It focuses on three pillars: (i) promoting growth and local development; (ii)
investing in human capital; and (iii) reducing vulnerability to disasters. The strategy has two-
pronged approach, combining longer-term institution building (including economic governance
reform) with support for the government in the delivery of quick, visible results to the population.
This results agenda involves activities to: (i) improve the effectiveness, transparency and
accountability of public sector institutions; (ii) consolidate governance reforms including public
financial management, both from the expenditure and revenue perspectives, and procurement to
strengthen core institutions; and (iii) strengthen key sector ministries that are critical for service
delivery.

54.    The CAS explicitly identifies budget support as an important aid modality, fostering
country ownership, alignment with the national development program, and domestic
accountability. Budget support for a country like Haiti is critical under the current circumstances to
ensure that the government has the financial space to safeguard pre-earthquake achievements in the
area of public finance management and continue implementation of governance reforms. The
impact of the earthquake on revenue collection is significant and concerted financial and technical
support is vital for economic recovery and rebuilding. Until some level of normalcy has returned in
economic activity and in the capacity to administer the tax system, substantial budget support

operations.

RELATIONS WITH IMF AND OTHER DONORS

55.     A large number of donors are active in Haiti. The EU, the IMF, France, Canada, USAID
and the IADB are providing support in a number of areas, including public finance management,
electricity sector reforms, and governance.

56.     The proposed operation has been prepared in consultation with the donor community.
A joint-mission of donors involved in budget support took place in May 2010 to coordinate the
policy actions underpinning the government's reform program and budget support operations in the
aftermath of the earthquake. This mission followed on a series of joint supervision missions and
consultations among the members of the budget support group (Groupe Conjoint d'Appui
Budgétaire, GCAB), including in particular the World Bank, IADB, EU, France, the Spanish
Agency for International Cooperation, CIDA) and the USAID, in collaboration with the IMF. The
donors signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in April 2009 with the objective of, in as
much as possible, harmonizing budget support operations. The MOU also established a budget
support group to provide a forum to exchange information among stakeholders and support policy
dialogue with the government. The government drafted a common policy matrix, which draws from
the PEMFAR action plan, among other sources. Donors coordinate closely in the supervision of the
implementation of the reform program contained in the matrix.

57.     The IMF is preparing a new ECF after the completion of the PRGF in January 2010,
the Board date of which is scheduled for July 21, 2010. The core reforms supported by the
program include: (i) enhancing public resource mobilization and efficiency of spending; (ii)
improving liquidity management and increasing the financial sector's contribution to growth; and
(iii) and improving the business and investment environment. In late May 2010, an IMF mission
reached agreement ad-referendum with the Haitian authorities on a new three-year ECF-supported
program. The periodic assessment of Haiti's macroeconomic performance by the Fund serves as a
key input for dialogue on policies related to macroeconomic stability and for ensuring timely
disbursement of budget support.

                                                  19
58.     The IADB supports the government's governance program through various
instruments. In addition to budget support, the IADB is also providing technical assistance in the
area of procurement, debt and data management (SYSGEP), budget preparation and execution as
well as developing capacities at the Customs and Tax Administration offices to boost revenues
collection. IADB assistance seeks to increase tax and customs revenues, improve the efficiency of
public spending and strengthen the management of public debt. In the energy sector, the assistance
seeks to support the government's efforts to increase the efficiency of the EDH power utility. The
IADB will also provide technical assistance to the Haitian government for strengthening the Energy
Unit at the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications to assess the legal framework and
develop regulatory measures to modernize the framework for the energy sector development and
increase the level of investments in this sector.

59.      CIDA is actively supporting the government's public finance management programs.
It has organized a series of training aiming to strengthen budget preparation, especially the capacity
of staff in the Ministry of Planning and other line ministries (Education, Public Works, Health,
Agriculture and Justice) to design a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) in line with the
DSNCRP objectives. In the area of revenue administration, Canada supports the Haitian
government in increasing its ability to generate revenue by providing consistent, long-term
technical assistance to its income tax and customs administrations. The support provided includes
technical assistance and the procurement of equipment that is used to modernize the country's fiscal
administration. Another CIDA project (PARGEP) aims to help strengthen governance in Haiti. To
achieve this aim, the project relies on the transfer of expertise from the public service of Quebec
and the École Nationale d'Administration Publique (ÉNAP) to the public service of Haiti. CIDA
also finances the provision of the expertise required to enable Haiti's national electricity company
(EDH), to provide quality electricity services to the city of Les Cayes.

60.     Brazil is the first donor to transfer funds to the Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF). It
contributed US$55 million. The Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF) gathered momentum after
Brazil contributed to the multilateral mechanism set up to help Haiti rebuild following the January
12, 2010 earthquake. In addition to Brazil, several other countries have indicated intention to donate
to the fund, which the World Bank oversees as its fiscal agent and administrator.

61.     Finally, both the EU and USAID are active in the economic governance area. The EU
has a number of long-term experts working in the Ministry of Finance providing technical
assistance in the restoration of economic governance systems and more specifically those related to
public finance management. Before the earthquake, USAID supported the Integrated Financial
Management System (IFMS) to identify and eliminate opportunities for corruption through
financial transactions using information and communications technology. Following the physical
destruction of a number of PFM related institutions, USAID will help restore the system to improve
government transparency and accountability. USAID has also assisted the Directorate of Taxes in
the development of Strategic and Tactical Plans for modernization and review of the main tax laws,
implementation of sound tax audits, collections, and taxpayer services and education, as well as the
development of a plan for data processing.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

62.     To support the recovery and reconstruction efforts, the World Bank group: (i) is
providing US$100 million of additional grants, US$65 million of this via an emergency IDA
project, the Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery Project, approved in March 2010;
(ii) has restructured and redeployed the existing portfolio of 14 projects (commitment: US$198
million, of which US$116 million undisbursed); (iii) has jointly coordinated the Post-Disaster
Needs Assessment; (iv) is directly supporting the government in crisis coordination, including
through support for the establishment of a crisis secretariat; and (v) is working with the government
and donors to develop new structures for reconstruction and aid coordination. IFC has also
approved US$35 million of emergency loans to the private sector.

63.     One component of the Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery Project
aims to restore key economic and financial functions of the government. This includes the
provision of technical assistance as well as the rehabilitation of equipment and offices. Technical
assistance support consists of: (i) enabling the reinstatement of the MEF's basic functions in
accounting, reporting, budget monitoring, and control; (ii) enabling the re-establishment of the
Court of Accounts and the strengthening of external audit capacity; and (iii) restarting operations at
the procurement regulatory body and procurement units in line ministries. In supporting key
government entities to re-establish operations, the provision of goods and equipment as well as
relocation or physical structure rehabilitation is critical, including for key institutions such as the
Central Bank, Procurement Regulatory Agency (CNMP), National Statistical Institute (IHSI), and
Auditor General's Office (CSC/CA). This component aims to exploit complementarities with other
Bank technical assistance projects, the EGTAG series (please see below).

64.      Recovery of the key functions of the Ministry of Economy and Finance will restore the
ability to carry out fundamental public finance functions and enable the government to plan
and direct the reconstruction program. The activities supported by the Infrastructure and
Institutions Emergency Recovery Project were selected in close consultation with the government
and coordinated with other development partners. These activities include: (i) the provision of
prefab-office spaces to the Ministry of Economy and the Directorate of Taxes and Customs in
addition to equipment for the Ministry of Finance and most economic and financial institutions
(CNMP, CSC/CA, IGF, IHSI); (ii) the restoration of the information technology and systems
between the Central Bank and the Treasury as well as between the Central Bank and commercial
banks; and (iii) the provision of technical assistance on the capacity to execute and control
expenditures.

65.      The proposed operation builds on three previous Economic Governance Reform
Operations (EGRO). The Board approved EGRO I, II and III in January 2005, January 2007 and
December 2009, respectively.12 These operations supported the government's implementation of
critical economic governance reforms to increase transparency and efficiency in the use of public
resources and external assistance. They had as objectives to: (i) improve budget preparation,
execution and control, and public procurement processes; (ii) strengthen public sector human
resource management; (iii) step up anti-corruption efforts; (iv) improve efficiency and transparency
in the management of public enterprises and the Road Maintenance Fund; (v) create a mechanism

     EGRO I was assessed by IEG as satisfactorily, having achieved the stated objectives.

for civil society to monitor economic governance reforms; and (vi) support government
communications to raise awareness of governance reforms. EGRO III, the most recent EGRO
operation, was designed to be followed by a fourth operation as part of a programmatic series of
two operations. The fourth operation was to be triggered by a set of follow-on actions. An
assessment of the status of triggers for EGRO IV is presented in Table 7. As of May 2010, only
four of the nine triggers for triggers were on track due to the impact of the earthquake on
institutions.

66.     Progress in the areas supported by the EGRO series was encouraging before the
earthquake. In public financial management, significant progress was made, in particular with
respect to budget management and financial controls. Progress in procurement had been relatively
slow with significant delay in the adoption of the Procurement Law and its application. In human
resource management, the architecture of a registry of state employees for key line ministries was
put in place and the legal framework for the civil service had been strengthened.13 In anti-
corruption, Haiti has now an anti-corruption unit. An anti-corruption strategy was adopted by the
government in March 2009 and was widely disseminated. In public entity management,
transparency had been enhanced with the completion of the financial audits of the national port
authority (APN), the telecommunications utility (TELECO), and the national electricity company
(EDH). The Road Maintenance Fund (FER) was fully operational with significant budget resources,
and transparency in the FER's resource management had been enhanced with the completion of an
audit on a yearly basis. Lastly, the government set up a mechanism for civil society, with
competitively hired civil society organizations (CSO) to increase understanding and raise awareness
of governance reforms and to monitor the government's program of economic governance reforms.

67.      Bank technical assistance grants support the implementation of governance reform.
Two ongoing Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grants (EGTAG I and II, US$2 million
each) have been helping the government to strengthen its institutional capacity in the areas of public
resource management. EGTAG I, approved by the Board in January 2005, was a core component of
IDA's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for Haiti, aimed at restoring the credibility of public
institutions in the wake of the political turmoil of the early 2000s. The project built on important
advances made by the LICUS Economic Governance Grant (US$1.5 million) program, approved in
November 2004, which provided immediate technical and financial assistance for institutional
strengthening. EGTAG II, approved in June 2006, has been restructured and extended through
2011. While initially covering a broad agenda across five components (financial resource
management, human resource development, monitoring of service delivery and sector policy, anti-
corruption and civil society engagement, and communication and project management), the
restructured operation focuses primarily on budget management, including budget formulation,
execution, monitoring and control. Specific activities include: (i) supporting the newly created
General Finance Inspectorate (Inspection Générale des Finances, IGF); (ii) strengthening the
budget oversight capacity of Parliamentarians by conducting capacity building activities to enhance
capacity of key Parliamentary Commissions; and (iii) strengthening the Budget Directorate
(Direction Générale du Budget) at the Ministry of Economy and Finance to further improve budget
by expanding the software- SYGAP- and capacity building activities to strengthen budget
formulation.

68.     The proposed operation is also closely linked to the Electricity Loss Reduction Project
(PREPSEL, US$6 million). PREPSEL aims to strengthen the electricity company's (EDH)
management systems and practices, improve the quality and reliability of electricity services, and
increase revenue collection capacity. Activities under the PREPSEL include: (i) financing the
installation of new billing and grid maintenance systems (CMS and TSMS), and remote meters for
13
  A new civil service law and a law for the organization of the central administration were enacted by decree in July
2005. The arrête defining the organization and functioning of the Conseil Supérieur de l'Administration et de la
Fonction Publique, was approved in March 2008. The completion of procedures for merit-based appointment and
promotions and the framework organizing and regulating the functioning of Office of Human Resources (OMRH) is
underway.

                                                         23
large clients and independent producers (IPPs), which will enable EDH to measure the energy
consumed by its clients, and produced by the large IPPs in a more reliable manner; and (ii) reducing
opportunities for theft. In addition, PREPSEL is providing capacity building support to strengthen
EDH's anti-fraud unit. An additional grant financing of US$5 million was approved in September
2009 to finance private sector management services for EDH, and cost overruns for the existing
project. The additional financing also builds on a Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) study that financed tariff and market studies and set out a proposal for improving EDH
management. The PPIAF and EGRO II also supported an increase in the transparency of transfers
from the state to the electricity sector through the monitoring mechanism table, which was prepared
in cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank.14 These measures are expected to improve the
EDH's profitability, contributing to a gradual reduction in budgetary support from the Treasury in
the long term. Higher returns will also help EDH improve the quality of its services, which will
have an overall beneficial effect on Haiti's economy.

69.    The Bank is also providing technical assistance to the government of Haiti using
resources from the Multi-donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development (US$150,000). An
industry-level cost competitive analysis of the Haitian garment sector is having a tremendous
impact on Haiti's ability to market itself to potential investors. The benchmarking data has been
used by IFC in investment promotional materials and government officials have used the data in a
recent investor forum hosted in Port-au-Prince, as well as to support two recent investment
promotion missions to Brazil and Korea.

70.    The South-South Experiences Exchange Trust Fund (SEETF) provided financial
support (US$50,000) to facilitate investment and economic cooperation between Haiti and two
large apparel producers: Brazil and South Korea. The trust fund has funded two outreach
missions to Brazil and Korea to meet potential investors, apparel buyers, manufacturers and
government counterparts with the objective of strengthening economic cooperation and bringing
investment to Haiti. The missions yielded good results in terms of image building and lead
generation.

71.    A number of Bank projects support the social sector agenda. Several projects support
the government's National Strategic Plan for Education for All, focusing on the first two strategic
choices related to increasing access for schoolchildren at the primary levels and supporting the
supply side by providing infrastructure with the view of reaching the 2015 goal of universal
primary education. First, an ongoing Education for All project (US$25 million) approved in
FY2007 supports increasing access to schooling through providing tuition waivers for poor families
and school feeding programs. It also aims to strengthen the supply side by
constructing/rehabilitating schools, increasing the supply of trained teachers, and strengthening
various capacity building activities in the Ministry of Education. Second, a US$5 million
Emergency School Reconstruction Project (ESRP), approved in March 2008 supports the National
Plan of Action for Safe Schools by restoring educational infrastructure and mitigating the
vulnerability of educational infrastructure. It also aims to strengthen the capacity of the Haitian
government to enhance disaster resilience across the education sector through training, appropriate

DSNCRP include projects in social protection and health.

LESSONS LEARNED

72.    Experience points to the need for adopting a simple approach in most fragile countries,
in particular after the occurrence of major natural disasters. In such an environment, the
design of a budget support operation should avoid the risk of delaying disbursement or of stalling
implementation because of exogenous factors--as was the case in the previous operation. The
proposed operation is single-tranche to promote continuity in areas where there has been
government ownership while focusing on institution rebuilding.

73.    Institutional rebuilding and strengthening of legal and regulatory frameworks are key
factors underpinning budget support operations supporting reconstruction programs. A key
immediate challenge for the government under the proposed operation is to continue strengthening
the legal framework for public finance management, anti-corruption and procurement to ensure
proper management of aid inflows. Ensuring that these core institutions function appropriately is
crucial for improving service delivery and efficient use of resources. Countries that have
experienced major natural disasters need strong institutional support to back up critical reforms
aimed at restoring the state functions quickly. Public expenditure management and anti-corruption
reforms are of paramount importance as massive aid inflows are expected for reconstruction
programs. This is a lesson drawn from experience in post-natural disaster countries.

74.      Technical assistance programs to support reforms represent a key factor unsatisfactory
implementation of budget support operations and progress in meeting development
objectives. To minimize the risk of slow implementation, the proposed operation has been designed
in close coordination with technical assistance programs including the EGTAG operations, the
Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency project, and the PREPSEL project. Other donor-financed
operations further complement the technical assistance provided by the Bank.

75.    Close coordination among development partners within a simple, commonly agreed
reform framework is important. Core institutions are recovering from the earthquake and
experience major difficulties to resume implementation of the government reform programs. Such
an approach requires a prioritization of reforms with a reasonable milestone framework based on
commonly agreed targets through enhanced coordination of development partners' programs.
Drawing from that lesson, the proposed operation is based on the government's matrix supported by
a harmonized budget support framework involving budget support actors.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

76.    The proposed operation draws on a wide range of analytical work carried out by the
government and the Bank in recent years. Most notably, the overall design of the operation is
based on the government's DSNCRP itself, which was developed in a participatory process and
reviewed in detail in the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) prepared by the Bank and the Fund.

77.    Technical notes have been prepared on key issues of economic governance which
receive the financial support of the World Bank under EGTAG1: (i) debt management; (ii)

                                               25
anti-corruption; (iii) controls; (iv) procurement; (v) budget preparation and execution; and
(vi) public human resources management. These notes have been prepared in partnership with
the government of Haiti and experts. They summarize, on each issue, the legal and institutional
framework, the main achievements and weaknesses, and the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Their objective is to help the World Bank team and the country counterparts communicate
internally and externally on ongoing efforts and priorities ahead.

78.     The PEMFAR and its follow-up action plan provide the technical basis for the
proposed policy actions under the public financial management and procurement
components. The PEMFAR acknowledges certain progress in strengthening fiscal discipline and
improving the efficiency of the public financial management (PFM) and procurement systems over
the period 2005-08, despite the difficult context. The PEMFAR identified progress in budget
preparation and execution and in particular the improvements resulting from the implementation of
the FMIS SYSDEP. In the area of procurement, the establishment of the CNMP helped to
standardize tender documentation and improve the management of procurement processes. The
report identified a number of remaining challenges, namely the budget's limitation in terms of a
forward-looking perspective, and poor link with sector policies; the lack of cash-flow planning and
the weak capacity of line ministries; the need to link the different information systems; and the
opportunity to further improve the PFM regulatory framework. Policy recommendations in the area
of budget preparation included further linking budget and policy planning, incorporating extra-
budgetary funds into the budget; and communicating expenditure ceilings to the ministries at the
beginning of the budget preparation process. In the area of budget execution and control,
recommendations focused on accelerating recruitment of financial controllers, public accountant,
and financial inspectors, and continuing the process of reducing the comptes courants. Lastly, the
PEMFAR assesses Haiti's Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) and rates the
country's performance, which allows for comparing Haiti with other countries and highlighting the
progress to be made and steps to be taken in order to bring it at par with international standards in
the medium-long term.

79.      The Bank prepared a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) in 2006, which
identifies poor economic governance as one of the main constraints to growth and poverty
reduction. The CEM highlights the important advances made between 2004 and 2006 to increase
transparency and efficiency in the use of public resources and external assistance. These included
changes in the legal framework for budget formulation and execution, the setting up of critical
institutions and agencies, and efforts at disseminating basic information. The report's
recommendations focused on the need for full implementation of the new legal framework, and the
capacity building necessary to achieve the implementation especially with regards to revenue,
expenditure and human resource management. Gradually, coverage of the framework could then be
extended to offices handling financial management and planning functions in sectoral ministries. In
addition, the report points to the need for redistributive policies--through increased collection of
progressive taxes to mobilize much needed public resources, and improved efficiency and targeting
of public spending. The findings and recommendations of the CEM with regards to economic
governance reform were subsequently incorporated into the EGRO series.

                             V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION


OPERATION DESCRIPTION

80.    The proposed supports the government's Action Plan, which outlines the
government's priorities for Haiti's reconstruction. In particular, the operation supports the
governance program. The objective of the proposed operation is to strengthen and implement the
legal and regulatory frameworks and systems to create the conditions for accountability and
transparency in the context of the reconstruction.

81.   The program design balances the pragmatism required to respond to the earthquake
and the urgent need to address existing and emerging governance and fiduciary risks. The
program places emphasis on accountability and transparency in areas with risk of weak governance
and where the government's buy-in has been established and where progress has been achieved.

82.      Consistent with the above strategy, attention has shifted towards operationalizing
oversight institutions and mechanisms. The proposed operation focuses on areas deemed critical
for creating governance conditions that are conducive to transparent and efficient use of the
reconstruction funds, and enhanced accountability. The design of the operation derives from the
perceived risk of inefficient use of public resources if oversight institutions are not operational and
the legal and regulatory frameworks for adequate public expenditure management, accountability
and control as well as procurement systems are not in place during the immediate period following
the earthquake. Such a risk, if it materializes, may lead to weak capacity and inefficient use of
resources, worsening political and social tension, and therefore could jeopardize the reconstruction
efforts.

83.      The proposed operation aims to contribute to: (i) improved transparency in the
management of public transfers to the electricity sector (EDH) and independent power providers;
(ii) strengthening the external and internal control audit functions; (iii) strengthening the monitoring
mechanisms of the declaration of assets; and (iv) reinforcing procurement regulation to enhance
transparency in procurement practices. The heightened focus on these areas has been stressed in the
governance program announced and presented by the government in New York, in March 2010.

84.     While the proposed operation is not a continuation of the EGRO series, it uses some of
its critical triggers. The areas of focus do not differ significantly from those addressed in the
previous operation (EGRO III), and not only does the proposed operation address the short-term
challenges after the earthquake but it also aims to consolidate the gains achieved in the recent past.
Areas of continuity include the strengthening of budget controls and audits, and the establishment
of transparency in the management of transfers in the electricity sector given the urgency of
ensuring adequate monitoring and oversight of public resource use. While retaining procurement as
an area of focus, it shifts the focus on implementation of the procurement Law to strengthening the
legal framework and capacity given the damages to procurement institutions. The EGRO series will
be discontinued, and the Bank will consider a new series of policy loans to better assist Haiti in
addressing the new policy and development challenges in the aftermath of the earthquake.



                                                  27
85.     The government is working on a strategy to revamp the Tax Directorate with IMF
assistance. The government is also revising Haiti's tax policy and the upcoming strategies will
define the prioritization of measures to enhance tax administration and tax policy. The Bank is
assisting the government of Haiti through the provision of prefabricated offices to rebuild the Tax
Directorate offices, which is the priority announced by the government in the aftermath of the
earthquake.

86.    Prior actions. The Bank is supporting the government in its efforts to implement its
governance program, following assurances that it is committed to carry on with the implementation
of these reforms. Box 2 provides a summary of the prior actions that the government has already
undertaken to implement the program supported by this Grant.

                                                 Box 2: Prior Actions

A. Transparency in transfers management

To Enhance Transparency and Monitoring of Financial Transfers in the Electricity Sector:

The government has strengthened the monitoring of payments to the electricity sector, as evidenced by the issuance of a
joint-memorandum from the MEF and the MTPTC (under whose authority EDH is) describing: (i) the procedures to be
followed by the MEF and EDH for payments of IPPs pursuant to the IPPs' respective contracts currently under
implementation; and (ii) MEF and EDH's respective obligations in this procedure.

The MEF has published on its website the monitoring mechanism table ­ consolidated by MTPTC ­ for the period from
October 2009 through March 2010. At a minimum, the table includes updated monthly data on: (i) payments made by
the State to each IPP, as well as transfers to cover EDH fuel costs, (ii) payments made by EDH to each IPP, (iii) energy
produced by each IPP, and (iv) amounts billed by each IPP during the period.

B. Public Finance Management

To reinstate Budget Controls

The CSC/CA has communicated to MEF the results of the external audit of the government accounts (October 2007 to
September 2008).

The MEF has submitted the 2008-09 central government accounts to the Supreme Audit Institution (CSC/CA).

The Ministry of Finance has adopted a revised action plan for 2010-2014 and a manual of internal control procedure for
use by inspectors of IGF.

C. Public Sector Governance

To Advance Transparency in Public Affairs through Enhanced Enforcement of the Declaration of Asset Law

The Anti-Corruption Unit (ULCC) has submitted a progress report on the Asset Declaration Compliance, including
specific recommendations for action, to the MEF, the Senate, and the Court of Accounts.

To reinforce public procurement regulation and enhance transparency in procurement practices

The CNMP has restored its website containing information on procurement bids and contracts awarded.
The recruitment of the new members of the CNMP has been advertized in local newspapers.

The government has issued an instruction to Ministries and other public contracting authorities to clarify that the use of
accelerated procurement procedures under the State of Emergency Law must receive prior authorization from the Prime
Minister.


                                                           28
                                Box 3: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The design of the proposed operation is consistent with the government's DSNCRP and the government Action plan for
reconstruction. These strategies were prepared in a participatory manner, ensuring broad based stakeholder
involvement. Consultations regarding the proposed procurement reforms took place.

Principle 2: Agree Upfront With the government and Other Financial Partners on a Coordinated Accountability
Framework

The policy matrix for the proposed operation draws from the government's matrix underpinning harmonized support
operations, which was finalized in May 2010 for the FY2009-10.

Principle 3: Customize the Accountability Framework and Modalities of Bank Support to Country
Circumstances

The policy actions supported by this operation on the one hand reflect the post-conflict environment from which Haiti
has only recently emerged and the impact of the earthquake on key governance institutions, and on the other hand
recognize that progress has been made over the past years in governance. For instance, some measures sustain progress
achieved in the past and focus on results while others focus on institution rebuilding. The operation was also designed
as a single-tranche DPG to take into account the political uncertainty in the next months.

Principle 4: Choose Only Actions Critical for Achieving Results as Conditions for Disbursement

The selected prior actions and conditions for disbursement focus on actions deemed critical for stronger government
capacity to manage the reconstruction fund in a transparent manner. Areas addressed by the operations are also highly
visible and progress achieved would strengthen Haiti's credibility, thereby maximizing the chances for mobilizing
further external support. The proposed operation focuses on areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage and has
existing operations providing technical assistance or sectoral expertise through investment operations, which would
help ensure efficient monitoring and supervision.

Principle 5: Conduct Transparent Progress Reviews Conducive to Predictable and Performance-Based Financial
Support

At the request of the government, two supervision missions (December 2009 and May 2010) of the matrix
underpinning budget support operations had been organized by the government, which helped assess progress in
targeted areas including among other areas public finance management, anti-corruption, tax reforms, procurement, and
prioritize and sequence reforms. It also helped provide a clear calendar of performance-based disbursements. Future
budget support operations will be based on the reforms that will emerge from a supervision mission tentatively
scheduled for October 2010 by the government.

POLICY AREAS

87.     The proposed operation supports key policy actions under four broad policy areas,
organized in three components: (i) transparency in the management of the transfers to the
electricity sector; (ii) public finance management, in particular budget control and audits; and (iii)
public sector governance understood as anti-corruption and procurement. Annex 2 summarizes the
policy measures taken prior to the Board presentation of this operation and the expected outcomes.

88.    Annex 2 also lays out the follow-on measures, which highlight the main actions the
government plans to implement as part of its governance program. The key next steps as
described in this section do not necessarily form the indicative triggers for a follow-on operation.
Presenting the government's course of governance activities that follows the measures underlined
                                                          29
in the proposed operation helps understand the rationale for the choice of the prior actions and its
links with the broad governance objectives in the medium term.

Component 1: Transparency in the Management of Transfers to the Electricity Sector

Background and Sector Issues

89.     Electricity supply by EDH was largely insufficient relative to demand.15 The earthquake
further aggravated its EDH operating capacity. The national and vertically integrated utility
Electricité d'Haïti (EDH) has been in a dire financial situation, with losses averaging 50 percent.
Such a situation has resulted from lack of maintenance, which affected the quality of service and
fueled a culture of nonpayment. Compounded by weak management and governance problems, it
has affected EDH's capacity to generate revenues and its capacity to invest in the sector. Efforts
aimed at expanding coverage have led EDH to subcontract the provision of electricity to
independent providers. Unable to cover its expenses (including fuel costs) EDH has relied on fiscal
transfers from the Treasury, amounting to US$100 million on average annually over the past years.
The earthquake damaged power generation, transmission, and distribution. EDH is facing increased
difficulties in billing clients and generating revenues. Although electricity services have been
restored in several affected areas, sustaining electricity supply represents a difficult challenge for
the government.

90.     The earthquake damaged previous efforts to address weak billing, to increase revenue
collection, and improve delivery. In 2009, government designed policy reforms to improve EDH
management and reduce fiscal inefficiencies in the sector through a two-pronged effort: (i)
improving the financial situation of the utility; and (ii) strengthening institutional capacity in the
sector. The government started with the design of a new tariff structure for EDH in August 2009 to
gradually improve its financial situation, followed by a reduction in the amount of transfers to the
electricity sector in the 2009 budget from approximately US$100 million to US$50 million. Under
the new structure, the subscription fee for all clients and the tariffs for non residential customers
roughly doubled. With respect to management capacity, contracts for the provision of new billing
(Customer Management System - CMS) and grid maintenance (Technical Service Management
System - TSMS) systems in EDH were awarded in June 2009 through a competitive bidding
process.16 Implementation of the systems was to be accompanied by the introduction of a new
enhanced commercial approach in utility.

91.     At the time the earthquake struck, the system installation was ongoing and surveys for
the construction of the new database feeding into the information systems had started. The
installation of both systems only resumed in April 2010. It is expected that the completion of
system installations will not take place before October 2010, a four-month delay. With respect to
revenue, EDH's revenues have decreased substantially in the aftermath of the earthquake due to a
drop in the number of customers in Port-au-Prince and the difficulty for EDH to deploy teams in the

15
  Overall, less than 20 percent of the Haitian population and only a few areas have access to electricity.
16
   The CMS will facilitate proper execution and monitoring of all commercial activities of EDH, in particular metering,
billing and collection. The TSMS aims to optimize attention of customer claims related to poor quality of electricity
supply, by helping reduce time between the receipt of claims and the restoration of regular electricity supply, which is
the critical parameter of quality of service.

                                                          30
capital to bill electricity. In March 2010, revenues were approximately at 30 percent compared with
December 2009.

92.     Transfers are expected to increase, contrary to previous forecasts, thereby putting
further strain on the budget. Given the impact of the earthquake on the electricity sector, the
FY09-10 amount of the transfers already increased from a budgeted amount of US$50 million in
the FY09-10 budget to an adjusted amount of US$87.5 million. It is projected to reach US$110
million in FY10-11. This represents approximately 34 percent and 76 percent of the projected
budget support respectively for FY09-10 and FY10-11. The amount of transfer is likely to increase
beyond the projected amounts as the government also plans to expand electricity coverage to
support industry, trade and tourism zones with the participation of the private sector in the near
future (including through a contract awarded to a private provider, which is building a 30 MW
Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) Power Plant in Port au Prince). Planned projects already identified include:
the rehabilitation of the Peligre power plant, construction of the Artibonite C-4 hydroelectric dam
and the rehabilitation of the power plants of Sault Mathurin and North Caracol.

93.     Increases in transfers require rapid measures to mitigate risk of capture and
mismanagement. The management of transfers to the electricity sector covering the operating costs
of EDH and that of independent power providers (IPP) lacks transparency and requires rapid
corrective action in view of the projected amounts. Until October 2008, transfers to the electricity
sector had been published on a regular basis and audited, although the government had some
reservations about the quality of the audits. Publication had been interrupted since 2008 and only
resumed in January 2010. Payments to the IPP and the use of transfers within EDH have not been
subjected to regular checks and balance. Due to the absence of a formal framework for monitoring
transfers and strict rules governing the transfers from the State to the electricity sector, payment
modalities also raises serious concerns about public resources management (See Box 4).

             Box 4: Contracts with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Haiti's Electricity Sector

The government and EDH signed Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs) with two private firms, respectively in 2006 in
2008, for the production of electricity. The first firm is present in Port au Prince (Varreux I, II and III) with a total
installed capacity of 35MW (to increase up to 57MW), while the second one has two plants in Les Cayes and Petit
Gôave for a total installed capacity of 24MW. As EDH has been unable to pay part or all of the (energy and fuel) costs
incurred under these contracts, the State budget is being used to cover the balance. The payment process, however,
lacks basic transparency and accountability principles, due to a systematic absence of communication among the
entities involved and inefficiencies throughout the process. Cases have arisen where, following a delay in paying the
invoice, withdrawals from the State treasury account at the Central Bank of Haiti (BRH) took place as stipulated in the
contract without prior notification to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Public Works, or whereby an IPP was
paid although EDH had objected to the invoice.


94.     The government is committed to pursuing fiscal transparency and efficiency in the
electricity sector. To that end, the government is determined to sustain actions toward establishing
enhanced transparency in the management of financial transfers, which will help detect weaknesses
and reduce fiscal inefficiencies in the sector. The EGRO III budget support operation already
supported this action. The monitoring mechanism table was published on the MEF website in
January 2010 with data covering the period October 2008 through September 2009. Although it
marked a net improvement, some key data - related to the specific fuel consumption under each IPP
and amounts billed to the government were still missing. The MTPTC and EDH were in the process

                                                          31
of collecting the data for the next publication in January 2010. However, the delay in publishing the
table and the missing data also pointed to a lack of organizational structure within the entities in
charge of data collection and institutional weaknesses in the management of electricity provision by
the private sector.

Specific Actions Supported By the Proposed Operation

   (i) The government has strengthened the monitoring of payments to the electricity sector, as
       evidenced by the issuance of a joint-memorandum from the MEF and the MTPTC (under
       whose authority EDH is) describing: (i) the procedures to be followed by the MEF and
       EDH for payments of IPPs pursuant to the IPPs' respective contracts currently under
       implementation; and (ii) MEF and EDH's respective obligations in this procedure.
       Difficulties with publishing the monitoring mechanism table on a regular basis have shown
       that it is necessary to support the implementation of a comprehensive framework for the
       monitoring of the transfers, instead of only focusing on the publication of the table. This
       would include formalizing the process by which bills are paid to the IPPs and clarifying the
       responsibilities of each entity in this process. In particular, it is essential that EDH verify the
       monthly invoices that it receives from the IPPs within the timeframe defined in the contract
       (usually 15 days). In the event that EDH cannot make payment, a detailed report on the
       invoice should be sent to MEF. In addition, each concerned entity (MEF, MTPTC, EDH)
       has formally nominated a person responsible for transmitting and consolidating the
       monitoring data.

   (ii) The MEF has published on its website the monitoring mechanism table ­ consolidated by
        MTPTC ­ for the period from October 2009 through March 2010. At a minimum, the table
        includes updated monthly data on: (i) payments made by the State­to each IPP, as well as
        transfers to cover EDH fuel costs, (ii) payments made by EDH to each IPP, (iii) energy
        produced by each IPP, and (iv) amounts billed by each IPP during the period. Financial
        transfers to the electricity sector and corresponding electricity production would continue to
        be monitored and published, as they are key elements of the improved governance in the
        sector. Nevertheless, taking into account the fact that EDH information systems were
        damaged by the earthquake, only "essential" data should be published during a transition
        period. At a minimum, the table will include updated monthly data on: (i) payments made
        by the State to each IPP, as well as transfers to cover EDH fuel costs; (ii) payments made by
        EDH to each IPP; (iii) energy produced by each IPP; and (iv) amounts billed by each IPP
        during the period. This prior action was a trigger for the fourth operation of the EGRO
        series and was slightly revised to reflect the challenges created by the post-earthquake
        period.

95.     By the end of this operation, the identified policy reforms are expected to contribute to
enhanced transparency in the management of the transfer. In particular, it is expected: (i) all
invoice payments by the Ministry of Finance (MEF) to the Independent Power Providers (IPP) will
have followed the rules described in the joint-memorandum signed by the MEF and the Ministry of
Public Work; and (ii) data on payments to IPPs published on the Ministry of Finance's website and
actual payments will have been reconciled by the MTPTC and MEF.



                                                   32
Key next steps

96.     The government is determined to take further steps towards establishing full
transparency in the management of the transfers in the electricity sector. Over the coming
year, it is committed to commissioning a bi-annual audit of the reports by an independent firm to
verify if the information is factually correct, and adopt corrective actions if necessary. Such audits
would involve a reconciliation of the data reported by EDH with those of its local suppliers (i.e.
energy produced as measured by EDH and energy billed by the suppliers).

Component 2: Public Finance Management: Budget Controls

Background and Sector Issues

97.     The Haitian government's system of public expenditure controls, as prescribed by the
legal texts, encompasses administrative, jurisdictional, and parliamentary oversight.
Administrative oversight falls within the ambit of the General Finance Inspectorate (IGF), either
before or after payment of expenditures. External oversight of public expenditures is exercised,
independently of the administration, by the Superior Court of Audits and Administrative Disputes
or the Court of Accounts (Cour Supérieure des Comptes et du Contentieux Administratif ­
CSC/CA), which deals with jurisdictional oversight, and by the Parliament, which is responsible for
legislative oversight.

98.     Since 2004, the Haitian government has taken some steps to streamline public
expenditure controls. The Supreme Audit Institution was reorganized with the Decree of
November 23, 2005 establishing its organization and operations. The IGF was established as a
decentralized entity of the MEF through a decree issued in May 2006. It is responsible for the
internal audit function of the public sector. The IGF became operational in May 2009, with
adequate office space and equipment, and through recruitment of new inspectors.

99.      Progress achieved in terms of external control is being slowed down by the impact of
the earthquake on the CSC/CA following the destruction of its offices. Historically, the
certification of general accounts of the government and the issuance of a report to Parliament on the
integrity of the government's financial transactions by the CSC/CA was undertaken with significant
delay before Haiti's reengagement in 2004. Since its reorganization in 2005 and under the EGRO
series, the CSC/CA has undertaken measures to achieve its key objective of clearing the backlog of
the audits of government accounts and align its activities with the calendar envisaged within the
law. Over the recent years, it has achieved significant progress in budget control, including the
completion of the audits of the FY2003-2007 accounts and submission of the corresponding Budget
Review Laws. However, this progress was suffered a serious setback when the earthquake struck,
causing significant damage to its infrastructure. Since then, the CSC/CA has focused its efforts on
finding a new office and protecting and collecting files in the aftermath of the earthquake. It has
restored its capacity and it is now operational, with almost all its staff on board.

100. The role of the CSC/CA in the reconstruction process is key, especially the resumption
of certification of government accounts and issuance of a report for the Budget review in
accordance with the legal timeframe. Identifying bottlenecks and integrity issues in the
government operations and budget execution is paramount during the reconstruction process given

                                                 33
the significant amount of public resources expected to be channeled through the budget and the
need for maximizing the efficiency of the budget. In addition, the recent operationalization of the
IGF provides opportunities to translate into corrective measures the recommendations from the
audits of the Court of Accounts regarding distortions and/or weaknesses identified in the
management of public resources by line ministries. However, realizing these opportunities requires
the swift resumption of the activities of the Courts of Accounts.

101. In order to meet such challenges, close coordination between the Treasury and the
Court of Account is required. The Treasury, as part of the MEF whose building is no longer in
use, has been affected by the earthquake, and implementation of its activities has been delayed
significantly. Before the earthquake, the Treasury was in the process of finalizing the 2008-09
government accounts, of which the submission to the Court of Accounts for audit purpose has
beendelayed. With the MEF resuming its operations, the Treasury is striving to complete this
process in order to meet the deadline for their submission, and to complete a similar process for the
FY09-10 government accounts. Their audit would help to ensure that any relevant issues arising
from the audit conducted by the Court of Accounts would be incorporated in the FY10-11 budget
execution cycle. The Treasury considers it a priority to place the FY09-10 budget execution and
revenue management under external audit and legislative scrutiny in order to identify weaknesses
that may have affected the budget integrity in the current fragile environment and the
administration's weakened capacity.

102. Although the functioning of the internal audit body (IGF) was not significantly
disrupted by the earthquake, it has revised its action plan and work program to adjust to the
impact of the earthquake on government institutions and the corresponding challenges. The
IGF started implementing the organizational and financial audits in December 2009 according to
the action plan that was approved by the Ministry of Finance, following its staffing and the
appointment of its Head. The impact of the earthquake, resulting needs and reconstruction activities
have led to a changing environment, requiring an adjustment of the IGF's action plan. In particular,
the increase in the number of projects and aid flows has contributed to the necessity for this change.
Consequently, the IGF has designed a new action plan covering the FY2010-14 period, which
includes new audit activities to be submitted for approval to the Ministry of Finance. Audits and
controls planned for FY10-11 focus mainly on the post-earthquake activities. Among the planned
new tasks feature the audits of the settlement of salary arrears in the education sector and the
national police force, those of subsidies and transfers from the budget and all emergency funds as
well as the activities of public accountants in all line ministries, the inventory of projects managed
by the government or by other non-governmental entities. Lastly, the IGF also plans to finalize and
submit for validation and adoption by the Ministry of Finance the operational manual to be used by
inspectors to ensure that audits are conducted in full compliance with international standards.

103. The Bank technical assistance projects (EGTAG and the Infrastructure and
Institutional Emergency projects) provide support aimed at strengthening internal control
and audit activities in order to achieve these goals. The EGTAG provides assistance aimed at
strengthening capacity of the IGF to enable it to fulfill its planned activities. Such support includes
the provision of equipment and capacity building. The IGF also plans to recruit more inspectors in
its action plan from nine (9) in FY 2008-09 to fourteen (14) and twenty-one (21) respectively in
FY2009-10 and FY2010-11, and coordinate closely with other institutions such as the Court of
Accounts and ULCC. These projects also provide support to the Court of Account, including

                                                  34
equipment and capacity building so it can fully operate and improve the quality of the audit reports
in line with international standards. Lastly, the Bank also foresees support to the Treasury to speed
up the completion of government accounts and improve the quality of revenue and expenditure
consolidation and monitoring.

Specific Actions Supported By the Operation

   (i) The CSC/CA has communicated to MEF the results of the external audit of the government
       accounts (October 2007 to September 2008). This action initiates the process leading to the
       submission of the CSC/CA's legal opinion on the draft budget Review Law (Loi de
       Reglements) to the Senate, which would be done upon review by the Ministry of Finance of
       the results of the audits;

   (ii) The MEF has submitted the 2008-09 central government accounts to the CSC/CA. This
        should have taken place eight months after the end of the fiscal year. However, due to the
        impact of the quake on the MEF, it has been delayed. The Treasury has stepped-up efforts to
        complete the exercise and proceed with the submission of the accounts to the CSC/CA
        which in turn will proceed with the related audits for submission of its legal opinion on the
        2008-09 Budget Review Law to the Senate. This prior action was a trigger for the fourth
        operation of the EGRO series; and

   (iii) The Ministry of Finance has adopted an action plan for internal audit for 2010-2014 and a
        manual of internal control procedure for use by inspectors of IGF. The revised action plan
        would prioritize and sequence the planned internal audits taking into account the needs and
        challenges emerging from the changing environment based on the recommendations of the
        CSC/CA in the recent external audits. The new procedural manuals would help the IGF
        proceed with the audits in compliance with the required standards. This prior action was a
        trigger for the fourth operation of the EGRO series and was slightly revised to reflect the
        audit needs in the context of the reconstruction.

104. By the end of this operation, it is expected that: the compliance of external audits and
Budget review Law submission with the statutory timeframe will have been improved. In
particular: (i) the 2009-10 government accounts are submitted by the MEF to the Court of
Accounts, no more than eight months after the end of the FY2010; and (ii) the results of the audits
of the 2008-09 and 2009-10 government accounts are communicated by the Court of Accounts to
the MEF by September 30, 2011.

105. With regard internal audit, the IGF will have complied with the audit action plan endorsed
by the Ministry of Finance (2010-14), and audit reports are disseminated to the beneficiaries and
competent authorities. The audit reports include at least: (i) the inventory of government and
NGOs' projects; (ii) audits of subsidies in the education sector and the transfers by the MEF; (iii)
analysis of audit reports issued by the Court of Accounts; and (iv) audits of public accountants
activities in the MEF.




                                                 35
Key Next Steps

106. To sustain efforts aimed at fully restoring public expenditure management control and
effectiveness, the government intends to adopt actions aimed at: (i) sustaining previous efforts
to improve the orderliness and integration of budget process, and the integrity of government
operations. These are addressed in the procedural manual for the preparation and execution of
budget to be adopted by the MEF. These manuals would help to address weaknesses in sequencing
processes and in the integration of current and investment budgets. They would also help to
establish the procedures and controls for ensuring compliance with budget rules that are to be
applied to the deposits and expenditures from discretionary accounts (comptes courants) monitored
by Public Accountants; and (ii) starting deployment of inspectors in line ministries to monitor the
implementation of the recommendations of internal audit reports completed by the IGF.

Component 3: Public Sector Governance

3.a Anti-Corruption

Background and Sector Issues

107. Empirical evidence shows that during emergency and reconstruction processes,
opportunities for corrupt practices increase, especially in fragile environments, which
requires the strengthening of measures to fight corruption. In the case of Haiti, the oversight
capacity of governance institutions including the control and audit bodies and procurement
regulations have been weakened, leaving the state with limited capacity in an already difficult
environment. The procurement regulatory body is not operational yet, procurement units in line
ministries have been weakened and so has the Court of Accounts. Full restoration of the capacity of
these entities is not foreseen in the immediate future. At the same time, despite slight improvements
in the 2009 Transparency International survey, Haiti still scores poorly on measures concerning
corruption17 which is perceived as a major problem in the public sector.18

108. Although Haiti is equipped with a panoply of instruments to fight corruption, in
general, effective implementation of anti-corruption measures has been slow and difficult. The
poor enforcement of the declaration of Assets Law is particularly striking. A report on first year
compliance (indicating the number of declarations received by functions as indicated by the law,
with geospatial indications and indicating compliance issues that require follow-up by the
Judiciary), submitted by the ULCC to the Supreme Audit Institution (CSC/CA) and to the Senate
and Lower House on April 24, 2009, indicated that the compliance rate is very low. Excluding the
declarations that should be filed by the police force, to date only about one-fourth of the asset
declarations have been submitted. About 87 percent of the high-level members from the Executive
branch have complied with the mandatory request to file an asset disclosure form, the compliance
rates for members of the legislative and the judicial branches as well as senior management

17
   According to statistics published by Transparency International, Haiti achieved a score of 1.8 on the Index of
Perception of Corruption for 2009, a slight improvement from its score of 1.4 in 2008. Although this represents some
progress, Haiti still remains near the bottom of the index.
18
   This result came out of a "Governance and Corruption Survey" conducted jointly by ULCC and the World Bank in
2005.

                                                        36
representatives and public accountants, have been very low.19 In the current context marked by
increasing social and political tension, and in view of the massive aid inflows, low compliance rate
raises concerns as lagging submissions include those of officials managing public resources. It
should be noted that all members of the Interim Commission for the Reconstruction of Haiti should
declare their assets upon acceptance of a position in the commission.

109. In its governance program presented in New York, the government has highlighted the
need to ensure the effectiveness of the Declaration of Assets Law. In the same vein, the ULCC
is determined to adopt corrective actions to ensure that measures against corruption are in
place. The Law provides ULCC with full authority to act, and especially the Attorney General to
bring a case to trial (Tribunal de Premier Instance) and to take stern measures each time
irregularities are brought to its attention20. However, from the legal point of view, a series of actions
precedes the adoption of sanctions to defaulters: following the submission and approval of the
compliance report to the Senate and the CSC/CA, the ULCC sends official reminders to defaulters,
which is then followed by the enforcement of the sanctions as per the Law.

110. The proposed operation supports the ULCC's efforts at following up on the compliance
report and providing update to ensure that monitoring and tracking are done in a sustained manner,
with the objective of improving compliance with asset disclosure. As a first step, the authorities will
seek full compliance of government members with the Law.

Specific Actions Supported By the Operation

111. The ULCC has submitted the Progress Report on the Asset Declaration Compliance with
the MEF, the Senate, and the Court of Accounts. This operation supports the submission of the
second year compliance report prepared by the ULCC to the CSC/CA and to the Parliament. The
report highlights progress made in compliance and persistent issues that need to be addressed.

112. By the end of this operation, it is expected that: the anti-corruption unit (ULCC) will
have sent a report to the Court of Accounts showing that the compliance rate to the Declaration of
Assets Law of the members of the government has increased from 87 percent (as of May 2010) to
100 percent.




19
    The Asset Declaration Law provides for the mandatory disclosure of assets by civil servants, including all ranks of
the police force. The coverage is broad and includes political figures, civil servants, and public officials within the
framework of institutional, political, judicial and administrative organizations. It therefore includes members of the
Government, the National Assembly, the Judiciary, other members of independent institutions, representatives in the
regions and departments, and other public administration officials. To date 28 out of 90 congress officials, 9 out of 70
senators and 435 out of 1,500 of civil servants have submitted their asset declaration to the ULCC, not taking into
account those declarations required by the police force. In total, the ULCC is expecting about 9,000 declarations of
which some 7,500 are for the police force. The main priority for the ULCC is to collect asset declarations from senior
civil servants.
20
   ULCC's mission is to work towards fighting all dimensions of corruption in the public administration, as a means to:
(i) protect public and collective goods; (ii) ensure the efficiency of the measures and actions aimed at preventing,
detecting, sanctioning and eliminating corruption actions and similar infractions; and (iii) promote transparency in
public management.

                                                          37
Key Next Steps

113. In the coming year, the government will intensify efforts aimed at strengthening the
implementation of Declaration of Assets Law. First, the authorities intend to enforce the sanctions
as per the Law to defaulters. No concrete actions have been undertaken to address issues raised by
the ULCC report last year. The ULCC keeps monitoring and tracking the percentage defaulters and
will enforce the Law by sending to those public officials who failed to submit asset declarations
reminder notices (exploit de rappel). If defaulters exceed the authorized submission deadline
subsequent to the reminder notice, the ULCC will take actions and resort to judicial means. The
sanction as defined by the Law is the deduction of 1/4 of defaulters' salary.

114. Second, the government intends to adopt by decree the Code of Ethics for the public sector
to support the dissemination and training of civil servants. This would follow the adoption of the
Anti-Corruption and Illicit Enrichment Law submitted to Parliament in December 2009 expected in
the next Parliament session. The code is finalized and the signature of an "ethics protocol" in the
context of the reconstruction of Haiti would allow the ULCC to: (i) detect cases of conflict of
interest; (ii) verify the legal status (in their countries of origin and in Haiti) of private firms that
obtain contracts with the government for reconstruction of infrastructure in Haiti; (iii) monitor the
allocation and use of emergency and reconstruction funds and disclose expenditures flows to the
public with the use of innovative systems like the government expenditure databases (GED) that
encourage budget transparency; and (iv) create the "procurement observatory" in collaboration with
the National Commission for Public Procurement (Commission Nationale des Marches Publics) for
the monitoring of public contracts and their compliance.

3.b Procurement

Background and Sector Issues

115. The earthquake has caused significant damage to Haiti's procurement system.
Following the adoption of a Procurement Law and subsequently the enactment of the first key
implementing decrees, it was expected that progress would continue at an accelerated pace as the
procurement regulatory body, the Commission Nationale de Marches Publics (CNMP)21, was
finalizing the rest of the implementing decrees and preparing their dissemination. The CNMP had
also begun assisting procurement units in line ministries with the preparation and adoption of
procurement plans as required by the 2009 Law. However, as a result of the earthquake, the office
of the procurement regulatory body was destroyed and the procurement units in line ministries were
weakened. Equipment and records have disappeared with the collapse of the public buildings, and
some staff were injured or left the country after the earthquake. The web site and data on
procurement bids have not been updated. The procurement system has been barely effective ever
since.



21
   The roles of the Commission National des Marchés Publics (CNMP) are, inter alia, to introduce effective
procurement control, strengthen capacity within line ministries, develop procurement policy, draft procurement
legislation, and standardize procurement procedures.

                                                     38
116. Two other elements require strengthening to avoid putting procurement practices and
oversight at risk in the current context. First, following the earthquake an Emergency Law was
passed by Parliament to amend the existing Emergency Law of September 9, 2008. The
amendment, dated April 19, 2010, specifies in article 7.5 that "By virtue of a declaration of a State
of Emergency, the government will award contracts that it considers necessary according to
accelerated procedures specified by the regulations governing public procurement." These
accelerated procedures are those specified in the Procurement Law of 2009 in article 34.1 on direct
contracting (gré-à-gré ) and articles 33 and 33.1 on restricted bidding procedures (l'appel d'offres
restreint). Both these non-competitive procedures are designated by the Procurement Law for use
only in exceptional cases and subject to authorization by the CNMP. However, if not adequately
regulated the lack of transparency associated with such emergency procedures could lead to an
increased risk of abuse and corruption. Second, the mandate of the CNMP's staff will expire in
September 2010. If the five members of the CNMP are not appointed (or reappointed) rapidly it
would further weaken procurement oversight and the assistance to line ministries. CNMP members
must be appointed by the Prime Minister following an open and competitive selection process.

117.     Reinforcing procurement regulation and strengthening the CNMP's capacity is a
priority. Donors' investment in the reconstruction under the financing of the HRF will be
scrutinized by the Commission and the Steering Committee before approval, and executed either by
the government or the donors. The approval process for projects includes provision of detailed
information on the procurement methods required, which will follow either the national
procurement rules or those of the donors. The CNMP monitors only procurement methods for the
government's projects but it is expected that a significant amount of investment will be executed by
the government. The progress achieved so far is unlikely to be reversed provided rapid and
appropriate measures are taken to restore the capacity of the CNMP to fulfill its mandate. Equally
important is the restoration of the procurement units' capacity in line ministries. The CNMP already
has new offices and Bank technical assistance projects are currently providing support to make the
CNMP fully operational through: (i) provision of equipment and furniture; and (ii) capacity
building. In particular, the CNMP will recruit experts for a 12 to 18 month period to help provide
assistance to line ministries, finalize the remaining implementing decrees, and organize the
dissemination process.

Specific Actions Supported By the Operation

   (i) The CNMP has restored its website containing information on procurement bids and
       contract awards. Although most of CNMP's files were destroyed in the earthquake, its
       electronic server was recovered, which facilitated the retrieval of some records to help
       consolidate data on contract awards. Restoring the website would help ensure transparency
       and complement the dissemination of new procedures to various government offices, the
       private sector, civil society, and public and private media. This prior action was a trigger for
       the fourth operation of the EGRO series and was slightly revised to reflect the context of the
       reconstruction;

   (ii) The recruitment of the new members of the CNMP has been advertized in local newspapers.
        The government has advertized the recruitment of the new CNMP members to take steps
        toward ensuring continued effectiveness of procurement regulation upon the expiration of
        the mandate of the CNMP members, expected in September 2010. This would help avoid an

                                                 39
           institutional vacuum that would impede procurement oversight, and delay key objectives
           with respect to the strengthening of line ministries and the adoption of the remaining
           implementing decrees; and

       (iii) The government has issued an instruction to Ministries and other public contracting
            authorities to clarify that the use of accelerated procurement procedures under the State of
            Emergency Law must receive prior authorization from the Prime Minister. The use of
            noncompetitive procurement methods could be justified in the aftermath of a major natural
            disaster. However, if not adequately regulated, the lack of transparency associated with
            such emergency procurement procedures could lead to an increased risk of abuse and
            corruption, especially in the current context. The requirement for authorization from the
            Prime Minister of all requests to use the accelerated procedures will ensure increased
            scrutiny of the accelerated procedures, and limit potential abuse on the part of contracting
            entities.

118. By the end of this operation, it is expected that: (i) the Prime Minister will have given
prior authorization to all contracts awarded by invoking the Emergency Law's accelerated
procedures; and (ii) compliance with the procurement code will have been improved, as evidenced
by a decrease in the share of non-competitive procurement in total procurement, from 56 percent
(as of 2008) to 45 percent. This indicator is measured by the value of contracts awarded without
competition as a percentage of all contracts that do not fall under the accelerated procedures
invoked by the State of Emergency Law.22

Key Next Steps

119. In the coming year, the government will intensify efforts to make the Procurement
Law fully effective. Various steps toward that end include: (i) strengthening the capacity of the
CNMP in order to proceed with the adoption of pending implementing decrees and preparing a
specific ad hoc decree to stipulate dispute resolution mechanisms; (ii) strengthening capacity within
the procurement commissions in line ministries, (particularly those in the Ministries of Public
Works, Public Health, Agriculture, Justice and Education); (iii) carrying out an audit of contracts
awarded in 2009-10 to assess compliance with the new Code; and (iv) preparation of public
procurement plans in key contracting authorities (at least five ministries) and public institutions and
communication of said plans to the CNMP for approval. Article 5 of the new Law requires
acceptable procurement plans from each public entity before expenditures can be approved. This
new practice will help reduce waste and fraud and inform the budget process.


                                  VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

PARTICIPATION PROCESS

120. Policy measures selected in this document have been informed by the outcomes of
various government consultative processes involving relevant stakeholders. The proposed
operation supports and draws from the government's DSNCRP and the government action plan for
22
     This indicator is the same as the one used in the EGRO III.

                                                             40
reconstruction developed during the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) following the
earthquake and presented to the donors in March 2010. These two documents outline the main
policy measures that went into this document including transparency, procurement, budget controls
and anti-corruption. As such, the design of the operation benefited from broad stakeholder
consultations conducted by the government. These consultations involved line cabinet ministers,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), members of civil society, the private sector, local
authorities, development partners and beneficiary groups. The participatory methodologies of the
DSNCRP also included a Strategic Planning and Action Process, focus group discussions and
participatory Poverty Assessments.

121. Extensive consultations were also held throughout the first half of 2009 on the new
procurement law. Over several months, the government engaged in a significant amount of
consultation with civil society and parliamentarians to ensure an inclusive process and to reconcile
divergent views. Furthermore, in March 2009 the CNMP organized a dissemination seminar to
familiarize key players, including representatives from different government agencies and the
private sector, as well as parliamentarians, academics and civil society representatives, with the
provisions of the law.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

122. The actions supported by this operation are likely to have positive poverty and social
impacts. Joint World Bank and IMF staff assessments of the DSNCRP have emphasized the need
for more explicit policies on governance reforms. The actions supported under the proposed
operation would contribute to an overall improvement in governance: (i) the proposed measures in
the electricity sector aim to increase transparency in public resource use to minimize capture and
fungibility; (ii) budget control and anti-corruption measures have as objective to enhance
accountability; and (iii) procurement reforms are expected to contribute to a reduction in the
opportunities for fraud in public contracting, while protecting the private sector's interests. These
measures will ultimately make it easier to scrutinize the extent to which voted budget allocations
and actual public expenditures are in line with the DSNCRP objectives, and benefit the entire
population, including the poor.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

123.    The specific policies supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have a
significant effect on the environment, forests or other natural resources. The proposed
operation focuses primarily on institutional reforms, with limited environmental implications. Anti-
corruption measures supported by the proposed operation may improve environmental enforcement
and compliance, and thus have a positive effect on the environment. It should be noted though that
the proposed measures in electricity may spur policy changes in the medium-term, which may have
positive or negative effects on environment. Any resulting effect needs to be monitored closely to
allow for identifying the potential effect and corresponding mitigation measures, if necessary.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

124. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements will rely on the government with the aim of
strengthening government capacity and institutions. As in the predecessor operations, the

                                                 41
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is the agency responsible for coordination and
implementation of the activities and reforms under the proposed operation as set out in the Letter of
Development Policy. Similarly, the MEF will be in charge of reporting progress. As in the first two
budget support operations, the review of the goals of the program will be largely based on relevant
and easy-to-monitor indicators. In parallel, collaborative monitoring has progressed among donors
with the government's support in public sector and economic governance, and all governance-
related areas including transparency and the fight against corruption. In particular, implementation
will be monitored as part of the joint donor matrix for budget support.

125. Bank staff will monitor the outcomes of the program and make possible adjustments to
the operation as it evolves. If required, latest country developments, stakeholder support, and
feasible options for realizing the intended development goals would also be taken into account. The
review will be largely based on the monitoring indicators and the goals of the program. At the same
time, the overall status of the government's program will be monitored under the review of the
joint-matrix of Haiti's partners to determine whether country conditions and the specific policy
actions of the proposed operation are met.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

126. Public Financial Management System. The Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) was carried out in 2007. It provides a baseline for the
assessment of the country's public financial management environment, identifying existing
weaknesses and at the same time acknowledging certain progress made to strengthen fiscal
discipline and improving the efficiency of the public financial management (PFM).

127. In spite of the improvement in the PFM environment achieved in the last two years,
some critical weaknesses remain. As developed in the previous chapters of this document,
progress has been made on the legal framework, the preparation and execution of the budget, and
audits. However, weaknesses remain with respect to: (i) the content of the budget documents and
the usefulness of the budget as a planning tool, mainly due to the lack of a forward looking
perspective in the budget; (ii) the need for stronger links between the budget for recurrent spending
and the investment budget a lack of dialogue between the MEF, the planning ministry, and
spending ministries; and off-budget revenues or aid inflows that finance some ministries' spending;
(iii) the need for improving accounting and fiscal reporting, particularly the inclusion of final
investment expenditures, the timely reconciliation of accounts and preparation of annual accounts;
and (iv) weaknesses in cash and treasury management, with progress yet to be made in the
rationalization of government bank accounts. The Treasury Department of the MEF, government
ministries, other government agencies, and many donor funded projects have their own accounts in
the Central Bank of Haiti, the BRH, but these are not consolidated into a single treasury account.

128. Haiti's fiduciary environment has withstood the impact of the earthquake on
institutions. In February 2010, an exception was granted by World Bank Management as provided
in Annex A to BP 10.02, Financial Management, to the actions that the Bank normally takes with
respect to the audit reports of the financial statements of eleven projects became overdue after
January 31, 2010. Since this authorization, the audit reports for three projects have been submitted
and the requirements for two have been waived on grounds of limited activity. In addition, the
audits in respect of the remaining six projects are underway, with all the reports expected by August

                                                 42
31, 2010. A review of the audit reports that have been submitted, together with a review of the
financial management arrangements for some of the projects in the portfolio, has revealed that there
are no major fiduciary issues existing in the portfolio. The Bank will be engaged in a very close
dialogue with the government to agree on necessary remedial actions that ensure integrity of public
funds if any issues are revealed by the remaining audits.

129. The latest IMF safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Haiti (BRH) was
conducted in 2008. The assessment identified a number of weaknesses, in particular in the areas of
monetary management, financial reporting, internal audit and controls. The BRH has been
implementing some of the recommendations and progress is being monitored by IMF staff. BRH's
annual financial statements are regularly audited by a private sector audit firm with an unqualified
opinion, albeit with some delays. Consultations with the IMF during the preparation of the
proposed grant have not revealed any systemic vulnerability that caused to believe that the control
environment into which the grant proceeds will flow is other than adequate. As a result, IDA will
not use additional fiduciary arrangements as per OP 8.60. However, as in any exceptional
circumstances, the IMF foresees an audit of the BRH in the coming months.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

130. The proposed grant will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy loans/credits. The untied finances will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of
the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once the grant is approved
by the Board and becomes effective, the Recipient shall open, prior to furnishing to the Association
the first request for withdrawal from the Financing Account, and thereafter maintain the following
two deposit accounts ("Deposit Accounts") on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank: (a) a
deposit account in Dollars ("Foreign Currency Deposit Account"); and (b) a deposit account in
Gourdes ("Local Currency Deposit Account"). At the request of the borrower, the proceeds of the
grant will be deposited by IDA into a US$-denominated account designated by the Borrower and
acceptable to the Bank at the Central Bank of the Republic of Haiti (Banque de la République
d'Haïti, BRH). The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the Grant into said account, an
equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the
foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds of the
grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Policy Grant Agreement, IDA
will require the Borrower to, promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to the
amount of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be
cancelled. The administration of this grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

131. The proposed operation takes place in an environment of high risk characterized by
significant macroeconomic, political and security, institutional capacity, and natural disaster
risks. These risks reflect the weak revenue mobilization capacity following the destruction of the
Tax Directorate and damages to the economy, the country's security and political situation in the
aftermath of the earthquake, the destruction of key institutions, and the country's exposure to
hurricanes, flood, and possible aftershocks. First, low domestic revenue could worsen

                                                43
macroeconomic performance, and a possible reduction of planned public investment may affect
social stability. Second, a deterioration in the security and the political situation constitutes an
important source of risk for the proposed operation. Uncertainty fueled by the difficult challenges in
organizing the presidential elections and the possible extension of the current President's time at the
presidency, gave rise to widespread discontent among population and the opposition parties.
Sustained and growing discontent and demonstrations have taken place lately. Third, the
destruction of several key governance institutions also represents a risk to the operation as it could
further weaken already fragile institutions, which in turn would affect the implementation of reform
and possibly government ownership as well as the reconstruction program. A possible reversal in
the political stabilization process, together with a weakening of ownership over the key measures
agreed with the government, could undermine the development objectives of the operation. Lastly,
Haiti is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including hurricanes, flash floods, and the potential
risk of aftershocks of severe magnitude expected by some experts. Renewed occurrence of large
scale natural disasters would derail the government's reform program and divert resources from the
longer term development agenda towards more urgent recovery and reconstruction needs.

132. Mitigating factors are: (i) for macroeconomic risk, the continued commitment of donors to
supporting the government's budget and government's efforts aimed at enhancing the efficiency of
the use of public resources to mitigate the impact of low revenues in the short term; (ii) for political
risk, the commitment of the government to enhanced transparency in public resource management
and accountability of the executives could contribute to mitigating such a risk. Together with
accelerating the delivery of key public services, it would be critical to strengthen the perception that
the government is focusing on providing relief to the population, which in turn would help
contribute to releasing political tension; (iii) for weak institutional capacity risk, the operation
focuses on sustaining the government's reforms that have started generating positive results in a
limited number of reform areas. The Bank also approved an Infrastructure and Institutions
Emergency Recovery project in March 2010 to support the restoration of the functions of key
institutions (procurement regulatory body, Ministry of Finance, Court of Accounts, Internal Audit
Body) and restructured its portfolio by reallocating its funds from existing and pipeline projects or
other sources, including trust funds, to respond to the urgent needs. In addition, the government has
demonstrated commitment through the prior actions already carried out in a difficult environment,
as well as the definition of the follow-on measures targeting critical areas of economic management
and governance as part of a medium-term vision; and (iv) for natural disaster risk, the Bank's
restructured portfolio of emergency recovery projects directly addresses this risk. However a major
natural disaster, including an earthquake of similar magnitude of that of January 2010 could cause
significant damage and derail the government's program.

President
International Development Association
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433

Mr. President,

The government of the Republic of Haiti hereby submits this request for accelerated
disbursement of budgetary aid, with a view to helping it to pursue its reform projects aimed
at strengthening its capacity to manage the public finances in a more optimal and efficient
way, while ensuring the accountability and transparency of budgetary operations.

The policies and reforms implemented over recent years have produced some positive
changes which will definitely facilitate macroeconomic management, including: a) the
reduction of US$1.2 billion in outstanding debt, reaching the HIPC point in July 2009 which
will make it possible to free up budget funds for investment purposes for the 2010 ten-year
period, with over US$50 million being initially allocated to debt service; b) a more stable
macroeconomic context characterized by the progressive reconstitution of international
reserves to a level of 3.1 months of imports as of September 2009, and greater control of
inflation; c) an improvement in the business climate which favored a resumption of private
investment and annual average growth of 2.2 percent over the last five years compared with
the decline of 0.7 percent over the first half of the preceding ten-year period; d) a
strengthening of the financial sector by tightening of the prudential rules and requiring an
acceptable level of liquidity even if the persistence of high liquidity levels in the system
renders an adjustment of the credit policy necessary; and e) some noteworthy improvements
in budgetary management, even if some advances are still necessary, particularly in favor of
results-based management.

Significant progress had been made in governance before the earthquake in budget
preparation, monitoring of budget execution and controls, and procurement regulation. The
main achievements are highlighted below.

The legal framework for budget preparation was adopted, which allowed for submitting the
budget to Parliament in a timely manner. Budget preparation has been strengthened with a
consultation process involving the Ministry of Finance and Planning as well as line
ministries. The civil society has been involved in the design of the budget. The government
budget is now widely disseminated on website and the official journal.

The control system has been strengthened with the creation of the internal audit body (IGF).
Public accountants had been deployed in all line ministries and the use of the comptes


                                            54
                                                
 

courants went from approximately 60 percent of total expenditures in 2003-04 down to an
estimated 3 percent for FY 2009-10. A financial management system was implemented
throughout the central administration, which integrates the budget, treasury and accounting
functions (SYSDEP), and monitoring of investment has been launched with another
monitoring system (SYSGEP). Reporting had been strengthened with through actions to
reduce the backlog and delay in submitting the Court of Accounts' legal opinion on the
Budget Review Law to Parliament.

With respect to revenue, tax revenue increased to 11.2% in FY09 compared to an average of
10% over the past years. Significant progress was made in tax and customs administration,
which helped sustain tax revenue performance over the recent past. The government had
implemented a comprehensive package of reforms including, the adoption by Parliament of a
new Customs Code. A new computerized information system (ASYCUDA World) under
UNCTAD assistance was installed in the main customs offices. The pre inspection
company's mandate has been extended ensure effective customs revenue collection.

In procurement, the creation of a procurement regulatory body (CNMP) helped regulate
procurement practices and brought about a significant reduction of the percentage of
noncompetitive procurement (defined as contracts awarded "sole source" or after "restricted
bidding"). According to the latest statistics available, the use of such noncompetitive
procurement methods (gré-à-gré and appel d'offres restreint) declined from an estimated 85
percent of contract awards in 2004 to 56 percent in 2008. Before the earthquake a
Procurement Law was adopted with four implementing decrees.

The creation of an anti-corruption unit (ULCC) has helped raise awareness among civil
servants and the population about the consequences of corruption and the way forward in
combating corruption. Subsequent to the adoption of the Law on Declaration of Assets,
several categories of targeted groups have submitted their declarations, and a monitoring
report has been submitted to the Senate and the ULCC.

Because it directly impacted Port-au-Prince and the entire metropolitan area where the most
important economic infrastructure facilities are located and a third of the country's
population resides, the earthquake of January 12, 2010, very severely disrupted the economy
and the public finances system. The country's productive capacities have been devastated.
The vulnerability of the population and of the state institutions has been increased by a
pronounced recapitalization of households and of the State which has eroded the latter's
ability to provide essential basic services for the people. The loss of a considerable quantity
of physical capital (infrastructure, housing, equipment and materials) and also of human
resources has put the country in an initially unfavorable position for moving into a sustained
dynamic of growth and poverty reduction.

The position of the public finances, which was posting distinct improvement before the
earthquake, is now displaying a definite but fortunately temporary downward trend. Revenue,
which was running at a monthly average of 3 billion gourdes during the first quarter (against
2.4 billion gourdes a year earlier) slumped abruptly to 700 million gourdes in January 2010,
then 1.6 billion gourdes in February, prior to progressively moving back up to 2.8 billion

                                              55
                                                
 

gourdes in May. The target for the 2009-2010 fiscal year has now been scaled back to 26.3
billion gourdes against the 34.9 billion initially set, hence a performance of just 75 percent.
Although the majority of the regional offices contributing to the State's resources were not
affected by the earthquake, the revenues collected in the provinces have remained pitifully
low and the bulk of all revenue is currently being generated in the metropolitan area, which
also includes the country's main port and airport.

Regarding the implementation of expenditure, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)
is presently operating out of two provisional locations and with a reduced number of
personnel. The main servers holding the data were saved and are once again operational. The
expenditure forecasts for the fiscal year point to a slight reduction in current expenditure (-
0.5 percent compared with the previous year), while wages and salaries were swiftly restored
and are being paid on schedule. Locally financed capital expenditures, which have been
diverted in part to cover emergency needs, are expected to increase by 26.4 percent.

Policy emphases of the government

The Haitian government presented the policy framework for reconstruction to the Donor
Conference held in New York on March 31, 2010, broken down into an Action Plan for the
recovery and development of Haiti and organized around four main thrusts:

    1. Territorial recasting, involving the identification, planning and management of new
       development areas, stimulation of local development, reconstruction of impacted
       areas, establishment of the economic infrastructure necessary for growth (roads,
       energy and communications), and real estate management that ensures protection of
       property ownership while facilitating the progress of major projects.

    2. Economic recasting, which with the development of the key sectors, must seek the
       modernization of the agriculture sector in its components offering an exportable
       potential, development of a professional construction sector governed by anti-
       earthquake and anti-hurricane laws and regulations and including application and
       supervision agencies, and pursuit of manufacturing industry and organization of
       tourism development.

    3. Social recasting, assigning priority in the first place to an education system that
       guarantees access to schooling for all children, offering vocational and university
       education aligned on the modernization requirements of our economy, a health
       system assuring full coverage nationwide, and social protection for the employed and
       the most vulnerable.

    4. Institutional recasting, which will immediately tackle the task of getting the state
       institutions up and running again and giving priority to the most essential functions,
       the redefining of our legal and regulatory framework to make it better suited to our
       needs, the setting up of the agency that will be tasked with managing the
       reconstruction, and establishment of a culture of transparency and accountability
       which renders corruption out of the question nationwide.

                                              56
                                                
 

The aim will be to develop a dynamic focus on catching up and improving the standard of
living and the quality of life, together with rapid growth and a pursuit of competitiveness that
will guarantee the possibility of Haiti being classified as an emerging country by 2030.

The program for which the budgetary aid is requested

In general terms and in connection with the other partners which include the IMF, the
program will strengthen the stability of the macroeconomic framework.

The macroeconomic framework

Recovery is the priority, and growth must be vigorous over the coming years to permit
improvement of living conditions. As a result of the damage and losses suffered and the
marked slowdown in economic activity caused by the earthquake, a drop of 8.5 percent is
expected in GDP, notwithstanding the emergency and rehabilitation measures scheduled to
extend over 18 months after the quake. Our macroeconomic projections for the period up to
2013 point to annual average growth of 3.5 percent GDP per capita in real terms. This
implies a rapid recovery which would conceivably bring the rate of GDP growth up to 9.8
percent in 2010-2011, a rate which would gradually slow until it stabilizes on a trend slightly
above 6 percent p.a. between now and 2015.

Our growth strategy is designed to favor greater diversification of the sources of growth by
taking maximum advantage of our potentials, which will spur intensified integration of the
sectors and, following on from a significant increase in the number of job openings and
opportunities, will serve to slow emigration and allow more equitable distribution of the
fruits of growth.

We also intend to consolidate the progress made in regard to macroeconomic stability by
pursuing the structural reforms that will be implemented in the context of a new, three-year
program agreed on with the IMF and supported by an Extended Credit Facility that will be
submitted for approval by the Executive Board this coming September. In addition, a reduced
joint matrix of performance measurements in management of public finances was approved
during the last review of the partnership arrangements relating to budgetary aid with the
donors providing the aid.

A major challenge will be securing the resources essential for carrying out the investments in
infrastructure in particular, including reconstruction, and providing the necessary basic social
and economic services. In this connection, the fiscal policy envisages a progressive
increasing of the tax burden to 12.2 percent between now and 2012. The budget deficit
excluding grants and external financings will be contained at 4.4 percent in 2009-2010 and
will then gradually decline to 3.0 percent in 2012-2013. We hope to be able to cover these
deficits by external budgetary aid in order to avoid resorting to monetary financing, which
could be a source of inflation. This stance will be maintained over the rest of the period while
the reforms designed to strengthen capacity and internal financing mechanisms, such as the
financial autonomy of the State, are implemented.



                                              57
                                                 
 

The monetary policy will endeavor to hold inflation below the 10 percent per year level
while assuming that the priority is recovery of the economy. Control of inflation will have to
contribute to our goal of price competitiveness by reducing our unfavorable inflation
differential with our partners and competitors.

Regarding the program itself, four specific components will receive special attention.

Budgetary transparency in the electricity sector

The objectives of the government are to expand electricity coverage, to improve the
management of the utility company (EDH), and to improve the transparency in the
management of transfers to the electricity sector, which amounts to approximately US$100
million a year.

The government has undertaken two major reforms in the electricity sector aimed at
improving the sector's financial position and strengthening its institutional capacities. Budget
transfers were reduced in 2009, and a new rate structure was devised for EDH and adopted in
August 2009. The earthquake had some very negative repercussions on EDH, with the
appreciable thinning of its clients in Port-au-Prince and the heightened difficulties in
collecting invoices. Thus, in March 2010, receipts were of the order of 30 percent of the pre-
quake projections. The quake also delayed introduction of the two billing and system-
maintenance systems designed to improve EDH's management efficiency.

Management of the transfers to the electricity sector has suffered up until now from the
absence of strict application of the institutional rules supposed to govern it, in particular
regarding payment of independent producers' invoices. This has led to an irregular payment
situation involving use of a BRH guarantee letter for independent producers, and at times the
absence of agreement between the parties on the payments made. As a result, clarity was
lacking regarding the amounts paid to the independent producers and the subsidies to EDH,
which were only partially published notwithstanding the government's transparency
objectives.

After the earthquake, a substantial increase in transfers was likely in order to meet the need
to maintain and increase electricity service coverage. The government accordingly enhanced
transparency in the management of transfers for covering EDH's needs for fuel oil and
payments to independent electricity producers. To achieve this, the government strengthened
the monitoring and validity of the transfer arrangements in favor of the sector by the legal
clarification mechanisms in effect governing payment of invoices submitted by independent
producers to all entities concerned so as to ensure strict application of all pertinent rules. The
government also ensured that these data are published on the MEF, MTPTC [Ministry of
Public Works, Transportation and Communications] and EDH websites and updated
monthly. Independent audits will be organized to verify the veracity and conformity of the
transfers made, in connection with the auditing of the invoices submitted and paid.

Combating corruption

The 2005 study on governance and corruption revealed that a very large majority of the
leading members of civil society considered corruption to be a major problem in the public
sector. Combating corruption is one of the government's primary objectives. This objective
is all the more valid in the context of the reconstruction efforts that can be expected to
involve the injection of considerable resources into Haiti.

Some critical milestones have been passed in recent years in the process of equipping Haiti
with instruments for combating corruption.

Haiti has ratified the principal international conventions on the subject and established in
2004 an Anti-Corruption Unit [Unité de Lutte Contre la Corruption ULCC], while adopting a
strategy for the purpose in 2009, that was confirmed after the earthquake by a formal
declaration in favor of good governance. A law on asset declaration by political officials,
civil servants and other public agents was passed in 2008 and is the subject of monitoring by
the ULCC. This law has only been partially implemented for the moment, and the
government undertook to strengthen this process by means of the sending by the ULCC to
the supervisory authorities, including the Ministry of Finance, the Court of Accounts and the
Senate, of a report setting out the status of asset declaration by the different agents
concerned. This stage will initiate a set of actions designed to either increase the rate of
declarations or else to apply the provisions of the law to those balking at complying. The
government will strengthen the tools for implementing said law by adoption of a decree on
the code of ethics for the public sector, with special emphasis on the reconstruction efforts
and the extensive public procurement that will be involved.

The budgetary controls

The administrative control, whether performed a priori or a posteriori, is the responsibility
of the General Finance Inspectorate [Inspection Générale des Finances IGF]. The
jurisdictional control, external and independent, is performed by the Court of Accounts [Cour
Supérieure des Comptes et du Contentieux Administratif CSC/CA], while the legislative
control is done by Parliament.

In practice, the control agencies remain relatively weak, in terms of human resources and
verification tools, and the earthquake of January 12 did not help to strengthen them. As it
happens, the auditing of the government accounts by the CSC/CA has fallen considerably
behind and the audit of those for 2007-2008 is only now being wrapped up, a circumstance
which diminishes the relevance of such exercises. While the CSC/CA was in the process of
making progress with these audits so that the findings could be communicated to the entities
concerned to permit prompt correction of weaknesses found, after the damage caused by the
quake the CSC/CA's audit work could be further delayed. There was also no coordination
between the CSC/CA and the IGF, although the IGF is responsible for applying the
CSC/CA's recommendations in the budget implementation process. The government
accordingly brought this entity into operation around the third calendar quarter of 2009,
while the activities contained in its action plan adopted in the same period were to be started

                                              59
                                                 
 

right away. This plan will now have to be revised, in light of the quake and of the
reconstruction work and related activities now to be done.

In order to pursue the reforms designed to strengthen the effectiveness of the role expected of
the budgetary controls, and to improve the integrity of the management of public
expenditure, the government has: (i) finalized the audits of the government accounts for
2007-2008. To move the catching-up process forward, the Treasury has submitted the
government accounts for 2008-2009 to the Court of Accounts; and (ii) adopted a new action
plan for the IGF together with an operating manual for the inspectors.

Subsequently and in the course of 2010-2011, the government's program will consist in
strengthening its own budget preparation and implementation procedures, in deploying the
corps of inspectors to the spending ministries and in taking all steps required for the CSC/CA
to be fully capable of performing its assigned functions with regard to auditing and certifying
the public accounts within the time limits set by law.

Procurement

The objective of the government is to fully implement the Procurement Law, which requires
strengthening the procurement regulatory body. The past practices in regard to procurement
were weak and the most often resulted in the awarding of private contracts lacking in
transparency and showing little concern for the efficaciousness of public expenditure. The
efforts made in the recent past have made it possible to gradually reverse this trend, in
particular as a result of the establishment of the National Public Procurement Commission
[Commission Nationale des Marchés Publics CNMP], whose role consisted in controlling the
procurement procedures and applying the standard procedures in effect. This made possible a
significant reduction in the number of contracts awarded without competition. Then there
was also the adoption of a Public Procurement Law in August 2009 and the main
implementing decrees, with a view to introducing tighter control of public procurement.

The post-earthquake situation has led the government to adopt an Emergency Law
authorizing governmental entities to use the fast-track procedures provided for by the
Procurement Law, but without suspending the strict rules governing procurement. The
government undertook to publish a note clarifying these points and explaining in detail the
procedures to be followed under the Emergency Law. The government commenced the
hiring procedures for members of the CNMP whose mandate expires in September 2010 in
order to prevent any interruption, even temporary, of the activity of this institution of crucial
importance in these times when reconstruction is the order of the day and taking into account
the Emergency Law. Finally, the CNMP got its website up and running and to publish the
contracts awarded.

In addition, the authorities will intensify their efforts to make the Procurement Law fully
operational, which will involve strengthening of the CNMP's resources, and especially its
human resources, supporting the procurement committees in the major spending ministries,
performing the audit of the contracts awarded since the entry into force of the present law,



                                               60
                                               
 

and promoting the adoption of procurement plans by public entities, subject to CNMP
approval, prior to any expenditure commitment.

These activities will require technical assistance from the World Bank, particularly through
EGTAG II and the emergency project supported by the group institutions.

STRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING OF THE PROGRAM

For ensuring implementation and monitoring of the program, the government has established
with the Ministry of Economy and Finance an entity for the strategic monitoring of the
reforms and policies, including coordination of the contributions of the different financial
and technical institutions that support our efforts in this field.

I reiterate our commitment to working with your institution, in particular in the
implementation of our policy of strengthening good governance, transparency and
accountability.

Very truly yours,

                  ANNEX 3: FUND RELATIONS NOTE (JUNE 21, 2010)

This letter provides an assessment by IMF Staff of policies in Haiti, in the wake of the
January 12, 2010, earthquake. The reconstruction outlook remains subject to some
uncertainty, in part due to delays in donors' disbursements.

In recent years, Haiti made steady progress toward macroeconomic stability. Under
continuous IMF-supported programs since 2004, economic growth was positive, rising to
close to 3 percent in 2009. Inflation declined from about 40 percent in 2003 to virtually zero
at end-2009, and reserves increased. Prudent policies and structural reforms resulted in the
delivery of US$1.2 billion in HIPC/MDRI debt relief to Haiti in June 2009. On January 27,
2010, the Executive Board of the Fund approved the sixth and last review under the ECF
arrangement, together with an emergency augmentation of access equivalent to 80 percent of
quota. The ECF was also extended until end-May 2010.

Given the considerable damage caused by the earthquake, the main challenge is to rebuild
the country. Damages to economic and government infrastructure are estimated at 120
percent of 2009 GDP. The humanitarian situation remains dire, with 1.3 million people in
temporary shelters. At a conference in New-York, donors announced total pledges of US$9.9
billion for Haiti's reconstruction, including US$5.3 billion for the next two years. A key
challenge for donors and the authorities will be to ensure the rapid delivery and productive
absorption of these inflows.

In late May 2010, staff and the authorities agreed ad referendum on a new three-year
ECF-supported program. The new program aims at supporting the authorities'
reconstruction and growth plan, while maintaining macroeconomic stability in the context of
large expected aid inflows. The authorities' economic strategy focuses on: (i) raising revenue
collection, and increasing the efficiency and transparency of spending; (ii) enhancing
monetary operations through improved liquidity management and inflation forecasting, and
the introduction of Treasury bills; (iii) restarting credit while maintaining financial sector
stability through a partial credit guarantee scheme; and (iv) attracting investment and
expanding the export base, by improving infrastructure and the business environment.

The macroeconomic outlook for FY 2010­13 will depend heavily on the path of aid
disbursements. Reconstruction-related aid inflows are expected to peak over the next 2­3
years. After a sharp drop this fiscal year, economic growth is expected to rebound to
9 percent on average over the next two fiscal years. In FY 2010, the adverse impact of the
earthquake is being mitigated by a recovery in agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.
Twelve-month inflation would reach 8.5 percent by the end of this fiscal year. In the fiscal
area, the authorities are reducing expenditure from budgeted levels in order to adjust to the
decline in tax revenue caused by the earthquake. The overall deficit after grants is projected
to widen to close to 7 percent of GDP this year and narrow to 5.7 percent in FY 2011.

Haiti's debt outlook is expected to improve, reflecting the debt relief that is being provided
by multilateral and bilateral donors. Haiti was at high risk of debt distress before the

earthquake, which further worsened the debt outlook. Debt relief committed by multilateral
donors and Venezuela is estimated at 14 percent of 2009 GDP (the World Bank effectively
cancelled US$38.8 million of Haiti's debt in May). In the coming weeks, the IMF Executive
Board will further consider a framework that would allow delivery of debt relief to Haiti on
its outstanding obligations to the IMF. Board discussions of a new 3-year ECF and the 2010
Article IV consultation could take place shortly thereafter.

                          ANNEX 4: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

                               HAITI--DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

The updated DSA was prepared jointly by the Fund and Bank staffs in accordance with the
revised Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income countries
(LICs). Under the a baseline scenario that does not include any debt relief provided or
committed by official creditors following the January 2010 catastrophic earthquake, the
updated DSA shows that Haiti's risk of debt distress remains high due to the deterioration of
the macroeconomic outlook and new borrowing. Although HIPC and MDRI relief have
substantially reduced Haiti's debt burden since June 2009, the updated DSA findings
indicate that the net present value (NPV) of the debt-to-exports ratio would breach the
relevant policy-dependent threshold in the baseline scenario for the medium-term.23 Haiti's
weaker near-term macroeconomic outlook following the January 2010 earthquake, a narrow
export base, together with new and projected borrowing, are key factors in the risk of debt
distress.24 An alternative scenario shows that delivery of announced debt relief by
multilateral and bilateral creditors would improve the debt sustainability outlook. That
scenario also stresses the need for new borrowing to remain limited and on highly
concessional terms. Staff will continue to closely monitor the evolution of external debt and
the government's ability to secure highly concessional financing and mobilize domestic
resources.

I. BACKGROUND

4.1.     Haiti reached the completion point in June 2009 and received US$1.2 billion in
debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI. Debt service savings amounted to
US$265 million under the HIPC Initiative and US$972.7 million under MDRI. The debt
stock in NPV terms was reduced from US$1,320 million at end-September 2008 to
US$641 million at end-September 2009.25 While most relief has been provided, conclusion of
bilateral agreements with some Paris Club creditors is still pending. 26 As a result of the debt
relief initiatives, Haiti's nominal external public and publicly guaranteed debt stock reached
US$1.24 billion at end-September 2009 (about 19 percent of GDP), down from US$1.88
billion at end-September 2008 (Text Table 1). Assuming full delivery of Paris Club debt
relief, debt stock at end-September 2009 would stand at US$1.06 billion (16.6 percent of
GDP).


23
   Haiti is classified as a weak performer based on its three-year average score of 2.86 on the World Bank's
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). For a weak performer (defined as those with three-year
average CPIA ratings below 3.25), the indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are PV of debt-to-
GDP ratio of 30 percent, PV of debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent, PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent,
debt service-to-exports ratio of 15 percent, and debt service-to-revenue ratio of 25 percent. Haiti is currently
classified as in high risk of debt distress.

4.2.   Haiti's public debt as of end-September 2009 was estimated at about
24.8 percent of GDP. Most of the public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt is owed to
external creditors (about 67 percent), and the rest is domestic debt (equivalent to about 8.2
percent of GDP). The domestic debt corresponds to credit to the government from the central
bank (BRH).

4.3.   The level of external PPG debt at end-September 2009 rose by more than
previously projected at the time of the Completion Point in June 2009.27 In nominal
terms, Haiti's debt was expected to reach 13.2 percent of GDP in 2009 under the Completion
Point DSA--3 ½ percentage points lower than actual debt stock. The larger-than-expected
increase reflects higher bilateral debt between 2008 and 2009 due to new borrowing (on
concessional terms) from Venezuela under the PetroCaribe agreement, on which no relief

27
   The Completion Point DSA prepared in June 2009 is deemed a more reliable comparator in terms of
macroeconomic assumptions (EBS/09/91), given that the January DSA Update was based on very uncertain
data immediately following the earthquake (EBS/10/14, Supplement 1). The January 2010 DSA Update also
found Haiti's risk of debt distress to have increased markedly, reflecting both a worsened near-term outlook and
new higher borrowing. The updated DSA also reflects a lower discount rate, which increases the PV of debt.
                                                     70 
 

was provided under the HIPC initiative. 28 Haiti's external debt rose to US$1.48 billion at
end-March 2010, reflecting the IMF emergency augmentation of January 2010, new IDB
borrowing, and further PetroCaribe financing.

4.4.    Haiti's debt situation is being reassessed in light of the catastrophic damage to
the economy. Damages and losses from the earthquake are estimated at more than
120 percent of 2009 GDP. A multi-year reconstruction and growth strategy has been
developed by the Haitian authorities in conjunction with the international community, for
which a total of US$9.9 billion have been pledged at the New York Donors' Conference in
March 2010. Several creditors have announced their intentions to provide debt relief on
Haiti's outstanding debt stocks, as part of a broader initiative to alleviate debt service
constraints. These include:

        The World Bank provided debt relief on Haiti's outstanding debt of SDR 24.3
        million (about US$36 million as of May 21, 2010). Debt relief became effective in
        May 2010 when the 14 donors to the Debt Relief Trust Fund agreed to allocate the
        resources needed to cover the debt cancellation.

        The IDB would provide US$479 million to cancel Haiti's outstanding debt as of end-
        December 2009 and convert the undisbursed loans in the existing project portfolio
        into grants. Debt relief, which was approved in March 2010 by the Board of
        Governors, will become effective in the near future, as soon as the committed donor
        financing is available.

        IFAD announced in April that it would cancel about US$50.7 million in outstanding
        debt (in NPV terms) to be delivered in the form of grants against debt service due, on
        a pay-as-you-go basis.

        Venezuela officially confirmed it would provide debt relief on Haiti's outstanding
        debt as of January 25, 2010 in the amount of US$395 million. Modalities for debt
        relief have yet to be clarified.29

        Taiwan, Province of China, has offered to pay about US$12 million in interest and
        to provide a five-year moratorium on principal payments on Haiti's outstanding debt.

4.5.   In June 2010, the Fund Board approved the establishment of the Post-
Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR) Trust. The PCDR is a dedicated instrument to assist
countries affected by catastrophic natural disasters like Haiti. Such a mechanism would

28
   In the Completion Point DSA, resources accumulated under the PetroCaribe agreement (US$104 million)
were treated as private debt on the understanding that the binational company (Societe Mixte) would be set up
in early 2009, in which case financing from PetroCaribe flows would become the debt of the binational
company and not of the government. The binational company is yet to be established, and total PetroCaribe
flows, including new flows accumulated as of end-FY2009, in the amount of US$295 are now considered part
of government debt.
29
   The DSA scenario with debt relief assumes cancellation of US$295 million outstanding as of end-September
2009, plus US$100 million in subsequent (future) flows in 2010.
                                                     71 
 

enable the Fund to provide debt relief to Haiti and would also be available to other very poor
countries that are hit by similar shocks in the future. Debt relief from the Fund would
complement a concerted international effort to cancel Haiti's remaining debt. Official
creditors accounting for about 92 percent of Haiti's outstanding debt as of end-March 2010
(excluding the Fund) have already delivered or are firmly committed to providing debt relief
on outstanding debt stocks (Text Table 1). If Haiti's eligibility for assistance under the PCDR
is approved, debt stock relief could be provided on Haiti's outstanding obligations to the
Fund in the amount of SDR 178.18 million.

4.6.    The current DSA framework includes new borrowing accumulated since the
Completion Point in June 2009, as well as projected new borrowing through FY 2015.
In particular, accumulated concessional trade financing from Venezuela under the
PetroCaribe agreement of US$295 million is now included. The treatment of this portion of
debt follows the same approach as in the January 2010 DSA Update. 30 The framework also
incorporates the new airport loan (US$33 million) contracted in December 2009 with the
Development Bank of Venezuela (BANDES). 31 In terms of new flows, the framework
includes projected ECF disbursements through FY 2013, together with accumulated
PetroCaribe flows of US$160 in FY 2010 and projected future PetroCaribe borrowing in the
range of US$230-250 million a year through FY 2015.

II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY OUTLOOK, 2010-2030
Baseline Scenario

4.7.   The baseline macroeconomic framework for the long-term debt sustainability
analysis has been revised to take into account recent developments as well as the
macroeconomic impact of the 2010 earthquake. Key macroeconomic assumptions are
summarized in Box 1 and Text Table 2. Long-term assumptions are somewhat more
optimistic compared to those used in the Completion Point DSA. Specifically, long-run
growth is now assumed to be slightly higher, reflecting the massive reconstruction effort
projected to take place over the medium-term. This is also projected to raise government
revenues (excluding grants). Exports of goods and services would grow by 10-12 percent a
year, but decline in percent of GDP until FY 2013. They would subsequently recover
gradually to their pre-earthquake levels and rise to more than 17 percent of GDP by 2030.
Imports would surge by more than 60 percent in FY 2011, in line with the reconstruction
plan. Imports are expected to remain somewhat elevated in the medium-term and revert to
about 35 percent of GDP in 2030.

4.8.   Given a weaker near-term macroeconomic outlook compared to the Completion Point
DSA and higher borrowing, Haiti remains at high risk of debt distress after the earthquake
(Figure 1). Haiti's present value (PV) of external debt relative to exports breaches the

30
   In the January 2010 DSA Update, resources accumulated under the PetroCaribe agreement were considered
part of government debt.
31
   The terms of the airport loan from BANDES did not meet the minimum concessionality criteria required
under the ECF arrangement and therefore a waiver on the performance criterion on contracting of external non-
concessional debt was requested at the time of the Sixth Review under the ECF (EBS/10/14).
                                                      72 
 

indicative threshold until 2022, reaching a peak of 187 percent in 2013 before declining
gradually to less than 100 percent in 2022. Despite higher average GDP growth between FY
2011 and FY 2013 compared to the Completion Point, exports (in percent of GDP) are
projected to be lower and imports and government expenditure much higher. The PV of the
debt-to-revenue ratio is slightly below the relevant policy threshold in 2010 (at 23.5 percent)
but declines steadily over the projection period.

4.9.     Higher borrowing in 2009, and projected continued borrowing under the
PetroCaribe arrangement through 2015, raises risks to debt sustainability substantially.
Haiti's debt sustainability outlook has worsened since reaching the HIPC Completion Point
in June 2009, mainly due to new bilateral borrowing. Based on the January 2010 DSA
Update, accumulated PetroCaribe debt of US$295 million alone raised the PV of external
debt by more than 45 percentage points of exports in FY 2010. Although the terms of
PetroCaribe financing are highly concessional, the continued accumulation of PetroCaribe
borrowing, which is expected to increase by about
US$230-250 million a year based on current
projections of oil imports, poses a risk to medium-
term debt servicing capacity.32 However, the
terms of future PetroCaribe borrowing have yet to
be clarified. The possibility of creating a private
binational corporation that would use accumulated
inflows to finance energy and social projects is
still on the table. If and when that happens, future
PetroCaribe flows would become private
liabilities and no longer add to public debt. On the
other hand, at the June 2nd Punta Cana summit in the Dominican Republic, Venezuela
indicated that a large share of future PetroCaribe inflows over the coming years could be
converted into grants.

4.10. Based on the sensitivity analysis, Haiti's debt situation remains vulnerable to a
combination of shocks, but in particular to less favorable export performance. With the
exception of the debt service-to-revenues ratio, the alternative and shock scenarios worsen all
of Haiti's debt stock and service indicators. Importantly, the ratios would exceed the relevant
thresholds in the case of the NPV of debt-to-exports, debt-to-revenue, as well as debt-to-GDP
ratios. In the particular case of the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio, Haiti is most vulnerable to
a combined shock to growth, exports, and non-debt creating flows. Together, these shocks
could push the PV of debt-to-exports ratios up to 400 percent in FY 2012 before declining,
although it would remain above the threshold for the projection period.




32
  Under the PetroCaribe arrangement, financing of oil imports is provided on concessional terms, namely, two-
year grace period, 25-year maturity and 1 percent interest. The size of the portion financed is determined based
on prevailing oil prices and varies between 30 percent of total shipments for oil prices US$40-50 per barrel to
70 percent for oil prices US$150 and above.
                                                 73 
 

4.11. The prolonged nature of the breach in the baseline scenario precludes a
modification of Haiti's risk of debt distress rating using the remittance-based
framework. The revised debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income countries
approved in August 2009 allows for the effect of remittances in the determination of a
country's risk of debt distress. Under the new guidelines, however, taking into consideration
remittances can change the risk of debt distress only if breaches to the thresholds under the
baseline or stress tests (i.e. before taking into account remittances) are not very protracted. A
benchmark for the maximum permissible length of the breach of the thresholds could be 10
years starting from the current year (i.e. about half of the projection period) (SM/10/16). In
the case of Haiti, the debt-to-exports ratio is breached until 2022 in the baseline scenario, and
all indicators except for the debt service-to-revenues ratio sustain a protracted breach under
the stress tests.

Debt Relief Scenario

4.12. Delivery of announced debt relief would significantly improve long run debt
sustainability (Figure 2). The debt relief scenario assumes delivery of relief on debt stocks
as of end-September 2009 as outlined in paragraph 5 by the World Bank, IDB, IFAD, and
PetroCaribe. The scenario also assumes debt relief on outstanding credit to the Fund as of
end-January 2010 (i.e. SDR 178.13 million).33 This would translate into a debt stock relief of
about US$965 million in nominal terms as of end-2009. The debt relief scenario maintains
the assumption in the baseline regarding the projected accumulation of PetroCaribe
borrowing outlined in paragraph 6. Based on these assumptions, all debt indicators remain
below the policy relevant threshold in the baseline scenario, with the exception of the debt-
to-exports indicator which temporarily breaches the policy relevant threshold between 2014
and 2018.

4.13. Debt dynamics would however remain sensitive to external shocks. Breaches
would persist under the most extreme shock scenario (the combination shock) for the three
stock indicators: (a) PV of debt-to-GDP; (b) PV of debt-to-exports; and (c) PV of debt-to-
revenue. The breach is particularly protracted for the debt-to-exports indicator (peaking to
297 percent in 2012 and remaining above 100 percent until 2027). This highlights Haiti's
continued external debt vulnerability, in part stemming from its very narrow export base.

III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

4.14. In the baseline scenario, public debt indicators remain somewhat unchanged
over the projection period (Figure 3). The PV of public debt-to-GDP remains at about
30 percent throughout the projection period. This stability reflects a decrease in the level of
external debt that is offset by an increase in domestic borrowing, which increases from
8 percent of GDP in FY 2010 to 20 percent of GDP by 2030. The PV of the debt-to-revenue
ratio rises gradually to about 160 percent by 2016 and maintains that level over the projection
period.


33
   This includes SDR 105 million outstanding as of end-September 2009 in addition to SDR 73.13 million
disbursed in January 2010.
                                               74 
 

4.15. Shock scenarios put public debt on a sharper rising trajectory over the
projection period. Public debt indicators are particularly sensitive to growth shocks and to
debt-creating flows. Moreover, a combination of a growth shock and lower primary balance
would significantly raise the PV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios well above the
baseline scenario.

IV. DEBT MANAGEMENT
4.16. The earthquake is thought to have severely disrupted existing debt management
systems. The Ministry of Finance building has been damaged. Based on an assessment of the
damages, further technical and financial support will be needed to recover data, set up a
working computer system, and rehabilitate physical infrastructure.

4.17. The earthquake is a major setback, given recent steady progress. Debt
management capacity had improved in Haiti since the decision point was reached in
December 2006. In the area of debt recording, the BRH and the MEF had completed the
installation of the most recent version of UNCTAD DMFAS system, version 5.3, which
allows for improvements in the availability, quality and security of debt data. In part resulting
from the upgrade to the latest DMFAS system, debt reporting by the government had also
improved.

4.18. Prior to the earthquake, satisfactory progress had also been made in establishing
the debt unit at the Ministry of Finance, although the finalization of the draft operations
manual, and the legal and institutional framework for debt management did depend on the
results of ongoing technical assistance by UNCTAD and CEMLA.

V. CONCLUSIONS

4.19. Haiti's risk of external debt distress remains high even after HIPC and MDRI
debt relief. The PV of debt-to-exports ratio breaches the 100 percent threshold for a
prolonged period, even though other debt indicators remain below their relevant thresholds.
The analysis, however, shows that implementation of debt relief commitments would
significantly improve the debt sustainability outlook and contribute to the reconstruction
effort, provided donors meet Haiti's large and immediate financing needs through grants and
highly concessional loans.

    Box 1: Macroeconomic Assumptions
    Growth and inflation. After contracting by 8.5 percent in FY 2010 following the devastation of the
    earthquake, growth is expected to rebound to almost 10 percent in FY 2011, averaging about
    7.5 percent a year between FY2011 and FY2015 on the back of significant reconstruction related aid
    inflows, before reverting to its long-run trend. Long-run growth is projected to be slightly higher than
    the rate assumed in the Completion Point (CP) DSA (5 percent against 4.5 percent), assuming effective
    utilization of the surge in aid-inflows and reforms to expand to absorptive capacity of the economy.
    Inflation is projected to increase to about 8 percent in FY 2011 and FY 2012 on account of increased
    domestic demand and short-run supply side bottlenecks associated with large reconstruction aid
    inflows. Inflation is expected to revert to about 6.5 percent starting FY 2014.
    Fiscal policy. Revenue, which reached 11 percent of GDP in FY 2009, is projected at about 10 percent
    of GDP due to severe losses in government administrative and physical capacities. Government
    revenues are expected to recover gradually, in line with the rebound in economic activity, and to
    increase to 14 percent of GDP in 2015. Primary spending is projected to peak to about 32 percent of
    GDP in 2011 and 2012 in line with the surge in reconstruction-based aid inflows before falling to about
    22 percent of GDP in the long run. The fiscal deficit is expected to peak at 5 percent of GDP in 2012,
    and to average 3.4 percent of GDP from 2016 onwards.
    Grants and financing. Grants are assumed to peak to about US$1.5 billion per year in FY 2011­12 as
    reconstruction and economic activity rebound and average about US$1.1 billion per year through FY
    2015. It is assumed that Haiti would remain eligible for concessional assistance from IDA and IDB
    which would cover most of Haiti's external borrowing needs from 2018 onwards. The assumed grant
    element of new external borrowing is 35 percent. Following the introduction of a Treasury-bill market
    during 2011, domestic financing will remain capped to maintain medium-term public debt
    sustainability.
    Current account. After contracting by 20 percent in FY 2010 due to damage in textile production
    capacity and to distribution infrastructure, exports of goods and services are projected to rebound and
    grow by an average of 12 percent in FY 2011­15 and reach their pre-earthquake value by 2016. Exports
    are assumed to increase to about 18 percent of GDP by 2030, slightly higher than CP assumption.
    Imports of goods and services, on the other hand, are projected to surge to about 52 percent of GDP in
    FY 2011­12 reflecting reconstruction related imports, and to revert to about 37 percent of GDP by
    2030. The current account deficit excluding grants in percent of GDP is projected to widen significantly
    in FY 2010 and FY 2011 to about 29 percent and 24 percent, respectively, before declining to about
    13 percent by FY 2015. The current account deficit is expected to be covered largely by grants and is
    projected to average 3.5 percent of GDP in FY 2013­15 and 4.4 percent through 2030.

    1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
    2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
    3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
    an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
    4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
    5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
    6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

    1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
    2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
    3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
    an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
    4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
    5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
    6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

       ANNEX 5: GOVERNANCE PROGRAM OF THE GOVERNMENT OF HAITI

Introduction
5.1.    The January 12, 2010 earthquake in no way shook the determination of the Haitian
government to continue its quest to build a State that aspires to and demonstrates the highest degree
of transparency and accountability in managing the funds entrusted to it by taxpayers and its
international financial partners.

5.2.    This note is aimed at reaffirming the commitment of the Haitian government to manage
public resources properly and apply the highest standards of transparency and accountability to the
use of these resources during this critical phase of reconstruction of the national economy and
sweeping reform of the Haitian society.

5.3.    The note is composed of two parts. The first part takes stock of the significant strides made
in the area of economic governance prior to the January 12 earthquake, and the second lists the
activities that the government pledges to undertake to build on and even surpass the gains made in
the past.

I.   Progress Made Prior to the Earthquake

5.4.    Significant progress was made with the implementation of economic governance measures
in the six years preceding the January 12 earthquake. This progress relates, in particular, to budget
preparation, budget execution monitoring, and internal and external auditing of public expenditure.

5.5.    The law on the preparation and execution of budget laws has been adopted, providing, inter
alia, a budget preparation timetable. Budget preparation has been strengthened through the
implementation of a consultative process between the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)
and the sectoral ministries, as well as coordination between the Ministry of Planning and External
Cooperation (MPCE) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, with a view to better linkage of
investment expenditure and current expenditure. The various civil society sectors have been
included in the drafting process and have been informed of budget choices. For several years, the
draft budget has been submitted to Parliament in a timely manner. Measures have been adopted
with a view to making the budget available to the public on the MEF's website, via pamphlets, and
in the print media.

5.6.    The public expenditure oversight systems have been strengthened by the establishment and
commencement of operations of the Inspectorate General of Finance [Inspection Générale de
Finances IGF]. In addition, public accountants and financial comptrollers have been assigned to all
ministries and government agencies and current account use has been reduced from 60 percent of
current expenditure, excluding salaries, in 2004 to the historic level of 3 percent in 2009. SYSDEP
and SYSGEP, two public expenditure automated management systems, are used on a regular basis
to ensure close and integrated management of current and investment expenditure. Budget
execution reports, prepared on a periodic basis in accordance with international accounting
standards, are published monthly and annually. Since 2005, national revenue accounts have been
prepared in fewer than eight months after the end of the fiscal year and transmitted for the opinion


                                                 89
                                                    
 
of the Superior Court of Auditors and Administrative Law Disputes [Cour Supérieure des Comptes
et du Contentieux Administratif CSCCA] prior to submission to Parliament.

5.7.    In the area of revenue, ongoing efforts to improve the management of the tax and customs
administrations facilitated an increase in taxes to 11.2 percent in 2009 compared to an average of
10 percent over the past decade. A new customs code has been approved by the Chamber of
Deputies. The process of drafting a tax code with a view to aligning it with regional standards has
started. Sydonia World has been installed in the main customs offices with the aim of enhancing
their effectiveness and reducing cases of fraud and underbilling. At the same time, the mandate of
the SGS, the company responsible for inspecting merchandise prior to loading, has been expanded
in provincial customs offices in order to help ensure effective management of the flow of
merchandise and revenue collection.

5.8.    A National Public Procurement Commission [Commission Nationale des Marchés Public
CNMP] has been established to better regulate and normalize public procurement procedures and
help build capacity in the area of the procurement of goods and services in sectoral ministries. This
entity, even more so than the establishment of the legal framework, has facilitated some
improvement in procurement practices, as a result of the various training and dissemination
sessions organized. Available statistics indicate that the share of procurement not subject to
bidding relative to total government procurement fell from 85 percent in 2004 to 56 percent in
2008. In addition, a few months prior to the earthquake, an important step was taken with the
adoption by Parliament in June 2009 of the new procurement law. Four important implementing
decisions have been signed and published.

5.9.   The establishment of the Anti-Corruption Unit [Unité de Lutte contre la Corruption ULCC]
has contributed greatly to raising awareness among government employees and the general
population of the costs and risks associated with corruption and the ways and means of preventing
it.

5.10. After adoption of the law on asset disclosure, it was noted that a significant majority of
government employees complied with the provisions of this law. After going through their
disclosure statements, a report was submitted by the ULCC to the CSCCA and the Anti-Corruption
Commissions of both chambers.

II. Actions to be Taken to Preserve and Strengthen the Progress Made in the Area of
Economic Governance

5.11. The government is cognizant of the importance accorded by the Haitian people and Haiti's
international financial partners to the proper use of public funds, transparency, and accountability in
the management of resources provided to the government for Haiti's reconstruction and
development. During the March 16-17 technical meeting held in the Dominican Republic, the
government, through its representatives, reiterated the importance to be accorded to sound and
transparent management of the resources that will be mobilized through Haiti's taxpayers and
partners.

5.12. Consequently, in the post-earthquake period, the government is resolute in its desire to
preserve and even build upon the gains made in the area of economic governance. Although the

                                                  90
                                                   
 
earthquake dealt a severe blow to key institutions and logistical resources in place prior to January
12, the government quickly focused on salvaging the main equipment and servers that were not
completely destroyed and mobilized assistance from its chief partners to get pre-earthquake
management and oversight systems up and running again.

5.13.   The Haitian government is taking the following actions:

A.       Short term (6 months)
        Reaffirming the government's commitment to the medium-term reforms set forth in the
        joint budget support matrix adopted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and donors
        prior to the earthquake. Conducting a monthly review and possible updating of matrix.
        Making the matrix available to input from possible new partners.
        Making it mandatory for all public procurement in excess of the amount set forth in the
        implementing decision to the public procurement law to be subject to competitive bidding or
        to substantiation by the CNMP, in the case of exceptions to this rule.
        Building the intervention capacity of the Inspectorate General of Finance and the CSCCA
        by making technical assistance available to them.
        Making the transfer of budget resources to public enterprises, in particular the EDH, fully
        transparent and making transparency and accountability mandatory for these enterprises in
        the use of these transfers as well as their own resources.
        Having the government prepare the supplementary budget reflecting the new needs arising
        from the earthquake and the funding provided by the international community to support
        public expenditure.
        Publishing periodically the list of projects directly financed by donors or with the
        government's own resources.
