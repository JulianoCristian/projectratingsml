"versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "H6090", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Development\n            Policy Operation Project for Haiti were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: in small countries, policy based\n            programs need to be relatively simple and straightforward,\n            in particular in a country with high risk of occurrence of\n            major natural disasters such as Haiti. The rationale for a\n            single-tranche operation was supported by the possible risks\n            affecting the operation, the period required by the\n            Government to implement the reforms, the need to test the\n            incoming Government's sustained commitment to the\n            reform program, and the knowledge that implementation\n            capacity is not strong. The policy actions supported by this\n            operation reflect: On the one hand the recognition of the\n            difficult environment from which Haiti had only recently\n            emerged after the devastating earthquake which struck the\n            country on January 12, 2010, significantly worsening the\n            poverty and living conditions of the population and\n            exacerbating the country's development challenges; and\n            on the other hand, the progress made over the past years\n            with the support of the preceding economic governance reform\n            operations. Countries that have experienced major natural\n            disasters need strong institutional support to back up\n            critical reforms aimed at restoring institutional functions\n            as fast as possible. Progress in public financial\n            management, such as budget control and auditing processes,\n            and procurement procedures have benefited from technical\n            assistance, without which it would have been difficult to\n            make headways. This is a lesson drawn from experience in\n            every country that has suffered natural disasters. The\n            program policy matrix needs to be concise, with few measures\n            and outcome indicators that are clearly defined and deemed\n            within the control of the government with strong support\n            from donors. Such an approach requires prioritizing reforms\n            within a reasonable timeframe based on agreed prior actions\n            and targets between the Government and donors."}, "docdt": "2012-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
