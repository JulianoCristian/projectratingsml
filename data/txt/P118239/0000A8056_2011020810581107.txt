                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed operation is to support enhanced accountability and transparency in the management of public resources in the context of the
                         reconstruction. The operation supports the government's capacity to manage public resources efficiently and transparently. More specifically, the operation
                         supports the following measures: (i) increasing transparency in budget transfers to the electricity sector; (ii) reinstating budget controls and external and
                         internal audit processes; (iii) improving enforcement of the Law on Declaration of Assets; and (iv) reinforcing public procurement regulation and enhancing
                         transparency in procurement practices.

                         Progress towards meeting the development objective is not significant at the moment. Of the seven indicators used to track the progress towards the DO, five are on track and data
                         are not yet available to make an assessment on the two others. Close monitoring and ongoing dialogue with the client are expected to lead to progress.
