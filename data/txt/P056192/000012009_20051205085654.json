Among the many lessons learned, the\n            need for legal and regulatory framework, in all its\n            dimensions, is the necessary foundation for the banking\n            environment to succeed. From an internal point of view,\n            future Bank operations, replicated on this model, would\n            require further adjustments in current policy and practices.\n            From a practical point of view, standard disbursement\n            schedules can not be applied to projects where private\n            sector actors have total control over decision spending:\n            current loan disbursement arrangements are based on a\n            predetermined schedule, namely, creating pressures that\n            undermine prudent credit decisions by private lenders.\n            Notwithstanding, the most important policy issue revealed by\n            this project is that any attempt to create a market-based\n            system for financing public investment can not be in direct\n            competition with non-market funding sources (including from\n            the Bank) if it is to succeed.
