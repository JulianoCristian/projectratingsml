       (PCR) for the Oil Palm Second Phase Project in Ghana. The\n            overall outcome of the project is rated satisfactory. The\n            objectives of the project were to continue the Bank's\n            involvement in the agricultural sector including policy\n            areas, strategy for development, production of improved\n            planting material, and improved cultivation technology;\n            diversification away from cocoa, import substitution; and\n            continued development of investments made in the Oil Pam\n            Development Project First Phase. Lessons learned: The\n            project has shown that establishing a nucleus plantation\n            linked to outgrower holdings is viable under the conditions\n            of: (i) a simple project design; (ii) autonomy to operate as\n            a business entity; (iii) efficient and competent management;\n            and (iv) provision of adequate amounts of local counterpart\n            funds. Technical assistance (TA) can be used for the\n            successful training of local counterpart staff with the\n            cooperation of the TA provider, and close monitoring by the recipient."}, "docdt": "1994-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
