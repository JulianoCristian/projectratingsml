          for consolidation of Phase I development of the nucleus\n            plantation and smallholder/outgrower plantings. It will also\n            increase palm oil production through an additional 2,500 ha\n            of outgrower plantings. The main components include:\n            vehicles, equipment, and housing for nucleus estate and oil\n            mill employees; inputs, extension services, and credit to\n            smallholders/outgrowers; consultant services; training; and\n            development of an oil palm research program. There are no\n            unusual technical project risks, and implementation problems\n            are expected to be minimal since the project will be based\n            on the institutions and experience of Phase I. However, the\n            project faces risks related to: (a) the high rate of\n            domestic inflation which, if it continues, could lead to\n            cost over-runs, and (b) the availability of foreign exchange\n            to meet recurrent costs of imported farm inputs. However, in\n            view of satisfactory experience with the Government's\n            contributions under Phase I, and assuming continued efforts\n            by the Government at containing inflation, these risks are\n            significantly reduced."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
