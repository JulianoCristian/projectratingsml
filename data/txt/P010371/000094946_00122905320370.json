The project inputs\n            contributed to: improving access to and quality of maternal\n            health services including family planning; enhancing staff\n            development through in-service training, expansion of\n            pre-service training capacity, and career enhancement\n            programs of female paramedics; improving managerial\n            capabilities; and strengthening the health management\n            information system. The experience of the Area Focus\n            Approach (AFA) confirmed the critical importance of\n            availability of female paramedics and supportive supervision\n            to improving performance of first level care facilities. The\n            policy of training and eventual recruitment of local girls\n            adopted by the Sindh government is a sustainable solution to\n            the problem of regional shortages of female staff. It not\n            only addresses multiple constraints including housing and\n            security concerns to the retention of female personnel but\n            also provides an element of accountability to the community.\n            The AFA pilot has also underlined the need of training\n            traditional birth attendants and linking them to the primary\n            health system. Considerable potential exists for increasing\n            collaboration between the Health Education and Nutrition\n            units, existing nongovernmental organizations, and\n            community-based organizations."}, "docdt": "2000-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
