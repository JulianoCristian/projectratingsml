social\n            sector programs on a long run fiscally sustainable path\n            through the reduction of the level and duration or program\n            benefits, increase in cost recovery and the facilitation of\n            the private provision of services; (b) to increase labor\n            market distortions inherent in social sector programs, as\n            well as the labor code; and to reduce poverty by improving\n            the quality of social sector programs and their targeting.\n            The project components include: (a) a fundamental reform of\n            the pension system consistent with a move towards a funded\n            privately managed system; (b) a long term health sector\n            reform strategy to improve health status and contain health\n            care costs; (c) improved solvency of the Employment Fund and\n            an increase in labor market flexibility; (d) reform of the\n            hiring and termination process embodied in the Law on Labor\n            Relations; and (e) adequate budgeting and delivery of social\n            assistance benefits."}, "docdt": "1998-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
