institutional\n            development impacts are substantial. Significant lessons are\n            drawn from the project, namely for complex adjustment\n            operations, requiring substantial policy dialogue, and\n            technical assistance (TA). The potential for political, and\n            civil instability, should be carefully considered, for, as a\n            result of the Kosovo crisis, the Ministry of Labor and\n            Social Policy (MOLSP) - the project's lead coordinating\n            agency - was responsive to the refugee crisis, but its\n            ability to focus on policy reforms was reduced, causing\n            delays in passing the reform legislation. Nonetheless, it is\n            worth noting that because of the Government's\n            ownership, and commitment to reforms, in particular the\n            Minister of MOLSP, critical stages succeeded in the\n            legislation process. Adjustment lending proved an efficient\n            instrument in forcing reforms in all sectors, because\n            besides individual sector reforms - simultaneous in social\n            protection, labor and health sectors - the release of the\n            second tranche was conditional to the passing of ALL\n            legislation. Moreover, the success of adjustment operations,\n            is largely dependent on parallel investment operations, to\n            substantiate reform efforts, through policy dialogue, and\n            the provision of TA. However, a realistic timetable would\n            have allowed further support, and acceptance of reforms."}, "docdt": "2000-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
