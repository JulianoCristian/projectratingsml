reactivating a road maintenance program, which virtually\n            came to a standstill due to Ghana's severe shortage of\n            foreign exchange, and at increasing the capacity of the\n            domestic trucking fleet to permit transportation of food and\n            other essential commodities. Specifically, the project\n            would: (a) enable Ghana to carry out for the next two years\n            routine maintenance on all public roads and periodic\n            maintenance on about 6,000 km of paved, gravel and feeder\n            roads by providing spare parts, lubricants, bitumen and\n            tools required for Ghana Highway Authority (GHA) and private\n            domestic contractors engaged in road maintenance; (b)\n            increase the capacity of private domestic contractors and\n            quarry operators to undertake road maintenance works by\n            providing equipment and related spares through a line of\n            credit to BHC; (c) enable remobilization of part of the\n            domestic trucking fleet by providing spare parts, lubricants\n            and tools; and (d) strengthen the institutional capacity of\n            BHC and the private domestic contractors through technical\n            assistance. The main project risk is that project-financed\n            spare parts and other supplies may be diverted from their\n            intended recipients. The project would attempt to minimize\n            the risk through pricing measures."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
