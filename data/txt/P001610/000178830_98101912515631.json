        in improving and expanding secondary education and the\n            training of secondary school teachers. In addition, it would\n            assist the Government in the preparation of a national\n            education plan to provide the basis for future development\n            of the education system. Specifically, the five-year project\n            would finance: (a) construction, furnishing and equipping of\n            five new and the expansion of six existing secondary\n            schools; (b) construction, furnishing and equipping of\n            additional boarding and teaching facilities for Chancellor\n            College at Zomba; and (c) preinvestment studies and\n            technical assistance for preparation of a national education\n            plan. As a result of the project, both enrollment and output\n            of secondary and higher education would increase by about 5\n            percent per annum thereby providing much needed manpower for\n            middle- and higher-level positions. Relatedly, the project\n            would contribute to expanded educational and employment\n            opportunities for women. It would also lead to improved\n            analysis, planning and management of Malawi's education\n            system. There are no major risks to the project except a\n            possible shortage of secondary school teachers. Steps have\n            been taken to minimize that risk."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
