effort in crop and livestock development and to strengthen\n            the linkage between research, extension and agricultural\n            activity in Senegal. Specifically, the project provides for:\n            (i) introducing mixed agriculture/livestock production\n            systems research programs in five priority regions; (ii)\n            establishing nationally-coordinated multi-disciplinary\n            research teams for six priority foodgrain and cash crop\n            commodities; (iii) reorganizing and strengthening the\n            operations of the Institut Senegalais de Recherches\n            Agricoles (ISRA), the implementing agency; (iv) establishing\n            long-term manpower planning and training for professional\n            and technical staff, and improving personnel management\n            policies and procedures; (v) strengthening research on\n            production economics, marketing, and human resources; (vi)\n            strengthening capabilities for evaluation and application of\n            new technologies, and more effective links with extension\n            services; and (vii) strengthening linkages with external\n            technical assistance agencies, including international\n            agricultural research centers."}, "docdt": "1981-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
