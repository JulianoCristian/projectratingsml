Senegal will be the six-year first phase of a long-term\n            program to improve the relevance and impact of\n            Senegal's national research effort in crop and\n            livestock development and to strengthen the linkage between\n            research, extension and agricultural activity in Senegal.\n            Specifically, the project provides for: (i) introducing\n            mixed agriculture and livestock production systems research\n            programs in five priority regions; (ii) establishing\n            nationally-coordinated multi-disciplinary research teams for\n            six priority food-grain and cash crop commodities; (iii)\n            reorganizing and strengthening the operations of the\n            Institut Senegalais de Recherches Agricoles (ISRA), the\n            implementing agency; (iv) establishing long-term manpower\n            planning and training for professional and technical staff,\n            and improving personnel management policies and procedures;\n            (v) strengthening research on production economics,\n            marketing, and human resources; (vi) strengthening\n            capabilities for evaluation and application of new\n            technologies, and more effective links with extension\n            services; and (vii) strengthening linkages with external\n            technical
