The\n            project has two components. The first, for reform and\n            institutional development support, comprises approximately\n            10-12 discrete subprojects to be executed by selected\n            institutions involved in policy and research, training,\n            implementation and other activities related to China's\n            economic reform program. The second component is for\n            preinvestment and project preparation. It is similar in\n            design, purpose and scope to two previous Technical\n            Cooperation Credits (Credits 1412-CHA and 1664-CHA). It\n            consists of a line of credit available to finance\n            feasibility studies, preinvestment and other technical\n            assistance needed to prepare projects for external,\n            specifically Bank/IDA, financing. In certain exceptional\n            circumstances, it could also be used to finance technical\n            assistance activities related to project implementation,\n            including the national components of provincially-based and\n            funded investment projects."}, "docdt": "1992-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
