 development impact, and satisfactory performances by both\n            the Bank and Borrower.  Despite cancellation of most of the\n            loan amount, the project's key development objectives\n            were substantially achieved.   Some components were\n            cancelled including: steel plant restructuring and\n            relocation; line-of-credit component; and surplus labor\n            re-employment support.  Lessons Learned were in the areas of\n            Bank procedures and covenants as well as procurement.\n            Lengthy Bank preparation and appraisal procedures, entailing\n            project preparation studies and determining the feasibility\n            of sub-borrowers, are not appropriate for projects in\n            dynamic sectors such as industry, especially for economies\n            in transition.  Also, sub-borrowers under intense\n            competitive pressure are less likely to be able to meet\n            financial covenants.  While assurance is needed that the\n            sub-borrowers are creditworthy and have a satisfactory\n            business plan, financing terms ought to be responsive to\n            changing competitive conditions and product market dynamics.\n            Requiring sub-borrowers to assume the foreign exchange risk\n            burdens them, especially if the sub-borrower is unable to\n            hedge against such a risk, particularly in China.\n            Procurement was delayed due to: (a) lack of sufficient\n            understanding by the Borrower and its agencies of Bank\n            procurement procedures; and (b) the Chongqing Environmental\n            Protection Bureau's (CEPB's) nebulous internal\n            procedures for reviewing and approving bid documents."}, "docdt": "2004-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
