CHONCQING, PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
1.0 INTRODUCTION
Chongqing Special Steel Company (CSSC) was established in 1934 in the
Shapingba district in Chongqing City, Sichaun Province. The plant is locaed on
the Jialing River in a very densely populated area. CSSC is state owned and
employs about 18,300 people. The plant produced an average of 219,500 tonnes
of steel products over the last five years. The steel grades were 44 peret carbon,
7 percent stanless and 49 percent high quality special alloy steels.
The existing steel making facilities consist of ten small - electric arc furaces
(EAF). The furmaces are of 1950's technology. Because of their age and
condition and the lack of space, the fimuaces cannot be retrofitted to bring them
into compliance with enviromental standards for air, water and solid wate
disosal. CSSC is unable to consistently meet the product quality of specialty
steels used in the transportation and machinery manufactuing industries because
of obsolete facilities. These facilities are scheduled to be tom down in 1996-
1998.
1.1 Project Background
CSSC has been designated a "key" company in the production of specialty steels
in China and is expected to play a major role in the projected expansion of the
economy.
In order to effectively solve the pollution issues, it is proposed to build a new
steelmaling plant capable of meeting environmental standards and to produce
450,000 tonnes per year of high quality semi-finished steel blooms. Major
production equipment in the new plant will be a 100 tonne electric arc furnace, a
continuous bloom caster, a ladle metallurgy furnace and a vacuum degasser. The
plant will be constructed on a green field site five kilometers from the existing
6316R

plant. Cast blooms will be shipped by rail to be processed on the existing
finishing mills.
Environmental control facilites will include:
* A baghouse for control of DC arc fuimace, ladle metallurgical furnace and
furnace systems, and fimace raw mateial supply system.
* A multi-function and anti-corrosion cyclone separator for control of boiler's
fume.
• Closed water recycle systems for electric furnace, ladle metliugical fiunace,
vacuum degasser and casting facilities.
- Solid separation, oil skimming and chemical treatment for recycle water.
- Sanitary treatment facilities.
* Noise abatement facilities.
- Extensive plantings and greenery.
1.2   Framework for an Environmental Impact Assesment (EIA)
According to the Chinese environmental protection law and manaEnt
regulations, construction projects need an EIA. The World Bank's Operational
Directive 4.0.1: Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01) provides complete
procedures and requirements. In 1993, The Chinese National Enm tal
Protection Bureau (EPB), National Planning Committee, the Ministry of Finance
and the People's Bank of China co-issued the Circular on Sing
EnvironmentalImpact Assessment Management for Constuction Projects
Financed  by  International fimncial o tions (Dtocmment No. 324,
Environmental Monitoring, June 21, 1993), which raised specific requiremenrs fr
the management and report compilation of ETA for loan projects. The EIA
requiements by both documents are generally similar.
Bases for Drawing up the Program are:

Jingkou (new site), Banbianjie and vicinity 200 m out of the new site are
protecting aims of acoustical environmental quality.
1.3 Enviroranental Benefits To The Local Community
Present air quality at the existing and new plant sites has been deternined from
data obtained from observations by Chongqng Environmental Center moNtoring
station at the Shuangbei monitoring station for the existing plant area, and the Ban
Bian Jie monitoring station for the new plant area. The data consists of measured
annual average concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO,), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
total suspended particulate (TSP).
A computer dispersion model known as the Industrial Source Complex Long
Term Model (ISCLT2), approved by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency, was used to evaluate air quality based on emissions from the existing
plant and predicted emission from the proposed facilities. The model was used
for three determinations: (1) the existing plant's effect on the area around the
plant and its effect in the area of the proposed site; (2) the effect of the new
facilities if located at the site of the existing plant; and, (3) the effect of the new
facilities on the present plant site and the new plant site if located on the proposed
site.
Results show that: (1) the new facilities will have a slight effect on air quality at
any location and (2) when the existing plant is shutdown, air quality in the area
near the plant will be significantly improved by decreased concentrations of NOx,
SO2 and TSP. The shut down will not affect air quality in the area around the new
site. The results are summarized below.

CSSC - Steel Making Equipment
Water Consumption at the new plant will be 35 percent lower than the old plant
since 92 percent will be recirculated.  Wastewater treatment wiln control
suspended solids, oil           and chemical oxygen demand (COD  ). A
sanitary system will control suspended solids and biological oxygen demand
(BOD and COD). Water retumed to the Jialing River will be of significantly
better quality than the applicable standards.
Noise from the present facilities does not significantly effect residential areas and
no effect is expected from the proposed plant.
Slag, roll scales, coal ash and used refractories are solid waste product of
steelmaking. Slag is about 84 percent of the total and only one percent is
presently recycled at CSSC. It is piled on the west bank of the Jialing River and
much of it ends up in the river causing pollution. Nonnal water run-off adds to
the condition.
The new plant will increase slag production by 39 percent but 87 percent of the
total will be processed through a plant and recycled. The same processing plant
will be used to reduce the slag pile at the existing plant.
Roll scale and coal ash will also be recycled in the new plant. The Jialing River
will not be adversely affected by the disposal practices for the balance of the
materials.

2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Chongqing Special Steel Company (CSSC) is located in a very densely
populated area in te city of Chongqing in Sichuan Province. Ihe steel making
facilities are a major source of air and water pollution and are scheduled to be
shutdown in 1996-1998.
As part of the Chongqing Industial Reform Project, a modern steelmaking plant
capable of complying with accepted enil standards will be constucted.
The proposed location is a green field site owned by CSSC about 5 kIlometers
from the existng plant Major steelmaldng fcifities at the new plant will be an
Electric Arc Furnace (Ultra High Power, Direct Curent), a Ladle RefiDing
Furace, a Vacuum Degasser and a Contmiuous Bloom Caster The plant will be
capable of producing 450,000 tonnes of semi-finished blooms per year. The
Bloom size will be 200 x 200 mm and 240 x 240 mm cross section and 3.4 to 4.2
m long.
The semi-finished blooms will be shipped primarily by raiL to the present
finising ficilities for further conversion to a variety of specialty products for the
automotive and machinery manufacturing, tool manufturing, chemical and other
industries. Proposed finished product mix from 450,000 tonnes of blooms is:

In addition to the serious industrial pollution problems caused by the lack of
modem technology and the poor condition of equipment, CSSC cannot meet the
product quality specifications for specialty steel products. While chemical
specifications can usually be met the problems of steel cleanliness and segregation
cannot. Lower metallic yields, high slag volumes and long heat times also occur.

2.3  Industrial Pollution Control Components
2.3.1 Air Pollution Controls
The new 100 tonnes EAF will use second hole evacuation to control emissions
from the furnace. These emissions will be ducted to a baghouse. The esimated
control efficiency of this baghouse is greater than 99 percent. Emissions of
particulate matter (PM) from the Refining Fumace (RF) will be ducted to the
same baghouse. The system used to charge materials to the EAF and RF will be
controlled by a dust collector. The efficiency of this baghouse is also greater than
99 percent. Emissions of PM and SO2 from the new boiler will be controlled by a
wet scrubber. The design of this scrubber is proprietary. The estimated control
efficiency for PM is 95 percent and for SO2 the control efficiency is go percent
The coal feeding system to the boiler is also controlled by a baghouse with a
control efficiency of greater than 99 percent. Pollution sources and control
measures are shown in Table 2-1 and Table 2-2.
2.3.2  Industial and Sanitaxy W aster Treatnent
The rnajQrity of sanitary and industrial wastewater in the Shuagbei and
Shapingba areas are discharged to the Jialing River without treatment. This river
is also the major source of industrial and drinking water for the Shapingba
District, the annual average flow rate is 69.41 billion cubic meters and the
average concentration of suspended solids is 2.37 kgmn3.
The total volume of industrial wastewater discharged to the Jialing River from
sources located in the Shuangbei and Shapingba areas is approimatly 42.6
million cubic meters (m3) per year. CSSC (#1 #2 and #3 steel makdng shops)
discharges the greatest amount of COD (chemical oxygen demand) and oil.
The total COD discharged per year is 4,894 tonnes and CSSC discharges
approximately 342.31 tonnes, or 7 percent of the total. Total oil
discharged is 446 tonnes per year and CSSC discharges 60.65 tonnes, or 14
percent of the total. The total  fresh water for  the existing plant is 7,909,500
m3 per year and the expected fresh water for the new plant is 5,170,000 m3 per
year, a decrease of 35 percent Except for preteatment of the continuous caster
water, there is no sanitary or industial wastewater treatment at the existng plant
and the water recycle rate for the caster is only 22 percent. The new plant will
contain both sanitary and industrial wastewater treatment facilities and the recycle
rate for industrial water usage will increase to 92 percent The industrial

wastewater treatment system will control suspended solids, oil and COD ; the
sanitary system will control suspended solids and BOD (biological oxygen
demand) and COD. The environmental impact from the industrial and sanitay
water is discussed in Section 4.2. Water pollution sources are shown in Table 2-3.
2.3.3 Noise and Noise Abatement
The three existing steelmaking shops of CSSC are located near the center of the
plant and are removed from residential areas. Noise from these facilities does not
significantly impact these residential areas.
The new site is located on the Jingkou Farm. North of the proposed plant
boundary is farmland and to the    northwest   are residential areas. The
Jialing River forms the southeast border of the plant boundary. Noise from the
proposed new facilities is not expected to significantly impact any existing
residential areas. The proposed project will include the construction of modem
housing for plant personnel and other significant improvements to the surrounding
areas. This will also help to mitigate the effect of any plant generated noise in the
new residential areas. Pollution sources are shown in Table 2-4.
2.3.4 Solid Wastes
Production of specialty steel at the existing site is accompanied by the production
of solid wastes such as oxide and reducing slag, scale, coal ash and waste
refractories. The majority of the slag is stored along the west bank of the Jialing
River and as the storage pile increases in height, the slag pile becomes unstable
and slips into the river. It is estimated that 700,000 tonnes of slag have been
produced by the three steehnaking shops. Slag accounts for 84 percent of the total
solid waste produced and less than one percent is reused. Of the total solid waste
produced, 1.95 percent is reused and this is mainly scale.
When the new 100 tonne EAF goes into operation, approximately 49,800
tonnes/year of solid waste will be produced. This represents an increase over the
existing steelmaking facilities of 55 percent; however, 87 percent of this amount
will be reused and the amount disposed will be reduced by 90 percent. It is
anticipated that 40,000 tonnes of slag and 2,100 tonnes of scale generated at the
new plant and up to 75 percent of the coal ash will be sent iG the slag handling
facility for processing. Furthermore, the proposed slag procescing plant with a
capacity of 100,000 tonneslyear, will process the slag at the existing plant and

thereby gradually reduce the amount stored. This will also reduce the amount of
slag that is inadvertently discharged into the Jialing River. Pollution sources are
shown in Table 2-5.

kimn. - It is one of main water sources of Chongqing City for living and production,
and production and sanitary wastewater is discharged to this river. According to
measurements recorded at the Beipei hydrometric station, the largest discharge at
flood peak is 44,800 m3/s, the largest annual average flow is 3,080 m3/s, the
smallest annual average flow is 1,140 m3/s, the average radial flow in some years is
694.1 hundred millions m3, the average sand amount is 2.37 kg/m3, and the annual
transport of sand is 1.65 hundred million tonnes.
(b) Groundwater
The area is located in base rock hilly country, it's hydrogeology is complex, the
distribution of groundwater is influenced by the geological structure, the stratum,
the control of the rock characteristics, the landforms and the distribution of the
water system. The supply of main groundwater is contained in carbonate rock, the
crack water of clabtic rock which includes also red layer hole crack water), and the
hole lines wate; of !oose rock. Of the three types of groundwater, the richest
groundwater source is contained in carbonate rock; however, it is not used for
production or d&znestic use.
3.2 SURVEY OF THE ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT

4.0 ANTICIPATED IMPACTS
4.1   General Description of Impacts
Environmental impacts of the proposed project include impacts on the ecological
and social environment, and living quality. The impacts rnay be caused by site
selection, potential accidents, activities during construction period, and normal
operatior. of the proposed new facilities.
4.1.1 Wastewater Treatment
The proposed wastewater treatment system will provide for wastewater collecting
systems, treatment plants and disposal facilities. The principal beneficial effect in
Chongqing are:
D  To improve the water quality of the receiving waterbody and gradually restore
the ecosystem.
•  To improve the level of municipal construction and enlarge the scope of
municipal services, improve the source of drinldng water by reducing
wastewater discharges and enhance the scenic quality and sanitary conditions
of the city.
* To reduce waterborne infection and to improve public health level.
The principal long-term effects of the proposed project are the adverse impacts on
receiving waterbodies caused by the effluent discharge from treatment facilities.
The effects on water quality in the Jialing river by wastewater discharges have
been assessed by use of a mathematical model.
The activities during construction of wastewater treatment plants, pump stations
and drainage systems may generate noise, dust, mechanical tail gas, traffic and soil.
erosion; however, all of these effects are temporary. There is an integrated system
of construction management in China. While taking necessary measures, the
adverse effects on environment and society during the period of construction can
be reduced to minimum levels.

and to improve living quality and health level.
Potential adverse effects of the proposed project have been analyzed and predicted
comprehensi'ely in the process of assessment, especially for problems caused by
sanitary landfill, such as the effect on groundwater. The problems of odor, noise
and leachate due to solid waste collecting and transferring are minimized.
4.1.3 Industrial Pollution Control (IPC) Project
The steehnaling facilities are now quite old and the quality and quantity of steel
produced versus the resources required results in products that are not competitive
in the world market. There are ten existing EAPs and a 1950's vintage
continuous caster. Eight of the 10 EAFs have no air pollution controls; the
remaining two furnaces have controls that are not efficient.
In order to meet the requirements of national economic development and
enviromnental protection, CSSC intends to use a 50 million dollar loan from the
World Bank to build a steel-making shop at a new site and adopt advanced process
flow and control techniques. CSSC plans to build a 100 tonne super power EAF
with on-line treatment facilities and a continuous casting machine, to improve
efficiency and reduce energy consumption. The yield will be 8-12% higher than
that of ingot casting and the energy equivalent of 80 kg of standard coal will be
saved per tonne of steel. Thus, less pollutants will be generated and environment

at the plant will be improved. At the same time, the project will greatly improve
the social environment and quality of living.
This plan is supported by the World Bank and Chongqing Goverunent. CSSC has
already acquired the Jingkou Farm as the new site of the project. CSSC entrusted
Chongqing Iron & Steel Designing Institute (CISDI) to prepare a report for the
EAF and pollution treatment project. The environmental assessment is designated
Class A.

4.2 Impact on Water Quality
The majority of sanitary and indusbial watewater in the Shuangbei and Shapinba areas
are discharged to the raing River without treatment. This river is also the major
source of industial and drinldng water for the Shapinba District. The annual avarage
flow rte is 69.41 bilion cubic meters and the average concentration of suspended
solids is 2.37 kglm3.
The total volume of industial wastewater discharged to the Jialing River from source
located in the Shuangbei and Shapinba areas is approximately 42.6 milion cubic meters
(m3 ) per year. CSSC dishres the greatest amount of COD  (chemical oxyge
demand) and oil and grease. The total COD discharged per year is 4,894 tonnes and
CSSC existing steel-making plant discharges approximately 342 tonrs, or 7
percent of the total. Total oil discharged is 446 tonnes per year and CSSC existing
steel-making plant discharges 60.65 tonnes, or 14 percent of the total. The total
fresh water ror the existing steel-making plant is 7,909,500 m3 per year and the
expected fresh water for the new plant is 5,170,000 m3 per year, a decrease of 35
perent Except for petreatment of the continuous caster water. there is no saitary
or industrial wastewater treatment at the existing plant and the war recycle rate
for the caser is only 22 percent The new plant will contain both sanitary and
industrial wastewater treatment facilities and the recycle rate for industial water
usage will incrcase to 92 percent The indusial wastewater treatment system will
control suspended solids. oil and COD, the sanitary system will control suspended
solids and BOD and COD. It is expected that the impact of the wastewater will
meet the Chinese water quality standard as shown in the following chart:

The Water Quality Assessment of COMs and Onl
The water quality assessment will be canried out for COD  and oil   The
background concentration as detemiined from monitoring date is added to the model
predictions of contaminant concentrations in the Jialing River.
Predic-ted WatLr Oublyr Impact of Eidsting Steelmakng Processes
The oil-containing substances from each discharge point at the existing plant of CSSC
have resulted in two obvious high concentration zones appearing in the water body of
Jlaing River. Between the #1 pollutant discharge outfall and the No. 3 control cross-
section, in a range of 900m in longitudinal length and about 15m in lateral lengt, there
exists a water zone where the oil     concentration is ten times as high as the
Class EI standard of 0.05mgtL. The oil-containing substances from the exsting plant
of CSSC have reslted in obvious "pollution zones" along the river downstream from
the dicage outfall No. 3 control cross-section and GCj (Gaojiahuayuan wate
intaldng spot) indicating that these oil-containing substances from the existing plant of
CSSC have a significam impact on the water quality in the hialing River adjacefnt to and
downstream of the plant.
The COD from the eisfing plant of CSSC has orly a minimal effect on the Jialing
River water quality and the affbaed areas are limited to a very small zone, resulting in
a slight impact to the water quality of the segment in the plant area and No. 3 control
cross-section and GQaw Gaojiahuayuan water intaklng spot of the jaling River.
Predicted Water Impact ofthe Proposed Proiect
The oil-containing substances from the existing steehnaking plant1, after being
relocated, wiR obviously have less effects on the ,aling River. The range where
concentrations go beyond standards in the vicinity of the exsting plant will shrink in
longitudinal length and the concttion of oil-ontainig substances in GA3
(Gaojiahuayuian water intaking spot) will fal from the existing 0.05mg/L to 0.02mg/L
The oil-containing substances from the pollutant discharge outfall of the proposed
project will have some effects on Jialing River, but the affected section of the jaling
River is small and the range where concentrations go beyond standard is about 400m in
longitudinal length, about 18m in lateral length. The oil-containing substances will also
have some effects on No. 2 control cross-section of the water intaking spot for the

Agicultural Cheical Plant, but the pollutant concentration of the water zone affected
is 0.01 nmg/L, just 20% ofthe standard.
COD from the pollutant discharge outfall (#0) of the proposed project will have litte
eftec on water quality. The estmate concentation of COD  at the water zone of
No. 2 control cross-section Qf the water intaldng spot for the Agricultural Chemical
Plant is 0.5mg/1, just 3.3% of the standard value for Class m water zones.
After the backgrund concentation is added to the concntration of the oil-containing
substances afier completion of the proposed prject, the water quality will improve at
the eitig plant The high connaon zone of 0.5 mgAL will decrease allowing the
rnge where the pollant concentrtion goes beyond standards to move close to the
upstream segnent of G_ Gaojiyuan water intamdng spot, which enables the oil
concenaon of the water zone at the water intaking spot to meet the class III
andard. However, the "pollution zones" of oil- ing substances along the
riveside will still  *st mainly because of the backgrotnd input from the segment
upstream of CSSC, which is not part ofthe proposed project of CSSC but will require
the municipal govemment to plan a central program and solve the problem.
The distnbutions of the co  on of COD   when added to the background
cncentaon indicates tXa after the completion of the proposed project, the n hea
concentraton of COD  is small, rang from I-2mglI, and the zone where the
concentration increases near the poDutant discharge opening (#0) of the proposed
prqect is about 600m in longitudinal lengti and about 10-20 m in lateral length After
dilution and diffsion in the Jialng Ri, the concentaton will drop rapidly to the
background level, this having no effect on the water quality at No. 2 control =oss-

(e) Analysis of the Effect on Liangtuo Water Plant by the Proposed Project
*iangtuao Water Plant (see Figure 5) is one the key municipal construction projects of
Chongqing during the period of the "Eighth-five Plan'. The water intakdng spot for the
Plant is on the other river bank, in Jiangbei District, about 3,800 m downsteam of the
outfall ofthe proposed project site of CSSC.
The rmodel predictions indicate that oil-containing substances and COD discharges
from the proposed project will have litde effect on the water quality of the wter
intang spot.
Under normal pollutant discharge condition, the concntration of the water quality at
the water itaking spot affected by oil-containing substances from the polutant
dischrge opening (#0) of the proposed project is less than 0.00004 mg/L, that affect
by COD is less than 0.00075 mg/L.
ADI of the calculation reslts show that oil-contining substances and COD from the
proposed project of CSSC will not have    effect on the water quality of the watr
inaldng spot for Liangtuo Water Plant.
Conclusions
The oil-containing substances from the pollutant discharge opeing (#0) of the
proposed project will have litle effect on the Jialing River and only a slight effect on
the No. 2 control (the water intakdng spot for the Agriculual Chemical Plant) cross-
section downstrem  COD discharges wil not change sigpificanty.
In generaL the construction of the proposed project will play a positive role in reducing
the concentration of oil-contaimng   bstances in the segment of Jia}ing River
downstrem of the plant. The relocation of the sMin g units and the movement of
the po0utant discharge openings will improve the water quality in the section of the
Jaing River adjacent and downstream of the eisting plant.. The pollutas discharged
from outfall #0 of the proposed project, will not have effect on the water quality of the
water in taking spot for Liangtuo Water Plant.
In summary, the water assessment justifies that the relocation project for
steelnaking pollution control of CSSC is urgent, as well as feasible.

4.3.3  Existing Air Quality
Ambient concentrations of NOx, SO2 and TSP were measured at Shuangbei, near
CSSC's existing plant, and at the new site (Ban Bian lie) in 1991, 1992 and 1994.
In 1991 and 1992, samples were collected four times per day (0700, 1100, 1500
and 1900 hours) for five days in the months of January, April, July and October.
Therefore, a total of 80 samples were collected per year for each of the three
pollutants. The duration of each sample was approximately 20 minutes. Ambient
concentrations were measured hourly in June, July and August of 1994 and the
duration of each these samples was 20 minutes. The same sampling and analytical
techniques were used for the three sets of data. These data were obtained from the
CSSC (see Appendix A) and are sumnarized in Table 4.4.
The continuous monitoring data collected in 1994 for the months of June, July and
August were averaged and this value was entered as the July 1994 average in
Table 4.4 for the existing plant and new site. Comparing the July 1991, 1992 and
1994 pollutant concentrations reveals that these averages are generally consistent;

therefore, the annual NOx, S02 and TSP concentrations at the existing and new
site can be estimated from the three data sets. These estimates are discussed in the
following paragraphs.
Annual Average Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) Concentration for the Existing
Plant
Figure 1 summarizes the TSP concentrations measured during the three sanpling
periods (1991, 1992 and 1994) at the Shuangbei air quality monitoiing station
located near the eisting plant. Concentrations measured at Shuangbei during the
continuous sampling that was performed in June, July and August of 1994 are
somewhat higher than the values for July 1991 and 1992 (see Table 4-4). More
variability in the data would be expected at this site because of the proxmity of
industrial sources. The number of samples collected in 1991 and 1992 make it
difficult to determine the reasons for the differences in concentrations from year to
year. Annual EAF steel production was 288,070 tonnes, 295,300 tonnes and
257,410 tonnes in 1991, 1992 and 1994 respectively. Production levels (see Table
4-5) and annual TSP concentrations folow similar trends for 1991 and 1992. The
average monthly production levels in the summer of 1994 were 14 percent lower
han in July 1991 and 1992; however, the average monthly TSP concentration for
June-August 1994 was more than 40 percent higher than the July 1991-0992
levels. Although it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions from these data
sets, it would appear that meteorological conditions have a significant influence on
TSP concentrations. For example, precipitation events during these sampling
periods would greatly reduce TSP concentrations. If the mean monthly TSP
concentration is plctted (see Figure 1) for 1991 and 1992 and the same trend is
assumed for 1994, then the average TSP concentration for 1994 can be estimated
(see Table 4-4). The annual concentration estimates for 1991, 1992 and 1994 are
0.60 mg/rm3, 0.43 mg/m3 andc 0.73 mg/m3. Averaging these values results in an
estimated annual average for the existing plant of 0.59 mg/n3. therefore, this area
is meeting the annual air quality standard for TSP; because no standard for TSP
exists.

Annual Average Total Suspended Particulate fTSP) Concentration for the New
Site
Figure 4-4 summarze the TSP concentrations measured at the new site in 1991,
1992 and 1994. The three data sets are relatively consistent, especially the
concentration trends from season to season. The analysis performed for the
existing plant was repeated for the new site. The estimated anual mean TSP
concentrations for 1991, 1992 and 1994 are 0.26, 0.28 and 0.22 mg/re3. Based on
this analysis, the estimated background annual mean TSP concentration for the
new site is 0.25 mg/n3. Based on these air-quality estimates, the new site is
currently meeting the annual TSP air quality standard since no Chinese standard
applies.
Annual Average Sulfur Dioxide (S 02) Concentration for the Existing Plant and
New Site
Figures 3 and 4 summarize the SO2 concentration data for 1991, 1992 and 1994
recorded -t the Shuangbei and Ban Bian Jie monitoring stations. The SO2 data
exhibits less variability than the TSP data. The annual mean estimate for 1994 for
both the existing plant and the new site (see Figure 4) were determined by use of
the same procedure foliowed for TSP. The annual means for 1991, 1992 and 1994
(see Table 4.4) for the existing plant are 0.24 mg/mr3, 0.31 mg/n3 and 0.28 mg/m3

and the means for the new site are 0.13 mg/m3, 0.15 mg/rn and 0.07 mg/n3,
respectively. Based on these averages, the amual mean SO2 concentration for the
existing site is 0.28 mg/mn and for the new site the annual mean is 0.12 mg/rn3.
The annual SO2 air quality standard for Class II and Class m areas is 0.06 mg/rn3
and 0.1 mg/mn3, respectively.
Annual Average Nitrogen Oxide (NO2) Concentrations for the Exdsting Plant and
New Sit
The NOx data for 1991, 1992, and 1994 is presented in Figures 5 and 6. These
data exhibit more variation than from year to year and season to season at the
eisting site than the SO2 and TSP data. The data at the new site is somewhat
more consistent. The same procedure that was used to estimate annual mens for
SO2 and TSP was applied to the NOx data. The annual mean NOx concentation
for the existing plant is 0.09 mg/rn3 and for the new site the mean is 0.04 mg/rn
(see Table 4-4). An annual NOx standard has not been established for Chongqing;
threfore, the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 0.11
mg/m' will be used. Both the existing and new site are in compliance with this
NOx standard.
4.3.4 Air Pollution Controls
The new 100 tonne EAF will use second hole evacuation to control emissions from
the furnace. These emissions will be ducted to a baghouse. The estimated control
efficiency of this baghouse is greater than 99 percent. Emissions of particulate
matter (PM) from the Refining Furnace (RF) will be ducted to the same baghouse.
The system used to charge materials to the EAF and RF will be controlled by a
dust collector. The efficiency of this baghouse is also greater than 99 percent.
E-ussions of PM and SO2 from the new boiler will be controUed by a wet
scrubber. The design of this scrubber is proprietary. The estimated control
efficiency for PM is 95 percent and for S02 the control efficiency is 80 percent.
The average particulate matter concentration in the scrubber exhaust gases is 0.08
g/m'. The coal feeding system to the boiler is also controled by a baghouse with a
control efficiency of greater than 99 percent.

Table 4-6 lists the emissions from the ten EAFs and other facilities at the adsting
plant along with the planned emissions from sources at the now site. These
emissions were calculated by CSSC and CISDI. There are three selang
shops at the existing CSSC plant. The No. I Steelming Shop ha four lO-tome
EAFs and the No. I and 2 EAFs have canopy hoods to control partiuate
emissions. The No. 2 Steelmaking Shop has three 10-tonne EAPs and the No. 3
SteeLmaing Shop has three - 20 tome EAFs. None of theses f .inces are
equipped with air pollution controls.
The new EAF will utilize second hole evacuation and these fiumes will be ducted to
a baghouse. Emissions from the refining firnace will be ehasted to an EAF
baghouse. The torch cutting of the continuous cast billet wil be exhasted directly
to the atmosphere. The boiler emissions will be ducted to a wet scrubber that will
control PM, SO2 and NOx emissions.
The total particulate emissions from the ten Small EAFs and related facilities at
the existing plant are more than 20 times greater than particulate emissions from
the new facilities.

4.3.6. Meteorological Data for the Chongqing Area
A five year fiequency distribution (1988-1992) of wind speed, wind dircion and
stablity clss was prepared by the meteorological office in Chongqing. These data
were used by the CISDI in the Chongqing dispersion model to predict anwal
average concentrations of SO2    . These same data were also used in the
ISCLT2 model.
4.3.7 Air Quality Impact of the Proposed Project
The CISDI used a dispersion model approved by both the Chongqing and the
Chinese Environmental Protection Bureaus. This is a gaussian model and contains
algorithms for complex terrain and particle settling. The model was modified for
dispersion conditions in the Chongqing area based on the results of wind tumld
studies. The documentation and users guide for this model has not ben
translated; therefore, a model approved by the U. S. EPA was used to verifr the
results of the Chongqing dispersion model. The Industrial Source Complex Long-
Term (ISCLT2) model was used to evaluate the air quality impact of emissions
from the eisting plant and the proposed new facilities. ISCLT2 is also a gaussian
model that contains several options. The model is capable of handling multiple
sources, including point, volume and area sources. Source emission rates can be
treated as constant throughout the modeling period, or may be varied by month,
season, hour of the day, or other optional periods of variation. Multiple receptor

networks can be specified in a single run, including a mix of Cartesian and Polar
coordinates.
The ISCLT2 model was used to evaluate three scenarios: (1) Air quality impact of
the existing sources on the area outside of the existing plant and at the new site;
(2) The air quality associated with locating the new EAF and related fcilities at
the existing site; and (3) The improvements in air quality at the existing site if the
new EAF is located at the new site, and the degradation in air quality to areas
surrounding the new site.
The ISCLT2 model was executed using the same source input and meteorological
data that was used in the Chongqing model. The input data and the receptor
network are listed along with the TSP and S02 concentrations in Appendix A.
The predicted NOx, SO2 and TSP concentrations at the monitoring site located
near the existing plant (Shuangbei) and new site (Ban Bian lie) are listed below.
These concentrations are due to emissions from sources that will be idled at
CSSCs existing plant. The measured annual average NOx, SO2 and TSP
concentrations at each site, as determined from the 1991, 1992 and 1994
monitoring data (see Table 4-4), are also listed.
Predicted annual average TSP concentrations due to emissions from the sources
that are scheduled to be shutdown at the existing CSSC Plant are shown in Figure
7. Figure 8 shows the annual average TSP concentrations due to operation of the
new 100-tonne EAF and associated facilities if they were to be installed at the
existing plant and Figure 9 illustrates the impact if the new ficilities are installed at
the new site. Figure 8 shows the significant improvement in air quality that would
take place due to the shutdown of the ten EAFs at the existing plant and replacing
these furnaces with the 100 tonne EAF. This decrease in TSP concentrations is
approximately 99 percent. Installation of the new EAF at the new site would
result in a negligible increase in TSP concentrations (see Figure 9) at the new site
and a significant improvement in air quality at the existing plant. A complete
listing of the ISCLT2 modeling results are contained in Appendix B. The
modeling results for NOx and SO0 are also presented in Appendix B. Results of
the ISCLT2 model predictions for these two pollutants are presented in Figures 10
through 15.
Figures A-13 and A-20 are reproduced from the Environmental Assessment (see
Annex A) and present the annual average TSP concentrations predicted by the
Chongqing dispersion model for the sources at CSSCs existing plant and the new
6324R

site, respectively. These model predictions are similar to those presented in
Figures 7 and 9. Based on this comparison, the Chongqing and ISCLT2 dispersion
model predictions are comparable and both models indicate that a significant
improvement in air quality will result when the 10 existing EAFs are idled and the
new 100 tonne EAF becomcs operational.
Figures 10, 11 and 12 present the annual average SO2 concentrations for the three
sccnarios. There will be a net decrease in SO2 concentrations of 95 percent when
the existing sources are idled and the new EAF comes on-line (see Figues 10, 11
and 12).
Figures 13, 14 and 15 are the annual average NOx model predictions for the three
scenarios. The decrease in NOx concentrations will be approximately 20 prcent
Although there is a net increase in NOx emissions from the new boiler, the stack
height of this boiler is greater than the three boilers that are scheduled to be
shutdown; therefore, ground level NOx concentrations are less.
Table 4-9 lists the NOx, S02 and TSP ISCLT2 model predictions at the Shuangbei
and the Ban Bian Jie monitoring sites due to emissions from the sources that are
scheduled to be shutdown at the existing site.

*    ^ISCL2 model predictions at the Shuangbei (Eisting Plant) and Ban Bian
Jae (New Site) monitoring sites due to emissions from the three steebnaing
shops at the existing plant.
** Shuangbei monitoring station is near CSSC's existing plant ad the Ban
Bian Jie monitoring station is at the new site.
The measured annual averages for these three pollutants at both moritoring
stations are also listed (see Table 4-4). The model predictions provide an estimate
of the percent contribution to air quality at each station. Emissions from these
sources at the eisting CSSC plant have a significant impact at the Shuangbei
monitoring station but only a slight impact at the Ban Bian Fie station. Absent
these emissions, the annual average NOx, SO2 and TSP concentrations would be
reduced as follows:

The estimated background concentration was obtained by subtracting the ISCLT2
model prediction at the monitoring station from the measured concentration (see
Table 4-4) at that station. This value represents the estimated ambient background
concentration due to emissions from all sources except the No. 1, 2 and 3
Steelmaldng Shops at CSSCs existing plant.
If the estimated bawkound concentrtions listed above are added to the predicted air
quait  impacts due to emismons from the new f&ities, then an estmate of the
ambient air quality after the new facilities go into operation can be obtained. These
ambient air quality levels assm=e that no chnge in emissions from other sources rill

4.4 Disposal of Industrial Wastes
During production, a large amount of raw materals, fuel and auxiliary mneuials
such as scrap, pig iron, fuel, and refactories are required. Production of special
steel g8entes a large amount of solid waste such as slag, coal ash, scale, and
waste refiatories.
4.4.1 Impact of Solid Waste Disposal at the Existing Plant
Ofthe solid waste generated only 19.5% is utilized. Becas of this low rate more
tha 700,000 tonnes have been stored since CSSC began operation. The majority
of the slag which was discarded in the slag yard came from the three stecmaking
plants, account for 86.4% of the total dirgeu, second to which is coal slag and
waste rectories. The slg may be divided into oxide slag and reducing slag the
main componots of which are indicated in Table 4-10 as follows:
Table 4-10 Component of
Item    SiO,  A1203   COO          P     I   MPO   Cr*  VA _0,

Analysis of the components of the slag indicates that the slag contains some
poisonous elements such as P, Crl, Mn, V, W, etc..
(a) Conditions of the aesting slag yard
The aesting slag yard of CSSC is situated on the west bank of Jialing River, east
of the exsting plant area and 100m from the low water level line o f the rJalg
River. The slag yard is about 500m in length, 20m in width and about 20m in
depth. During the flood season, the bottom of the slag yard is inundated in the
flood water and water frmm drenching and diolving flows out ofthe slag piles.
(b) Slag drenching and dissolving test
In order to understand how the water from drenching and dissolving generatd by the
natural rain water passing through the slag piles affects the surface water, drenching
and dissolving.ater simulation tests slag samples are carried out in the laboratory.
024R



PROJECT 45E9                                                  SECTION 4
Page 46
Samples were prepared in accordance with the slag discharge ratio of oxide slag
and reducing slag in the actual smelting process. For the test, different conditions
were considered according to the rainfall intensity, water temperature, and pH
value of the rain water. The test results show that:
* Cr, P, and W are dissolved more in low temperature than in high temperature;
only the amount of V dissolved increases as the temperature rises.
* drenching & dissolving of pH value of 2.5-7 was simulated to find out the effect
on the above four elemnents Cr and P are dissolved less as the pH value
increases, while the amounts of V and W dissolved increase as the pH value
rises.
* According to the accumulated results of the Drenching & dissolving tests, the
amounts of Cr, P. V, W, that are dissolved decreases gradually as the
frequency of repeated rain drenching increases.
-  Usually Cr dissolved in water represents itself as Cr*3 and Cr". Sampling
analysis by drenching and dissolving at different water-slag ratios indicates that
Cr" makes up 0.50-0.61% of the total. It can be seen that the content of Cr"6
is very small compared with the dissolved Cr.
- Based on the results of the drenching & dissolving test, the amounts of the
harmfiul elements in the water from drenching & dissolving in the slag yard
are shown in Table 4-11.

According to the above Table, the concentration of Cr+, the most poisonous is far
lower than the standard value for surface water environmental quality of Class m
water zones, that of P is also lower than the standard for Class HI water zones.
The effect on the environment by the existing slag yard of CSSC is mainly on
silting up the river course.
4.4.2 Impact of Solid Waste Disposal After the Proposed Project is Completed
After the completion of the proposed project when the existing No. I Steelnmakdng
Plant, No.2 Steelmnaking Plant, No.3 Steelmaldng plant are removed, slag wil not

PROJECT  45E9                                                  SECTION 4
Page 47
be produced and the amount of coal ash and other solid wastes will be slightly
reduced. The total amount of discharges will be reduced by 31511 tla of solid
waste (slag, scale, coal ash) ; however, only 2,965 t/a which wil be stored in the
slag yard of the proposed site.
According to the above analysis of solid waste discharges, after the proposed
project is completed 62,963 t/a of solid waste will be generated 39%/o more than in
the existing plant, but the reuse rate will rise from 19.7h/a to 87.4% and the amount
of the discharged will be reduced by 78.3%. Approximately 40,000 tonnes of slag
and 2,102t of scale generated from the proposed plant will be all reused, and the
ate of reusing coal ash will reach 75%.  Furthermore, the proposed slag
processing plant, with a capacity of lO0,OOOtta, will process part of the slag in the
existing slag yard, gradually reduce its amount, thus bettering the sociaL economic
and environmental benefits.
(C) Conclusions
The proposed slag yard is enclosed by mountains on three sides. To ensure
stability of the slag, flood-relief ducts will be laid down on the bottom of the
mountain valleys while solid waste will be piled up and sorted to allow reuse of all
the solid waste. Watering and other dust reduction be taken for the pulverized
coal ash during transportation. For the slag processing plant in the proposed slag
yard, al the slag from production will be processed and reused, the waste water
from slag boiling wil be neutralized and settled for recirculation. No waste water
will be discharged from slag yard. Because the proposed slag yard is out of way
and the water pumps for production are installed with buffers, the noise generated
will not have great effect on the surroundings.
Extensive measures have been fully considered to reuse the solid waste for the
proposed project, all the scale, slag and a large amount of coal ash will be reused
allowing the future elimination of the exsting slag yard and recovery of slag, thus
bettering the social, economic and environmental benefits.
4.5   Noise and Noise Abatement
The three exsting steelmalig shops of CSSC are located near the center of the plant
and are removed from residential areas.  Noise from these facilities does not
significanty impact these residential areas.
6324R



PROJECT  45E9                                                   SECTION 4
Page 48
The new site is located on the .mgkou Farm  North ofthe proposed plant boundary is
fSnlnand and to the northeast and south are reidential areas. The maling Riv form
th southeast border of the plant bounduy. Noise from the proposed new facilties is
not exeted to significandy impact any existing residential areas. The proposed
project will iclude the construction of modem housing for plant persomnl and otd
significa improvements to the surrounding areas. This will also help to nitigate the
effect of any plant geneated noise in the new residental areas.
The proposed slag processing plant will be sheltered on three sides by hhr  trrai
thus reducing the fiequency of enissions due to wind-blown dust.  Dust control
meres such as water sprays will be utilized to reduce emissions during slag cUsbing
and screening operations A drain field wil be installed in the slag yard and the slag
quench water will be collected, neutrlzed, and recycled.
The management of solid wastes at the proposed new facilities will resul in a ruch
higher reuse rate of waste materials and a significant decrease in the amount of wates
disposed. The Jialing River will not be impacted by these disposal pracices. Additonal
infonation regarding tne generaton, processing, reuse and disposal of sold wastes is
contained in Annex A.
4.6  Environental Impact During the Construction Period
4.6.1 Atmospheric Environment
Exhaust emissions from heavy equipment operations during site preparation and
erection of the new facilities will not have    adverse affects on air quality. Dust
generated during earth moving operations will mainly fall out on the proposed site
and little is expected to be transported off site. The air quality impact of the
construction phase will not be significant and when the project is finished this
condition will be eliminated.
4.6.2 Surface Water Environment
Water utilization and discharge during construction period will be related to
washing of the buildings and structures, washing of the construction vehicles, and
surface munoff due to heavy rain in excavated areas.
In order to avoid or reduce any adverse impacts to the environment during project
construction, the construction unit will enhance the management of the
6324R



PROJECT  46E9                                                SECTION 4
Page 49
construction process, when maintaining and washing the buidings and structures.
Contucdon waste water collection will be adopted to avoid the water flow into
th rulding River. An area will be established for washing the coucton vehicles
and the waste water will be collcted and settled. In order to prevnt solid erosion
during civil work, measures wi be taken to control runoff and erosion.
4.6.3 Audio Noise
Equipment to be used during constuction will include font-end loade,
bulldozers, heavy roller compactors, cement mixers, pile drivers and tnportion
veidles. Explosives will also be used on a limited basis. Construction noise
during ni8ht time has a greater impact on surrounding communities Therfe,
explosives wiI be used during the daytime. Construction within 200m from the
plant's boundary shall be carried out in day time as much as possible, and during
the night only those construction activities which produce little noise will be
arried out.
Due to the constucton activity vehicle transportation, loose cement work, etc.,
the dust content of the surrounding atmosphere of the construction project wil
increase The dust generated may increase in summer which is dry and hot.
The constuction yard and huge temporary facilities for construction are located
within the range of the project's expropriated area. Transportation is mainly by
vehicles usmg the ensting roads and temporary construction roads. The shoveling
amount is a bit less tian loading amount, so only a small quantity of solid and
stone wil be traported on extemal roads. Thus the noise due to the increase
traffic will not affect the resident's health. The noise of the contuction tools
within the yard will affect the dwelling region of Jmgkou, and if the construction
proceeds at night, the residents near the construction yard will affected by the
noise.
4.6.4 Public health
Since the water drainage system will not be completed during construction,
saniary sewage and garbage may be discharged in the construction yard, breeding
of mosquitoes and flies.  Dises spread by these insects may affect the
construction workers.
To minimize health effects in cetain areas discharging methods will be established
for sanitary sewage drainage, and sanitary garbage storage. Health supervision

will be enhanced and including inspection of the work yard, disinfect and
etnguish mosquitoes and flies to reduce the occurrence spreading of disease.
The construction will destroy the vegetation in the excavated areas of the
construction. The orange trees and crops and other vegetation and trees in
Jingkou Farn and the construction yard will be removed. During the construction
period, the measure shall be taken to minimize soil erosion and surfice water
nmoff and avoid damage to the ecological envirornent.
4.7   Impact ofthe Proposed Pmject on Living Quality
The new fcilities will be constructed on the Jinkou Farm site. Appoximtely 1100
fam worker abodes will be replaced with new and greatly inproved housing units.
The new residential area will be constructed in the northwest corner ofthe Jrkou Fam
site. According to the project plan, the new abodes will be desgd to   -r wi
the cuart domestic faet standard These housng unts wil contai a water sup,
electic power, natural gas, a dranage system that is connected to a smitay
watewater tratment facility.
4.8 Impact on Social Environmental
The effect on the socal envronment due to the shutdown of the ten asting EAF's
and the instalation and operation of the new faciities at the proposed new site wil be
evaluated in terms of land utility, xndustial developme  infist,ucue public utilitie,
agniltural development, employment opportunity and livnng quality.

Nad "-" represents unfavrable effect.
According to this table, the eiing production activities have imposed serio
unfavorable effects on the social evironment, and the &vorable dects have bee
nininil.
Since its establiuet from  1960's, CSSC has not had sufficient investment
capital to modeniize and replace equiipment.
The existing buildings and facilities are old, and consume large quantities of energy
and raw materials and this leads to a waste of resources. Among the 10 smal
EAF's and small coal boiters for the existing three steelmaking plants, only two
EAF's were installed with dedusting sytems. All the remaining facilities are not
equipped with air polution controls. Only the waste water genemted for the CCM
of No. I Stedmaldag Plant was tred, and all the other wastewater was
discharged directly into Jialing River. No measures have been taken to control the
noise generated from production activities. A large amount of the solid waste
produced fxom production activities was poorly reused and the solid waste was
discarded on the bank of fialing River, silting up the river course, which has

The existing Jigkou Farm is used maily for frint tree cultivation, fish frming,
breeding and dairy cow raising, i ng an area of 600 nm (I mu-0.06 hecare)
planted with fiuit trees (mandarin oranges), an area of 10) mu bred with fish
farning and 500 dairy cows. The farmers are self-employed individuas and
depend on traditional manual labor supplied by the family unit For this reason,
productivity is low and economic benefits are poor.
The existing public utilities at the new site include a domestic water treatment
plant, taking in water from Jialing River, with a capacity of 160 m3h. This
treatment plant cannot meet the demand for treated water. One substation
supplies electric power for living and production at the farm and this substation

cannot satis  the requirements for power consumption of peak power
requirements. One natural gas supply and distribution station can only supply
natural gas for 50°ho of all the farm houses.
Jingkou Farm is far from the densely populated area of Shapingba and the land is
appropriate for industrial applications.
The proposed project of CSSC is to be located at Jingkou Farm. The Farm was
merged into CSSC in 1992 and preliminary land preparation work is being carried
out. Within the proposed plant area, the rock and soil layers are stable, without
any disadvantageous geological conditions such as landslides, collapse,
underground caves and large cracks. The engineering geological conditions within
the area are good for the establishment of a new plant.
4.8.3 Analysis of the Effect on the Social Environment during Production
After the proposed project is completed and put into production and the existing
three steelmaking plants are removed, the environmental quality of the existg
plmt area and its surroundings will be obviously improved. The total emission
amount of T.S.P. will drop from 3024t1a to 517t/a, so the atmospheric
eavironmental quality will be significantly improved. For the above reasons, the
ef:ct on the social environment is clearly favorable.
The unfavorable effect by the project on the social environment mainly includes: a
portion of land will be for disposal of solid waste and materials as storage for slag
transportation of raw materials and products during production will impose certain
pressures on the local traffic transportation conditions, but the effect is anticipated
to be negligible. It is suggested that a new slab brick making plant be set up to
make extensive use of the coal slag from the proposed boilers when the proposed
project is completed. Other effects on the social environment will be minimized by
intensifying the management of production.
4.9  Impact on the Ecological Environment
4.9.1 Air Pollutant Emissions from the Existing Plant
Pollutant discharges from steelmaking facilities at the existing plant have a
negligible impact on the ecological environments in the Gele Mountain and
Jiangbei Farm areas. Plant damage has been associated with elevated sul&r
6324R



PROJECT  45E9                                               SECIION 4

dioxide concentrations in the ambient air. Emissions of SO2 from the eisting steel
maldng facilities                       represent a very small faction of
the total emissions in the Shapingba District. Therefore, the impact on ambient air
quality due to SO2 emission from the existing plant will effect the ar quality in the
Gele Mountain and Jiangbei Farm areas.
4.9.2 Wastewater Discharges from the Existing Plant
The waste water effluents discharged from the existng s utelakig plant ae
mainly oil and COD .
When the oil and COD are discharged to the Jrling River, they directly affect the
normal breathing and metabolism of the fish and other aquatic species and cause
destruction of plankton. When the waterbody is affected by heavy metal element,
not only does the Heavy metal discharges in the waste water directly affect the
aquatic life and the poisonous element can also transmit and be stored in the food
chain and this is harmfil to many living thins including hliuman beings. From above
we can see, when the water body is poliuted, the harm range is quite large and the
harm degree is rather high.
Wastewater discharges to the Jialing River from the exsting sdemaing plant
coupled with the exsting water quality results in acceedances of the environmental
and fishery water quality standard.
4.9.3 Solid Waste Disposal from the Existing Plant
Shutdown of these facilities using the water quality of the Jialing River
downstream of the plant.
The solid waste of steelmaking production is sent to the old plant slag yard located
on the west bank of the Jaling River. The concentration and amount of harmful
elements in the leachate from slag storage piles that discharges into the Jling
River are far below the discharging standard, however, it does increase the
concentration of these effluents and may be harmful to the fish in Jialing River.
The solid wastes remain in the River and thus affect the living environment of the
river.

4.9.4. Air PollutahtEmissioni from the Proposed Facilities
Background SO2 concentration in the vicinity of the proposed new site and SO2
emissions from the new facility will be less than the existing plant. Therefore, the
impact on the ecological environment is expected to be negligible.
4.9.5 Effluent Discharges from the Proposed Facilities
Waste water discharged forn the proposed facilities will be significantly less than
at the existing facilities. However, discharges of oil  may impact aquatic
species in the rlig River. After carrying out the proposed project, the 0.050mg1l
of oil concentration will range from exit to 400m down stream, from coast to 5-
i5m toward middle river. Within this range, the oil will do harm to fish in riing
River. Some discharges of COD will not harm the fish in the rilini River.
4.9.6 Solid Waste Disposal from the Proposed Facilities
The new slag yard wiH be located south of Tongyougou in rmgkou, which is
encosed on the south, north and west by Zhongliang Mountains. Flood drainage
pipelines will be installed at the bottom of this slag gard. Comprehensive reuse of
the solid waster will result in less storage and a decrease in the quantity of
discharge leachate. Therefore, the slag yard will have little effect on the ecological
environment.

Public Opinion Survey
With the help of the People's Congress and the universities and schools in the
region, a written survey will be distributed to obtain the opinions of workers,
teachers, parents and students.
Public Meetings
Representatives from the People's Congress of the Shapingba District and
members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress -will be invited to
attend meetings. They will answer questions, present their personal opinions and
solicit the opinions of the public. The public meeting took place on March 7, 1995.
6.3  RESULT OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
6.3.1 Statistical Result of Public Opinion Investigation
Two hundred copies of the public opinion survey were sent out and all of them
were returned. All the investigated people are residents in Shangbei Region (see
Table 6-1). Among those being investigated, 23.5% are living around the existing
plant location of Chongqing Special Steel Co. and 76.5% are living around the
proposed location of the new plant in rmgkou.
Results of the survey are shown on Table 6-2. Regarding the shutdown of CSSC
steel makdng facilities, 92% support the plan, 1% show concern, 2.5% have no
interest and 4.5% oppose the plan. The reason for the objection is that they are
concerned that the new plant may cause envirorunental pollution at the new
location since the existing steel-making plants have had environmental pollution.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The existing site has a large population density and is in a heavily industrialized
area of the Shapingba District. The new site is approximately 5 km north of the
exsting plant and is less populated. The elevation of the existing site averages 210
meters (m) and the new site elevation ranges from 196 m to 215 m. The terrain in
both areas is hilly. The Jiating River (elevation of approximately 165 m) meanders
north-south past both sites and the terrain slopes from 300 to 500 m on either side
of the river. Wmd flow at low levels (500 m or less) is dominated by this river
valley and the predominant wind directions are north-northwest and northwest.
7.1 Air Quality
The existing plant operates ten small  EAFs and three coal-fired boilers. The
No. 1 and 2 EAFs at the No. 1 Steelmaking Shop have canopy hoods to capture
particulate emissions. The capture efficiency of these hoods is approximately 40
*              percent according to CSSC personnel. The eight remaining furnaces and the three
coal-fired boilers are not equipped with pollution controls.
Replacement of the ten EAFs and the tfree boilers with the 100-tonne EAF and a
new boiler will greatly reduce air pollutant emissions. Air quality in the vicinity of
the existing plant will greatly improve after these facilities are shut down and the
air quality impact due to operation of the new I 00-tonne EAF and related facilities
will have no significant change. This is due to the installation of "state-of-the art"
air pollution controls.

Page 2
7.2 Surface Water Quality
The magjority of sanitary and industrial wastewater in the Shuangbci and Shapingba
areas are discharged to the Jialing River without treatment. This river is also the major
source of industnial and drinking water for the Shapingba District. The annual average
flow rate is 69.41 billion cubic meters and the average concentration of suspended
solids is 2.37 kg/mrn3.
The total volume of industrial wastewater discharged to the Jialing River fiom sources
located in the Shuangbei and Shapingba areas is approximately 42.6 million cubic
meters (i3 ) per year. CSSC discharges the greatest amount of CODs (cheiical
oxygen demand) and oil. The total COD discharged per year is 4,894 tonnes and CSSC
steelmaking discharges approximately 342.31 tomnes, or 7 percent of the totaL Total oil i
discharged is 446 tonnes per year and CSSC steehnaking discharges 60 65 tonmes, or 14
percent of the total. The total fiesh water for the existing plant is 7,909,500m3 per year and
the expected fresh water for the new plant is 5,170,000 m3 per year, a decrease of 35 percent.
Except for pretreatment of the conrnuous caster water, there is no sanitary or industrial
wastewater treatment at the existing plant and the water recycle rate for the caster is only 22
percent. The new plant will contain both sanitary and industial wastewater teament
facilities and the recycle rate. for industrial water usage nll increase to 92 percent The
industrial wastcwater ranent system will conurol suspended solids, oil and COD; the
sanitary system will control suspended solids and BOD (biological oxygen demand). It is
expected dtat the quality of the water discharged to. the Jialing River from the wastwater
trcatment systems will meet the applicable Chinese standard.
7.3    Noise and Noise Abatement
The three existing steelmaking shops of CSSC are located near the center of the plant
and are removed from  residential areas   Noise from  these facilities does not
significantly impact these residential areas.
The new site is located on the Jingkou Farm. North of the proposed plant boundary is
fariland and to the northeast and south are residenal areas. The Jialing River forms
the southeast border of the plant boundary. Noise from the proposed new facilities is
not expected to significantly impact any existing residential areas. The proposed
project will include the construction of modern housing for plant personnei and other
significant improvements to the surrounding areas. This will also help to mitigate the
effect of any plant generated noise in the new residential areas.

Page 3
More detailed analyses of the expected impact on the surrounding environment due to
noise generated by the new facilities are contained in Annex A.
7.4  Solid Wastes
Production of specialty steel at the existing site is accompanied by the production of
solid waste, such as oxide and reducing slag, scale, coal ash and waste refrctories.
The majority of the slag is stored along the west bank of the Jialing River and as the
storage pile increases in height, the slag pile becomes unstable and slips into the river.
It is estimated that 700.000 tomes of slag have been produced by the three steialdng
shops. Slag accounts for.84 percent of the total solid waste produced and less than one
pent is reused. Of the total solid waste produced, 19.5 percent is reused and this is
mainly scale.
When the new 100 tome EAF goes mto operation, approximately 63,000 tonnear
of solid waste will be produced.  This represents an increase over the eistig
stehnaking failties of 39 percent, however, 87 percent of this amount will be rused
and the amount disposed will be reduced by 78 percent. It is anticipated that 40,000
tonnes of slag and 2,100 tonnes of scale generated at the new plant will be reused and
up to 75 percent of the coal ash will also be reused. Furthermore, the proposed slag
pocessing plant with a capacity of 100,000 tonnestyear, will process the slag at the
eisting plant and thereby gradually reduce the amount stored. This will also reduce
the amount of slag that is inadvertently discharged into the raling River.
The proposed slag processing plant will be sheltered on three sides by higher tem*
thus reducing the frequency of emissions due to wind-blown dust.  Dust control
measures such as water sprays will be utilized to reduce emissions durng slag crushing
and screming operations. A drain field will be installed in the slag yard and the slag
quench water wil be collected, neutralized, and recycled.
The management of solid wastes at the proposed new facilities wil result in a nmch
higher reuse rate of waste materials and a significant decrease in the amount of wastes
disposed. The Jialing River will not be impacted by these disposal practices. Additional
informaion regarding the generation, processing, reuse and disposal of solid wastes is
contained in Annex A.

7.5 Impact of the Proposed Project on Living Quality
The new facilities will be constructed on the Jinkou Farm site. Approxinately
1100 farm worker abodes will be replaced with new and greatly improved housing
units. The new residential area will be constructed in the northwest comer of the
Jinkou Farm site. According to the project plan, the new abodes will be designed
to comply with the current domestic flatlet standard. These housing units will
contain a water supply, electric power, natural gas, a drainage system that is
connected to a sanitary wastewater treatment facility.
The Jinkou Farm workers that are displaced by the proposed project will become
ernployees of CS SC. These workers will reside in the new residential area and will
be eligible to all the benefits associated with employment by CSSC. These
workers will receive training so they can acquire the skills necessary to perform
their new jobs efficiently.
The quality of the environment in the vicinity of the Jinkou Farn will not
deterorate when the new facilities come on line. "State-of-the-art" air and water
pollution controls will insure that no degradation in air or water quality Will occur.
The shutdown of the 10 EAFs and three coal-fired boilers at the existing site will
greatly improve the enviromnental quality in the vicinity of this plant.
