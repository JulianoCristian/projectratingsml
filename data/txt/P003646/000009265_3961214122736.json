reform and technological restructuring. Moreover, the\n            project supports the government of China's efforts to\n            help relatively underdeveloped regions in the interior catch\n            up with the country's faster growing coastal areas. To\n            achieve these objectives, the project will help Chongqing\n            municipality (CM) to: 1) achieve a significant reduction in\n            pollution and restructure productive facilities from its\n            most polluting industry, iron and steel; 2) establish a\n            strategy and prepare a long-term plan to achieve a major\n            reduction in pollution for the whole industrial sector by,\n            inter alia, increasing the effectiveness of CM's\n            environmental regulatory framework and pollution management\n            capability; and 3) initiate a pilot effort to assist\n            industrial enterprises in other industrial sectors to\n            restructure their productive facilities, control pollution\n            and transform themselves into modern corporations. The\n            project will include the following components: 1) support\n            for development and implementation of economic and\n            environmental policy agendas and action plans; 2) relocation\n            of the city's two major polluting steel mills; 3)\n            restructuring of advisory facilities for industrial\n            enterprises; 4) a line of credit to support a pilot program\n            in industrial enterprise reform, pollution control and\n            restructuring; and 5) technical assistance to strengthen\n            environmental regulation, surplus labor reemployment and\n            innovation in state asset management."}, "docdt": "1996-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
