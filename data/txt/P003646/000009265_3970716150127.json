Special Steel Company\n            (CSSC) is located in a very densely populated area in the\n            city of Chongqing in Sichuan Province.  The steel making\n            facilities are a major source of air and water pollution and\n            are scheduled to be shutdown in 1996-1998.  As part of the\n            Chongqing Industrial Reform and Pollution Control Project, a\n            modern steelmaking plant capable of complying with accepted\n            environmental standards will be constructed.  The project is\n            composed of production and supplementary equipment which\n            include scrap processing, electric furnace steelmaking,\n            refining furnace, continuous casting, steel slag processing\n            and oxygen station, boiler station, compressed air station\n            and water processing.  The pollution sources produced by the\n            new facilities are waste gas, waste water, solid waste, air\n            power and machine noises.  This report is an environmental\n            assessment of the project.  Its environmental impacts\n            include impacts on the ecological and social environment,\n            and living quality.  The impacts may be caused by site\n            selection, potential accidents, activities during the\n            construction period, and normal operation of the new\n            facilities.  The results of the environmental impact\n            assessment show that: 1) the new facilities will have a\n            slight effect on air quality at any location; and 2) when\n            the existing plant is shutdown, air quality in the area near\n            the plant will be significantly improved by decreased\n            concentrations of Nox, SO2 and TPS."}, "docdt": "1995-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
