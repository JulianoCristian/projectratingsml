meet power demands, the second phase\n            of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant Project will increase\n            generating capacity by constructing two coal-fired\n            supercritical units. A third and final phrase of installing\n            additional capacity will follow. This environmental\n            assessment was prepared to supplement an earlier draft\n            report submitted by the East China Electric Power Design\n            Institute (ECEPDI) to further address the impacts of the\n            project, particularly as they relate to current and future\n            power production at the Waigaoqiao facility. Mitigation of\n            air pollution takes the form of emissions controls and\n            emissions offsets. A high-efficiency electrostatic\n            precipitator (ESP) will be installed to reduce particle\n            emissions from the plant to acceptable levels. Particle\n            emissions from coal and ash handling and storage activities\n            will be controlled by using covered conveyors, watering, and\n            air pollution control equipment. The dust control program\n            from Phase I will continue to minimize emissions from\n            general traffic. Bottom ash will be slurried with recycled\n            water eliminating dusting conditions. Fly ash disposed of in\n            an ash yard will be humidified, reducing the potential for\n            fugitive particulate emissions. Sulphur dioxide emissions\n            will be mitigated by using low-sulphur coal. Emissions of\n            nitrogen oxides will be mitigated by using low-nitrogen\n            oxide- derivative burners, a technology incorporated into\n            modern boiler designs. Mitigation of negative impacts on\n            water resources includes: wastewater treatment using\n            neutralization and sedimentation; oil-separation employed\n            for water with the potential for oil contamination; cooling\n            water treated with chlorine for biological control to\n            minimize chlorine residue; treated wastewater will be\n            discharged with cooling water at predetermined dilution\n            percentages; other low volume wastewaters such as\n            oil-contaminated water, boiling cleaning wastewater, and\n            bottom ash sluice water will be recycled after treatment;\n            rainwater in the ash yards will be diverted to the settling\n            basins at sufficient capacity to obviate the need for\n            discharge; and non-contact rainfall runoff will go to\n            settling ponds for discharge. Ash disposal will be mitigated\n            by its reuse. Impacts associated with resettlement will be\n            mitigated according to World Bank operational directives and\n            the country s relevant laws and regulations, and possibly\n            include job replacement and/or compensation. Finally, the\n            comprehensive monitoring program for Phase I, which measures\n            the air, water, ash, and occupational conditions, will\n            continue in Phase II during both construction and\n            operational periods. Specifically, during construction,\n            environmental monitoring of dust emissions, runoff, and\n            solid wastes will be performed. Any construction discharge\n            will be monitored for pH, total suspended solids, and other\n            parameters. Noise; emissions and ambient air quality; the\n            quality of raw water, service water, and wastewater\n            discharged to the environment; and periodic safety training\n            and the use of primary personnel protection measures will be monitored."}, "docdt": "1997-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
