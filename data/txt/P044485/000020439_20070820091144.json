"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the China Waigaoqiao Thermal\n            Power Project were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was low or negligible, the\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: (i) strong borrower commitment; (ii) comprehensive\n            planning for engineering, equipment supply, installation,\n            and commissioning; and (iii) close field supervision by a\n            competent owner that identified and rectified problems in a\n            timely manner are key factors for a complex project such as\n            this one. This project and other recently completed power\n            projects in China show that construction management was\n            successfully performed by the implementing agencies. Also,\n            the project was explicitly designed to pilot new approaches\n            to meet environmental requirements at minimum cost,\n            restructuring the power sector, and utilizing private sector\n            finance. Piloting has been the feature characteristic of\n            Chinese reforms. Finally, several positive, systemic lessons\n            for Bank supervision were identified in the QAG review: (a)\n            an experienced, knowledgeable, and cohesive team is\n            beneficial to project implementation; (b) continuity is\n            important in ensuring effective supervision and establishing\n            good rapport with counterparts; and (c) supervision of\n            multiple projects in the same country or sector by the same\n            team is cost-effective."}, "docdt": "2007-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
