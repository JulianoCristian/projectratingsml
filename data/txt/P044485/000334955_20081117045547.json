The quality of supervision\n            throughout this final period of project implementation i.e.\n            the seventh and eighth years since Board approval, was\n            pragmatic, well-focused and solutions-oriented. Almost all\n            the main development objectives have now been\n            achieved-namely, the commissioning of two large, coal-fired\n            thermal plants-despite an extensive delay at start up; the\n            adoption of the \"bubble concept\" approach to\n            controlling atmospheric pollution for the first time in the\n            developing world, despite initial skepticism by the company\n            and some local authorities; a reform program for the power\n            company that went beyond that envisaged at appraisal; and\n            the successful mobilization of financing for the power\n            sector from international markets. Several positive,\n            systemic lessons for Bank supervision more generally emerge\n            from this review. First, the project benefited from an\n            experienced supervision team that knew the power sector in\n            China very well. Second, continuity in Bank staff working on\n            a project is important in ensuring good supervision. The\n            supervision team was also cohesive; all the members had a\n            deep institutional knowledge of the power sector in China\n            and have been working as a team on other projects. The\n            supervision results demonstrate the team's high\n            professionalism and the good rapport and working\n            relationship established with their project counterparts."}, "docdt": "2006-08-04T00:00:00Z"}
