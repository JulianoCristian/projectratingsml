This reallocation of\n            project cost savings, is part of the measure proposed in the\n            Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), to ensure effective\n            portfolio management. The agreed revised targets have been\n            largely met, and, remarkable improvements were noted in\n            project implementation after the mid-term review, whereas a\n            recent supervision mission (March 2004) confirmed that with\n            the execution of on-going, and recently awarded works\n            contracts, the development objectives of the Project,\n            including the physical and institutional components will be\n            fully met by the Closing Date of December 31,2004, with an\n            undisbursed amount of about U$S 20 million. These cost\n            savings, are proposed to be reallocated to finance priority\n            investments requiring additional funding under the Flood\n            Protection Project. The existing action plan has been\n            amended to include the new activities, and, is acceptable to\n            the Bank."}, "docdt": "2004-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
