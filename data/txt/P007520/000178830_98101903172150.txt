TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A. OF MEXICO  ITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THl UiITED 152;;ICAN STATES
FOR THE FOURTH ROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$ 21.8 million to
Nacional Financiera, S.A., (Nafin) uith the guar-antee of the United Mexican
'tatas to covor the estimated foraign exchange cost of a road project.
PART I - Historical
2.        Of the twenty-four Bank loans to M4exico, five totalling
$155 million were for highways, of which three were for federal roads (in
1960, 1963 and 1968) and two for toll road transpo-rt (in 1962 and 1965).
The proposed project was appraised by a Bank mission in November 1969.
Negotiations were held from May 13 - 20, 1970. Negotiators from Nafin
were headed by Lic. Pedro Galicia and from the Secretariat of Public
Works by Subsecretary Ing. Rodolfo Felix Valdes.
3.        The proposed loan would increase the Bank's lending to Mexico
to $979 million (net of cancellations). Mexico has received no IDA
credits. The following is a summary of Bank loans to Mexico (as of April
30, 1970):

4.       qSerious delays have occurred in procurement and construction,
and disbursements have been slower than was expected,under the following
irrigation loans: Loan 336-ME of 1963 - construction in one district
had been temporarily postponed while efforts were underway to improve
drainage, increase the supply of water and improve the cropping pattern;
subsequently, construction has been resumed and the Closing Date extended
to June 30, 1971,which should permit complete disbursement of the loan;
Loan 450-ME of 1966 - construction of the distribution system w~as delayed
in order to concentrate efforts on completion of major storage works;
current prospects are that the project may still be completed by the
original Closing Date of March 31, 1972; and Loan 527-ME of 1968 -
effectiveness was delayed 13 months because of problems in reaching agree-
ments with farmers on water charges; progress with the execution of the
project is now satisfactory and full disbursement by the original Closing
Date of June 30, 1975, is expected.  Progress under the following highway
loans has been lagging:  Loan 354-ME of 1963 - the project suffered from
delays in placing contracts and in obtaining local funds, bad weather and
the problem of right-of-way acquisition.  It is now about 95% complete
and will be fully completed this year;  Loan 401-i4E of 1965 - work was
completed early in 1970 but disbursements are lagging because, after
elimination of one of the project roads,the corresponding amounts have
been reallocated but, so far, only partly disbursed; Loan 528-ME of 1968 -
although delays have occurred in making disbursement applications, con-
struction is generally proceeding satisfactorily.
5.        A tourism project is expected to be appraised this summer and
a project for a forest industries complex is under preparation with assist-
ance from the Bank/FAO Cooperative Program.
6.        IFC's total commitments to Mexico had reached $30.5 million by
April 30, 1970, consisting of $8.0 million of operational investments
and $22.5 million standby and underwriting commitments. From these
commitments the Corporation still held $5.4 million on that date, con-
sisting of $2.9 million in loans and $2.5 million in equity.
PART II - Description of the Proposed Loan
7.        Borrower:              Nacional Financiera, S. A., a financial
agency of the Mexican Government which,
under Mexican legislation, has to be the
borrower or co-borrower of Bank loans.
Guarantor:             The United Mexican States.



- 4 -
Amount:                The equivalent in various currencies of
$21.8 million.
Purpose:               To finance the estimated foreign exchange
cost of a program for the improvement of
about 580 kms and the construction of
about 462 kms of federal highways.
Amortization:          25 years, including a 5-year period of
grace; amortization in semi-annual
installments beginning July 1; 1975 to
retire the loan by January 1, 1995.
Interest Rate:         7 percent per annum.
Commitment Charge:     3/4 of 1 percent per annum.
Estimated Economic
Rate of Return:       18 percent per annum.
PART III  - The Project
8.        The appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Fourth Road
Project - Mexico" (PTR-h7a) is attached.
9.        Since the Bank's first road loan to Mexico,    good progress has
been made in developing a modern highway system in the country, and the
length of the federal system has increased from 21,000 kms in 1960 to
27,000 kms in 1968. At the same time the quality of the roads has been
improved and nearly 60 percent of the system is now paved. The project
is a continuation of this process.
lOo       A need exists for further investments in roads and other
transport modes to assist in the continuing rapid growth of the country,
and there is also an increasing need for a well coordinated overall
strategy of transport development. On the request of the Government, a
Bank mission visited Mexico last April to study the transport sector of
the country. Its report is now being prepared. In addition, a special
study is being made of the rate structure of toll roads owned and operated
by the Caminos y Puentes Federales de Ingresos y Servicios Conexos (Caminos);
a governmental agency.
11.       The planning, construction and maintenance of federal roads is
a responsibility of the Secretariat of Public Wlorks. This Secretariat has
a competent staff and extensive experience in highway construction and
maintenance. Expenditure on federal highways over the next seven years
is estimated to be the equivalent of about US$700 million.



- 5 -
12.       The total cost of the project works, including contingencies,
is estimated at the equivalent of about $56.8 million. The proposed
loan of US$21.8 million equivalent consists of $18.8 mlllion represent-
ing the estimated foreign exchange cost of project works, together with
$3 million for interest and other charges on the Bank loan. The balance
of the financing for the project would be provided by the Federal Budget.
Bank disbursements for project works would be made on a percentage basis.
13.       Contracts for the project works would be let on the basis of
international bidding except for approximately $5.8 million of contracts,
constituting about 10 percent of the total cost of project works, for
bridges and miscellaneous works which would be awarded after locally
advertised bidding. This follows the pattern of procurement agreed under
previous loans. The Government has agreed in the case of six roads to
tendering for "packages" of road sections as well as individual road
sections, as explained more fully in paragraph 4.15 of the Appraisal
Report and paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 of the Guarantee Agreement. This
procedure is intended to encourage broader international competitive bid-
ding, reduce costs and improve efficiency in construction.
14e       The project is justified on the basis of substantial resulting
economic benefits, mainly through road user savings arising from the im-
provement of riding surfaces and from shorter routes. In the case of one
project road, a measurable increase of agricultural output is also
expected. The rates of return on the individual roads range from 10 per-
cent to 29 percent, with a weighted average of 18 percent.
PART IV - Legal Instruments and Authority
15.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Nacional
Financiera, S. A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between the United Mexican
States and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article IIi,
Section (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors sepa-
rately.
16.       The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements follow generally the
pattern of the agreements for the previous Mexican road projects.
17.       The financial position of Caminos, the Co-borrower with NAFIN
under loans No, 317-ME and 40l-ME,has been very weak.   Recently, the
Government has taken various steps to deal with the situation and has also
agreed in principle to the rescheduling of Caminos' debt to the Banco Na-
cional de Obras y Servicios Publicos, S.A., a Government-owned bank. In
order to ensure that this action is taken promptly, the Government and the
Bank agreed that rescheduling of that debt be a condition of the effectiveness
of the proposed loan (Section 7.01 of the Draft Loan Agreement).

PART V - The Economy
18.       An economic mission visited Mexico during March-April 1970, and
is at present preparing its report. Its findings generally confirm those
of the report on The Current Economic Position and Prospects of Mexico
EWH-194aa), sent to the Executive Directors in December 1969. During 1969
economic growth continued at a vigorous rate (6.4 percent). Domestic pri-
ces rose by only about 4 percent and the current account deficit of the
balance of payments fell slightly from US$740 million to US$700 million.
F'ternal indebtedness is high: latest estimates (still preliminary) show
a debt service ratio of about 24 percent in 1969.
19.       The Mexican authorities recognize the need to increase both pu-
blic savings and exports. Without such action, external debt is likely to
grow at a rate wqhich would eventually call Mexico's creditworthiness into
question. Although the Government is fully aware of the problem, it is
not likely to take the necessary action in 1970, since there will be a
change of Administration in December of this year. The Government has,
however, taken special measures to avoid excessive public investment in
an election year. It is proposed to have policy discussions with the in-
coming Administration at an early date in the expectation that, as in the
past, the Government of Mexico will demonstrate resolution and flexibility
in mobilizing resources for economic development in a framework of social
stability and institutional continuity. On the basis of this expectation
Mexico can be considered creditworthy for external borrowing on conventional
terms.
PART VI - Compliance with the Articles of Agreement
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles o' Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - Recommendation
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loani.
