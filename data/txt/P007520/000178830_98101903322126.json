Since the Bank's first road\n            loan to Mexico, good progress has been made in developing a\n            modern highway system in the country, and the length of the\n            federal system has increased from 21,000 km in 1960 to\n            27,000 km in 1968. At the same time the quality of the roads\n            has been improved and nearly 60 percent of the system is now\n            paved. The project is a continuation of this process."}, "docdt": "1970-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
