PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2230-TUN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Education Project
in Tunisia, for which Loan 2230-TUN in the amount of US$27 million was approved
on December 23, 1982. This amount was reduced to US$25 million on December 19,
1988. The loan was closed on December 31, 1989, two years behind schedule. The
last payment was made on May 11, 1990. An undisbursed balance of US$4.2 million
was cancelled at that time, thus reducing the loan amount to US$20.8 million.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Operations Division, Country Department II. of the former Europe, Middle East &
North Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) , and
the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during a mission in June 1990, and is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan Agreement; supervision
reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.

REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2230-TUN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.    In support of the Sixth Plan (1982-1986) objectives, the project aimed at
increasing the provision of appropriately trained technical personnel to
agriculture and agro-industry and of primary school teachers. It would do so by:
(i) assisting the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in strengthening and developing
its programs for the dissemination of technical knowledge and skills to local
farming communities and for the upgrading of its extension agents; (ii) improving
the quality of agricultural education; (iii) endowing the MOA with a capability
for manpower and education analysis and planning; (iv) providing didactic and
farm equipment to existing training institutions; (v) constructing and equipping
four primary school teacher training colleges (Ecole normale d'instituteurs,
(ENI) for the Ministry of Education (MOE); and (vi) carrying out a technician
manpower study.
ImBlementation Experience
2.    Startup activities for the three components were eighteen months late: the
MOA component was delayed because the Ministry of National Economy was reluctant
to grant equipment import licences; civil works contracts for the four ENIs were
signed late because of early administrative delays and late engineering studies;
and the technician manpower study started late because of delays in setting up
the inter-ministerial committee responsible for overseeing execution of the
study.
Results
3.    MOA component:   Thanks to the quality and relevance of the equipment
purchased, the institutions supported by the project offer significantly better
teaching conditions. Enrollments and annual outputs are higher than estimated
at appraisal, although some of the projections did not fit the nature and
potential and/or observed performance of the assisted institutions.   It is
unfortunate, however, that the project supported the existing agricultural
training apparatus before carrying out a detailed assessment of its structure.
This assessment was completed in 1988 and raised serious doubts on the cost-
effectiveness of the system. Its main conclusions were that the agricultural
training system is dispersed into too many different levels, specializations, and



- iv -
types of institutions, and therefore seldom reached a critical mass in terms of
teaching staff, class sizes, and infraaztructure. The study stressed the need to
restructure the system to reflect the expected reduced employer role of the
public sector and the larger part the private sector must play.
4.    MOE component:  Enrollments and outputs are markedly lower than projected.
The main contributing factors are: (i) of the four ENIs, only one is fully
operational and one is not yet occupied. The other two are not fully completed;
and (ii) the training of primary school teachers is shifting from the five-year
program in separate training institutions (on the basis of which the ENIs were
built) towards shorter training of more highly qualified candidates, thus
resulting in excess capacity. In spite of some design and construction flaws,
the ENIs are of acceptable design and quality.
5.    Technician manpower study:  Although the whole study was carried out, it
did not result in a useful instrument for the following reasons: (i) little
integration between the tasks, which were assigned to different teams; (ii) the
analysis, based on a highly aggregated macroeconomic model, fails to take into
account specific features of job qualification subsets and of regional labor
markets; and (iii) the main recommendations are supply-driven: they focus
essentially on institutional development of the MOE. Information gathered for
the study could however be used if the analysis were finetuned to integrate
regional labor market specifics.
Sustainability
6.    MOA component:  The implemention unit has devised a number of systems to
ensure acceptable service life of the equipment financed and access to foreign
exchange for spare parts, and to provide equipment to beneficiary institutions.
It has further carried out a survey of best maintenance structure practices and
is about to define a strategy.
7.    MOE component:  In light of the ongoing restructuring of primary school
teacher training, the usefulness of all ENIs is questioned. Eventually, they
will all be converted into other types of training institutions, more adapted to
new training programs. This issue is currently being discussed in the framework
of the FY92 Higher Education Restructuring Project.
FindinRs and Lessons learned
8.    This project suffered from several design and implementation flaws commonly
encountered in Bank projects: delays in obtaining import Licences, late
preparation of engineering studies, late creation of the interministerial
committee to supervise the technician manpower study, late creation of the
project implementing unit in the MOA, and absence of a Bank architect in the
early stages of project implementation. Most newer projects have already drawn
lessons from past experiences and are incorporating a number of measures
(including midterm reviews, as was recommended by the Borrower in the present
case) to ensure timely implementation.
9.    MOA component.  On the whole, the project could have been an opportunity
to initiate a policy dialogue on aspects of agricultural education/training and



- v -
employment.   The Bank has accumulated significant experience in this area.
Instead of consolidation, the project could have focussed on reform. The Bank
contribution could have been not only to support short-term material
improvements, but assist in ensuring long-term conceptual sustainability of
strategic public sector training and employment functions. The overall structure
of the agricultural education/training apparatus is currently being revisited by
interested ministries, on the basis of the study financed by the project. This
should increase the external efficiency and the cost-effectiveness of the system.

closed on May 11. 1990 to permit all
disbursements for committed expenditures.)
B.    Socioeconomic Back_round
1.    The Sixth National Development Plan (1982-1986) was in its final drafting
stage when the Fifth Education Project was under preparation. With regards to
the training sector, the Plan aimed at improving the quality of training and
better matching its content with needs for trained manpower in those priority
investment sectors, particularly agriculture (which accounted for 35% of the
Tunisian workforce).   The  70s had witnessed the emergence of structural
diversification in agricultural production and growing technical sophistication
in farming methods and these new trends were projected to continue during the
next two decades. In consequence, the country was faced with mounting demand for
technically specialized manpower, and embarked on improving the quality of
training provided in agricultural schools as well as slowly shifting its
agricultural training from formal vocational schooling to shorter training, more
adapted to meet the specific technical needs of farmers.
.1/    Final payments were made on May 11, 1990, and an undisbursed amount
of US$4.2 million was cancelled at that time. thus reducing the loan
amount to US$20.8 million.



-2-
2.    In the education sector, the Sixth Plan estimated that, although gross
primary enrollment rate was already 1001, primary school enrollments would grow
annually at 4.61 per year, the result of projected high population growth (2.61
per annum) and increased internal efficiency (by reducing dropout rates). Tunisia
was faced with a severe shortage of qualified primary teachers, the poorer
regions suffering most, the more qualified and experienced teachers preferring
posts in urban areas. Consequently, the Government decided to recruit and train
primary teachers within the disadvantaged areas.
C.    Objectives and DescriDtion of the Proiect
3.    The project was designed to support key Sixth Plan (1982-1986) objectives,
i.e. the provision of needed skills and of appropriately trained, technical
personnel to agriculture and agro-industry; and the expansion and improvement of
primary teacher training. The project would achieve these objectives by:
(a) assisting the Ministry of Agriculture (HOA) in strengthening and
developing   its   programs   for   the   dissemination   of   technical
knowledge/skills   to   local   farming   communities   and   for   the
upgrading/refresher training of its technical cadres including extension
agents;
(b) helping to improve the quality of agricultural education/training so that
the MOA could staff its technical, research and extension services with
technicians and field supervisory personnel well grounded in the technical
specializations required for agricultural development;
(c) endowing the MOA with a capability for manpower and education analysis and
planning in the agricultural sector;
(d) providing urgently needed didactic and farm equipment to existing
institutions - six higher level agricultural institutes (HLAI), four
agricultural secondary schools (ASS), and fifteen agricultural training
centers (ATC) - and technical assistance and equipment to the newly
created National Agricultural Instructor Training Center (NAITC) and the
Bureau of Agricultural Education Studies and Planning (BAESP);
(e) developing primary teacher training through the construction and equipment
of four new primary teacher training colleges in disadvantaged regions;
and
(f) assisting in studies of technician level training for industry and related
commercial sectors through financing of technical assistance.



-3-
D.    Project Design an' Oraanization
4.    In its initial a   6n stage in 1980. the project was to concentrate solely
on technical and vocational education provided by the Ministry of Social Affairs
(through the Vocational Training Office) and the Ministry of Agriculture, the
same focus as the Third and Fourth Education Projects, which aimed at introducing
pre-vocational training in the last two years of primary school to improve
employment opportunities to students likely to leave school at the end of the
primary cycle (Third Project) and at expanding lower level vocational and
apprentice training in the Ministry of Social Affairs (Fourth Project). After
the 1978 riots in which unemployed youth and trade unions had been heavily
involved, the Government had decided to give high priority to training for school
leavers and raising the productivity and employability of workers. Although a
number of problem areas had been identified in the general education system (low
internal efficiency, overcrowding in primary schools, lack of relevance between
secondary curricula and labor market needs), the Government and Bank staff
initially felt that technical and vocational education required more immediate
attention.
S.    As project preparation advanced, it was generally felt by some in the Bank
that the Tunisia lending program focussed somewhat too heavily on vocational
training and that a general education c',mponent should be included in the
project. In addition, the Government indicated that it could not exceed its
budgetary allocation to the Vocational Training Office beyond that anticipated
for the implementation of the Fourth Education Project. Finally, the Ministry
of Education (MOE) was moving ahead with its plan to introduce a nine-year basic
education cycle and requested Bank assistance in implementing part of it.
6.    It was finally decided that the project would include: (i) the agricultural
training component identified at the onset of project preparation; (ii) the
construction and equipping of four primary school teacher training colleges
(Ecole Normale d'Instituteurs, ENI), to help meet an urgent need for primary
school teachers and help implement the new shorter (one-year) training cycle for
graduates of secondary schools; and (iii) a study of technician-level manpower
needs to assess the employability of technical secondary school graduates: the
MOE had requested Bank assistance in financing the expansion of such schools.
The proposed study would provide information on the feasibility of including such
a component in a later operation.
7.    HOA component.  The conceptual foundation of this component was to improve
the quality of the agricultural training apparatus in Tunisia.   The project did
not question the overall mission, the scope and organization of the system.
Although the provision of additional equipment to 6 out the existing 9 HLAIs, to
all ASSs, and to 15 out the existing 27 ATCs, and the later extension of the
project's outreach to an additional 2 HLAIs and 8 ATCs, seemed to imply an
endorsement of the existing system, in fact, each individual training center was
functioning fairly well and was in dire need of equipment.  It was therefore
noncommital to provide the needed equipment, irrespective of the future structure
of the whole agricultural training system.



-4-
E.    Prolect Imlementation
8.    Project start-up was eighteen months late: the Ministry of Rational Economy
was reluctant to grant equipment import licences, which delayed implementation
of the MOA component, in spite of competent management by the project unit and
timely bid launching. Civil works contracts for the four ENIs were signed late
because of early administrative delays and late engineering studies.   The
technician manpower study was also late in getting started because of delays in
setting up the inter-ministerial committee responsible for overseeing
implementation of the study.
9.    The Loan Agreement was revised twice: in July 1987, disbursement percentage
for civil works were increased from 30 to 50% to reflect true indirect foreign
exchange cost of civil works.  XI- May 1988, the benefits of the project were
extended to a larger number of agricultural training institutions.  This was
possible because of favorable US$/Tunisian dinar exchange rate. In addition, the
closing date was extended twice: from December 1987 to December 1988 and then to
December 1989.
F.    Maior Results of the Proiect
10.   MOA component:  The most evident result is that, for the most part, the
institutions supported by the project offer significantly better teaching
conditions, thianks to the quality of the equipment purchased. The technological
complexity of the equipment is commensurate with the degree of development
reached by the agriculture sector as a whole. In quantitative terms, enrollments
and snnual outputs are higher than estimated at appraisal, although some of the
appraisal projections do not seem to fit with the nature and potential and/or
observed performance of the assisted institutions (see Part III, Section E, Table
1).
11.   As  indicated  in  paragraph  7,  the  project  supported  the  existing
agricultural training apparatus without questioning its structure. And yet, the
agricultural manpower study included in the project implied a critical review of
the soundness and the performance of the agricultural training system.   The
study, completed in 1988, raises serious doubts on the cost-effectiveness of the
system in general.   One of its major conclusions is that the agricultural
educational and training system in Tunisia is dispersed into many different
levels, specializations, and types of institutions, and therefore has great
difficulty in reaching the necessary critical mass, in terms of teaching staff,
class sizes, buildings, equipment, and documentation.  The study confirmed what
many critics had expressed since the early 80s: a thorough rethinking of
agricultural education was needed, not only because of the dispersion mentioned
before, but mainly because of the changing role of the public agricultural
sector. During the 60s and 70s, nearly all trained agricultural professionals
found automatic employment in the civil service.  A 1984 FAO study2 showed that
staff availability in 1983 already exceeded minimum requirements and replacement

- 5 -
needs for the year 2000. It is now fully recognized that the private sector must
take a larger part in the employment of agricultural professionals at all levels.
12.   MOE component: Of the four ENIs financed by the project, only one if fully
operational and one is not yet occupied, while two remained unfinished at
completion time.  These four ENIs are located in disadvantaged areas to attract
local trainees who would then teach in their own region. The ENIs were initially
designed to be coeducational since the assignment of female teachers far from
their  native  areas  was  particularly  difficult.    In  fact,  only  one  is
coeducational. It is unclear from project files if the decision to devote the
other three schools exclusively to male trainees resulted from a lack of demand
by females.
13.   Enrollments and outputs are substantially lower than projected at appraisal
(see part III, section E, Table 2). Several factors contributed to this: (i) the
three functioning schools opened one year late; one ENI has not opened yet
(coustruction encountered substantial delays because of the initial contractor's
poor  performance  and  financial  difficulties,  which  resulted  in  contract
cancellation and new contracts with a number of subcontractors under the
supervision of the regional office of the Ministry of civil works); (ii) two of
these schools are not fully finished or equippet; (iii) the ENIs were designed
to offer three programs: a five-year course for trainees having completed grade
9. a one-year course for secondary school graduates, and an in-service program.
Since the creation of the ENIs, the Tunisian education system has turned away
from primary school teacher training in ENIs. thus reducing markedly (and
eventually eliminating) the five-year program. There is therefore overcapacity
in these institutions and they will in all likelihood be converted some other
type of training institution, possibly IUTs (Instituts Universitaires de
Technologie).
14.   Overall, the ENIs are of acceptable design and quality.   There are,
however, a number of design shortcomings which could have been averted with
better coordination between local architects and the Bank's. As table B, part
III, section G, illustrates, an architect participated in most project
preparation missions and in supervision missions, starting in late 1985. An
architect was noticeably missing from the earlier supervision missions (late 1983
to late 1985), at a time where contribution to design could have been
instrumental.   Some of the design flaws involve: east-west orientation for
dormitory buildings (making rooms facing west uncomfortably warm in afternoons
and evenings); in three ENIs, sloped skylights on workshop roofs do not face
north (making the workshops excessively warm); in one ENI, built-in masonry
storage units in dormitories constraint the layout flexibility; in one ENI, a
more costly and environmentally hazardous approach to sewage had to be adopted
because of the presence of rocky soil, a condition which could have been
identified earlier.   There are also some construction flaws which endanger
occupants and/or expensive equipment and which remain to be addressed: the
roofing material over the workshops is composed of unpainted corrugated asbestos-
cement panels, many of which are broken; and there are major cracks in walls and
leaking roofslabs.
15.   Technician manpower study: All eight tasks of the study have been carried
out and yet they did not add up to a useful instrument. The main reasons are:



(i) little integration between the tasks, which were assigned to different teams;
(ii) insufficient theoretical structure in the methodology reflecting excessive
concern with cost-saving; (iii) the study, based on a highly aggregated
macroeconomic model, did not sufficiently disaggregate the analysis to take into
account specific features of job qualification subsets nor specificity of
regional labor markets; and (iv) main recommendations and recommendations on
financing are supply-driven: they focus essentially on institutional development
of the MOE and enrollment projections based on assumptions on baccalaureat
passing rate and orientation percentages.
16.   The study concludes that the country trains fewer and fewer technicians
when the country's technical attainment level is low, particularly in industry.
Most working technicians (60Z) only received general secondary education.
Graduates from technician training have difficulty in entering the labor market.
Seen as a whole, the technician labor market does not function satisfactorily:
there are at the same time an excess of some types of technicians and an unmet
potential demand of some other types. Furthermore, other studies have noted that
regional circumstances play an important role in the external efficiency of
technical training (only 10Z of graduates from the Tunis CFP - Centre de
Formation Professionnelle - were unemployed three years after graduating whereas
832 of graduates from the Sidi-Bouzid CFP were unemployed after three years. It
is therefore essential to extend the analysis of the current situation to the
specifics of regional labor markets and to make projections of the dynamics of
these markets for medium-term assessment.  This is beginning to be addressed
under the FY91 Employment and Training Fund
G. Proiect Sustainability.
17.   MOA component.   The project has made substantial efforts to ensure
acceptable service life of the equipment financed. A survey was carried out
recently to determine the best maintenance structure - centralized,
decentralized, or through commercial firms - and will help define an overall
maintenance strategy. The implementation unit has also taken steps to ensure a
permanent and swift access to foreign exchange for the purchase of spare parts
and accessories.   In addition, it has established a demand-driven system to
provide equipment to beneficiary schools.
18.   It has already been pointed out that the project fell somewhat short of
addressing fundamental issues relating to the agricultural training system. The
growing importance of the private sector is recognized, but 90Z of the
professionals trained at the ASSs and HLAIs still go for public employment - with
the exception of the Food Technology Institute where only about 10% of graduates
are employed by the public sector. Clearly, the Government is under pressure to
provide training and employment for all graduates of the formal agricultural
education system.   So far,  growth in the agriculture sector has enabled
absorption of most graduates, but the sustainability of the existing system needs
to be assessed and a long-term training and employment strategy needs to be
developed.
19. MOE component. In light of the on-going restructuring of primary school
teacher training, the usefulness of all ENIs is in question.   This issue is
currently being addressed under the FY92 Higher Education Restructuring Project.



Eventually, they will be converted into other types of training institutions,
thus requiring physical modifications to adapt existing structures to their new
functions.
H.    Performance of the World Bank.
20.   HOA component:  The Bank's contribution was limited to improving teaching
quality (through provision of equipment) to existing training institutions. It
could have contributed much more substantially by addressing structural reforms
of the agricultural training system.   Its performance during preparation,
appraisal and supervision was basically technical, in line with defined
objectives.   Owing mostly to difficulties encountered in implementing the
physical aspects of this component, supervision missions focussed essentially on
the mechanical execution of the project (procurement, disbursements, auditing),
and missed opportunities to contribute to the institutional and pedagogical
impact of the operation.
21. MOE comRonent: The absence of an architect in the Bank's first supervision
missions was detrimental to school design.   During project implementation,
however, the Bank's architects provided useful recommendations to redress
construction flaws in time for them to be corrected.
I.    Summarv of Borrower's Actions.
22.   HOA component:  Difficulty in obtaining equipment import licences was the
main obstacle to a timely implementation of this component. The project
implementation unit was adequately staffed (although belatedly) and enjoyed an
encouraging staff continuity. It provided leadership in designing a system to
assess specific equipment needs for each institution and a well-coordinated
equipment delivery system. In addition, it produced - and communicated to the
Bank - timely, insightful, and forward-looking progress reports.
23.   MOE component: Construction sites were insufficiently supervised by staff
from MOE and Ministry of Public Works. In addition, late payments to contractors
and the main contractor's financial difficulties resulted in construction delays.
J.    Government-Bank Relations during the Proiect.
24.   The Borrower and the Bank displayed appropriate flexibility during project
implementation, which allowed for redefinition of project scope (MOA component).
Satisfactory cooperation was exercised by all teams.
K.    Consultants Services.
25.   MOA component.  The key task assigned to consultants was the agricultural
manpower study, which made a critical assessment of the supply and demand and
created a data base on which to base decisions for streamlining the education
apparatus. It confirmed that the agricultural education system lacked a clear
strategy concept and pointed out to the high financial parameters sucha as unit
cost per student and per graduate.   The agro-pedagogical studies and the
financial analysis of school farms were conducted by MOA staff.   The agro-
pedagogical studies are not completed. Some of the recommendations of the school

farm analysis have resulted in actions (such as the reduction of size of school
farms).
26.   Technician manPower study.  Interim reports on this study were often late.
It is however difficult to ascertain whether delays were caused by the consulting
group responsible for the carrying out of the study or by untimely reactions from
the overseeing committee.
L.    Documentation and Data Relating to the Proiect.
27.   The program was implemented on the basis of the usual documents: Loan
Agreement, Staff Appraisal Report and President's Report. MOA implementing unit
provided 26 status reports of high quality. The reports provided by MOE were
focussed exclusively on procurement and disbursement issues, and failed to
include any impact assessment on enrollments and quality of training. The Bank's
supervision reports also focusses heavily on the physical and financial aspects
of project implementation.

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Part II only covers the agricultural training component.
I. Final Project Status
Introduction
1.    The original purpose of the project was to accomplish the objectives set
for the agricultural education system.   It therefore aimed to provide eight
university-level schools, four high schools and 23 agricultural training centers
with additional teaching and farming equipment. Also included in the project
were studies on: (i) human resource planning in the agricultural sector, with a
view to matching training more closely to the demands of employment; and
(ii) adjustments to training programs, teaching methods and rural communications.
2.    The estimated project cost was US$13.9 million from the Bank loan and TD
1.8 million in Title II funds (Government's contribution).
Usage of Funds
3.    As of the project completion date, commitments had reached the following
levels: US$14.39 million from the loan and TD 1.66 million from Title II funds.
Fund usage was therefore 104% for the loan and 92% for Title II.
Constraints
4.   The progress of the project was affected by several constraints, including:
(a) a delay of over one year in project start-up; (b) the withdrawal of certain
suppliers because of delays in the issuing of import licences during 1985 and
1986; (c) the various changes made in the training system during project
implementation; and (d) the expansion of the project to include 10 additional
institutions during its final phase, resulting in an extremely heavy workload
during the final months of implementation.
Project Impact
5.    The equipment purchased is beginning to have a very positive impact on the
activities of the beneficiary establishments. In particular, the project made
it possible to consolidate practical training, improve teaching methods,
intensify outreach activities, improve the production techniques used in
demonstration farms.   Thanks to this equipment, it will also be possible to
develop research and experimental programs in all institutions. In addition, the
improved school management facilities have resulted in improved working and
living conditions in the various institutions.



- 10 -
6.    The two studies undertaken as part of the technical assistance component
have resulted in the following new strategies:
The study on the rehabilitation of the farms attached to the schools
helped increase their educational value; and
The study on the relevance of training to employment identified certain
inadequacies in the training system and enabled plans to be formulated for
restructuring the system.
7.    With respect to the fellowship and short-course component, implementation
proved costly for the country and it was considered more appropriate to execute
it within the framework of bilateral assistance programs.
Recommendations for more Efficient Utilization of Eguipment
8.    In order to make the most efficient use of the equipment purchased under
the project, the following measures should be adopted, in conjunction with the
beneficiary institutions: (a) consolidation of all research programs in
university-level schools; (b) intensification of development and outreach
activities in surrounding areas; (c) training of maintenance teams for each
category of equipment; (d) establishment of maintenance teams in each center; (e)
training of laboratory staff for operating scientific equipment; and (f) training
of qualified staff for operating audiovisual equipment and producing teaching
aids.
II. Lessons learned
Bank Performance
9.    During apDraisal: (i) appraisals should take into account the particular
features of the individual beneficiary institution. In this case, the appraisal
seems to have been based on generalizations, so that theoretical lists were drawn
up bearing no relationship to the particular features of the individual
institutions.   Consequently,  these lists had to be revised during project
implementation and brought into line with the specific needs of individual
training institutions. (ii) appraisals should cover all activities necessary for
supporting project implementation.   The agricultural component contained a
program to provide additional equipment that failed to take into account the
additional construction needs implied by the provision of this equipment. This
resulted in a mismatch between buildings and equipment and, in certain cases,
even overcrowding, despite a degree of expansion during project implementation.
10.   During implementation: the importance of mid-term evaluations as part of
project monitoring.   The monitoring of the project was based on very brief
visits. This approach makes it impossible to study any problems encountered in
detail so that the necessary corrections can be made. In the future, full mid-
term reviews should be made.



- 11 -
Borow,er Performance
11.   During appraisal: Project content should be geared to the country's current
situation. This would help avoid difficulties during implementation and improve
project performance. The Borrower should therefore play a more dynamic role in
project appraisal. Consideration should also be given to the Borrower's possible
contributions in the form of technical cooperation, particularly in the areas of
training and other expertise.
12.   During imDlementation:  project management units should be established
several months prior to start-up. This would help avoid delays, particularly
during the start-up phase and would ensure successful implementation of the
actions planned.
13.   Experience has shown that certain appropriate measures can help increase
the efficiency of the actions planned under the project, in particular updating
of projections in light of developments in the project sector, involvement of
future users of equipment in all phases of the project, and self-evaluation by
the Borrower during project implementation.
Bank-Borrower RelationshiR
14.   The Bank-Borrower relationship was exemplary throughout project appraisal
and implementation. There is therefore no need for further comment.

N.B:
Some of the appraisal projections do not seem to fit with the nature and potential and/or
real performance of the assisted schools:
The National Instructor Training Center was not meant to allow an enrollment capacity of
325. Given the predominance of short, specially tailored courses, the 1988/89 output of
upgraded teaching personnel reached 710.
The ratios between enrollments and annual outputs must at least correspond to the average
number of years required to complete a given cursus. For the HIAIs and the ASSs, the
ratios anticipated in the Staff Appraisal Report appear unpracticably narrow whereas the
observed figures show for 1988/1989 a performance which includes a certain degree of
attrition.
Short upgrading courses are usually given in certain ATCs, not in ASSs.
The three-year courses are the exception rather than the norm at the ATCs offering
initial training. The sum of the 1988/89 output of two- and three-year courses exceeds
the appraisal targets.
