The\n            project's overall development objective was to enhance\n            Chile's policy and institutional innovation framework\n            for competitiveness and improve the impact of priority\n            innovation programs. More specifically, the project's\n            objective was: (i) to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Economy's capacity on innovation and ensure its\n            coherence with other policies for competitiveness; (ii)\n            strengthen National Commission For Scientific And\n            Technological Research (CONICYT) and improve the coherence,\n            quality and relevance of research funding policy in Chile;\n            and (iii) stimulate technology transfer and the creation of\n            new technology based enterprises through Chilean Development\n            Agency (CORFO). Chile has been the fastest growing economy\n            in Latin America since 1990. The impressive performance of\n            the economy owes much to a strong institutional framework,\n            exemplary monetary policies and deep integration into the\n            global economy. Due to strong growth Chile has made notable\n            progress towards the goal of convergence with Organization\n            for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies.\n            The income gap, however, remains sizeable. Despite progress\n            in recent decades, Chile remains highly dependent on the\n            export of unprocessed natural resources, notably copper.\n            Chile will need fast and sustained growth to further reduce\n            poverty, continue improving living standards, and close the\n            income gap with the lower tier of OECD countries by 2020.\n            Sound macroeconomic management is well entrenched. Hence,\n            Chile is in a favorable position to focus on microeconomic\n            reforms aimed at boosting the capacity of firms to sustain\n            productivity growth and develop new business opportunities."}, "docdt": "2010-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
