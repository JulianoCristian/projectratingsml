Country and Sector Background 
 
Chile has been the fastest growing economy in Latin America since 1990 (Table 1). The 
impressive performance of the economy owes much to a strong institutional framework, 
exemplary monetary policies and deep integration into the global economy. Due to strong growth 
Chile has made notable progress towards the goal of convergence with OECD economies. The 
income gap, however, remains sizeable. Per capita income in Chile (adjusted for purchasing 
power parity) is currently less than 40 percent of the OECD average leaving ample room for 
further catch-up in relative living standards.

The Asian financial crises of the late 1990s revealed vulnerabilities of the Chilean economy to 
external shocks, in part due to shortcomings in productivity and economic diversification. 
Despite progress in recent decades, Chile remains highly dependent on the export of unprocessed 
natural resources, notably copper (Figure 1). Growth deceleration in 2006 has also raised 
concerns that Chile may have started to exhaust previous sources of growth.  While there have 
been concerns in the private sector of a real effective exchange rate appreciation (16 percent 
Page  2
from 2003 to 2007), there is little evidence that this has affected (non-copper) export growth 
(IMF 2007) thus far. That said, this calls for further productivity increases in the (non-copper) 
sector.

Chile will need fast and sustained growth to further reduce poverty, continue improving living 
standards, and close the income gap with the lower tier of OECD countries by 2020. The 
perception of sound macroeconomic management is now well entrenched. Chile is one of the 
few sovereign borrowers in Latin America, along with Mexico and more recently Brazil and 
Peru, to enjoy an investment-grade credit rating. Hence, Chile is in a favorable position to focus 
on microeconomic reforms aimed at boosting the capacity of firms to sustain productivity growth 
and develop new business opportunities. Evidence from economies that have successfully 
diversified and added value to their natural resource base such as Australia and Finland suggests 
that boosting Chile’s capacity to innovate should be at the center of such reforms. Cross-country 
analysis indicates that half of all differences in income and growth is attributable to differences 
in total factor productivity (TFP), generally associated with technological development, 
innovation, and the investment climate (see Chile, Development Policy Review, 2006). Chile’s 
total factor productivity has historically been relatively high, however during the 1990s, this 
trend has reversed and Chile’s TFP has sharply decreased. 
 
A
potential explanation for the low levels of TPF is related to the microeconomic constraints to 
institutional adjustment costs (Bergoeing and Repetto, 2003). However, as mentioned by the 
Development Policy Review for Chile (2006), if the gap in TPF were due solely to 
microeconomic obstacles, the inefficiencies would appear to be surprisingly large relative to the 
US given the extensive microreforms that have taken place in Chile. The latter suggests that 
innovation deserves to be a central issue due to its impact on raising firms’ capacity to introduce 
productivity-improving measures. Cohen and Levinthal (1989) argue that R&D is not only 
crucial to generate new knowledge, but to enhance “absorptive capacity” (i.e., the firm´s ability 
to use and benefit from existing information). Investments in innovations that do not necessarily 
involve R&D may also yield high dividends in the medium term for Chile. Marimon (2008), for 
example, indicates that innovations in process and organizational forms that are not accounted 
Page  3
for in official statistics have facilitated the growth of outward looking industries such as banking, 
tourism and textiles in Spain.

Sector issues 
 
In the area of science, technology and innovation (STI), Chile has made gains over the last 
decade but continues to lag substantially advanced economies with respect to most STI 
indicators (Table 2).  Chile’s R&D spending per capita, full-time equivalent researchers as a 
percent of population, and patent activity significantly lag the efforts of OECD countries, even 
those with a natural resource base, in many cases by more than an order of magnitude. The 
differences are not due solely to income disparities; on some indicators Chile also falls behind 
dynamic economies with lower GDP per capita such as China and India. Several factors explain 
Chile’s low performance relative to more advanced economies: 
 
Chile’s policies and institutional framework for innovation is underdeveloped preventing an 
efficient use of public support for innovation.  
Until recently, the country did not have a fully 
articulated innovation policy with coherent and achievable objectives.  The institutional 
framework takes current shape more from historical precedent, rather than from explicit 
decisions regarding the roles and functions of actors; in many cases, it is fragmented, shows 
overlaps and lacks clear accountability mechanisms. Diverse studies and assessments have 
warned 
about the lack of policy coordination in Chile’s national innovation system. Several 
ministries –including the Ministries of Economy, Education, Planning, Agriculture, Transport 
and Telecommunications, Public Works, and Foreign Affairs– have historically been involved in 
the formulation of STI policies and the design and management of programs (Box 1), but 
cooperation between actors has been minimal.

As a result, Chile has had a wide array of uncoordinated policies and programs for R&D and for 
technology diffusion with significant overlap between content and objectives. For instance, 
coordination between Chile’s two key implementing agencies--the Chilean Science and 
Technology Council (CONICYT) and the Innovation promotion group (InnovaChile) of the 
Chilean Development Agency (CORFO)--has traditionally been modest. Support for team-based 
research, which could potentially have a high impact, is also fragmented among various 
institutions that follow different principles and strategic priorities for allocating funding. 
Fragmentation reduces the effectiveness of public expenditures, results in duplication and leads 
to excessive diffusion of programs including to some areas with relatively low social rates of 
return. The lack of explicit policy-making evaluation mechanisms has impeded learning, created 
inertia and prevented change despite duplication and fragmentation. This is an area for 
significant improvement.

Need to build capacity in the Ministry of Economy (MoE) to design, manage and evaluate 
innovation and microeconomic policies
.
Shortly after the presentation of the National Innovation 
Strategy (volume 1) prepared by the National Innovation Council in February 2007, the 
Government formed an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Innovation tasked with the responsibility 
of formulating innovation policies, giving orientation to Chile’s support system for innovation 
and addressing problems that hinder the systems effectiveness, including fragmentation and 
overlap. The Committee is led by the MoE and comprises the Minister of Finance, the Minister 
of Education, and other line ministries. The Committee has a Technical Secretariat attached to 
the MoE. The Ministry is also tasked with the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of 
policies concerning markets regulation and small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). It will 
need a strong capacity to set the policy agenda, monitor the impact of innovation and 
microeconomic policies and hold implementing agencies accountable for results, a capacity that 
it currently does not possess. A major institutional strengthening effort is thus required to 
enhance its capacity. 
 
Chile's stock of human capital for innovation and technology management is low and 
geographically concentrated. 
 A major barrier to innovation in Chile is the insufficient level of 
advanced human capital and disarticulation between skill production and the needs of the 
productive sector. This is partially demonstrated by the low number of young researchers 
working in private companies, but pertains also to the nature and quality of the skills being 
produced. Despite a strong increase in the number of researchers in the last decade, the stock is 
still comparatively low (Figure 3). Furthermore, Chilean universities have a limited tradition of 
stimulating entrepreneurship or linkages with industry, and young researchers tend to stay in the 
public sector, working either for government research institutes or universities. An additional 
barrier to innovation in Chile is the lack of mobility of advanced human capital within the 
country and modest international linkages. The existent stock of advanced human capital is 
geographically concentrated in the Santiago area, which reflects the lack of a bridge between the 
regions and the metropolitan area.

Low overall research and development, lack of investment focus, and poor articulation with 
private sector needs. 
Overall investment in research and development is increasing, but from a 
comparatively low baseline (Figure 4). This is only partially attributable to the structure of 
production.  Even when R&D investment rates per sector are controlled, countries such as 
Australia continue to show much higher rates of R&D intensity (Maloney and Rodriguez Clare 
(2007).  The effectiveness of public R&D has been hindered by a lack of policy focus and 
definition of strategic priorities connected to the needs of its production base coupled with 
adequate accountability measures. In this context, Chile has not been able to optimize the 
effectiveness of public investment.

Business Enterprise investment is 45.8 percent of all R&D spending
—a reasonable percentage 
by regional standards.  Nonetheless, the existing evidence suggests that the private and public 
Page  7
R&D efforts are mostly isolated and parallel rather than complementary, impeding the 
transformation of knowledge into productive innovation. There is a growing consensus that Chile 
is not close to deriving full commercial benefit from either the knowledge or the skills that its 
publicly-financed research efforts are producing.  In recent years, successful pilot initiatives for 
public-private research partnerships have emerged in Chile. These initiatives are modest and 
fragmented among CORFO, CONICYT, and FIA.  
 
Inadequate mechanisms for transferring technology to SMEs.
 Small and medium size enterprises 
in Chile account for roughly 95 percent of the total employment.  Hence, SME development is at 
the heart of enhancing Chile’s innovative potential and TFP growth. Besides increasing R&D, 
there is a large potential for non-R&D driven TFP growth by enhancing the capacity of SMEs to 
adopt existing technologies and improving organization and management. There is little 
experience of collaborative technology development in Chile that is led by the private sector and 
substantially funded by them. Through InnovaChile’s programs, CORFO has supported the 
formation of business networks for technology transfer but this initiative is not well articulated 
with other programs nor is it tailored to the specific needs of firms in priority sectors of the 
economy. Evidence from countries such as Spain and Ireland suggests that Chile would benefit 
from a broad vision of innovation which includes the development of a coherent framework for 
technology services targeting SMEs. 
 
Weak incentives and insufficient support for technology based start-up companies
.
There has 
been a wide range of initiatives implemented to foster the growth of new firms in sectors with 
high growth potential, including the development of university based incubators, and networks of 
angel investors. Yet, there are concerns that the impact of some of them has been weak (e.g., 
incubators and networks of angel investors) and that there are gaps within the value chain faced 
by start-up companies.  
 
2. 
Government strategy  
 
Innovation is a top priority in Chile’s competitiveness agenda. In November 2005 the Lagos 
Government set up a high-level Commission to prepare the ground for the formulation of a 
national strategy for innovation and competitiveness. In its final report from March 2006 the 
Commission recommended the establishment of a permanent National Innovation Council 
responsible for strategy formulation and providing policy advice to the executive. In May 2006, 
President Michelle Bachelet formed such a Council with participation of high-level experts on 
STI and government representatives. The Council presented the first volume of a National 
Innovation Strategy in January 2007, which was endorsed by President Bachelet shortly 
thereafter. The strategy underscores that becoming a knowledge economy means adding value to 
sectors where Chile has demonstrated comparative advantages while supporting key emerging 
sectors. The Council presented the second volume of the National Innovation Strategy with more 
detailed recommendations in February 2008. The two volumes were prepared on the basis of 
consultations with relevant stakeholders and advice from international independent experts to 
incorporate best international practices.  
 
The first volume of the Innovation strategy defines strategic innovation goals for a 12-year 
Page  8
horizon and general principles to guide innovation policy.
1
Its key elements are to (i) build a 
strong platform for human capital that will substantially expand tertiary education, especially in 
technical areas, and will support the formation of highly specialized human capital in STI; (ii) 
enhance research capacity, with an emphasis on applied research; (iii) foster innovation within 
enterprises 
inter alia
 through the development of stronger interfaces with research groups and 
new models to promote technology transfer; (iv) generate a pro-active culture of innovation 
within Chile’s society; (v) set in place a robust governance structure for the innovation system; 
and (vi) build regional STI capacity in areas linked to their economic specialization. A second 
complementary volume of the National Innovation Strategy will be issued shortly providing 
more detailed guidance on innovation policies and the supporting institutional framework. The 
Inter-ministerial Committee on Innovation will be responsible for the strategy’s implementation 
under the leadership of the MoE.  A second volume with more detailed recommendations for 
implementing the proposed National Innovation strategy was presented to President Bachelet in 
February 2008. 
 
The Government presented in mid-2007 a draft law to Congress to formalize the establishment of 
the National Innovation Council and the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Innovation. The latter 
will be chaired by the Ministry of Economy. Thus, the government recognizes the importance of 
strengthening the Ministry of Economy (MoE) so that it can effectively play a leadership role on 
innovation policy and the closely related competitiveness agenda.
 
3. 
Rationale for Bank involvement 
 
Over the last few years, the World Bank has assisted the Government of Chile in the innovation 
area through policy advice (e.g., the preparation of a Strategy to Promote Innovative SMEs 
(2004), an Investment Climate Assessment (2006), and the Development Policy Review (2006)) 
and support for two investment projects – 
the Millennium Science Initiative followed by the 
Science for the Knowledge Economy Project.
 The latter, implemented by CONICYT, was 
conceived as a two-stage APL since testing new instruments in the innovation system involves a 
learning and incubation process before they can be consolidated. The APL1 was satisfactorily 
implemented and closed at the end of March 2007 as originally envisaged (see Annex 2.4 for a 
summary of key results). 
 
The Government of Chile has requested a new investment project to foster Innovation. The 
project would build on the aforementioned APL1 but would have a wider set of objectives to 
accommodate Chile’s more ambitious new policy vision. It would support key elements of the 
national innovation strategy with a strong emphasis on building robust institutional foundations. 
The Government regards the World Bank as a strategic partner due to its expertise in the 
innovation area, knowledge of a wide range of international experiences such as OECD and 
1
The strategy’s key benchmarks by the end of the 12-year period are to reduce the weight of Chile’s top 25 exports 
to no more than 50 percent of total exports; to increase the participation of young adults (ages 18-24) in tertiary 
education from the current 43 percent to 80 percent in 12 years; to raise R&D as percentage of GDP from the current 
0.68 percent to 2.32 percent with the private sector leading the way by the end of the period; and improve Chile’s 
World Competitiveness ranking in the areas of innovation, technology sophistication of enterprises, and education 
and skills.  
Page  9
Asia, and the capacity to help adapt internation
al practices and instruments to Chile’s reality and 
needs. 
 
The proposed project is fully aligned with the goals of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). 
In particular, it will support the objective of converging with OECD income levels and living 
standards by accelerating sustainable growth through increases in total factor productivity. The 
proposed project would have strong synergies with other Bank interventions aimed at increasing 
Chile’s innovation capacity, in particular the Tertiary Education Finance for Results APL1.  
 
4.  Objectives and Description 
 
The project’s overall development objective would be to enhance Chile’s policy and institutional 
innovation framework for competitiveness and improve the impact of priority innovation 
programs. More specifically, the project’s objective is: (i) to strengthen the Ministry of 
Economy’s capacity on innovation and ensure its coherence with other policies for 
competitiveness; (ii) strengthen CONICYT and improve the coherence, quality and relevance of 
research funding policy in Chile; and (iii) stimulate technology transfer and the creation of new 
technology based enterprises through CORFO. 
 
Description  
 
The project would contribute to the aforementioned development objective through three 
components: (i) strengthening the MoE’s capacity on innovation and ensuring its coherence with 
other competitiveness policies; (ii) enhancing Chile’s science base; and (iii) fostering technology 
transfer and new ventures through InnovaChile’s programs managed by CORFO.   
 
Component one
:
Strengthening the MoE capacity on innovation and related competitiveness 
policies
.
This component would enhance the MoE’s institutional capacity to formulate, monitor, 
and evaluate innovation policies in accordance with the guidelines of the National Innovation 
Strategy. In addition, it would support selected elements of the broader Strategic Plan to 
strengthen the MoE, which is under advanced preparation, in order to foster consistency between 
innovation policies and other policies seeking to enhance Chile’s competitiveness. This would 
also ensure that the innovation related units of the MoE operate within a solid and adequate 
institutional framework promoting sustainability of reforms. The design of this component 
benefited from an extensive consultation process with internal and external stakeholders, a 
process that would continue during project implementation. In addition, this component would 
support the Project Coordination Unit within the MoE. 
 
Component two
:
Strengthening Chile’s Science Base
.
This component would strengthen 
CONICYT by helping the institution formulate a strategic plan with clear medium-term goals 
aligned with the national innovation strategy, develop and implement a coherent research support 
policy, and increase its capacity to design and evaluate programs. At the end of the project, 
CONICYT would have increased capacity to design, oversee, and learn from the implementation 
of its programs. The Inter-ministerial Committee on Innovation and the Ministry of Education 
would guide CONICYT in the implementation of this component.  
 
Page  10
Component three
:
Fostering Technology Transfer and New Technology-Based Ventures. The 
component would strengthen 
CORFO-
led programs that seek to stimulate the start-up of 
knowledge intensive businesses and the adoption of higher value technologies by SMEs, and its 
monitoring and evaluation capacity. It would achieve the above through three subcomponents: (i) 
upgrading new technology based enterprise development, (ii) strengthening technology extension 
and transfer services for SMEs, and (iii) strengthening 
CORFO’s
 monitoring and evaluation 
capacity
 of InnovaChile’s programs. 
 
The Government of Chile has requested a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) for US$30 million to 
promote innovation and competitiveness by strengthening the institutional capacity of the 
Ministry of Economy, by improving the quality of research in Chile, and by stimulating 
technology transfer institutions and practices. The SIL would provide a framework for constant 
interaction between the Bank’s technical team and Chile’s relevant stakeholders inside the 
Ministry of Economy and inside front-line institutions such as CONICYT and 
InnovaChile/CORFO. The Bank has acquired extensive expertise over the years on building 
institutional capacity and would be able to share its experience with similar institutional reforms 
in Chile and in the region. 
 
The project would be implemented over a four year period (mid-2008 to mid-2012). This would 
allow adequate time to consolidate the changes in the institutional framework for innovation 
supporting the long-term innovation strategy.

6. Implementation 
 
The Ministry of Economy would assume responsibility for overall project coordination and 
would be responsible for implementing component 1. Components 2 and 3 would be 
implemented by CONICYT and CORFO, respectively.  The project would be implemented over 
a
5
year period (January 15, 2009-January 15, 2014).
 
7. Sustainability 
 
Innovation is a top priority in Chile’s competitiveness agenda. Government ownership of the 
project is strong, which is reflected in the establishment of the National Innovation Council 
responsible for the formulation of the National Innovation Strategy whose first volume (White 
Book) was presented in January 2007.  The latter reflects a move towards the construction of a 
broad national consensus on the importance of establishing a more integrated and effective 
national innovation system to enhance Chile’s productivity and competitiveness. Thus, the risks 
of policy or program reversal are minimal. Also, the MoE through the Inter-Ministerial 
Committee on Innovation will reduce fragmentation, foster cross-collaboration and contribute to 
consensus building within the national innovation system, enhancing its sustainability. At the 
same time, the modernization of the MoE is based on a consultative process with the 
Page  12
participation of internal and external stakeholders, which ensures both ownership and promotes 
sustainability.  
 
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
The project design is appropriate to the borrower’s needs and targets some of the key constraints 
to innovation identified in the National Innovation Strategy (volume 1 and volume 2). Project 
design has drawn from international best practices, lessons from OECD innovation practices, and 
lessons learned from relevant Bank projects (including the APL I on Science for the Knowledge 
Economy), which have been adapted to the realities and priorities of Chile.
