1. Context, Project Development Objectives, and Design


Country Background

Chile has been the fastest growing economy in Latin America since 1990. The impressive
performance of the economy owes much to a strong institutional framework, exemplary
monetary policies and deep integration into the global economy. Due to strong growth
Chile has made notable progress towards the goal of convergence with OECD
economies. The income gap, however, remains sizeable. Despite progress in recent
decades, Chile remains highly dependent on the export of unprocessed natural resources,
notably copper.

Chile will need fast and sustained growth to further reduce poverty, continue improving
living standards, and close the income gap with the lower tier of OECD countries by
2020. Sound macroeconomic management is well entrenched. Hence, Chile is in a
favorable position to focus on microeconomic reforms aimed at boosting the capacity of
firms to sustain productivity growth and develop new business opportunities. Evidence
from economies that have successfully diversified and added value to their natural
resource base such as Australia and Finland suggests that boosting Chile's capacity to
innovate should be at the center of such reforms. Cross-country analysis indicates that
half of all differences in income and growth is attnbutable to differences in total factor
productivity (TFP), generally associated with technological development and innovation
(see Chile, Development Policy Review, 2006). Chile's total f8ctor productivity has
historically been relatively high; however during the 199Os, TFP growth rates decreased.


Sector Bqckgrguml

In the area of science, technology and innovation (STI), Chile has made gains over the
last decade but continues to lag substantially advanced economies with respect to most
STI indicators. Chile's R&D spending per capita, full-time equivalent researchers as a
percent of population, and patent activity significantly lag the efforts of OECD countries,
even those with a natural resource base. The differences are not due solely to income
disparities; on some STI indicators, Chile also -falls behind dynamic economies with
lower GDP per capita such as China and India.

Several factors have explained Chile's relatively weaker performance on innovation
relative to more advanced economies:

       Chile's policies and institutional framework for innovation were fragmented
       preventing an efficient use of public support for innovation.
       The capacity to design and evaluate innovation po licies can be strengthened.
       Chile's stock of human capital for innovation and technology management is low
       and geographically concentrated.




                                            1
       Overall investments in research arid development are low and the articulation with
       private sector is less than necessary.
       Mechanisms for transferring technology to small and medium enterprises can be
       enhanced.
       The incentives and support for technology based start-up companies are at a
       nascent stage.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

During the 2000s, the World Bank had assisted the Government of Chile in the
innovation area through policy advice (e.g., the preparation of a Strategy to Promote
Innovative SMEs (2004), an Investment Climate Assessment (2006), and the
Development Policy Review (2006)) and support for two investment projects - the
Millennium Science Initiative followed by the Science for the Knowledge Economy
Project. The latter, implemented by CONICYT, was conceived as a two-stage APL since
testing new instruments in the innovation system involved a learning and incubation
process before they could be consolidated. The APLI was satisfactorily implemented and
closed at the end of March 2007, as originally envisaged.

In 2007, the Government of Chile requested a new investment project to foster
Innovation. The project built on the aforementioned APLI but had a wider set of
objectives to accommodate the new policy vision, which was more ambitious. It
supported key elements of the national innovation strategy with a strong emphasis on
building robust institutional foundations. The Government regarded the World Bank as a
strategic partner due to its expertise in the innovation area, knowledge of a wide range of
international experiences such as OECD and Asia, and the capacity to help adapt
international practices and instruments to Chile's reality and needs.

The project was fully aligned with the goals of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
In particular, it supported the objective of converging with OECD income levels and
living standards by accelerating sustainable growth through increases in total factor
productivity. The project had strong synergies with other Bank interventions aimed at
increasing Chile's innovation capacity, in particular the Tertiary Education Finance for
Results APLI.

Development Objective

The project's overall development objective was to enhance Chile's policy and
institutional innovation framework for competitiveness and improve the impact of
priority innovation programs. More specifically, the project's objective was: (i) to
strengthen the Ministry of Economy's capacity on innovation and ensure its coherence
with other policies for competitiveness; (ii) strengthen CONICYT and improve the
coherence, quality and relevance of research funding policy in Chile; and (iii) stimulate
technology transfer and the creation of new technology based enterprises through
CORFO.

Components

The project sought to contribute to the aforementioned development objective through
three components:

Component one: Strengthening the MoE capacity on innovation and related
competitiveness polit?ies. This component sought to enhance the MoE's institutional
capacity to formulate, monitor, and evaluate innovation policies in accordance with the
guidelines of the National Innovation Strategy. In addition, it would have supported
selected elements of the broader Strategic Plan to strengthen the MoE, in order to foster
consistency between innovation policies and other policies seeking to enhance Chile's
competitiveness. The design of this component benefited from an extensive consultation
process with internal and external stakeholders.

Component two: Strengthening Chile's Science Base. This component aimed to
strengthen CONICYT by helping the institution formulate a strategic plan with clear
medium-term goals aligned with the national innovation strategy, develop and implement
a coherent research support policy. and increase its capacity to design and evaluate
programs. At the end of the project, CONICYT would have increased its capacity to
design, oversee, and learn from the implementation of its programs. The Inter-ministerial
Committee on Innovation and the Ministry of Education were to guide CONICYT in the
implementation of this component.

Component three: Fostering Technology Transfer and New Technology-Based
Ventures. The component intended to strengthen CORFO-Ied programs aimed at start-
ups of knowledge intensive businesses and the adoption of higher value technologies by
SMEs, and its monitoring and evaluation capacity. It sought to achieve the above through
three subcomponents: (i) upgrading new technology based enterprise development, (ii)
strengthening technology extension and transfer services for SMEs, and (iii)
strengthening CORFO's monitoring and evaluation capacity oflnnovaChile's programs.

Implementation Arranr.ements

The Project would have been implemented by the MoE, CONICYT and CORFO. A
Project Coordination Unit (pCU) within the MoE, reporting directly to the Minister of
Economy, was responsible for overall coordination of project activities among the three
institutions and for the implementation of component I. CONICYT and CORFO were
responsible for implementing components 2 and 3 of the project, respectively, and inform
the MoE accordingly. The PCU within the MoE would have presented semi-annual

  which would have been responsible for the preparation of the interim and annual
  financial statements and disbursements for the project as a whole. Procurement activities
  would have been carried out by each implementing agency (the Ministry of Economy,
  CONICYT, and CORFO) for their own component. However, the PCU within the MoE
  would have been responsible for monitoring the consistency of all procurement activities
  with Bank practices. The PCU within the MoE was adequately staffed with technical
  experts to support project design and implementation.

 Potential less demand        s       This risk was mitigated by various factors. First, Chile enjoyed a
 tban expected from the               favorable business climate that encouraged entrepreneurship and
 private   sector    for              private sector investment, and the government was working towards
 technology services                  further improving the business climate through Chile Compile and

                                      tecbnology brokers that would play a proactive role in reaching

                                      technology service providers.                             .
  Resistance to change        M       This risk stemmed mostly from the traditional separation of Chile's
  from            research            research community from other parts of the innovation system.
  performers and other                CONICYT's stakeholders had sometimes impeded changes toward
  stakeholders        who             greater accountability and relevance. The risk was mitigated by the
. benefit from the current            close cooperation between CONICYT and the Inter-Ministerial

  arrangements                        by the National Innovation Council. Changes to CONICYT's
                                      strategic directions would have to be both aligned with the national
                                      strategy on innovation and supported (ex-ante) by the Jnter-

Overall risk rating        S



Ouality at Entry
The project responded to a demand from the Government of Chile to strengthen key
institutional pillars of its innovation system in line with the national innovation strategy.
During project preparation, the Bank team carried out consultations with members of the
National Innovation Council for Competitiveness, and representatives from the private
sector, the academic community, and think tanks. Project formulation was also informed
by extensive analytical work on innovation conducted by Chilean academics and World
Bank experts as well as lessons learned from the Chil~Science for the Knowledge
Economy Project and other innovation projects in the region (see Annexes 2 and 12.of
the Project Appraisal Document).

Initially, the leadership of the Ministry of Economy requested support for a more
ambitious operation that would have encompassed a broader institutional strengthening of
the Ministry of Economy together with support for CONICYT and CORFO. On the basis
of follow up consultations with the Government and Bank management, it was agreed
that the project would focus on strengthening those institutional aspects of the Ministry of
Economy that had the greatest bearing on innovation policies and programs. A broader
focus would have increased the project's complexity.

2. Post-Approval Experience and Reasons for Cancellation.
(main events leading to cancellation, steps taken to resolve problems, exogenous factors,
identification ofcauses and responsibility ifproject failed, implications offailure):

The project was approved by the Board on July 15,2008 and signed by the Minister of
Finance on December 31, 2008. It became effective on November 1, 2009, following
clearances by the Comptroller's Office. A new Government took office in March 2010.
The team visited Chile on May 12-14, 2010, to meet the new authorities, including Mr.
Juan Andres Fontaine, the new Minister of Economy, and to discuss the project's
objectives. On June 8, 2010, the new Government of Chile requested the project's
cancellation. Only the front end fee for US$75,000 was disbursed. The innovation
strategy of the new Government has a substantially different focus ..

 3. Assessment of Bank Performance
 (lending process/ensuring Quality at Entry, supervision and implementation assistance
 role, compliance with Bank policies, justification for rating):

 Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance is rated satisfactory. Project formulation followed a clear demand
driven approach, and consultations were conducted with different stakeholders as noted
earlier. Its design was also informed by extensive analytical work performed by the
World Bank, academics and practitioners. During preparation, the World Bank team was
active sharing lessons learned from innovation policies and programs in other Latin
American and OECD countries.

Following approval by the World Bank's Board in July 2008 and prior to effectiveness in
November 2009, the World Bank's team maintained a very active dialogue with
Government counterparts and conducted supervision missions, helping with the
implementation of the first project activities as noted in section 4 below. The World
Bank management team also maintained active discussions with the Ministry of Finance
to follow up on the reasons concerning delays in project effectiveness, in particular the
clearance process by the Comptroller's Office.

In May 2010, two months after the new Government took office, the World Bank team
conducted a mission to discuss the project's objectives and its scope with the new
leadership at the Ministry of Economy, Who expressed a different policy approach·
towards innovation as discussed in the following section.

4. Assessment of Borrower Performance
 (government and implementing agency performance, compliance with covenants,
justification for rating):

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

From the early stages of project preparation, the Government established project units at
each of the three executing agencies (the Ministry of Economy, CORFO and CONICYT),
which facilitated project preparation. The three units actively contributed to the design of
the project following the guidelines of the Inter-ministerial Committee on Innovation. In
particular, the unit at the Ministry of Economy played a leadership role in coordinating
activities among the three institutions; its head reported directly to the Minister of
Economy, Chair of the Inter-ministerial Committee on Innovation.

Following Board approval in July 2008, the loan agreement was signed by the Minister of
Finance in December 2008. Project effectiveness did not take place until November 2009,
after the project was cleared by the Comptroller's Office. Despite the unusual delay, the
Comptroller's Office did not have observations on the project's objectives and scope.
During this period, the executing agencies, especially the . Ministry of Economy and
CORFO, were active launching the first project activities. Most importantly, the Ministry



                                            7
of Economy created a monitoring and evaluation unit for innovation and competitiveness,
started to gather new indicators on STI, and completed the first studies and evaluations;
CORFO developed a framework for monitoring and evaluating InnovaChile's programs
(Component 3.3) and completed the first phase of the process for selecting the
beneficiaries of Component 3.2 to establish technology centers. Activities moved more
slowly at CONICYT, although they also started to gather new indicators on science and
technology complementing the actions of the other two implementation agencies.

A few months after project effectiveness, a new Government took office. The approach
of the new Government on innovation policy differs markedly from the innovation
strategy prepared by the previous National Innovation Council for Competitiveness,
which served as a key guiding framework for the project along with stakeholder
consultations. The new Government considers that the public sector should not play an
active role in addressing market failures (or that there are substantial market failures)
related to innovation and proceeded to request project cancellation.

5. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and ofwide general application)

The main lesson learned is that consultations with a wide range of stakeholders are
critical to the success of a project, but this might not suffice if there is an important
political change in the country. In circumstances where a very substantial change in the
policy direction occurs, project cancellation might often be the preferable course of
action.
