 Tanzania. The main project objective was to create an\n            effective institutional and financial framework for the\n            urban sector and prepare a sustainable urban infrastructure\n            investment and maintenance program.  Bank's performance\n            was satisfactory. Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory.The principal lesson learned in project design\n            is that the severe deterioration of urban infrastructure and\n            the need for fundamental changes in institutional and policy\n            mechanisms is likely to require a series of projects,\n            instead of a single technical assistance project and a\n            follow-up investment vehicle to comprehensively  address\n            sector needs in light of local capacity constraints. This is\n            especially true in a country, such as Tanzania, which\n            historically has had a high degree of centralization."}, "docdt": "1998-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
