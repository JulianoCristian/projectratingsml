3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The stated project objective was to support the Government's efforts to: (a) restore the normal functioning
of the power sector following the recent energy supply crisis; and (b) address the immediate regulatory
problems that were the underlying cause of the crisis. Additionally, one of the aims was to help address
longer-term issues through technical assistance, but this was not spelled out as a specific objective, because
it would be difficult to assess the results within the timeframe of the project.

The electricity supply crisis was the worst that Brazil had ever experienced. Its immediate cause was a
severe and prolonged drought. Rainfall had been below average since 1997, so the reservoirs were
gradually getting depleted. In 2001, rainfall dropped to 50% of normal in the South and Southeast, and
20% of normal in the North and Northeast. By October 2001, average reservoir levels had fallen to 21% of
capacity in the populous Southeast, and 8% of capacity in the poor Northeast, compared to more typical
levels of 40% for that time of year (the end of the dry season). As 90% of Brazil's generation capacity is
hydroelectric (the highest of any major country), a power consumption rationing of about 20 percent was
required to avoid widespread blackouts and brownouts.

But the underlying problem, which had left Brazil vulnerable, was a regulatory system that made it difficult
to finance new investments in power generation (especially thermal generation) because of the absence of
capacity charges and the lack of incentive for distributors to sign long-term purchase contracts with new
generators. This was exacerbated by transmission bottlenecks (so that power could not be transmitted from
the North and South, where the situation was not as dire), under-valuation of the opportunity cost of water,
delays and uncertainties in the process of environmental licensing, and poor coordination among
Government agencies (thereby delaying the policy response).

Once the Government recognized the severity of the crisis and the risks it posed for Brazil's overall
economic performance, around June 2001, it moved swiftly and effectively to ration electricity, so as to
limit the economic damage. Soon thereafter, it invited the Bank to send a mission to Brazil, to examine the
situation and propose how the Bank might assist. There was initially a great deal of uncertainty within the
Government about how to proceed with the reforms, and the Bank was able to provide essential technical
advice. This led to the preparation of the Energy Sector Reform Loan (ESRL).

This sector adjustment loan was to be accompanied by a technical assistance loan, to lay the foundations
for future sector adjustment loans. However, the technical assistance operation did not proceed at the same
time, because of the difficulty of getting the various potential participating agencies on board, during the
waning months of the former administration. The loan has been discussed and renegotiated with the new
administration and presented to the Board on June 24, 2003.

Assessment. These objectives were appropriate and realistic, given the urgency of the crisis and the
limited amount of more fundamental reform that could be accomplished during the relatively brief period
before the end of the administration.

In fact, however, the actual objectives of the loan went somewhat beyond those stated in the "Loan and
Program Summary," to include laying the foundation for more long-term reforms to improve sector
efficiency and to move towards universal service. This was also appropriate, because of the complexity
of the sector issues and the need for additional study and experimentation to optimize the system design.
Furthermore, addressing the needs of the under-served poor and rural areas was important in terms of
addressing poverty and inequality in Brazil.          Of course, the ultimate impact of these longer-term

measures was dependent upon the continuation of such movement by the following administration. This
was a risk worth taking.

The Bank was well placed to pursue these objectives because of its long history of involvement with
Brazil's power sector, including in key areas of the project reforms.

The hydrocarbons sector was not addressed (except in terms of its linkage with electricity production),
which suggests that it might have been more accurate to retain the original title of "Power Sector
Reform Loan." The issues affecting natural gas are quite important and complicated, especially as
relates to the quasi-monopoly power of Petrobras. However, there was no consensus in Brazil on either
the need for or the nature of desirable changes (there was, of course, no hydrocarbons crisis analogous
to the electricity crisis), so any attempt to include hydrocarbons fully would have resulted in major
delays if not cancellation of the loan.

3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable.

3.3 Original Components:
The loan had 20 conditions [listed as (a) to (t) below], grouped into 7 categories. All were met before
Board presentation:

Effective management of the energy crisis, by: (a) an efficient rationing system that protected the poor,
by exempting households consuming less than 100kWh/mo.; (b) contracting for emergency generating
capacity (2,000 MW), to get over the worst of the shortages until rainfall resumed; and (c) resolving the
financial disputes among power companies which had resulted from the crisis and totaled US$2.6 billion
between generators and distributors (because generators could not meet their power delivery contracts with
distributors) and US$2.0 billion between distributors and the regulatory agency, ANEEL (because
Government-imposed rationing led to financial losses by distributors).

Market reform, by decisions to: (d) improve the functioning of the wholesale market, in several ways, (e)
sell electricity from the federal utilities through public auction, rather than through negotiated contracts, so
as to reduce the opportunity to abuse the market power; (f) improve the operation and governance of the
system operator, by shifting power from stakeholders to technical experts; (g) provide greater diversity of
gas supply options, by getting Petrobras to offer alternatives to its traditional take-or-pay gas contracts;
and (h) prevent abuse of vertical integration, by dividing the main federal agencies into separate legal
entities for generation, transmission and distribution.

Regulatory reform, by: (i) ensuring timely pass-through of Parcela A costs by distribution companies
(these are uncontrollable costs, such as taxes, levies, the cost of power purchased under initial contracts,
and charges for power from the Itaipu hydro plant, which is jointly owned with Paraguay); (j) improving
the Valor Normativo system for pass through of energy purchase costs (which sets a ceiling for each type
of fuel); (k) requiring rebalancing of retail tariffs, to more accurately reflect costs and thereby eliminate the
subsidization of large industrial consumers; (l) mandating development of a comprehensive distribution
price review methodology, in advance of the 56 distribution tariff reviews due in 2003-04; (m) mandating
that transmission tariffs be revised to more fully reflect geographic variations in cost, and thereby lead to
more economic siting of generation; and (n) agreeing to study how to establish improved incentives to
maintain reliability of electricity supply.

Environmental and social progress, by: (o) preparing a program to improve planning and management of



                                                        - 3 -

environmental and social issues in the power sector, primarily by mainstreaming them early in the
expansion planning cycle, clarifying institutional roles, strengthening environmental staffing, carrying out
specific studies, and strengthening environmental monitoring and evaluation.

Protection of the poor, by: (p) setting national eligibility rules for low-income electricity tariff discounts
(for all households using less than 80 kWh/mo., and certain households in the 80-220 kWh/mo. range),
thereby ending the inconsistencies which had developed among the various distributors; and (q) calling for
mandatory connection targets, to eventually reach universal access within a two to ten-year period
(depending on the state).

Expanded energy efficiency and renewable energy, by: (r) mandating additional energy efficiency
standards, for electrical equipment and new buildings; and (s) providing incentives for renewable energy,
especially small hydro, wind and biomass.

Institutional reform, by: (t) agreeing to studies to restructure the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME),
to enable it to take over the role of policy maker and planning coordinator previously played by Eletrobras.

Assessment. This set of conditions was appropriate for the project objectives, and represent a very
serious and well-orchestrated effort by the Government, in consultation with the Bank, to address the
problems of the power sector, which was made possible by the urgency, importance and high profile of
the electricity crisis. There was a good mix of immediate measures to deal with the crisis and the most
obvious regulatory flaws, and studies to lay the basis for the next round of reforms. The measures to
protect/assist the poor were also important for a country such as Brazil with wide income disparities,
and could provide an important linkage to the priorities of the incoming administration.

3.4 Revised Components:
Not applicable.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
This was rated "satisfactory" by the QAG review in July 2002, but the ICR considers it "highly
satisfactory." The objectives were consistent with the CAS, and dealt with economic growth (by resolving
the electricity crisis), efficiency (by improving the regulatory system), poverty (by expanding access) and
environment (by improving management of environmental issues in the sector). Because of the nature of
this loan, Bank safeguard policies were not involved.

The project was quite comprehensive (as far as electricity, not hydrocarbons, was concerned), covering
virtually all the important sector issues (see above).

The QAG review points out 4 areas for possible improvement: (a) more specific monitoring arrangements;
(b) expanded treatment of social issues, including the feasibility of universal coverage; (c) analysis of the
financial condition of the sector; and (d) greater recognition of the implications of Petrobras' de facto
monopoly of the gas sector. The Region disagreed on points (a) and (b). On point (a), the Region's
response was firstly that standard monitoring arrangements were incompatible with a single-tranche loan,
and secondly that the forthcoming technical assistance project (followed perhaps by further adjustment
loans) would provide the vehicle for monitoring. The ICR review concurs with the QAG on this point.
Because this was intended to be the first in a series of loans for the sector, it was particularly important to
have good monitoring arrangements in place, and the delay in negotiation of the technical assistance project
has left a long gap in this respect. Establishment of a comprehensive electricity sector monitoring system
could have been incorporated either as one of the loan conditions, or in a side letter.

On point (b), the ICR review concurs with the Region that very substantial progress was made in respect to
the social issues, and a process was established for further work by the electricity regulatory agency,
ANEEL. Given the surprisingly weak data available, the many distribution companies involved, and the
need to process this project rapidly to deal with the power sector crisis, the appraisal mission did as much
as could be expected in this area. The additional analysis that is needed could better be done in the context
of sector work or preparation of an operation more focused on these matters.

On points (c) and (d) there is no disagreement between QAG and the Region. But in partial defense of the
Region, the ICR would point out the political sensitivity of the issue of Petrobras' power, and the
complexity of the sector's financial condition, especially given the large number of both private and public
companies, and the payment issues between generators and distributors that were still being resolved as the
loan was being prepared.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Overall rating ­ satisfactory. The objective of restoring the normal functioning of the sector was met
before Board approval, due initially to the measures taken by Government (loan conditions (a) to (c)), and,
later, to the resumption of normal rainfall levels.

Subsequent to the approval of the loan, the Government continued making progress. As detailed in the
November 2002 "Fourth Progress Report" of the Committee for Revitalization of the Electricity Sector
Model, this was primarily in four areas:

       (a)    Auction of "old energy" (freed up by the expiration of Initial Contracts), which was the first
              attempt to establish an energy market in Brazil. For 2003, an average of 4,600 MW was
              offered, to meet a demand of 1,300 MW (estimated demand above existing contracts), at
              satisfactory prices. Distributors are required to obtain at least 95% of actual demand from
              existing contracts plus auctions.

       (b)    Vertical separation. Accounts of physical distribution have been separated from
              commercialization, with ANEEL to issue the appropriate regulations. Free consumers will be
              able to have separate contracts for purchase of energy, transport and connection. For captive
              consumers, distributors will have to purchase energy through auction, even if they are
              generators as well.

       (c)    Tariff rationalization. ANEEL, by January 2004, will set the methodology and procedures for
              introducing capacity charges. Cross-subsidies in the "energy" component of tariffs will be
              gradually eliminated, by 2006. ANEEL has continued to take the necessary steps to improve
              the methodology for calculation of the Valor Normativo and Factor X.

       (d)    Improved functioning of the wholesale market.        ANEEL issued new regulations on the
              financial clearance of wholesale transactions, the methodology for calculating losses, the
              methodology for hourly transmission pricing, and the selection of the tax regime for market
              participants.

It is too early to tell the extent and direction to which progress will continue under the new administration.
Initial indications, such as the recent successful negotiations of the TA Loan, suggest that while the
Government may introduce modifications in the power sector model, there will not be any major
backtracking, and there will be continuing dialogue with the Bank.

The following table compares the expected follow-through actions recorded in the Report and
Recommendation of the President and the actions completed by the Government since the Loan approval.

4.2 Outputs by components:
See table above.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Several of the project conditions are related directly to institutional capability.          Resolution of the
intra-sector financial disputes (condition (c)) has helped restore the financial health of the power companies
(public and private), and enabled them to clean up their accounts. The change in the governance structure
of the system operator (ONS), by transferring some of the power from Eletrobras subsidiaries to technical
experts, should enable it to operate in a more objective manner. It is too early to tell what impact the
studies to restructure the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) will have, as it will take the new
administration some months to decide on such matters.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
With the accession to power of an administration with a different economic perspective, it remains to be
seen what will happen regarding the follow up to these measures. However, some of the key people
involved in the sector reforms are still in the Government, and the new administration has not backtracked
on any of these measures. Even more positively, the new administration is keenly interested in the TA
Project from the Bank.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government was able to implement the wide-ranging reform measures because of the impetus resulting
from the critical electricity crisis. It formed a high-level coordinating body, which had unprecedented
authority to address a wide range of sector issues. Even after the crisis was ended (by a combination of
rainfall, conservation and emergency power generation capacity), progress continued because of
recognition that more fundamental steps had to be taken to minimize the risk of future crises.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
See 5.2.

5.4 Costs and financing:
Not applicable.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainability was rated "likely" because of the consensus within Brazil, which crosses party lines, of
the need to prevent a repetition of the energy crisis. Furthermore, international experience to date has not
been marked by any dramatic reversals of power sector reforms. In addition, the steps toward accelerating
the expansion of access in poor and rural areas, and towards ensuring a standard policy for subsidization of
low-income consumers, should be regarded very favorably by the new administration. And while the new
administration's commitment to the overall power sector reform program is still uncertain, its willingness to



                                                     - 10 -

proceed with the TA Project is a very hopeful sign.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Experience in many countries has shown that power sector reform is not just a matter of setting up an
appropriate system and letting it operate, but rather requires continuous monitoring and fine tuning, based
on experience and changing circumstances. This, in turn, requires capable institutions. In Brazil, there is a
great need to strengthen MME (to take over the role once played by Eletrobras, which is now only one of
many operators in the sector) and operationalize CNPE (to take over from GCE, which was always
intended to be a temporary body).

The Government will need to address these institutional needs if it wishes to ensure the sustainability of the
recent progress in the sector. The technical assistance loan will finance advice to the Government and
could finance the technical work required for preparing program loans.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank responded promptly to the Borrower's expression of interest in helping deal with the electricity
crisis. The bank fielded three large technical missions, which included the Director of PSD, the Energy
Sector Manager, regulatory specialists from the Center, and consultants from NERA. It gave good advice
to the Government, and designed a complex operation consistent both with the CAS and with Government
priorities. The Bank moved quite quickly, from identification to Board presentation in just under a year. It
coordinated closely with the IFC, which was at the time preparing a loan to finance green-field generation.
The Bank also coordinated with IDB. There was a great deal of support from the CMU, in particular from
the country Lead Economist, and the Country Director. Cooperation between the Bank and Brazil appears
to have been particularly good.

The Bank showed appropriate flexibility in responding to the Brazilian request that the loan be changed to
a single tranche operation. The Bank originally preferred two tranches, so that the conditions could be as
comprehensive as needed, but initiation of the operation would not be delayed by the additional measures
that Brazil had yet to take. However, the Government took most of those measures very promptly, and
made the reasonable argument that it would be much cleaner to complete the operation during the outgoing
administration, rather than have the project caught up in and consequently delayed by the transition.
Furthermore, both the Bank and the Government agreed that it would be better to try to convince the new
administration of the value of the reforms, rather than to have it inherit a legal document with which it
might not agree.

The President's Report is well written and generally comprehensive, with only the few exceptions noted
above under Quality at Entry (analyses of the gas sector and of the financial condition of the power sector).
The loan conditionality is appropriate, except for the lack of monitoring (also noted above). The sector
risks are well described, and their mitigation was addressed by the technical assistance project.

As the QAG assessment noted, "the Bank team was also of high quality with expertise and practical
experience in relevant reform areas," and there was "strong country management leadership in backing the
ESRL and working closely with the task team." LAC management gave this operation high priority and
was willing to invest the resources needed.

The PPIAF grant of US$468,000, which became effective in April 2002, for ESRL preparation and
implementation during the remainder of 2002, was a very useful approach, as it enabled the Borrower to do


                                                    - 11 -

its work faster and with greater expertise. The grant provided technical assistance on: (a) the auction of
purchase or marketing rights from state owned generators; (b) alternative methodologies for establishing a
rate base for the new distribution tariff methodology; (c) market based methodologies to establish
maximum prices for power purchases; (d) a "second-generation" assessment of possible legal and
institutional changes to the existing power sector regulatory system; and (e) refinement of data to better
target tariff subsidies to genuinely poor customers. The work was done by mini-teams of international and
Brazilian consultants, who prepared short reports and presentations for the key Brazilian decision makers
on pending reform decisions. Because the same four Bank staff handled both the PPIAF grant and the
ESRL, there was an appropriately close coordination between the two operations.

7.2 Supervision:
Not applicable (Single-tranche adjustment loan).

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The QAG assessment was that the Bank's performance was "satisfactory." The ICR believes that it
deserves "highly satisfactory." The representative of the Borrower wrote: "I think the loan was timely and
the technical assistance (including through the PPIAF component) of outstanding quality. The work of the
WB staff.... was extremely helpful in an array of issues. The swift response in areas such as tariff review
greatly contributed to the positive solution of key issues in the area."

The QAG review team was divided as to whether the Bank was wise to make such a loan shortly before
national elections, with some members believing that this "left the Bank vulnerable to backtracking on
reform by a new government ...." While this is certainly a risk, the timing was dictated by the electricity
crisis, and the Bank was correct to respond rapidly. Even if the new administration should backtrack on
some of the reforms, the project would have achieved its immediate objectives, and the studies being done
to underpin further reforms would still be of value if and when a later administration was interested. In
fact, Bank dialogue with new administration has been good, and a second program loan to support the
energy sector is still possible.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The quality of the borrower's preparation work was highly satisfactory. Once it realized the seriousness of
the crisis, the Government gave resolution of the power sector crisis top priority, and created a special
high-level body (the Energy Crisis Management Chamber, or GCE, chaired by the Chief of Staff of the
President, having the key Government ministers as members. The Government also created a special
technical committee (Comite de Revitalização do Modelo do Setor Elétrico) to study the causes of the crisis
in the power sector and recommend solutions to the GCE. In less than six months the committee prepared a
sound and comprehensive analysis of technical, institutional, economic, social and environmental issues.
The committee proposed 33 practical and effective corrective measures. (see Annex 7 for reference of
supporting reports) addressing all the major issues. The quality and depth of the analyses performed by the
committee was highly satisfactory. Most of these measures have been already implemented (see reference
on Annex 7 ­ Progress Report No.4).

7.5 Government implementation performance:
See 7.7.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
See 7.7.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:



                                                     - 12 -

The Borrower's performance was also "highly satisfactory." The Government came up not only with
"quick fixes" for the crisis, but also with a major set of longer-term measures. Despite considerable (and
justifiable) pride in its own technical competence in the sector, it invited the Bank to send an exploratory
mission, and was receptive to the Bank's suggestions. It achieved (primarily through legislation) most of
the conditions that the Bank proposed for the second tranche so promptly, that the Bank was able to agree
to shift to a one-tranche operation as the Borrower wished. (The Borrower strongly preferred a one-tranche
loan for two political reasons. First, this avoided giving the impression that they were undertaking reforms
at the Bank's behest. Second, it meant that the project would be completed during the outgoing
administration, and thus would not get caught up in the transition.)          Progress continued during the
remainder of 2002 in the key areas. The one major relevant area in which there has not been much
progress is reform of the natural gas sector, but despite the title of this project, that really lies outside the
scope of the loan.

8. Lessons Learned

The QAG review pointed out two lessons. The first is that because it often requires a major crisis to
produce the political will necessary for major power sector reforms, the Bank should maintain a low-key
dialogue with countries in this sector even when they are not in a reform mode, and be prepared to respond
when the opportunity for reform arises. The ICR concurs. This is especially true in sectors such as this
one, where the Bank has a long history of involvement and the resulting detailed knowledge.

The second lesson from the QAG review is that it is advantageous to complement adjustment operations
with small technical assistance loans, to help maintain the dialogue "while leaving the Bank free to
determine the appropriate timing of further reform interventions in an uncertain political climate." In this
case, although the TA loan was delayed, discussion of it with the new administration turned out to be a
good way to resume the sector dialogue.

A related lesson is that PPIAF grants can be a good way to provide urgent technical assistance in project
preparation. One key is to have the same staff involved in both operations.

Another lesson from this project is the importance of having a high level/big clout Government team,
supported by experienced technical teams, to manage the reform effort.

Finally, on a more technical note, Government demonstrated a way to manage a power sector crisis without
blackouts, through a clever 20% rationing, which included power saving targets and incentives to reduce
consumption (large consumers trading electricity quotas on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, low income
consumers being paid to reduce consumption). Other countries that come to face such a crisis would be
wise to study the Brazilian experience in resolving it.

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Evaluation from the borrower - Loan 7120-BR
(Letter from the Borrower)

Background

         Brazil faced a grave energy crisis in 2001, as a result of a severe drought. Most of the
electrical energy produced in the country comes from hydropower, and by the end of the first
quarter of 2001, it became clear that the energy stored in the reservoirs would not be enough



                                                    - 13 -

to supply more than 80% of the projected demand for that year. This crisis precipitated the
re-evaluation of the reforms of the energy sector started in 1995.

        By mid-1995, it became clear that the public sector alone could not continue to fulfill its
traditional role of building the main energy plants in the country. Moreover, mismanagement
and the impact of public policies had resulted in a severe deterioration of the financial and
operational standing of most distribution companies. The weakness of public distributors
impinged also on the financial standing of generators, since protracted delays in the payment
of purchased energy was common. As a result, the distribution sector was privatized with a
view to ensure an improvement in service and greater predictability in the income of generator,
which were to be considered for privatization in a second phase.

        The reform of the sector also included the creation of a regulatory agency and several
market mechanisms, governed by the economic agents operating in the electricity sector.
Unfortunately, the teething pains of many of these mechanisms hindered the ability of a quick
and organic development and implementation of this model. At the same time, a rapid pick up
in energy demand somehow led it to outpace the catch up in supply spurred by the opening of
the generation sector to the private sector. Also, severe coordination and governance
problems developed in some of the core market institution, such as the so-called Wholesale
Energy Market, MAE.

        The reaction of the government to the energy crisis in 2001 was predicated on a review
of the model, without discarding the option for greater reliance on the private sector and
competition. Also, the government strived to attract the support of the population and business
toward a temporary reduction in energy demand through incentives rather than through
command policies. Indeed, a 20% reduction in demand was achieved without the need to
resort to black outs or other harsh quantitative controls. Instead, pecuniary incentives were
provided to low-income consumers, and tradable permits granted to businesses. Owing to
these measures, the inconvenience and economic impact of the rationing was sharply
reduced. Actually, the economy managed to grow 1,5% in 2002, quite in line with the growth
of the world economy and ahead of that of most neighboring countries. Nonetheless,
maintaining competition and the private sector in energy production and distribution clearly
required direct and indirect economic support, as is common whenever the economy or a
specific sector undergoes a structural adjustment.

The Role of the World Bank in 2001 and up to Disbursement of SLC

        The World Bank offered its assistance early on in the crisis. The first step in this
assistance included bringing international experts, and several meetings with technical officials
of the ad hoc Task Force to Manage the Energy Crisis (CGCE).

        After a set of constructive discussions with the Brazilian side, the interest in a sectoral
loan that could bring support to the economy emerged. This became apparent, as the Brazilian
economy experienced a number of negative external shocks, the effects of which compounded
the impact of the energy crisis.

        The financial assistance of the World Bank recognized and helped support the quite
comprehensive efforts of the government to put the sector back in track. Already in 2001, the
government managed to clarify and settle numerous issues with electricity distributors,



                                               - 14 -

regarding mainly the pass through of increases in the price of purchased energy, as well as
the exposure of the industry to the shortfall in energy supply.

        The government also took the lead in overhauling some market mechanisms, in
particular the wholesale market. The self-governance structured of that market proved
ineffective and a source of conflicts between agents, also hampering the technical operation of
that body. The regulatory agency had to intervene to put the MAE on a sound footing.

        The analysis of the general framework for the sector pointed to some key issues to be
addressed in 2002. The strategy to be followed by the government throughout 2002 was set
in the so-called Progress Reports of the Revitalization Committee in charge to overhaul the
sector. These reports informed the policy basis over which the World Bank lent US$
450,000,000 to Brazil in a single-tranche sector adjustment loan.

Developments Since the Disbursement of the energy sector reform loan

        Among the key issues addressed in the Progress Report # 3 were:

       l How to deal with the energy produced by Federal Generators, part of which would
             be freed by the end of 2002
       l How to charge independent consumers and foster competition in the sector
       l How to increase the transparency in the energy tariffs
       l How to make generators accountable for their production and introduce a system of
             competitive biddings that would create a real energy wholesale market.
       l How to ensure the expansion of supply of energy
       l How to go about the periodic review of tariffs for energy distribution
       l Environmental Issues


The Auction of "Energia Velha"

        These problems have been successfully addressed by the government. The quite
ambitious choice of forcing that all energy freed from existing contracts (Contratos Inicais) be
auctioned was carried out to completion in October 2002. The result of these auctions offered
the first glimpse of the actual demand price in the country. Indeed, currently the prices in MAE
are actually computed through sophisticated mathematical software, rather than set by the
market. The auction of energy--which was the largest ever carried out in the world--provided
true market price signals for the first time.

        As an interesting result of the pioneering auction, the prices resulting from the
competitive process have helped refrain some companies from engaging in the self dealings
allowed by grandfathering rules in the existing regulation.

        A second effect has been to force the big generators to face market risk, and -- as
such -- implement one of the keystones of the reform of the sector. Differentiated outcomes
across generators have also evidenced the deftness of different managerial approaches.

The Restructuring of Tariffs and the Incentive for Free Consumers

        Another key point that has shown remarkable progress is the so-called "opening" and

restructuring of distribution and transmission tariffs. In the case of distribution tariffs, the
objective is to charge captive and free consumers in the same way, so that the decision of the
consumer can be taken on a level playing field.

        The "opening" of tariffs is also a way to gradually eliminate any cross subsidies, or--in
the case of social or other policies that call for them--to make them transparent.

        Some of these measures were enshrined in legislation at the October meeting of the
National Council of Energy Policy; others will be passed in November 2002.

The New Bidding Process for Generators

        Another key feature of the program carried out by the Brazilian Authorities deals with
the way to foster the best use of the water reservoirs, along with competition in the sector. For
this purpose, a careful system of bids was designed and is currently being tested. The big
challenge is to build a system that takes into account the endogenous relations between
different river basins. Indeed, a bidding system with river basins that are linked and affected
by correlated shocks ought to be much more complex than systems dealing with independent
thermal plants. Given the extent to which bidding systems for thermal plants have proved to
be fragile, extra care is to be taken with the water system, also to avoid a disconnect between
business commitment and actual use of the water (which will in part remain in the hands of the
National System Operator).

        Agents have been discussing a methodology throughout 2002, under the leadership of
the government. A methodology has been developed taking into account all the contributions
received by the Revitalization Committee and a seminar explaining it and showing the tests to
which it has been subject will be held in the second half of 2002.

Ensuring Long-Term Supply

        The major challenge in market-based systems has been to ensure the adequate
medium- and long-term supply. Experience in Europe has not been very suggestive, because
of the structural overcapacity that exists there (built at the time the systems were owned by the
state, or closely regulated). Very little investment has occurred in those countries. The
experience in the U.S. is also mixed. Chile has managed to increase supply, but several
scholars have pointed out the ambivalences of the system--in particular as concerns the
tradeoff between incentives to invest and efficiency resulting from real competition.

        Also, it has been advanced by many scholars and practitioners that prices from the
wholesale market may not be very helpful for investment decisions because energy is a
non-storable good. As such, the usual inter-temporal connections that support investment
decisions are sharply weakened. In the case of Brazil, where price volatility is very high due to
the high correlation and volatility of water supply, simple reliance on market prices has proved
inadequate. As such, the government is developing a minimum set of rules that provide the
incentives for distributors to contract new capacity in advance. This set of rules takes into
account the impact of risk sharing regarding any regulation, and has received comments from
multilateral institutions, such as the IADB. Conversations with the World Bank have also been
useful.

The Tariff Review Process

        The Brazilian regulator has developed a new methodology that tries to accommodate
the more sophisticated techniques used across the world to the specificities of the Brazilian
case. The World Bank has helped in this discussion through the PPIAF that was granted in
tandem with the Energy Sector Reform Loan. The Bank brought the former heads of the
British and Uruguayan regulatory bodies, as well as a Chilean consultant. This contribution
has been important to the task force that is refining the methodology, taking into account also
the long-term effects of a tariff policy.

Taking Into Account the Environment

        The environment is one of the most valuable assets of Brazil. The biodiversity,
including large areas of rain forest is an integral part of the national identity and a treasured
heritage of the whole society. Ensuring that economic development does not occur at the
expense of the environment has thus been a priority of the current administration.

        In the case of the energy sector, a number of environmental instances get involved
throughout the life of any project. This may be very expensive and be a barrier for the private
sector if it is not accompanied by a clear coordinating role.

        This role has been achieved through protocols between the Ministries of Mines and
Energy and the Environment. These protocols have set the basis of mutual consultations and
also ways to speed up review processes. Efforts to improve the coordination with state
environmental agencies continue under way.

Overall Assessment of the role of the World bank

        The intervention of the World Bank in this process was timely and consistent. The
Bank has participated with advice since mid 2001, and the WB staff has consulted with sector
agents and society in general.

        Dialog with the Brazilian authorities was open and constructive. The WB's technical
assistance (including through the PPIAF) was of outstanding quality and extremely helpful in
an array of issues. The swift response in areas such as tariff review greatly contributed to the
positive solution of key issues in the area.
