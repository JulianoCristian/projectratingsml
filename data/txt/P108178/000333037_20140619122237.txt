                           KRYGYZ REPUBLIC SECOND LAND AND REAL ESTATE

                                                           REGISTRATION PROJECT



1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

After a period of considerable reform in the 1990s and early 2000s, the Kyrgyz Republic entered
into a phase of stagnation, increased corruption and some reversal of the reform process, which
culminated in the Tulip Revolution of March 2005. Political and social turmoil followed, lasting
several years. However, the economy continued to expand, with the real estate and mortgage
markets developing, and important land administration policy and practical reforms continuing to
be undertaken. Due to the Kyrgyz economy’s relative isolation, the impact of the 2008 global
economic crisis was not felt at the time of appraisal, although it was subsequently experienced in
2009-2010 and made worse by a related banking crisis.1

The project was a follow on project to the successful Land and Real Estate Registration Project
(LRERP) (IDA Credit 3370 KG/P049719), which ran from 2000 to 2008 and was rated as highly
satisfactory. That project supported the formation of a new registration authority (the State
Agency on Registration of Rights to Immovable Property or “Gosregister”), creation of a unified
system of real property and legal rights, establishment of some 50 offices across the country, and
registration of 2.4 million real estate objects (REUs) such as land, houses and apartments. The
land sector had developed rapidly since land, houses and apartments were privatized in the
1990s, with an active market of sales, leasing and mortgaging. In fact, between 2002 and 2007,
mortgages worth US$ 2.7 billion were issued. Essentially, the project was designed to expand
and consolidate the coverage and functions of the real estate registration system created in the
first project, and in so doing create a stable and sustainable institutional basis to underlie the
expanding real estate sector in the country.

The project was consistent with the four pillars of the government’s Country Development
Strategy (CDS) for 2007-2010: growth-oriented economic development and improving the
business environment; governance and transparency in public administration; human
development; and environmental sustainability. The government had identified a reliable, well-
functioning real property registration system as a key priority. The project was also consistent

          The Kyrgyz banking system, which is dominated by foreign-owned banks, was affected by the global
          financial crisis. Kyrgyzstan’s largest private bank, Asia Universal Bank (AUB), which accounted for about
          50 per cent of all deposits, faced involuntary bankruptcy charges as it allegedly froze US$ 11 million in client
          assets for its own liquidity needs. The AUB (along with six other banks) was placed under temporary
          administration and subsequently nationalized. AUB went through bankruptcy procedures and its assets were
          restructured and privatized. While the banking sector was reprivatized, it led to a sharp fall in demand, lack
          of credit and liquidity in the market, and a fall in deposits and loss of confidence in the banking sector. This,
          in turn, has negative consequences for the deepening of the financial sector and the development of the
          mortgage market.

                                                                    1	
	
with three of the objectives of the Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) for 2007-2010, which
built on the CDS, of economic management consistent with strong and sustained pro-poor
growth; reduction of corruption, improvement of governance and effective public administration;
and building sustainable human and social capital through education.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to “support markets for land and real estate and
the more intensive and effective use of land and real estate. This will be done through the further
development of a reliable and well-functioning system for registration of rights in immovable
property.”2 The outcomes and outcome indicators linked to the PDO were:

            improved functioning of, and access to, sales and long-term lease market - It was
             envisaged that there would be a 26 per cent cumulative increase above 2007 levels in the
             number of sales and leases, and that registration processing times would be reduced to
             half a day for individuals and one day for firms;
            increased access to credit - An indicator of at least 31 per cent increase above 2007
             levels in the number of registered mortgages was adopted;
            property rights clear, secure and reflected in an accessible information base - This was
             to be demonstrated through a continued increase in the total number of REUs in the
             registry system, and continued improvements in the quality of registry operations,
             communications and reputation;
            a financially and institutionally sustainable land administration system - This was to be
             shown by key central functions of the registry being fully funded by registry revenue, and
             by the registration process itself being streamlined to optimize efficiency and ensure fully
             adequate and sustainable funding.

The outcome indicators were complemented by 11 intermediate results indicators (one for each
subcomponent), plus core sector indicators for land administration projects.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

While the PDO was not revised, key outcome and performance indicators were revised on two
occasions. The first revision took place in January 2011 and involved changes of the PDO level
indicators and six of the 11 intermediate indicators. The PDO level indicators were modified,
primarily in terms of their targets and target dates, as follows:

            regarding growth in the number of registered sale and lease transactions, the targets were
             postponed and the final target reduced from 26 to 20 per cent cumulative increase to take
             into account the 2009-2010 recession, banking crisis and 2010 ethnic-based conflicts,3 all

          The PDO was expressed slightly differently in the Financing Agreement of 2008 as: to support markets for,
          and the more intensive and effective use of, land and real estate through further development of a reliable and
          well-functioning system for registration of rights in immovable property	
3
          In 2010, a series of violent attacks on ethnic groups, particularly in the South, resulted in the deaths of many
          hundreds of people and, according to the United Nations, displacement of some 400,000 people.

                                                             2	
	
             of which affected the real property market and provision of credit;
            the reference to long-term leases in the first outcome indicator was dropped to simplify it
             and because policy reform on community pastures had reduced the number of leases
             being registered;
            a common target for reduced registration processing times to both individuals and firms
             was adopted to simplify matters, there was a one year postponement of the final target for
             individuals, and a more ambitious final target of half a day for firms was adopted;
            targets for increased numbers of mortgages were postponed and reduced from 31 to 20
             per cent cumulative increase to take in to account the 2009-2010 recession, banking crisis
             and ethnic conflict;
            targets for a financially and institutionally sustainable land administration system were
             postponed to take into account implementation problems due to disruptions in agency
             leadership and structural re-organization (see 2.2 below).4

A one year extension was also granted, and as a consequence of the additional time, a further
target was added for the final year of the last outcome indicator so that the financially sustainable
system would be operating for at least one year, fully funded by registry revenue. Similar
references to “at least one year” were added to several of the subcomponent targets, together
with some additional target items.

The second set of revisions occurred in the restructuring of May 2013. The changes were based
around a modification of the last PDO level indicator on the establishment of self-funding
support for key central functions of the registry (related to the project outcome of a financially
and institutionally sustainable land administration system). Based on an extension of six months,
the target of “for at least one year” was removed so that the indicator reflected the fact that
achievement of this objective would not occur before the penultimate year of the project (but
rather only in the last six months). Also, the word “fully” was removed to reflect the decision
that not all local registration offices (LROs) would be under one financial management structure,
as originally foreseen.5

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The target population was those who held rights in real property or who were acquiring such
rights, plus government authorities (at national, regional and local level) that manage public land

																																																								
4
          As part of the restructuring, and consequential on the PDO level indicator changes,	 the intermediate
          indicators were also changed as to their targets and target dates. A new target date was set for subcomponent
          1.b to take into account the additional project year. The targets for subcomponents 1.c and 1.e were
          postponed to take into account disruptions in the agency leadership and delays by the government in
          considering the proposal to form a single enterprise. The target in subcomponent 2.a was reduced to correct
          an error in the original estimate of the number of REUs that need to be registered, and the indicator was
          altered to delete the reference to “non-private” because most public lands had already been registered. In
          subcomponent 2.b, the targets were revised in light of a revised methodology. The target in subcomponent
          2.c was revised to focus on an index of price information rather than valuation software, because mass
          valuation was unlikely to be implemented during the project period for lack of political consensus.
5
          Consequently, the indicators for subcomponents 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.d were modified to remove the words “for
          at least one year”, and the indicator for subcomponent 1.c was amended to reflect a more limited model of
          financial management integration of the LROs and also a delayed roll out for the financial accounting system.

                                                            3	
	
and thus directly or indirectly implies coverage of almost the entire population of Kyrgyzstan.
Other beneficiaries were those wanting to use the information base that was developed under the
LRERP, particularly real estate professionals (including banks, surveyors, notaries, and realtors).
Although it was not expressly stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the project’s
expected achievements would also have spill over benefits for the country’s entire economy
through future investment and real estate market effects, financial deepening and social stability.

1.5 Original Components

Three components were designed to support progress to reaching the PDO:

1. Organizational Development and Improved Services, with six subcomponents:
     performance, strategy and communications: resulting in a permanent unit with the
       capacity and resources to monitor all aspects of Gosregister’s performance, recommend
       strategic and other improvements, and communicate effectively with all stakeholders;
     information technology (IT) support: resulting in improved and expanded IT facilities,
       integration of registration and cadastre data, creation of a website portal, and
       establishment of a permanent unit to maintain and develop Gosregister’s IT systems;
     agency financial management and procurement: providing an automated accounting and
       reporting system, internal audit function, and subject to a government decision re-
       organization and consolidation of Gosregister;
     records management improvement: providing improved climate control and back-up
       arrangements for archives in all offices, digital archives completed in Bishkek and Osh,
       and imaging of current records operational in all offices;
     organizational structure and facilities: resulting in all operational and capital maintenance
       expenses, including those of headquarters functions, covered by income from
       registration; and
     project management: to ensure completion of the project on schedule.

2. Expanding Spatial and Legal Land and Real Estate Data, with three subcomponents:
     systematic registration of REUs: to register at least 120,000 REUs, mostly in novostroiki
       areas and 70,000 public REUs in urban areas, as well as registration of some community
       pasture lands;
     upgrading cadastral mapping: to improve the maps created under the LRERP, using
       satellite images or orthophotomaps, covering 7 million hectares, and production of
       orthophotomaps covering 34,000 hectares in 23 towns; and
     valuation support: to develop and operate valuation software for government use, and
       improve access to land and real estate market information.

3. Professional Development and Standards, with two subcomponents: human resource
development of Gosregister staff, through 45 technical, professional and management courses
over three years; and support for educational institutions and professional bodies (and their
members) involved in real property, supporting upgraded curricula, delivery of nine courses on
land and real property related subjects, and improved licensing arrangements and standards for
land market professional bodies.


                                                4	
	
1.6 Revised Components

The second component, entitled Expanding Spatial and Legal Land and Real Estate Data, was
revised in the first restructuring of January 2011 to alter the target numbers for systematic
registration and upgrading of cadastral mapping, and also to revise the basis of producing
cadastral maps from satellite images (orthophotomaps) to digitizing of existing cadastre maps
supported by geo-referencing in the field using global positioning satellite (GPS) equipment.
This change was necessary because the figures on which the initial estimates for systematic
registration of REUs were based proved to be incorrect. Also, government funds had become
available to cover the costs of satellite images, so the grant funds could be put to other uses.
Finally, the technical advice was that digitizing existing maps and refining them with geo-
referencing would be a more useful and economic approach to producing maps.

1.7 Other significant changes

The other significant changes during the course of the project were:

       Mid-term review of February 2010. This mission identified and addressed the various
        problems facing the project, leading to the remedial actions of the first restructuring.
       Restructuring of January 2011. As discussed, key outcome and performance indicators
        were revised for several reasons.
       Extension of the project closing date from May 31, 2012 to May 31, 2013 (as part of the
        January 2011 restructuring). The primary reason for this extension was to compensate for
        the time lost due to the uncertainties and frequent changes in leadership of Gosregister
        following its re-organization into the Department of Cadastre and Registration (DCR) in
        late 2009 (see below). The Bank’s acting Country Director approved this extension.
       Restructuring of May 2013. As discussed, the last PDO indicator was revised in light of
        delays in achieving self-financing status.
       Extension of the project closing date from May 31, 2013 to December 31, 2013 (as part of
        the May 2013 restructuring). The reason for this extension was to provide sufficient time
        for the government’s decision on the structure and organization of the land registry to be
        made and then implemented. The Bank’s Country Director approved this extension.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis: The background analysis was thorough, with preparation
taking place over the final year of the LRERP (simultaneously with supervision of the LRERP).
The Bank team had long and extensive experience with land administration, including in the
Kyrgyz Republic. As a follow on project, the issues within Gosregister, Kyrgyz land
administration and the wider context were well understood. In addition to the studies undertaken
for the PAD (environmental, economic), the team took into account both positive and negative
aspects of the LRERP, as outlined in the LRERP ICR, plus findings of an extensive customer
survey and results of interviews with a wide range of stakeholders conducted by Gosregister. The
choice for another project, rather than to leave support to other donors, was based on the Bank’s

                                                5	
	
capacity to provide funds for technical and infrastructure work as well as technical advice (as
part of project supervision) across a range of land administration and good governance areas.

Assessment of the project design: Although there were 11 subcomponents, the fundamental
design of the project, its objectives and organization were relatively simple. The PDO was a
continuation of the objective successfully pursued under the LRERP, and it was consistent with
the government’s and Gosregister’s objectives. A follow on project was required both to
complete the work left unfinished under the LRERP (particularly registration of state land and
informal settlements), to consolidate the LRERP’s achievements, and to raise Gosregister’s
operations to a more sophisticated and sustainable level. SIDA funded technical experts were
also closely involved, and other donors were engaged during supervision and preparation
missions, particularly the USAID-funded Land Reform Project. Further, the preparation team
worked with the Bank funded Bishkek Osh Urban Infrastructure Project and the Agriculture
Investment and Services Project to ensure coordinated efforts and maximize outcomes between
the projects, particularly in terms of mapping by the SLRERP. Components 2 and 3 on technical
works and training were of a standard type in the Bank’s land registration projects across the
ECA region for the last 20 years and largely unproblematic. Only certain organizational aspects
of Component 1, which relied on the project funding key services during a transition period,
could be described as potentially problematic because it was uncertain that Gosregister would
ultimately reach self-funding status. The design was therefore couched in terms of this risk (see
below). Finally, the indicators were well defined, most were easily measurable, and they clearly
related to the project’s PDO and activities.

Adequacy of government’s commitment, etc.: During preparation, there was strong support from
within the government, particularly from Gosregister but also from other ministries that were to
benefit from accurate and accessible land records, such as the Ministry of Agriculture. As the
project was consistent with the government’s CDS 2007-2010 and the JCSS 2007-2010, there
was acceptance at higher levels of government of the need for the project and its design.
Acceptance of some controversial grant covenants, particularly the obligation to make secret
coordinates public, demonstrated the government’s commitment. Gosregister staff, both
headquarters staff and LRO specialists, demonstrated commitment in diligently developing each
of the subcomponents, its funding needs and work plan.

Assessment of risks: As the list of risk on page 8 of the PAD shows, risks were closely
considered and a set of mitigation measures was developed. The risks reflected a range of
possible problems, from the unstable political and economic environment of the Kyrgyz
Republic (rated a moderate risk), through to organizational and governance risks within the
government and Gosregister, to technical and legislative risks. Volatility in the banking system
and property market was also identified as a risk, although a low level one. The risk that the
government would not agree to Gosregister becoming a stand-alone, self-financing agency was
identified, but it was noted that other arrangements to fund central level functions from registry
income would be available. Others risks (and responses) were of the kind encountered in similar
projects implemented elsewhere. Given government support and Gosregister’s successful track
record, many of the risks were rated as low, but due to the wider instability in the Kyrgyz
Republic, the overall rating was determined to be moderate.

2.2 Implementation

A variety of factors gave rise to the successful implementation of the project. On the Borrower’s
side, Gosregister/DCR was a competent, successful organization with the vision and ability to
implement the project activities and other reforms, even in the face of almost continual political
and institutional instability and turbulence. Management, staff and a solid project
implementation unit (PIU) had experience of the LRERP, and were eager to meet project targets.
When institutional difficulties arose (see immediately below), Gosregister was able to draw on
strong support from donors and key users to successfully protect its continued existence as a
semi-autonomous property registration authority. There was also a willingness of the government
to continue the reform of land administration, despite wider political instability, as evidenced by
the high rating of the Kyrgyz Republic in property registration in the Bank’s Doing Business
reports over the project period (see below).

On the Bank’s side, there was strong and persistent support for the project and the registration
system which helped Gosregister/DCR to maintain its equilibrium in the face of political and
institutional instability, and a willingness to take remedial action to overcome problems that
arose during the project, particularly through well-targeted restructurings and extensions that
permitted project goals to be achieved. Support was forthcoming from both headquarters and the
country office, particularly when it came to addressing contentious political and organizational
issues, such as the potential break up of Gosregister in late 2009. There was also a capable
preparation and supervision team with technical knowledge and a network of support with other
Bank land administration experts, and also significant support from the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and its technical experts, who were integral members of the
teams. In addition, SIDA funded technical assistance provided important support to
Gosregister/DCR. SIDA supported the LRERP since 2000 and its support continued until 2009,
providing a regular program of expert advisers, key equipment and local technical assistance,
and training. Finally, retroactive financing from the SLRERP permitted key PIU staff to be
retained between closure of the LRERP in December 2008 and project effectiveness, to maintain
the momentum and begin work on new activities.

Importantly, there was a close and strong partnership between Gosregister/DCR and the Bank,
both at a management and technical level. The two shared a common understanding and aims for
the project, and collaborated closely throughout to achieve the objectives, sometimes in difficult
circumstances. This was enhanced by the strong institutional capacity of Gosregister/DCR and
the trust and mutual respect that had developed during the LRERP and SLRERP.

There were a variety of factors that gave rise to problems. At the political level, a violent
revolution in early 2010 saw the resignation of the president and formation of a new government,
which had a destabilizing impact on the organization of public services and their delivery. Prior
to that, there had been problems at the pinnacle of government, particularly in the project’s first
two years, with senior politicians exercising close control over Gosregister decisions, which
resulted in a marked slowdown in activities. Economically, there were restraints on registration
activity due to the global financial crisis, the Kyrgyz banking crisis and ethnic violence, as
discussed above, although these did not have a direct impact on project implementation
activities.

                                                7	
	
At an institutional level, the re-organization of Gosregister into the Department of Cadastre and
Registration of Rights to Immovable Property (DCR), subordinate to a newly formed State
Registration Service (SRS), was announced in October 2009. The change was part of a re-
organization of government agencies, and it saw all agencies associated with registration
(vehicles, personal, property, businesses and others) amalgamated under the SRS. For some time,
there was uncertainty as to the status and the continued existence of Gosregister, in late 2009 to
early 2010, and two changes in DCR’s management. Lobbying by the Bank helped to ensure that
DCR was not dismantled and that it remained a stand-alone operation. Management of the SRS
was also unsettled. Here, too, uncertainty resulted in delays in project related decision-making
and consequential activities. Also, Gosregister lost its mapping staff to the Ministry of Natural
Resources as part of a re-organization. Through its own efforts with project support, Gosregister
regained the necessary skills, which permitted subcomponent 2.b to proceed, only through the
recruitment of consultants funded by the project.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: Monitoring and Evaluation was a strong element of the project design which
contributed to its successful implementation. The Results Framework and Monitoring annex to
the PAD contains an extensive set of monitoring indicators that match the elements of the PDO
and activities under the three components. The indicators, which are clearly expressed in
concrete terms, combine quantitative and qualitative measures, and they were consciously
designed to be the primary tool for both managing and assessing project progress. Further, the
results framework clearly envisages how the data was to be collected, including through reports,
assessments and customer surveys.6

M&E implementation: Based on the PAD’s indicators, data was routinely collected and reported
both prior to effectiveness and throughout the project period. The M&E results were consistently
of a high, reliable standard, covering the quantitative data gathered directly from LROs and
qualitative data, derived through surveys that were routinely conducted by Gosregister/DCR. As
required, the Bank supervision team members advised on M&E issues, but as the indicators were
generally straightforward and as there was solid M&E experience in the PIU, there was little
need for advice.

M&E utilization: The results of the M&E were closely considered and used by the Bank team,
PIU and Gosregister/DCR as the primary tool to monitor project progress, identify issues and
develop remedies to ensure that progress remained on track. No independent evaluation of M&E
was prepared during the project. The M&E results were used as the basis for extensive reporting,
and provided signals when changes in direction were necessitated. After eight years of Bank
involvement and M&E reporting and use under the LRERP, reporting and analysis of results was
a mainstream management tool within Gosregister/DCR during the SLRERP, and the results

          It should be noted that the core indicator on gender was not included, as it was not mandatory at the time,
          although it was included by early 2013. Monitoring of gender was undertaken towards the end of the project,
          including through a special gender study (see below). However, the results of monitoring on gender have yet
          to be utilized to any great degree in improving women’s access to registration services or the land market.

                                                           8	
	
were used in the preparation of the Borrower’s ICR (see Annex 7 for summary), which proved
very useful in preparing this report.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project triggered one safeguard policy: environmental assessment OP 4.01. The PAD noted
that were any building rehabilitation works to be undertaken, the environmental management
plan (EMP) that was prepared during project preparation would be used as part of tender
specifications and in works contracts. Minor rehabilitation works were conducted, in accordance
with the EMP, to server rooms at DCR headquarters and Bishkek, Osh and Issyk-Kata LROs.
There were no negative environmental impacts from these minor rehabilitation works.

The financial management (FM), disbursement and procurement staff within the PIU performed
capably, and all audits had a clear opinion and were conducted in a timely fashion. The FM
system recorded all transactions and balances, and it permitted clear and concise reports to be
promptly issued. Internal controls and audits further ensured the accuracy of records. The FM
was rated as satisfactory (seven times) or moderately satisfactory (three times) throughout the
project. There was one rating of moderately unsatisfactory (MU) in 2008. The issues giving rise
to the MU rating (an interim financial report being several months late and two FM reports being
in a form that was unacceptable to the Bank), were quickly resolved. Procurement was
unproblematic throughout the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The transitional arrangements to post-completion operational sustainability were a fundamental
design element of Component 1. The decision to create the GIS Center in late 2013 to fund key
central level activities from LRO contributions means that registry revenue is being used to
support those activities, as envisaged in the PAD and has been operating successfully in this
modality for over five months. Thus, a financial structure is in place to fund the work of policy
and strategy, communications, M&E and IT maintenance and development. Other project
sponsored innovations, such as scanning of in-coming documents and modern financial
management have been incorporated into the everyday practice of the LROs, and are thus
covered by existing budgets and staff.

In terms of the achievements under Components 2 and 3, responsibility lies with DCR, the LROs
and other key agencies to maintain the data, human resources and momentum for reform. As the
data has been created, it now needs to be maintained, and that work can be funded from the
budget and fees from users. The capacity and knowledge exists within DCR to run its own
training courses, both for its staff and the private sector, as is done by land registries elsewhere.

Some performance indicators to monitor and evaluate the legacy of the project would be the
reliability and adequacy of the IT system, time required to register a transaction and associated
levels of customer satisfaction, and the number of training courses and participants who attend
such courses. Further, to promote gender equity, an indicator monitoring the number of women
who own property and engage in property transactions would be desirable.



                                                 9	
	
No follow up project by the Bank is required, but as DCR has already joined the international
community of land registry agencies and has taken part in (and even hosted) international events,
continued engagement with Bank sponsored programs and events can be expected. Further, a
Bank sponsored Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) program would add
momentum to the reform and good governance program. DCR is looking to other donors for
assistance, and it has received a grant of US$ 2 million from the Kingdom of Norway to support
GPS/GNSS, IT and spatial data enhancement. DCR has also applied to the Republic of Korea for
assistance in further mapping.

An environment of innovation and reform exists with respect to land administration within DCR,
and it can be expected that the Kyrgyz Republic will continue to lead the region in this area of
reform, maintaining its high place in the Doing Business reports through incremental
improvements.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives: The project’s objective to support real estate markets and efficient land use remains
highly relevant today. The need for such support through an efficient, well-functioning
registration system has perhaps become more relevant as the Kyrgyz economy has moved further
from a planned to market based system, and as demands on natural resources increase with a
growing economy and population. The system is widely used by the population and almost no
transactions occur outside of the registration system. As elsewhere, a well-functioning
registration system is a cornerstone of economic development and social stability based on well-
defined and protected property rights. The objective is also consistent with improving
governance and the key areas of engagement listed in the Country Partnership Strategy 2014-
2017: public administration and public service delivery, business environment and investment
climate, and management of natural resources and physical infrastructure.

Design: The project’s design, unchanged throughout the implementation period, focused on
outcomes and outputs that remain highly relevant today. These were efficient public
administration and good governance, creation of useful real property data, provision of access to
such data, and enhancement of human capital. These elements are as necessary today as when
the project was designed and will continue to be so, although DCR is moving to the data
maintenance phase, rather than the data creation phase, and becoming a more mature land
registry operation in the process. Thus, the design properly assessed the country’s needs and
formulated actions to meet those needs.

Implementation: The manner of implementation was slightly adjusted over time as new
information arose and as circumstances evolved. Overall, implementation (by both
Gosregister/DCR and the Bank) remained generally consistent with the original project design,
reflecting accurate design. The timing of activities was slightly problematic, given delays due to
political, social and organizational disturbances, but two extensions compensated for the adverse
impact of those issues.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PDO indicators (clear, secure property rights; accessible information; financial and
institutional sustainability) illustrate the features of a reliable and well-functioning registration
system, which directly supports real estate markets and more intensive and efficient land use.
These indicators can therefore be used as the basis to assess whether the PDO itself was
achieved. As the data sheet shows, the targets for each of these indicators was either achieved or
exceeded. Similarly, the targets for the subcomponents were also achieved or exceeded, often by
a significant percentage, such as the mapping and training subcomponents. The details on how
each subcomponent performed regarding its outcome, indicators and targets are provided in the
Data Sheet and Annex 2.

Looking beyond the indicators and targets, support for the real estate market and more intensive
and efficient use of land was enhanced under the SLRERP in various ways:
Capacity building: DCR is a more mature, capable and robust organization, with a cadre of
skilled and capable individuals. DCR demonstrated its capacity in both lobbying to maintain its
separate status with the SRS while simultaneously moving forward with reforms and
improvements, including those under the SLRERP. Management skills and infrastructure,
including the use of quality M&E, further supports the organization.
Skilled and capable workforce: capacity building covers the staff of DCR and the LROs, and the
land market professionals, who benefited from training courses to improve their knowledge,
skills and understanding of modern land management. The public directly benefit from these
improvements through better service delivery and advice to facilitate their transactions with real
property.
More complete data: the country is better served by a more complete and accessible database of
properties and their owners, which is available for a wide range of public and private sector users
to exploit. The accuracy of the data (particularly mapping) has greatly improved, and will serve
as a solid basis for national spatial data infrastructure, the use of which is expected to greatly
expand. Reliable market data, too, is available for the first time, supported by analytical reports
that are utilized by the banking sector and others for valuation purposes.
Improved registration services: beyond the reduced registration times, policy and legislative
reforms have made it easier, quicker and simpler for people to transact with property. The
reduced fees, removal of the obligation to use a notary, and introduction at LROs of one-stop-
shop transaction service have dramatically reduced the burden on transactions and thus the
barriers to people using the system. As the Doing Business 2014 report shows, the Kyrgyz
registration system ranks number 9 internationally.
Better access to information: the improvements to IT, creation of the geo-portal, digitizing of
data and other reforms mean that everyone has better access to information on real estate. It can
also be delivered more quickly and cheaply than previously, and on-line access removes
opportunities for petty corruption.

The one area where there could be a technical dispute about the achievement of a project target
was the sustainable funding of key functions. The targets (as modified) for outcome indicator 4
and subcomponent 1.e Organizational Structures and Facilities were not actually achieved until
one day after the project closed as staff and functions were shifted to the newly created GIS
Center upon project closure, although the funding model had been put in place in several weeks

                                                 11	
	
before the close of the project. In the subsequent five months, the GIS Center has functioned in a
sustainable manner, continuing to provide identical services as were offered during the project
with sustainable funding by local office contributions and some fee for service arrangements.
Thus, while the objective was not technically fully achieved until after the SLRERP was
completed, the evidence is strong with the benefit of several months of post-project operation
that the sustainable financing of the key functions is indeed in place and that the target indicator
was achieved. The exact timing of the transition to self-financing on the day after project closure
was based on a clear rationale of DCR for delaying the switch from project funding of the PIU to
funding from registration office revenue as DCR sought to maximize the use of project funds
until the very latest date possible, and thus delayed the switch to registry revenue funding until
the project completion date had technically passed. Further, there could have been contracting
problems had the staff of the PIU been employed by the GIS Center prior to the closure of the
project.

3.3 Efficiency

In accordance with the PDO, the project has successfully helped increase the number of
transactions and reduce the time it takes to register property. Over the project period, the total
number of sales transactions increased by 74 per cent from just over 43,000 in 2007 to almost
75,000 in 2013. Similarly, the number of registered mortgages increased by 66 per cent from just
over 43,300 in 2007 to almost 72,000 in 2013. Both results exceed the project targets of 26 per
cent and 31 per cent respectively. These results are even more impressive in the context of the
general decline in the Kyrgyz GDP especially in the years following the global financial crisis,
the country’s banking crisis and the 2010 Revolution. For details on these external shocks, refer
to Annex 3.

Similarly, the time to register a transaction has also been reduced in accordance with the targets
from 3 days to just 4 hours or just half a day,7 and the number of procedures has dropped from
seven visits to two visits to the LRO. There is also an option to expedite the transaction, and this
requires only one visit. Clients pay KGS 300 for expedited procedure fee or KGS 150 for the
regular procedure.

However, the cost of service delivery to clients in terms of the fees they pay has not been
reduced. At the same time, even though per unit cost of service delivery has remained
unchanged, the project has helped reduce client reliance on notaries and therefore the total cost
of a real estate transaction has fallen. As noted, this brings direct savings to clients. Nevertheless,
there is room to reduce the direct per unit cost of service delivery. With technological
improvements and further cementing of the financially sustainable business model, DCR and the
LROs will likely be able to transfer some of the reductions in cost directly to its clients.

The net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) in the PAD and ICR are calculated
by using the increase in the monetary value of sales and mortgages in the Kyrgyz economy over
a ten-year period of which six years were the implementation period. Of this total increase, only
																																																								
7
      Note: Doing Business Report 2014 states that the time to register a property in Kyrgyzstan is 6 days. This
      figure is different because DB tracks the time for the entire procedure and not only the registration time at the
      DCR which is shorter.

                                                         12	
	
1 per cent is attributed to the project. This assumption is in line with the PAD and is important
because the project should not claim credit for the overall growth of the real estate market, which
can be attributed to other economic interactions which may have positively benefited the project
and other reforms by the Kyrgyz Government and other donor projects. The 1 per cent
assumption is conservative and helps mitigate several measurement, isolation and attribution
effects that ought to be considered when measuring the impact of the project alone.

Assuming a 12 per cent discount rate (as assumed in the PAD), the NPV of benefits attributable
to the project is estimated at US$ 17.1 million and the project IRR is estimated at 39 per cent.

Note that in the model used in this ICR, some assumptions related to the PAD projections were
changed. Given the project start date and the three external shocks – the global financial crisis,
banking crisis and 2010 Revolution – the ICR has found the PAD baseline assumptions to be
more conservative and some growth assumptions to be more aggressive. In the ICR analysis,
they have been adjusted to reflect a more accurate picture of what really happened in the Kyrgyz
market. For details, see Annex 3.

Due to these aforementioned changes made to the PAD projections, it is not fair to compare the
NPV and IRR with the figures projected in the PAD. Keeping this in mind, a positive NPV and
positive IRR should speak to the viability and success of the project.

However, purely for the sake of comparison, the analysis shows that the project’s estimated NPV
of US$ 17.1 million is 68 per cent higher than the original PAD projection of US$ 10.2 million.
This means that despite the three external shocks that affected the Kyrgyz economy, the project
has generated a higher NPV done better than what was projected in the PAD. Moreover, the
2009 and 2010 external shocks occurred fairly early on in the project, meaning that they had a
greater negative impact on the NPV because of the way the discounted cash flow (DCF) model is
more sensitive to changes in the early years of the project.

As for the IRR, the project’s estimate of 39 per cent is 18 percentage points lower than the
original PAD projection of 57 per cent. This can be explained by two developments. First, the
2009 and 2010 external shocks occurred fairly early on in the Project, meaning that they had a
greater negative impact on the IRR because of the way the DCF model works. Second, the
original PAD projection is calculated using a US$ 7.0 million project investment versus the
project’s final IRR estimate, which is calculated using a US$ 7.5 million project investment.
This, too, would lower the Project IRR. For the detailed model and analysis, see Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory.

Overwhelmingly, and as demonstrated above, the project achieved its objectives. It did so
efficiently, and it remained relevant throughout the project period. Minor shortcomings in
implementation occurred at a number of stages, the target of funding key registration functions
was not technically achieved until the project closed, and the project required two extensions
(totalling 18 months) for it to reach all goals, reflecting some problems with implementation.
However, these could not be considered serious enough to warrant the description of “moderate”,
nor do they detract from the significant and wide ranging set of achievements of the project.
Thus, an overall rating of “satisfactory” is appropriate.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The PAD noted that while the project would not be targeting poor people, the poor and other
disadvantaged people would be likely to benefit from project outcomes, such as improved access
to services and information, efficiencies that would result in lower direct and other costs,
consistent standards and accountability. Further, the PAD noted, ongoing links with legal aid
programs supported by other donors would also specifically benefit the poor.

For poor and disadvantaged people who own property and deal with it, or those who aspire to be
property owners, the achievements of the project listed above would have benefited them in the
way described in the PAD.9 Specific benefits include quicker and cheaper (or free in certain
instances) access to property information, reduced registration fees,10 removal of the obligation
to engage a notary or obtain a technical inventory certificate for every transaction, and increased
ease of using property to secure loans, particularly short-term loans to buy seeds and fertilizer as
well as to support animal breeding programs. Further, as the poor and disadvantaged are said to
suffer disproportionately from corrupt officials’ behavior, the project’s good governance
achievements would have benefited them more than others.

Women were not a specific target group of the project, but data from customer surveys were
presented in gender disaggregated form and further information was gathered from LROs. A
report on gender issues was produced in 2013. Thus, issues of particular concern to women could
be identified. While the legal framework treats men and women equally, the situation on the
ground is somewhat different, with women generally occupying a secondary position to men in
terms of finances and property (only 25 per cent of property owners are estimated to be women),
with the consequential reduction in their status both within and outside the family. The insights
from the customer surveys would allow DCR to develop a program to deal with issues of
																																																								
9
          The truly poor and disadvantaged, who often do not own land and have no real hope of obtaining it, would
          have received no advantage from the project achievements.
10
          As Doing Business 2014 notes, the cost of registering a transaction is 0.3 per cent of the value of a property.
          In Doing Business 2008, that figure was 4.1 per cent.

                                                            14	
	
particular relevance to women, such as women specific information brochures, meetings or
service times, although no such steps have yet been taken.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

As a primary focus of the project was institutional development and strengthening, and most of
Components 1 and 3 were dedicated to those goals, the project’s impact on the institution has
been covered in numerous places above.

However, the above discussion has not addressed the issue of corruption in the land registration
system, which is an important aspect of institutional change and strengthening. From both
anecdotal evidence and the 2012 customer survey (see section 6 below), the picture of LROs that
emerges is one of a relatively uncorrupt organization. Nevertheless, corruption is widespread in
the Kyrgyz Republic, with Transparency International ranking the country 155 out of 177, and
giving it a score of 24 out of 100, and the land sector (particularly land allocation) is reported
highly corrupt in some accounts. However, the 2012 survey indicates that the LROs are widely
regarded as honest and trustworthy. Customers are generally not required to make extra
payments, receipts are given for payments, and every LRO displays the requirements and fees for
registration in the public areas. Online access to property ownership information (through land
market professional who use the Kyrgyz Land Information System or KLIS) further reduces
opportunities for corrupt payments. One community lawyer who was interviewed for this report
and who was previously highly critical of Gosregister advised that from both his personal
experience and reports from clients, corruption was not a significant issue at the LROs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There were a few unintended outcomes of the project that have not yet been mentioned. These
were:

            the adoption of ISO standards for spatial data, which were used under the project for
             mapping, as the national standards for the Kyrgyz Republic, and the creation of the
             foundation for national spatial data infrastructure based on that mapping;
            the use of data produced by DCR by a wider range of government users, such as the
             statistics and taxation authority; and
            following the ethnic-based violence in 2010, in which many owners’ homes and also property
             certificates were burnt or otherwise lost, Gosregister was able to quickly and accurately replace
             their certificates using information from its electronic data base. Replacing the certificates rapidly
             permitted owners to reconstruct their homes, which was a significant element in reducing tensions
             and returning the situation to a more normal one.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A public opinion survey was conducted by DCR in February 2012, following a methodology
developed under the LRERP. This was the third survey conducted by Gosregister/DCR, and its
findings can be appropriately used in this report although they are over two years old.11 Some
																																																								
11
          A further public opinion study was conducted in 2013, but it focused only on gender issues.

                                                           15	
	
426 persons were surveyed across the country. Most were LRO private clients (70 per cent), with
the remainder representing professional clients. The survey focused on 11 areas of operations,
and it found that:

       Type or service required: clients were evenly divided between those who registered a
        sale, those who registered a mortgage, and those who sought information. The high
        proportion of clients registering a mortgage reflected a program to assist farmers with
        credit;
       Gender of property owners: female property owners represent about one-quarter of
        owners nationally, with the highest rates (30.8 per cent and 30 per cent) in Naryn and
        Chui oblasts;
       Dissemination of information on the property registration system: more than half (52.2
        per cent) thought that there was sufficient information on the registration system,
        although this was down from 69.5 per cent in the 2009 survey. The main means for
        clients to obtain information was through the mass media and from LRO staff, with only
        a small percentage using the DCR web site;
       Complexity of property registration procedures: one-fifth of clients found the procedure
        to register a property difficult or very difficult, particularly in more remote areas;
       Level of corruption: over three-quarters of those surveyed considered that the level of
        corruption in LROs is low, although approximately 6 per cent considered it to be high.
        These figures are an improvement on the 2009 survey, in which over 20 per cent
        considered corruption to be high. The survey lists several categories of cases where
        “rewards” for staff to complete their tasks are most common,
       Extortion by LRO staff: payment was reportedly demanded from clients in less than 4 per
        cent of cases;
       Issuance of receipts for payment for services: almost 90 per cent of clients received
        receipts for the payment that they make for services;
       Private sector services: more than half those surveyed were positive about the transfer of
        cadastral services from the government to the private sector;
       Attention to information stands: few (28.2 per cent) private clients paid attention to public
        information materials posted at LROs, although almost half (45.7 per cent) of
        professional clients take note;
       Qualify of information: three-quarters of clients found the quality of information to be
        good;
       Kindness of staff: around 90 per cent regarded staff as friendly or very friendly.

The survey paints a picture of DCR and the LROs operating reasonably well in many areas,
particularly in terms of clients’ satisfaction with staff and low levels of corruption, but it also
makes clear that there is work to be done to fully inform the public about the registration system
and to streamline registration processes.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate



                                                 16	
	
In the Kyrgyz Republic, the question of assessing the risk that the project’s outcomes will be
maintained over time cannot be answered from only one perspective. The uncertainties faced by
DCR, the registration system and its data over the coming years and decades turns on many
factors.

At the macro level, the risks facing stable government in the Kyrgyz Republic must be judged as
high. Since 2005, two presidents have been forced from office by public protest, several
governments have come and gone, and political assassinations are not unknown. Popular
uprisings are no longer unusual events, and given recent history, such uprisings could be
expected again.

The project’s outcomes also face potential (although not real at this stage) threats from within
government. Even where there is stable government, successful land administration system
elsewhere (including at least one developed with Bank assistance) have deteriorated over time
due to poor management, inadequate allocation of resources, and lack of understanding of the
importance of a well-functioning land registration system. There was clearly potential during the
project for Gosregister to be broken up (in fact, it lost its mapping capacities) or to be subsumed
within a larger body and neglected, and this risk remains into the future. However, important
factors (present in the Kyrgyz Republic) that reduce the risks are integration of the real estate
registration services in the wider economic, banking, planning, agricultural and other sectors of
the economy, and popular support for an efficient real estate registration system. As one notary
who was interviewed for this report put it, it would be unthinkable among her profession for the
registration system to not exist any longer. Given the important role that the land registry plays
in the Kyrgyz Republic, the likelihood of these risks is relatively small. Were threats to arise,
DCR would be able to draw on support from the public and land market professionals, as well as
donors who recognize the success and value of DCR’s system, to deal with such threats.

At the level of DCR itself, there are also some risks to sustainability, although these appear much
smaller given that establishment and strengthening of the organization has been achieved with
the assistance of both the LRERP and SLRERP. Here, the risk is that key personal could leave
without adequate transfer of knowledge, budget cuts could see important functions curtailed or
eliminated, and the flow of funds from the LROs to support key operations could stop. These
risks must be closely monitored and DCR leadership needs to intervene at an early stage to deal
with potential problems. In this regard, DCR is like any service delivery agency in modern times.
As registration fees are already very low by international standards, there is room for
shortcomings in budgets to be addressed by slight increases in fees. Further, from an operational
perspective, many of the project’s outcomes face little risk of being lost because they have been
incorporated in the daily operations and are an integral part of the LROs’ functions. The work of
maintaining the outcomes, including the GIS Center, can be funded from existing sources of
revenues (mostly fees). They are therefore sustainable, at least in bulk of LROs where revenue
exceeds operating costs. For details on each subcomponent’s sustainability, see Annex 2.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Satisfactory

The Bank team was well experienced and knowledgeable in their fields and in the region, and
they applied a fairly standard model of institutional development and land titling to meet the
needs of the Kyrgyz Republic. Over an extended period, they worked closely with equally
knowledgeable counterparts to design the project’s activities to achieve the PDO. Although
preparation set a clear course that did not require substantial (and costly) subsequent change,
there were some minor shortcomings in preparation, as demonstrated by the need to revise
component 2 in the first restructure and make changes to the mapping activity, and some targets
may have been overly optimistic.

(b) Quality of Supervision: Satisfactory

Supervision followed a regular rhythm of six monthly visits during which the team provided
technical advice, assessed project progress, developed an action plan for the coming six months,
and met with key stakeholder representatives and other donors. In between missions, there was
good support via email and the local Bank office provided support, as required, such as during
the threat to DCR’s continued existence. The Bank was also able to bring pressure to deal with
difficult issues, both within DCR and the government, such as ensuring that the coordinates
system was openly available. The restructures and extensions were timely and well-targeted, and
the mid-term review of February 2010 recognized and responded to issues appropriately.

DCR reports that the aide memoires were very useful, that the working group approach was very
good, and that the technical assistance (particularly that provided by FAO staff and consultants)
was of great help. A long and close working relationship existed between DCR management and
the Bank team, making frank discussions possible.

There were however, some minor shortcomings. Supervisions funds were significantly restricted
at the end of 2010, reducing the number of specialists who could take part in missions and thus
provide technical support. The funding problem also restricted the task team leader from visiting
the country in early 2011. In retrospect, the Bank should perhaps have engaged more fully with
senior officials and politicians to better publicize and promote the success of DCR and the LROs
to enhance understanding and support for the system. Overall, therefore, supervision can be
judged as satisfactory.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Satisfactory12

The Bank’s performance was adequate to the tasks and facilitated the success of the project.
Quality at entry and supervision were generally appropriate to ensure that the project was
																																																								
12
          The ICR report test for this element is: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at
          entry of the operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including
          ensuring adequate transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit
          closing), toward the achievement of development outcomes.

                                                           18	
	
successfully completed and the PDO was reached. While it could be argued that the Bank might
have been somewhat more active is dealing with the institutional, political and bureaucratic
hurdles facing project progress, and therefore to have acted more quickly to restructure, these are
concerns of a relatively minor degree. As there were no significant or moderate failings in
preparation and supervision, a rating of satisfactory can be attributed.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance:            Moderately Satisfactory

The performance of the government (including the former management of the SRS) is assessed
as moderately satisfactory, in that there were some moderate shortcomings in its performance.
The shortcomings fall under several headings:

       instability of government, particularly in the initial stages;
       lack of clear decisions or direction on the status of Gosregister/DCR;
       lack of capacity to make certain critical decisions and delays in settling the organizational
        arrangements, and a lack of timely resolution of implementation issues, which resulted in
        the transition arrangements for project funded operations to be delayed until the very end
        of the project.

However, in other regards, the performance of the government was supportive of the project and
its objectives. For example, in the following areas, the government performed adequately or
well:

       policy and legislative reforms to improve efficiencies in the real estate market, to remove
        barriers to access to land, to reduce some restrictions on the mortgaging of agricultural
        land, and to dispense with the requirement for a notary in all cases;
       reduction of fees and charges;
       public support for Gosregister/DCR, including through the media and visits to LROs;
       good relationships and communications with the Bank and other donors;
       compliance with grant covenants;
       contribution of government funds to the SLRERP.

Thus, overall, a rating of moderately satisfactory is warranted.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:              Satisfactory

The performance of Gosregister/DCR was generally of a high standard. There was strong
commitment and engagement in preparation of the project, and the organization ultimately
delivered on all its obligations during implementation. There was a very good working
relationship with the Bank team, an open and transparent attitude to information, and good
relationships and coordination with partners/stakeholders, including civil society. Further, the
managers of some of the LROs (particularly Bishkek LRO) were very active in implementing
reforms and fostering progress, particularly in the IT area. In general, Gosregister/DCR can be
considered to have performed with few real problems.


                                                 19	
	
However, the aides-mémoire show a series of delays in implementation but also delays in
making some key decisions. The supervision missions found that work was often well behind
schedule and stressed the need for Gosregister/DCR to make decisions and take action,
particularly in the 2009-2010 period. However, from 2011 onwards, when momentum had
returned, progress picked up. Although problematic at the time, these shortcomings were minor
in the overall scheme of things, the decisions were ultimately made and all targets were
achieved. They are not sufficient to downgrade an otherwise good performance by
Gosregister/DCR and the LROs, and thus a rating of satisfactory is justified.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

The significance of the government’s shortcomings listed above, and the impact that they had on
Gosregister/DCR’s capacity to perform, means that the overall rating must be the lower of the
two, and thus a rating of moderately unsatisfactory is justified.

6. Lessons Learned

The lessons learned from the SLRERP are:

       Robust M&E Framework: Project implementation was greatly aided by a robust M&E
        framework based on objective indicators that were tracked consistently throughout the
        project and served as useful tools to monitor outputs and outcomes. This allowed for
        greater focus on what was important for PDO achievement and course correction, when
        necessary.
       Institutional Capacity: Building institutional capacity was critical to the success of this
        project, especially in the face of political instability. This also enabled the successful roll
        out of the IT system and the creation of the self-financed GIS Center, which has reduced
        the registration services’ reliance on the state budget and will allow for future
        investments without straining the government budget.
       Political Environment: Related to the institutional capacity lesson is the broader lesson
        that instability is a regular feature of the Kyrgyz political system, and that future projects
        must recognize that time can expected to be lost during changes of power and
        government priorities can quickly change. In light of this, the Bank must be receptive to
        providing extensions and it must remain flexible in project design and dealing with
        changing political circumstances.
       Digital Archives: Over the course of this project, separate digital archives were
        maintained and updated regularly. This was extremely valuable as records could easily be
        replaced when paper records were lost. As noted, the ability to issue certificates based on
        these records helped stabilize the country in the aftermath of the violence in the South.
        Such a practice should be followed elsewhere, especially in politically volatile countries.
       Modular approach to IT: A phased, step-by-step approach to the development and roll out
        of IT systems works well and can be easier to achieve and implement than large-scale
        systems. Starting from a basic registration system, the ARS was progressive expanded
        over the course of the project to meet the needs of Gosregister/DCR and the LROs and as
        capacity to utilize new modules increased. Using experienced in-house experts also helps
        to build IT capacity, which is then available to adapt to ongoing changes in the IT sector.

       Bank-FAO Partnership Arrangements: This partnership proved very effective in
        delivering technical advice to the Gosregister/DCR and the LROs. In fact, throughout the
        ECA region over the last two decades, the FAO has worked with the Bank on land
        projects to provide useful and well-targeted advice on a range of topics, including
        surveying and mapping, valuation, IT, legal and associated matters. Likewise, technical
        support from SIDA was highly useful in aiding Gosregister/DCR and the LROs to
        develop and fully exploit the Bank funds to improve technology, skills and procedures,
        and thus customer service.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

DCR is grateful for the active support of the Bank team in the implementation of the project. We
agree on the draft ICR. The targets of all components and subcomponents were achieved and
exceeded. The Government successfully implemented the project and reached its objectives. A
rating of satisfactory is therefore justified.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1             Organizational Development and Improved Services

Subcomponent 1.a Performance, Strategy and Communications

Design

This subcomponent was designed to establish a permanent unit within Gosregister with the
capacity and resources to:

         monitor all aspects of Gosregister’s performance;
         recommend strategic and other improvements; and
         communicate effectively with all stakeholders.

It was to be built on the PIU from the LRERP, which was staffed by a range of specialists who
had long experience with project management, monitoring, communications and other relevant
areas of expertise. However, many lacked the analytical and strategic skills, and Gosregister
itself could only deal with strategic and communications needs by taking staff from other areas.

The outcome for this subcomponent was to be a sustainable unit that would monitor
Gosregister’s performance, provide strategic support and support improved communications, as
indicated by the unit’s outputs showing a gradual expansion of responsibilities, plus the
establishment of a sustainable financing mechanism. The outcome and indicator were not revised
during the restructurings, although the targets were adjusted in the first restructuring to state that
the new system would be in place for at least one year, and in the second restructuring to remove
that requirement.

Results

By the end of the project, the unit had consistently addressed and made progress in the areas of:

         monitoring and evaluating the performance of LROs, using data obtained through the
          automated registration system (ARS) reporting module and personal visits to every LRO,
          to improve service standards and ensure consistency in practice and outcomes across the
          country, as demonstrated by the reduced time to register a transaction;
         analysing changes and developments in the real property market, particularly as part of
          subcomponent 3.c on the price index (see below);
         developing and recommending policy, legislative and strategic improvements, which
          resulted in reduced registration times, reduced number of restrictions on the real estate
          market, lower costs for the public and a sustainable structure for core DCR services
          through the creation of the GIS Center. For example, the unit worked on eliminating the
          requirement for a technical inventory to be performed in all cases and for a notary to be
          engaged in every transaction;
         collecting and analysing data in order to prepare proposals for Gosregister/DCR’s
          financial independence;

                                                 23	
	
       improving communications, through adoption of a communications strategy, training of
        LRO staff in communications skills, conducting customer surveys (2009, 2012, 2013),
        making over 200 public presentations and issuing numerous press releases, which
        ensured that DCR had a profile with both the public and within government. The unit also
        shared DCR’s experiences with other government bodies delivering services to the
        public;
       developing a business plan and strategic plan for the period 2011-2016, primarily as an
        input to subcomponent 1.e on organizational structure, but of relevance to the wider
        range of DCR/LRO operations;
       collaborating with stakeholders, including representatives of civil society, to improve
        operations, policy, legislation, procedures and communications.

The goal of establishing a permanent unit was also achieved, albeit not until the end of the
project, with the establishment of the GIS Center. As noted, the Center was established at the end
of November 2013, and started funding staff on January 1, 2014. Of the 28 staff funded by the
GIS Centre through registry revenue, four belong to the policy, strategy and communications
unit (which is now named the “M&E Group”). These comprise one M&E specialist, one real
estate market specialist, one economist and one training specialist. The plan is to expand the
group to include another M&E specialist plus one M&E specialist in each of the seven oblasts,
and a communications specialist. DCR also employs three M&E specialists from budget funds,
and they are based in the cities of Osh, Naryn and Talas.

Attribution

The extensive and successful work of the unit and its many positive legal, policy, educative and
practical reforms achieved have been central to improving the functioning of the registration
system, the LROs and the real property market, and thus the more intensive and effective use of
real property.

Sustainability

The sustainability of the M&E unit is dependent on continued funding to pay the salaries and
associated costs of the staff. Five months after the project closed, funding for the unit’s staff is
continues to be provided. While an alternative model (full financial independence for DCR)
remains under consideration, the current arrangement is generally accepted, and thus appears
sustainable. Further, many of the positive outcomes of this subcomponent are likely to be
retained no matter what happens because they have been incorporated into the law and the
registration system itself.

Subcomponent 1.b Information Technology Support

Design

Subcomponent 1.b was designed to produce an integrated registration and cadastre IT system and
the KLIS,13 serving clients through a website portal that would benefit the private and public
sectors, and the establishment of a permanent unit that would have the resources and capacity to
provide ongoing IT maintenance and development support for all of Gosregister.

The outcome was an improved and sustainable IT system, as measured by the upgrading of the
IT system, introducing an internet portal, and establishing a permanent unit with resources and
capacity to provide ongoing IT maintenance and development support for all of Gosregister,
including the LROs. In the first restructuring, the outcome and indicator were not changed, but a
new target of loading various categories of digital data (archive, cadastre) was added for the
final, additional year, and a target was added for the IT unit to be fully funded from revenue for
at least one year. The second restructuring saw the requirement for funding for one year dropped.

Results

This subcomponent had a solid basis from the LRERP and SIDA funded support, and work
progressed steadily throughout the project period. As much of the work was technical in nature,
it was unhindered by the political and organizational issues being experienced by Gosregister.
Work initiated under the LRERP, such as the roll out of ARS to all 49 LROs and development of
geographic information system (GIS) software, using open source software, continued. In 2008-
2010, an IT strategy was developed (with SIDA support) and adopted, a geoportal was developed
and tested, ARS was established in all LROs, the open source geographic information system
(GIS) software for digital maps was tested in pilot LROs, and a centralized system for e-services
to external users (KLIS) was developed and tested with key clients. 14 A great deal of IT
equipment was acquired for this and other subcomponents, and by the end of the project, all
LROs had servers, desktop computers, scanners and other IT equipment required for project
related activities, as well as the necessary software.

Although the system was (and remains) decentralized, by early 2011, databases from 46 LROs
were being uploaded to KLIS, thus providing access to practically the whole country’s legal
property data (ownership and encumbrances) through the geoportal. By the end of 2011, KLIS
was fully operational, with updates from every LRO being provided over high-speed lines
(through a VPN or virtual private network connection) every few minutes, thus providing close
to real-time access to data. All archive scanned images and digital mapping data have been
																																																								
13
          The Kyrgyz Land Information System or KLIS is the central level database at DCR headquarters holding all
          LROs’ digital information, other than graphical data (which is scheduled to be incorporated in 2014). KLIS
          thus provides not only a source of information to external users through the geoportal, but a back up for the
          entire country’s real estate registration records.
14
          DCR has back up copies of digital maps, but as digital mapping is not operational in all offices (only Bishkek
          and two others is using digital mapping data at this stage) the digital maps are not yet incorporated in KLIS.
          This is planned for 2014-2015.


                                                           25	
	
uploaded to local servers and copies are stored securely.

The pace of progress did not slow in the last two years of the project. By the project’s end, an
updated version of ARS was developed and installed around the country, as was the software to
support the digital cadastral maps. KLIS was serving paying customers (particularly notaries and
real estate agents), renovations at DCR’s headquarters and Bishkek and Osh LROs had enhanced
the physical security of IT equipment, and a system for backing up legal data between
headquarters and the LROs (through KLIS) was fully operational. Finally, a consultancy to
integrate ARS with the GIS open source system was implemented.

As of December 31, 2013, the geoportal had 87 registered users. These are split between private
persons (65), primarily notaries, and legal entities (22), including real estate firms, banks and the
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. Public sector users of DCR’s data also include the
national statistics office and taxation authority. Bishkek city is considering using DCR’s
ownership and graphical data as the basis for the city’s geographic information system. Other
public sector bodies that receive digital data from DCR include Jalal-Abad city, the State
Inspectorate for Environmental and Technical Safety and the State Committee for National
Security.

The creation of the GIS Center allowed for the project’s IT specialists to be retained. The IT
group has nine members: one manager, two programmers, two database administrators, one
system administrators and one regional specialist for LROs in the north and one for LROs in the
south.

Attribution

In real property registration systems around the world, effective IT systems are the cornerstone
of efficiency, security and accessibility. They also play a key role in reducing corruption
opportunities (particularly petty corruption) by providing professionals and members of the
public with direct access to information. Accurate real property data can now be obtained in the
Kyrgyz Republic quickly and easily, reliable statistics are readily available, real property
information is more secure, and the benefits of improved IT have been delivered to all parts of
the country.

Sustainability

As noted in relation to subcomponent 1.a, after five months, the GIS Center funding model
appears to be successful. As Gosregister/DCR has developed a successful IT system that
improves operational efficiency, and the LROs understand the importance of IT to their
operations, it is highly likely that funds will continue to be provided by LROs from their
operational revenues to maintain the system as part of their core operating costs. However, for
some of the smaller LROs, where revenue does not meet expenses, the IT system (particularly
hardware) may not be sustainable without cross-subsidies, central level support or amalgamation
with larger LROs, and thus a long-term solution is essential if all land registries are to maintain
good IT infrastructure.

Subcomponent 1.c Agency Financial Management and Procurement

Design

This subcomponent was intended to result in the installation of a “robust automated accounting
and reporting system”, with an internal audit function established across the entire LRO network.
Further, subject to the decision to re-organize or consolidate Gosregister, this subcomponent was
to lead to the establishment of corporate financial management practices, which would include
improved financial reporting and an external audit.

The associated outcome and indicator were that an agency financial management and
procurement capacity would be developed, as demonstrated by the results quoted above from the
PAD, together with published audited financial statements. The outcome and indicator were not
revised during restructurings, although the targets were adjusted in the first restructuring to state
that the new system would be in place for at least one year, and in the second restructuring to
delete that requirement and also to modify the target to reflect what was possible in the
remaining time, that is, further implementation of the integrated accounting and reporting
systems in LROs.

Results

The objectives of this subcomponent regarding the installation of an accounting and reporting
system, plus a somewhat limited internal audit function for the entire LRO network, were
broadly met. Specifically:

         a consultancy produced a set of accounting practices and manual;
         an automated accounting module, linked to ARS, was installed and is operating in
          Bishkek, Osh and Issyk-Kul LROs on a pilot basis;
         a nationally consistent, revised accounting module of ARS was developed, and is to be
          rolled out in 2014-2015;
         accounting staff in all LROs have been equipped and trained in the use of computers,
          which was somewhat revolutionary when judged against the manual system (often
          assisted by an abacus) used in many LROs;
         accounting staff received introductory training in the accounting module of ARS;
         a corporate financial management plan, an accounting policy and charter of accounts
          were prepared and adopted;
         a corporate governance plan was prepared and adopted.

Currently, all LROs provide their accounts to DCR headquarters, and the SRS oversees DCR’s
accounting. The GIS Center economist is to monitor accounts, and DCR headquarters is to
provide an audit function.

The results of this subcomponent fell short of the loftier ambitions to see Gosregister/DCR
running a more open and transparent financial system, with accounts externally audited and

                                                 27	
	
published. As the PAD noted, this result was dependent on the decision to re-organize
Gosregister/DCR, which did not occur. However, within the confines of the revised results
indicator for subcomponent 1.c, the target was achieved.

Attribution

Better accounting and reporting goes to both improved management and greater transparency of
an organization, and to the extent that the work under subcomponent 1.c has raised the standard
of accounting and reporting in LROs, particularly Bishkek, Osh and Issyk-Kul LROs, then the
registration system can be said to be functioning better. Looking more broadly, the work under
this subcomponent has raised the issue of improved accounting and reporting, prepared LROs
and their staff for its implementation, and developed the necessary software. This is perhaps the
first stage of the process, but it is an important initial step in improving the financial and
reporting operations of the registration system.

Sustainability

The accounting and reporting module is integrated in ARS, and it is being successfully used in
the three pilot offices, so there appears little risk that its use will be discontinued in those LROs,
particularly as the module provides a useful management tool. It is almost certain that the revised
accounting module will be provided to other LROs because it forms part of the next iteration of
ARS, which is due to be installed. However, the training provided to staff of the non-pilot LROs
will probably need to be repeated as they have presumably forgotten much of what they learnt.


Subcomponent 1.d Records Management Improvement

Design

Subcomponent 1.d had the objective of making the extensive records created by Gosregister
since its creation in 1999 (primarily paper legal documents and sketches) secure and accessible.
It was to:

         improve climate control and back-up arrangements for archives in all LROs;
         produce complete digital archives for Bishkek and Osh LROs; and
         introduce scanning of new records in all LROs.

The outcome for this subcomponent was that LROs’ records would be more secure and
accessible, as indicated by the three items immediately above. The outcome and indicator were
not revised during restructuring, although the targets were adjusted in the first restructuring to
state that the new system would be in place for at least one year, and in the second restructuring
to drop that requirement.

Results

By the end of the project, LROs had made improvements to their archives, including:

                                                 28	
	
       renovations of archives in 46 LROs;
       introduction of air conditioning in seven LROs;
       new shelving and furniture in all LROs;
       basic fire equipment in all LROs;
       fire alarms installed in 24 LROs; and
       training for archivists in archives management.

Back up arrangements for digital records have been addressed under subcomponent 1.b above.

Although digitizing the archives of Bishkek and Osh LROs was slow to start, by the end of 2012,
the contractor had completed the work, with the results verified, for Bishkek and Osh LROs, and
through savings, the archive of an additional LRO at Alamedin was digitized. A total of
3,344,709 pages were digitized and made accessible through ARS. The LRO at Issyk-Kata
produced a digital archive using its own resources.

The project also supplied scanners to all LROs to digitize transactions as they were being
registered. In 2010 there was an assessment of the need for scanners at each LRO and an ARS
scanning module was developed. In late 2010 and early 2011, scanning of incoming documents
was introduced in Bishkek and eight other LROs, and all LROs by early 2012. Scanners for all
LROs were procured, and staff were trained in scanning, and the new module of ARS that was
developed to link scanned images to the property record. Thus, all LROs now scan newly
registered documents. Through this approach, staff can see the image of a document by clicking
on a thumbnail image on the title for the property (in ARS). Back-up arrangements were also put
in place, with copies of the records being stored at DCR’s headquarters as part of KLIS.

As the summary of results shows, this subcomponent met each of the three main indicators, and
exceeding the mass scanning indicator by covering a third LRO.

Attribution

Secure records (whether in paper or digital form) are essential to the security and reliability of a
registration system and its ability to function effectively. Digitized records are also important to
improve the efficiency of the registration system, by making data available quickly and easily.
The project activities thus had a direct positive impact in terms of achieving the PDO, as the
better functioning registration system provided more secure, reliable support for the real property
market. Such records also reduced the possibility of corruption by making a permanent record
that could not be removed or altered.

Sustainability

These changes appear to be sustainable as the archives have been improved, the digitized
information has been created (and is backed up), and the LROs are scanning newly registered
documents as part of the registration process. Most of the archive renovations were funded by the
LROs, so maintaining the archives should be within their budgets. There should be no need for
new equipment or software for several years (at least), but in the longer term, the scanners,

                                                29	
	
computers and software will have to be maintained and updated. As discussed under
subcomponent 1.b, the value of IT is recognized by the LROs so it can be expected that they will
ensure part of their budgets are available for IT maintenance, although the small offices could
struggle in this regard.


Subcomponent 1.e Organizational Structure and Facilities

Design

Subcomponent 1.e included a number of elements that were to result in “all operational and
capital maintenance expenses, including those of headquarters functions, covered by income
from registration.” It included activities related to:

         consolidating small offices with larger offices and providing services through branch
          offices or mobile services;
         Gosregister considering changes to its national structure;
         assisting with the transition to a new structure, if the government decided to proceed.

The outcome of this subcomponent was to be that the organizational structure and facilities
would be financially sustainable, as indicated by the implementation of arrangements so that all
expenses of the headquarter’s functions were covered by income from registration. The outcome
and indicator were not revised in the restructures, although the targets were adjusted in the first
restructure to state that the new system would be in place for at least one year, and in the second
restructure to drop that requirement. There was also clarification in the second restructure that
headquarter’s functions referred to those to be provided by the CSC (now the GIS Center).

Results

Initial identification work on consolidating small offices had begun under the LRERP, and
progressed with the drafting of a business plan. Six offices were informally reduced to branch
status in 2009, and a further 13 were identified for downgrading in a well-researched proposal
produced in 2010 by the working group responsible for this subcomponent. Out of a national
total of 49 LROs, these 19 were considered as uneconomic because they could not cover all their
operating expenses from revenue, and they were therefore recommended for consolidation.
However, DCR management decided in early 2011 to delay any consolidation until the larger
issue of DCR’s status as a single enterprise was settled. As that issue was not resolved during the
project period, work on the first aspect of this subcomponent – consolidating small offices – did
not commence.

That larger issue of the structure of DCR and the LROs occupied a great deal of time and
attention, particularly in the later phase of the project. A proposal for the creation of a self-
funding, single agency was submitted to the prime minister in 2009, but a wholesale re-
organization of government and registration services in particular overtook that process, with the
splitting of Gosregister into DCR under the SRS and the transfer of its mapping services to the
Ministry of Natural Resources by decree dated October 26, 2009.

                                                  30	
	
Delays followed as the SRS consolidated its structure and its management, which took time to
understand the issues and determine SRS’s own future. There was also a lack of permanence in
the SRS leadership. DCR continued to make proposals, including the drafting of a state
enterprise charter, in 2010-2011, and a draft package was submitted for the government’s
consideration in April 2011, but no final decision was forthcoming. The aide memoire of April
2012 notes that a decision was expected in August 2012, but with a change of government in the
third quarter of 2012, no decision was made. By the end of 2013, a further package had been
submitted to the government recommending financial independence for DCR within the SRS.
This package is planned to be considered by the prime minister and parliament in the first half of
2014.

An alternative approach was developed in the second half of 2013, during the second extension,
to ensure that there would be a sustainable basis for the core activities that could be implemented
before the project closed. This was to create the GIS Center, under the legal entity of Bishkek
LRO, that could employ the PIU staff. The GIS Center approach is a simpler means of ensuring
that key functions of DCR and the LROs could be funded through registration revenue. Funding
for the GIS Center comes from each of the LROs, with the contribution of each office reflecting
its ability to pay. For example, Bishkek LRO, which is the largest office, contributes more than
one-third of the funds, with Osh, Issyk-Kul, Issyk-Kata, Alamedin and Sokuluk LROs
contributing most of the rest. Remote LROs make only nominal payments. The arrangements are
based on a contract with all the LROs. The GIS Center proposal was approved by the SRS and
registered in the Ministry of Justice in November 2013, and it was to be fully functioning by the
project’s closing date of December 31, 2013.

In relation to the third aspect of 1.e, the detailed description of this subcomponent in the PAD
recognized that the consolidation of LROs was dependent on a government decision, and
therefore consolidation of LROs was never certain. The failure to do so during the project was a
missed opportunity, as resources were available to ensure a smooth amalgamation process.
However, consolidation of offices could be done at any time, as this is a matter that could be
implemented without significant cost. While the project planned to assist with such matters as
relocation of equipment and archives, some renovations and publicity, these costs could be
covered by LROs. Thus, no significant harm was done by the failure to consolidate smaller
offices, and the practicalities of insufficient revenue to operate the 19 LROs will most likely
force the issue in the very near future.

Attribution

Although it is early to fully judge the effectiveness of the GIS Center as a funding model, staff in
key support areas have been retained (as discussed in this annex) and to that extent, the model
has been effective in ensuring the skills and knowledge needed to support the registration
system.

Sustainability

There appears to be general agreement on the GIS Center funding model, with strong support
from the primary contributor (Bishkek LRO) to using registration revenue to fund key central
level functions, particularly IT support and development. It is likely, although not certain, that
this model will remain in place and continue to be effective over the longer term.


Subcomponent 1.f Project Management

Design

Subcomponent 1.f was intended to ensure that the project was well managed and completed in
accordance with the schedule and budget. It followed the LRERP’s approach of managing the
project through a PIU, which had specialists in the areas of M&E, financial management and
procurement, training, legal and IT. As the PAD noted, the main difference was to be that staff of
the PIU would be transferred to Gosregister over the life of the project, progressively reducing
the size of the PIU to core project management staff.

The outcome was that project implementation was to be timely and well-coordinated, and the
indicator was completion of the project on schedule. These were not changed during the
restructures except to take into account the extensions.

Results

The project benefited by the appointment of a very capable and experienced person as head of
the PIU soon after the project commenced, and he remained in that position throughout the
project period. Other capable staff, many of whom were members of the LRERP PIU, were
recruited and stayed throughout the project period, ensuring continuity and retention of skills and
corporate memory. As noted, retroactive financing from the SLRERP covered the costs between
the closure of the LRERP in December 2008 and the effectiveness of the SLRERP in October
2009.

Project progress was, in general, slow during 2009 and into the second year of the project. The
aide memoires show that work was often delayed, agreed actions were not met in time, and due
to delays, some work had to be repeated. These problems arose primarily through interference in
decision making at Gosregister (and perhaps other ministries and agencies) by high level
leadership. With the removal of the president and his associates in April 2010, DCR and the PIU
were once again able to begin making progress. Institutional changes in late 2009, which resulted
in the creation of the SRS and division of Gosregister into two parts, also distracted management
and the PIU from project activities, although most of these distractions were settled by the time
that the current director of DCR was appointed in April 2010. The first restructuring referred to
such problems in justifying the need for a one year extension.

By late 2010, the PIU had become fully focused on ensuring that project activities advanced. The
aide memoires show progress in meeting most of the project schedules in 2011 to 2013, although
delays in the government making a decision on the status of DCR and funding for core services

                                                32	
	
provided by the PIU meant that a further extension was required in 2013. By the end of the
project, with two extensions, the activities had been completed and all major outcomes had been
achieved.

The other main element of this subcomponent – the transfer of staff from the project and PIU to
DCR – progressed slowly due to the lack of a decision on DCR’s status and resolution of the
funding of DCR’s headquarters staff. As discussed already, the GIS Center now employs the
staff.

In terms of procurement, financial management, reporting and other core PIU activities, this
subcomponent functioned well. There were no problems with procurement, all audits were clean,
and all FM ratings (except one at the beginning) were satisfactory or moderately satisfactory.
Reporting was to a high standard and delivered in a timely manner. Government contributions
were all provided without difficulty, and disbursement of funds closely followed the formally
revised disbursement graph.

Attribution

The work under this subcomponent had an indirect, although crucial, role in achieving the PDO
and associated indicators. Timely and effective project management support allowed work under
the other subcomponents to progress smoothly.

Sustainability

With the close of the project, staff of the PIU are now employed by the GIS Center, as noted.
Retention of knowledge and skills relating to project management and reporting have therefore
been successfully retained through a funding model that appears at this stage to be sustainable, as
discussed above.


Component 2           Expanding Spatial and Legal Land and Real Estate Data

Subcomponent 2.a Systematic Registration

Design

This subcomponent was to support registration of properties in areas not covered under the
LRERP and to result in the systematic registration of at least 120,000 REUs (mostly in new
settlement or novostroiki areas) and 70,000 public REUs, as well as some community
pastureland. The outcome was that such REUs would be registered, with the indicator matching
the numbers specified in the subcomponent’s description.

Soon after the project began, research and a pilot project to register REUs in four novostroiki
areas in Bishkek were undertaken. It soon became clear that the number of unregistered REUs
was much smaller than originally thought, that many were not suitable for registration by
systematic means (due to ownership, occupation and building approval problems), and that most

                                                33	
	
public REUs had in fact been registered under the LRERP. Thus, by late 2010, the work under
subcomponent 2.a was rationalized, with the funds allocated to other subcomponents,
particularly 2.b. The restructuring of January 2011 reflected this, and although the description of
the activities was not altered, the targets were reduced to a total of 10,000 REUs, most of which
were to be in novostroiki areas. A target for registration of community pasturelands was also
added. The subcomponent was not changed in the second restructuring.

Results

Registration and survey work on the REUs was outsourced in late 2010 and completed in August
2011, with 10,005 REUs covered. When added to the number of REUs registered under the pilot
project of 2009, plus a government directive of October 2009 that resulted in public entities
registering the REUs that they occupied, a total of 20,854 REUs were registered during the
project period, well exceeding the revised target. Half of the 62 novostroiki in which systematic
registration work was conducted were in Bishkek, with the remainder spread between Osh (7),
Alamedin (10), Sokuluk (4) and Issyk-Kata (10).

Separately to the project’s activities, many new properties have been sporadically registered,
particularly newly constructed properties (including a large number of apartments in Bishkek).
On average, close to 70,000 new properties have been registered each year through applications
made by their owners, making almost half a million new REUs in the system during the life of
the project.

The other main aspects of this subcomponent – recording of community pasturelands – involved
the project staff working closely with those of the Bank funded Agricultural Investments and
Services Project to develop a methodology for demarcating, marking and registering these lands.
A target of registering pasturelands in more than 300 local areas was inserted in the results
framework in the first restructure. In 2010, a pilot was undertaken to test methodologies, and in
2011 tenders for the first of two phases of registration work were issued, with a tender for the
second phase issued in 2012. By late 2012, the first phase had been largely completed, but it was
not until September 2013 that work on the second phase came to a close. By the end of the
project, the original target was well exceeded. Community pastureland in some 395 local areas
had been demarcated and fully registered, with 37 additional areas incomplete due to disputes,
which DCR is in the process of resolving.

Attribution

The expansion of the number of REUs covered by the registration system provides support to the
real property market by extending the coverage of the registration system. The newly included
properties can be traded and otherwise dealt with in the same efficient, effective manner that
exists for other properties. The same also applies to the newly registered pasturelands.

Sustainability

As the data on the parcels and their ownership has been gathered and recorded in the registration
system, the results of this subcomponent are fully sustainable. Equally important however is

                                                34	
	
updating the data, as boundaries or ownership change. This, too, would appear to be sustainable
because DCR’s fees cover the cost of updating the data, and as they are very low, there is
potential for them to be raised slightly if costs increased. Also, the system for transacting without
the need for a notary has greatly reduced the barriers for the public to use the registration system,
and as the public generally accepts the need to register, there seems little risk that people will
stop using the system. In the future, newly created properties will be registered on a sporadic
basis through payment of registration fees by owners, and thus will not require project funds.
Thus all aspects of registering properties and keeping data updated appear to be sustainable.


Subcomponent 2.b Upgrading Cadastral Mapping

Design

Subcomponent 2.b was intended to result in maps based on satellite images or orthophotomaps
covering seven million hectares of arable and nearby pasturelands being produced and used by
local authorities and projects, and production and use of orthophotomaps covering 34,000
hectares in 23 towns. Digital cadastral maps were to be produced for:

        urban areas with active land markets, tourism, etc. and where digital cadastral maps did
         not exist, areas where increased development (of construction and land sales) was
         expected or areas where land market activity is hindered by the lack of maps; and
        areas where the lack of mapping hindered public land management or posed an
         environmental risk.

The component was to facilitate the acquisition of orthophotographs and/or orthorectified
satellite images of prioritized areas, training and equipment for Gosregister’s in-house
production of digital cadastral maps, and integration of the new maps to the ARS database.

There were two legal covenants relating to this subcomponent: the first required that the
government make spatial data openly available; and the second required that permits be issued
for aerial photograph flights.

The description of this subcomponent was modified in the first restructure to reflect a revised
detail design, as separate government funds became available to acquire and process aerial
photographs, and as the international professional advice was that digitizing of existing maps,
which were of adequate quality, would be more effective and appropriate. Thus, SLRERP funds
were to be allocated to digitize existing cadastre plans for 1.5 million parcels, with 680,000 land
parcels in urban areas to be geo-referenced by field GPS/GNSS survey. By doing so, the second
of the above legal covenants became no longer relevant.

The outcome and indicator for this subcomponent were that cadastral maps in selected areas
would be upgraded and accessible, as measured by the production and use, by local authorities
and rural projects, of rectified digital maps covering seven million hectares; and production of
orthophotomaps covering 34,000 hectares in 23 towns being used by LROs and also accessible
to other organizations. However, due to the significant changes in design in the first restructure,
while the outcome remained the same, the indicator was modified to reflect production of

                                                 35	
	
digitized maps for 1.5 million parcels and geo-referencing for 680,000 parcels. No changes to
this subcomponent were introduced in the second restructure.

Results

Work under this subcomponent started well in 2008-9, but following an assessment by an
international mapping consultant, it soon emerged that the original design needed to be modified
to better reflect the country’s needs. There were delays while the subcomponent was redesigned
in accordance with his advice, but as the redesign produced a better outcome, the delay was
justified. However, there were various other delays in implementation with no positive impact,
due to the re-organization of Gosregister (with the consequential loss of its mapping expertise),
recruitment of consultants to provide the lost technical expertise, preparation of tender
documents and the political instability of early 2010.

Work under the first set of contracts to digitize and geo-reference did not get underway until late
2011, although once work began, it progressed quickly. By the end of 2012, the original targets
had been achieved, and the program was complete by mid-2013. The contracts, which covered
key areas of the country, produced results that were better than anticipated: some 1.88 (against a
target of 1.5) million land parcels covered by digital maps, with 722,000 (against a target of
680,000) land parcels verified by geo-referencing.

The resulting digital mapping data is kept in a separate database and open source software is
used to view and modify the data. While it is therefore separate to ARS, the mapping data is
integrated with ARS from a user’s viewpoint. Users, who are currently restricted to DCR and
LRO staff, can seamlessly access either textual (through ARS) or graphical (through the open
source application) data from their workstation through a single office server. All 49 LROs have
the open source software installed, with staff trained in its use. DCR plans to provide external
users with access through the geoportal, with testing planned for late 2014 or early 2015.

It should be noted that the open source software is still in test phase in many offices – only
Bishkek and Osh LROs are updating maps in digital form as changes to boundaries occur. Paper
maps are being updated in parallel, and until DCR and the LROs gain confidence in the digital
mapping system, the two approaches will continue to operate in parallel, as they did for several
years before the legal registration system moved fully to a digital environment.

The subcomponent also delivered a number of outcomes that are not apparent from the
indicators. In particular, this subcomponent resulted in:

         adoption of a uniform, open coordinates system, as required under the legal covenant, for
          survey information, by decree signed by the president in October 2010;
         with SIDA and Bank technical support, preparation of a cadastral technical manual for
          staff of LROs, which was adopted by DCR in March 2011;
         with SIDA support, upgrading of the cadastre reference infrastructure through the
          creation of 93 base stations for GPS/GNSS across the country, 13 of which are
          continuously operating reference system points: nine funded under the project, three
          funded by SIDA and one privately owned station;

                                                 36	
	
        acquisition of 27 dual frequency receivers plus training for selected staff in all LROs in
         the use of GPS/GNSS equipment;
        positioning of DCR to apply for additional assistance from the Kingdom of Norway and
         Republic of Korea for support to complete digitizing of maps for the areas not covered by
         the project, plus geo-referencing, support the use of GPS and other activities;
        through the digitizing of maps for most of the country, creation of the foundation for
         national spatial data infrastructure in the Kyrgyz Republic;
        the implementation of internationally recognized principles and standards of quality
         control through the adoption of ISO standards for the quality control of spatial data as
         national standards, and by developing the capacity in the private and public sector for
         implementing them.

Attribution

Elements of a well-functioning, modern real property registration system were enhanced by the
results of this subcomponent, particularly in relation to:

        increasing the reliability of parcel and boundary data (particularly through geo-
         referencing);
        improving the accessibility of parcel and boundary data;
        equipping DCR and LROs for digital mapping; and
        establishing the foundation for NSDI.

Thus, this subcomponent had a direct positive impact on the reliability and accuracy of the
registration system.

Sustainability

The gathering and production of the mapping data was a one off exercise for the area covered
under the project. The data now exists, staff have been trained, and the system is ready to operate
around the country. As the data and skills will be in regular use, and as the updating has been, or
will soon be, integrated in the daily operations of the LROs, there appears little chance that
digital mapping will not be sustainable. The cost of updating of maps (which is primarily staff
salaries) should be covered by the registration and other fees paid by the public.


Subcomponent 2.c Valuation Support

Design

This subcomponent was originally intended to support the development of valuation software
and its implementation for both government purposes and to improve access to real estate market
information. It was a relatively small subcomponent and was to build on Gosregister’s initiative
under the LRERP on producing key parameters for use in mass valuation assessments. The first
step was to quickly and cheaply begin production of a sales price index. The index was to be
based on the prices recorded in sale transactions submitted to LROs for registration. Software

                                                 37	
	
development for mass valuation, which was dependent on the parliament adopting the necessary
legislative basis, was to follow.

No consensus on real property taxation within government and the parliament emerged in the
first two years of the project or was expected to emerge in the near future. The subcomponent
was therefore restructured in January 2011 to remove references to the valuation software, and
the intermediate results indicator was revised to delete reference to valuation software. The
indicator was redrafted to state that the sale price index would be available free of charge on the
DCR website.

Results

Development of the sales price index software, with assistance of the SIDA funded technical
assistance, and population of the database with recent sale prices proceeded quickly. By mid-
2010, DCR was publishing, free of charge on its web site, the monthly price indices for five
regions/LROs where the system was operating. At that stage, it was decided that the system
would not be implemented in small settlements because there was no demand and the market in
those areas was very thin. By mid-2011, nine regions/LROs were covered by the index and a
more sophisticated, paid service that provided data on cross-sections of sales had been launched.
The service can be found, in both Russian and Kyrgyz, at http://www.gosreg.kg. The service also
includes some free analytical reports. While the site is in English, the sales price index and
analytical reports have not been translated.

Results from DCR show that the index has become very popular. There were, on average, 200
hits per month in 2013 for the free version, and DCR has 87 individuals and bodies registered for
the paid version. In 2013, 30,411 paid reports were provided, giving a monthly average of 2,534
reports. The fee for the service is approximately US$ 3.00 per report, resulting in an average
monthly income of approximately US$ 7,600. DCR also provides a set of unique reports to the
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic and to four private banks. There is a separate tariff for
such bespoke reports.

The index continues to develop as new sales transactions are registered, and therefore become
more accurate.

Attribution
In providing data in this way, the functioning of the real estate market is enhanced by ensuring
that the market is more informed. Achieving the revised intermediate results indicator for
subcomponent 2.c, by making the index available over the web free of charge to the public, goes
to greater efficiency of the market.

Sustainability

As the data is drawn directly from the registration system, as long as the registration software is
maintained, the sales price index will continue to be available. As noted in relation to
subcomponent 1.b, it is highly likely that the LROs will provide funds for such software
maintenance. Staff are also required to analyse the data and produce the reports, particularly the

                                                38	
	
specialized report, and as the reports bring in significant revenue, it is highly likely that their
positions will be maintained.


Component 3              Professional Development and Standards

Component 3 was a relatively small component, with a mere US$ 0.6 million of grant funds
allocated over the entire life of the project. However, the ambitions of this component were high,
with plans for at least 15 courses per year for Gosregister staff (300 participants each year) and at
least three courses per year for educational and professional bodies (300 participants each year).
As the following summary of results will show, the project far exceeded the planned targets, and
there were innovations in the manner of presentation that significantly reduced costs.

Subcomponent 3.a Human Resources Development for Gosregister Staff

Design

Subcomponent 3.a originally aimed to present at least 45 courses for 900 Gosregister staff over
the original three years of the project. The targets were not altered as part of the restructurings.
The courses were intended to upgrade technical skills in operational systems and service
standards, as well as more general analytical and service delivery skills, which meant that both
headquarters and LRO staff were to receive training. As Annex 4 (Detailed Project Description)
to the PAD noted, this subcomponent was also intended to support Gosregister's transition
towards an independent agency that could, and would, develop its human resources
autonomously. Training was to include courses, seminars, workshops, study tours and
participation in local and international conferences.

Results

Training commenced soon after project effectiveness, and as training had continued under the
LRERP during 2008, there was little interruption in the program. Most of the training was
provided by Gosregister/DCR staff, although external trainers were used where Gosregister/DCR
staff lacked the necessary knowledge or experience. The PIU adopted a new approach of visiting
the LROs and conducting training in the field, instead of LRO staff come to Bishkek. By
reducing travel, accommodation and other costs in this way, the approach greatly increased the
training budget efficiency. As a result, despite the project being extended for a total of 18
months, and many more training courses being presented, all the training was provided within
the original budget.

The main topics covered in the training courses were:

    -     registration law and practice, at basic and advanced levels;
    -     office operations;
    -     surveying, GPS/GNSS;
    -     IT;
    -     communications and customer service;

                                                  39	
	
    -   monitoring and evaluation;
    -   financial management;
    -   management and organizational matters; and
    -   office safety.

The project accomplished significantly more than the subcomponent’s original goals. By
December 2013, 111 courses had been presented with 3,694 participants having attended. As the
entire staff of DCR and LROs is 1,668, this meant that many staff received training in more than
one subject. The following table shows the numbers of courses delivered over the project’s life
and the number of participants.

The gender of participants at courses under subcomponent 3.a was recorded, and these show that
there were 2,130 male participants and 1,564 female participants (including those in courses
provided in 2008). The male/female ratio of DCR and LRO staff is 57:43, so the training can be
seen to have been fairly spread between the male and female staff members, even though there is
a preponderance of men in the technical areas, which were a major focus of the training.

While participants were not asked to score their training course, they were asked to provide
feedback on the quality of the courses and what further training they would like. In general, their
responses were reported to be positive, and their advice on what further training was required
(primarily technical skills and IT) was used to develop the training plans. A consulting firm
conducted a skills/training needs assessment in late 2010 and early 2011. The results of that
assessment were also used to develop the training strategy and plans.

The training under subcomponent 3.a also included 19 study tours and conferences, with 59
participants, as follows:

    -   In 2009, a study tour to Kazakhstan to examine mass scanning and attendance at a
        conference in Kazakhstan on digital aerial photography.

    -   In 2010, a study tour to Norway to study IT matters, participation in the Third
        International Geo Conference in Montenegro, training in Bank procurement procedures
        and financial management in Italy for PIU staff, attendance at a conference on regional
        developments in cadastre and registration in Moscow and a study tour to Moldova.

    -   In 2011, a study tour to the Netherlands, further procurement training in Italy, attendance
        at a conference in Germany on GPS and a course on ArcGIS Server Enterprise facilities
        in Moscow.

    -   In 2012, attendance at United National Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)
        Committee on Housing and Land Management, Working Party on Land Administration
        (WPLA) conference in London, the World Bank’s annual Land Conference in
        Washington DC and a conference in Russia on GIS.

    -   In 2013, attendance at a GIS workshop in the Russian Federation, a seminar on
        safeguarding property rights in Sweden, a conference in Korea on information exchange
        and a conference in Turkey on software.

Further, in February 2009, Gosregister held its tenth anniversary conference over two days in
Bishkek, with over 100 attendees from LROs and 12 regional countries, including Armenia,
Azerbaijan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. And in March 2013,
DCR hosted the UNECE, WPLA conference in Bishkek, attended by over 100 delegates from 27
countries across the ECA region.

Attribution

The impact of training of Gosregister/DCR staff had a direct impact on improving the
registration system by increasing staff member’s understanding and skills in the existing system
and introducing them to both improved versions of the system (particularly ARS) that made it
more reliable, effective and secure, as well as new systems, such as digital mapping, the
scanning and financial management modules of ARS, GIS and other features. Staff were also
trained in providing new services, such as registration without a notary. The training equipped
staff to employ the many legal, procedural and IT based improvements to deliver better services
to the public.

Sustainability

Sustainability of training falls into two categories: retention of the knowledge already acquired
and new knowledge that will need to be acquired. In terms of the results of training under the

                                                41	
	
project, it can be assumed that the knowledge and skills will be retained and employed for
several years to come, as LROs have a relatively low turnover rate and the staff are using the
knowledge and skills in their everyday work, that resource is are unlikely to be lost through lack
of use. In the longer term, however, there will be a demand for refresher courses, training in new
areas and training for newly recruited staff. DCR has already identified that it will have training
needs in the areas of:

         GIS;
         GPS/GNSS; and
         changes to law and practice.

Thus, funding for development of courses, deployment of trainers and associated presentation
costs will be required. As long as the skilled PIU members remain employed through the GIS
Center (or alternate model), there is a good prospect for the training program to continue.
However, even if such staff were no longer available, existing LRO staff could provide the
training, as occurs in many land registries around the world.

Subcomponent 3.b Support for Education and Professional Bodies

Design

Subcomponent 3.b aimed to support educational institutions that taught courses associated with
land administration, and to support and provide training to the associations of land market
professionals. For the educational bodies, the support was to focus on developing or updating
notes and materials for courses, and possibly the initial presentation of the course itself. For the
professional associations, training was to be provided on topics such as the management, tasks
and international experience in running such associations, as well as training for members of the
associations on technical aspects of land administration and land and mortgage markets. The
original targets were three courses involving 300 participants over each of the three years of the
project, making a total of nine courses and 900 participants. These targets were not changed as
part of the restructures or extensions.

Results

Work on this subcomponent was slow to commence, as the table below shows, as representatives
of educational bodies and professional associations showed only very limited interest.
Gosregister decided in 2010 therefore that it would begin making the presentations, covering
technical topics on which its staff had expertise, while more actively seeking out proposals for
training from academics and professional bodies. A steady program of training was sustained
through the rest of the project, covering topics such as:

    -     KLIS and services provided by Gosregister/DCR and LROs;
    -     changes to the law;
    -     land management and basic elements of real estate;
    -     sales database; and
    -     Gosregister/DCR and law enforcement agencies and the courts.

There were a variety of participants attending the courses. These included real estate agents,
valuers, notaries and representatives of banks, government agencies, judges and court
representatives, and educational institutions.

The gender of the 1,074 participants showed that men were highly represented (men: 698 (65 per
cent); women 376 (35 per cent)), which probably reflects the dominance of men in the workforce
and the areas covered by the topics, although in the banking and legal sectors there is a good
gender balance in the Kyrgyz Republic.

With project support, one university course was developed. This was a cadastral engineering
course through the Kyrgyz Construction and Architecture Academy. The course, which is five
years in length, was first presented in 2012. Some 20 students have been enrolled in the course,
which has been run only once so far. A further course was prepared for a master’s degree of
science in land management, but agreement with the university involved was not finalized and
the course was not presented.

Attribution

The training under this subcomponent added not only to the better functioning of the registration
system – by equipping the private sector to use that system more effectively and efficiently – but
also provided support to the real property market by increasing the private sector’s knowledge of
real property matters, services provided by Gosregister/DCR and changes to the laws and
practices that supported improved efficiency. The training provided new skills and knowledge

                                               43	
	
that the private sector could utilize for its clients. The cadastral engineering course provided
support to the land market by equipping graduates with modern skills needed in geodesy and
cadastral surveying, on which the registration system is largely based.

Sustainability

Knowledge already obtained and the cadastral engineering course are assets that should not be
quickly lost, particularly as the private sector in the Kyrgyz Republic continues to develop and
will retain many of those professionals who took part in training. DCR has identified future
training needs for land market professional, particularly real estate agents and bank
representatives, in the areas of:

       changes to the law and procedures;
       changes in tariffs; and
       developments with KLIS.

Training of this kind is likely to continue because DCR and key LROs (such as Bishkek and Osh
office) have adequate internal resources to conduct training for external users.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

The main goal of the project was “to support markets for land and real estate and the more
intensive and effective use of land and real estate. This was to be done through the further
development of a reliable and well-functioning system for registration of rights in immovable
property.”15 The project was going to achieve its PDO by (a) increasing sales and leases; (b)
increasing access to credit by increasing the number of mortgages; (c) making property rights
more clear, secure, and accessible; (d) reducing registration time; and (e) establishing a
financially and institutionally sustainable land administration system.

As the Results Framework and other sections of this ICR demonstrate, the project achieved all of
its outputs and outcomes. These results are particularly impressive given the external shocks that
hit the Kyrgyz economy during the implementation period. The Project closed with an
estimated net present value of US$ 17.1 million or 68 per cent higher than the PAD
projection of US$ 10.2 million, and it achieved an estimated IRR of 39 per cent or 18
percentage points lower than the PAD projection of 57 per cent. Note the lower IRR is partly
a result of the restructuring that increased the project investment from US$ 7.0 million to US$
7.5 million.

This annex examines in detail the project’s economic impact in three subsections: (a) external
shocks and market constraints; (b) achievement of outcomes; (c) project performance versus
PAD projections.

External Shocks and Market Constraints

The project was affected by three major external shocks over the implementation period (2007-
2013). The first external shock was the Global Financial Crisis whose negative effects can be
seen in the Kyrgyz economy in 2009. Associated with that crisis was the banking crisis, in which
credit practically ceased to be provided. The third external shock was the 2010 Revolution,
which led to the ousting of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. However, only the risk of the third
external shock was somewhat identified in the PAD – the “turmoil in [the] Kyrgyz political
system” was rated as a “moderate risk.”16

As a result of these shocks, the Kyrgyz economy contracted 4.7 percentage points in 2009 and an
additional 3.4 percentage points in 2010. A comparative snapshot of GDP growth rates in the
region is presented below. As the graph shows, all countries experienced moderate to severe
economic contraction between 2008 and 2009. However, the 2010 Revolution meant that
Kyrgyzstan was the only country in the region that was not set on a path to economic recovery
between 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, the impressive economic recovery between 2010-2011 is

followed by another severe contraction in the 2011-2012 period due to disruptions in the gold
market.17

In addition to the external shocks, the project was implemented in an atmosphere with several
market constraints. The “volatility in [the] banking system and/or property market constrains rate
of growth in sales, leases, and /or mortgages” was identified as a “low risk” in the PAD.18 The
UNECE has identified “the lack of cheap long-term capital” as one of the biggest constraints of
the Kyrgyz housing finance market.19 Despite these constraints, the project has operated well and
exceeded its targets to increase the number of registered sales and mortgages.

Achievement of Outcomes

Despite the external shocks and market constraints, the project has shown impressive results with
the growth in sales, leases, and mortgages; reduced time to register a transaction; and the
establishment of a self-financing GIS center that supports the activities of the DCR.
Additionally, there has also been a reduction in the cost to register a transaction – this
development is an unintended positive benefit of the project.

Increase in Sales and Mortgages

Over the course of the project, registered sales have increased by 74 per cent from 43,104
(2007) to 74,900 (2013) versus the original project target of 26 per cent. Similarly, registered
mortgages have increased by 66 per cent from 43,314 (2007) to 71,908 (2013) versus the
original project target of 31 per cent. These results are particularly impressive in light of the

three external shocks discussed earlier. Not only has the project exceeded its targets on these two
metrics and increased the market liquidity, but it may have also played a role in softening the
negative impact of the three shocks on the Kyrgyz real estate market.

Reduction in Time and Cost to Register a Property

The reduction in time and cost to register a property has increased the efficiency of the real estate
markets in Kyrgyzstan.

Globally, the Doing Business Report ranks Kyrgyzstan ninth – 50 ranks ahead of the Europe and
Central Asia average – for registering a property.20 Over the course of this project, the number of
days to register a property has dropped from 3 days to just 4 hours or just half a day,21 and the
number of procedures has dropped from seven visits to two visits to the Gosregister. There is
also an option to expedite the transaction and this requires only one visit, although clients have to
pay KGS 300 expedited procedure fee instead of KGS 150 for the regular procedure.

Moreover, the cost to register a property has also dropped significantly since the project began in
2007. A part of this cost reduction can be attributed to the fact that notaries are no longer
required, and this helps save individuals KGS 2000 (US$ 41.3), which is almost 40 per cent of
the average monthly per capita income.22 Similarly, entities are able to save KGS 5000 (US$

          Note: Doing Business Report 2014 states that the time to register a property in Kyrgyzstan is 6 days. This
          figure is different because DB tracks the time for the entire procedure and not only the registration time at the

only 15 per cent of the individual and entity clients continue to use notary services as opposed to
100 per cent at the beginning of the project.

The GIS Center which was established during the course of the project is an important
achievement of the project. The Center became self-financing as of January 1, 2014 and it has
been operating well for the last five months based on contributions from local offices24 and fees
for services. This means that going forward, the Kyrgyz government will save approximately
US$ 39,000 annually as it will not need to finance the salaries and related costs of the PIU staff.
While the savings may not seem substantial, the self-financing nature of the GIS Center would
allow the Kyrgyz Government to spend the same money on other public services including
health and education. Assuming the same US$ 39,000 budget every year and a 12 per cent,
opportunity cost of capital, the net present value of potential government savings over a five-year
period amount to over US$ 140,000.

Project Performance versus PAD Projections

This section compares the project’s performance against the projections made in the PAD. For
this purpose, the same framework as the PAD is used so as to provide as comparable an original
model as possible. However, to allow for a fair comparison, the following assumptions have
been tweaked in the model presented in the PAD:

               2007 registered mortgages increased from 43,000 to 43,324 to reflect higher actuals;

              Kyrgyzstan,” Microfinance Centre and Partner To Enterprising People, December 2011,
              http://www.mfc.org.pl/sites/mfc.org.pl/files/Indebtedness%20report%20Kyrgyzstan_ENG.pdf. Median loan
              estimated at US$ 2,203, and average loan estimated at US$ 3,030.
24
     		       The GIS center annual budget of USD 39,000 is financed by local registration offices with each office
              contributing about 5 per cent of its revenue. The main activities funded in this way include IT support,
              GIS/GNSS support, monitoring, training, real estate analysis etc.

                                                               48	
	
       2007 registered sales increased from 40,000 to 43,104 to reflect higher actuals; and
       2009 and 2010 growth rates of registered mortgages, registered sales, average value of a
        mortgage and average value of a property are lowered to the actuals following the three
        external shocks faced by Kyrgyzstan.

All other assumptions in the PAD analysis remain unchanged.

The NPV and IRR are calculated by using the increase in the monetary value of sales and
mortgages in the Kyrgyz economy over a ten-year period of which six years were the
implementation period. Of this total increase only 1 per cent is attributed to the project. This
assumption is in line with the PAD and is an important because the project should not claim
credit for the overall growth of the real estate market because of other economic interactions
which may have positively benefited the Project and because of other reforms by the Kyrgyz
Government and other donor projects. The 1 per cent assumption is conservative and helps
mitigate several measurement, isolation, and attribution effects that ought to be considered when
measuring the impact of the project alone.

Assuming a 12 per cent discount rate (same assumption as the PAD), the NPV of benefits
attributable to the Project is estimated at US$ 17.1 million and the Project IRR is estimated at 39
per cent.

Due to the changes made to the original PAD assumptions, it is not fair to compare the NPV and
IRR with the figures projected in the PAD since the PAD assumption baseline was more
conservative and PAD growth assumptions were more aggressive. Keeping this in mind, a
positive NPV and positive IRR should speak to the viability and success of the project.

Purely for the sake of comparison, the analysis shows that the Project’s estimated NPV of US$
17.1 million is 68 per cent higher than the original PAD projection of US$ 10.7 million. This
means that despite the three external shocks that affected the Kyrgyz economy, the project has
generated a higher NPV done better than what was projected in the PAD. Moreover, 2009 and
2010 external shocks occurred fairly early on in the Project meaning that they had a greater
negative impact on the NPV because of the way the DCF model works.

As for the IRR, the project’s estimate of 39 per cent is 18 percentage points lower than the
original PAD projection of 57 per cent. This can be explained by two developments. First, the
2009 and 2010 external shocks occurred fairly early on in the project meaning that they had a
greater negative impact on the IRR because of the way the DCF model works. Second, the
original PAD projection is calculated using a US$ 7.0 million project investment versus the
project’s final IRR estimate which is calculated using a US$ 7.5 million project investment. This
too would lower the project’s IRR.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Summary of Borrower’s ICR

The lengthy Borrower’s ICR Report followed the format of the Bank’s ICR Report.
Following a summary of the project context, development objectives and design,
including a description of the two restructures, it looked at the key factors affecting
implementation and outcomes, and then moved on to the assessment of outcomes and
also lessons learned. At the end, the Borrower’s ICR provided a detailed list of
achievements and outcomes of the SLRERP in Annex 7. The following is a shortened
version of the main body of the Borrower’s ICR Report.

KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The SLRERP took into account lessons learned from land and real estate administration
in other countries as well as lessons from the LRERP. These cumulative lessons are as
follows:

а) Establishment of the single organizational structure, responsible for registration of
rights and maintenance of cadastre is viewed worldwide as advanced practice.
b) Improvement of registration offices’ financial management methods and analysis of
this aspect due to other activity aspects – such as service standards and payment – shall
help DCR to improve its activity, become more financially sustainable, and develop a
strategy for practical resolution of problems.
c) Focusing on more effective cooperation, which was one of the directions upon clients’
survey requiring much attention and support.

An important factor influencing on quality of preparation and design of the project was
that the SLRERP supported the established Government goals in the area of
development, specified by the Country Development Strategy for 2007-2010.

The World Bank played a key role in the process of the project preparation, directing
efforts for resolving fundamental issues related to improvement of the cadastre and
registration system and proposing advanced developments related to the project design.
Generally, the project design was correct and well developed.

Implementation

The SLRERP was implemented by the PIU operating in DCR headquarters under its
supervision. To implement the project successfully, on each component and each
subcomponent working groups from the PIU, DCR and LROs’ staff were created. For
each component supervisors from the DCR management were appointed to monitor the
working group operations. To monitor the project progress, a Steering Committee headed



                                           56	
	
by the DCR director was appointed. During the Steering Committee meetings the
working groups’ reports, problem issues and perspective plans were considered.

Under the LRERP a monitoring system was created to ensure agreed application of single
national standards of the 49 LROs and for reporting. The monitoring function included
data collection and processing required for development of framework results and data on
observing service standards. The performance, strategy and communication unit (PSCU)
made an analysis and developed strategies and organization of communication – as on
internal DCR issues so on issues related to other agencies – thereby providing to DCR an
important management tool.

In the course of the project implementation in 2009 a reform for streamlining procedures
and reducing registration time was implemented. Amendments in the Civic Code of the
Kyrgyz Republic were implemented in part of cancellation of mandatory notary
certification of transactions and in the Kyrgyz Republic law “On state registration of
rights to immovable property” in part of mandatory survey of real estate units, reduction
of registration and streamlining requirements for provided documents (requirement of
provision of notarized copies of constituent documents cancelled). The above
arrangements have significantly reduced the procedure, time and costs for transactions
processing with real estate. Direct transactions in LRO’s have enabled making
agreements and registration of rights. A registrar checks for compliance with legislation,
restrictions in the database, drafts an agreement, accepts an application and makes
registration. Registration is possible within 1 hour in urgent cases. A significant support
for streamlining procedures was implemented by the Kyrgyz Government, which adopted
arrangement plans and monitored the implementation of the reforms. These
developments enabled ranking in the ninth position in 2013 on the World Bank Doing
Business indicator “Property registration”.

Project implementation was successfully implemented thanks to invaluable World Bank
support, provided taking into account different approaches on the basis of the gained
experience. Supervision missions were arranged twice a year enabling regular personal
cooperation on project implementation issues. Project progress reports would be provided
twice a year enabling tracking key project indicators and progress in real estate market.
The following steps and additional actions would be agreed in detail with partners on
project implementation reflected in aide memoires and reports for the management, and
would be subsequently monitored. Consulting support from the World Bank part played
a great role in taking right decisions on project implementation.

During project implementation there was an effective cooperation with Swedesurvey
team (the Swedish cadaster agency implementing SIDA funded technical assistance
component and conducting training for DCR staff). Thanks to that technical assistance,
DCR developed effective land registration procedures and real estate objects, built
fundament for creation of cadastral database and implementation of GNSS technologies.

There were no major unforeseen developments that threatened the implementation path
of the project or its strategy for achieving the PDO. Issues that did come up were

                                            57	
	
identified in a timely manner and with appropriate attention related to overall
development objectives.

Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Under the SLRERP the Monitoring Unit has been revised into Performance, Strategy, and
Communication Unit, continuing the project activities. The monitoring system would
build on the first project experience, which was rather successful. Regional staff would
be accountable to the PIU national monitoring and evaluation coordinator.

Indicators related to quality of services provided would be monitored, including number
of submitted complaints and sampling check of observance of agreed registration
procedures including transparency and rates for registration. Whole data on contacts with
clients would be analyzed by regional monitoring staff and submitted to the PIU and the
DCR management.

The simple and comprehensive project design enabled development of that clear and
easily implementable monitoring system. Data quality would be reinforced by cross
checks, conducted during supervision missions and would be reckoned reliable. Data on
PDO indicators would be agreed with another existing information on real estate market
development. Particularly, mortgage credit data would be carefully studied by the World
Bank project team by cross checks, conducted under the Second Rural Financing Project.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards: The project did not involve any safeguard policies. There was a limited
amount of office repair and small-scale reconstruction, which at the time of appraisal
rated a category C for Environmental Assessment. 25 It did not involve involuntary
resettlement, natural habitats or forest areas.

Procurement: The procurement under the project has been carried out in satisfactory
manner. Procurement plans for project implementation were developed and revised as
required. The overall project risk for procurement was rated Medium to High,
considering the lack of Bank procurement experience in the PIU. Procurement staffing at
the PIU was adequate and the staff became more knowledgeable and efficient as the
project progressed.  

Financial management: The financing management system, employed by the PIU,
enables accounting of all operations and accounts and has a function of regular financing
reporting, which would be timely submitted to the World Bank. The established internal
control system within the PIU ensures authenticity of accounting documentation and
safety of the project resources and assets. The PIU has upgraded the project financial
management manual. The project would use the automated accounting system on the
basis of “1-C” software. Accounting is done according to the World Bank’s procedures
and requirements related to finances and payments management. Funds would be used in

ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Real estate market support together with more intensive and effective use of land and real
estate at the expense of further development of reliable and effective registration system
was for the Kyrgyz Republic a high priority throughout the whole project implementation
period. In 2013 a new transition Program of the Kyrgyz Republic to the sustainable
system for 2013-2017, which is based on the five new components was adopted:

First, a principle for formulating sustainable policy development policy through
cooperation and mutual impact of economic, social and ecological processes. Secondly,
policy content on all development directions has been formulated through specific
requirements for key components of the state governance system: (i) institutional
capacity; (ii) legislation; (iii) staff capacity and requirements for its development to
promote sustainable development principles nationwide; (iv) requirements for
information authenticity to take weighed political decisions. The third program element is
a human resources development policy through concrete obligations of public service
improvement. The fourth program element is inter-sectoral segments in providing public
service. The fifth section of the Program became a section for sustainable development

strategy, as without economic contributions of regions there is no sustainable country
strategy.

The project design was in compliance with state programs for country development.

An effective real estate registration system helped generate many economic benefits,
supporting (a) tenure security; (b) property taxation; (c) security for credit; (d) judicial
procedures relating to land and real estate rights; (e) dispute management; (f) real
property markets development and monitoring; (g) protection of State lands; and (h) land
reform; (j) information sharing between state and municipal bodies; (k) participation in
regions development.

The achieved outcomes in the course of the project development have become an
example of advanced experience for other state bodies.

Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The objective of the SLRERP is to support markets for land and real estate and the more
intensive and effective use of land and real estate has been achieved. It was done through
the further development of a reliable and well-functioning system for registration of
rights in immovable property. Project outcomes by the end of the project were as follows:

       Improved functioning of, and access to sales and long-term lease markets in land
        and real estate, as evidenced by an increase of at least 26 percent above the
        number of transactions in 2007. By the project completion date of 31 December
        2013, the number of transactions made up 74900 units, which is 73,8% from the
        basic indicator.
       Increased performance, expressed by reduction of average time for sale
        processing. The average indicator of transactions processing was 0,5 day as
        compared with the base 2007 year (4 days).
       Increased access to credit, as evidenced by an increase of at least 31 percent
        above the number of transactions in 2007. As of 31 December 2013, 71980
        mortgages were registered, which is 66,1% from the basic indicator.
       Property rights clear, secure and reflected in a publicly accessible information
        base, as evidenced by an increase in the number of land and real estate units in the
        registry system, and continued improvements in the quality of registry operations,
        communications and reputation. A permanent increase of total number of real
        estate units within the registration system and permanent improvement of
        registration operations was noted. In the base year, 2,4mln of real estate units
        were registered. Upon the SLRERP, in the information base more than 2,92mln
        immovable property units were registered.
       A financially and institutionally sustainable land administration system, as
        evidenced by implementation of organizational and financing reforms. Upon the
        project completion, a Centre GIS was established, being responsible for
        maintenance of information and geo-information technologies, monitoring and
        evaluation, improvement of procedures, the system professional development.

Efficiency

The gradual approach that DCR adopted has been, especially considering the questions of
capacity and resources, a very correct policy, ensuring reliable registration operations at
all times while allowing progress towards a modern and efficient registration system.

Under the project in all LROs, ARS was implemented, sporadic scanning of archive
documents carried out, KLIS and sales database has been developed, implementation of
automation accounting has been started, and cadastral database has been developed. The
consecutive approach applied under the project, particularly taking into account issues
related to capacity and resources enabled ensuring reliable operation of registration
system anytime making possible progress in establishing modern and effective land
registration system.

The developed monitoring and evaluation system allowed achievement of significant
outcomes in streamlining registration procedures. A monitoring group watched such
issues as problems in the executing activities, problem issues for clients, costs and time
for processing of each application type, public opinion survey was carried out according
to which recommendations for elimination of legal and administrative barriers and
unneeded costs in processing transactions with land shares and registration of such
transactions were given.

Procedures streamlining procedures made possible achieving significant results on
reduction of registration time and funds.

In part of cadastral mapping it was also decided to start from using cheap software
products. Mass geo-referencing of cadastral maps and their geo-referencing with the
following establishment of graphic data allows reducing time of cadastral procedures and
generally make cheaper preparation of appropriate documents. Transition to the
centralized digital database created a basic for implementing ways of cadastral data
provision via Internet, which is the indicator of the cadastre system performance.

Implementation of open software products for cadastral mapping allows integration of
graphic data with textual data as well as efficiency for step-by-step transition to digital
mapping in LRO’s. In the future this will enable graphic data processing and providing
real estate object’s location data in digital.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Results of the project remained relevant throughout implementation and continue to be
relevant. A reliable system for registration of immovable property rights is a key building
block of a well-functioning market economy. The project demonstrated clear success in
putting in place such a system, which in turn has had a direct contributing influence on
the significant expansion of land and real estate market activity. In 2013 an approximate



                                            61	
	
market volume made up about 28,8% GDP, which is almost annual state budget of the
country.

Access to the registration information: The system is open and accessible. Under the
project, KLIS data provision has been implemented enabling clients, state bodies and
registers use of registration data. KLIS data has served as a basis for taxation. Needed
real estate data and technical characteristics were provided to tax authorities for tax
calculation. Information from the real estate register was used by the National statistic
committee in recording housing resources nationwide in 2009. In implementing
electronic software for local self-governments, the information from the register was used
to develop municipal property register. To make an analysis of mortgage credit and real
estate market data is used by the National bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Prior to the project inception a special record or some reliable data sources on real estate
price was lacking. Currently, on the DCR website price index is published, being
developed by registered transactions documents.

There are memoranda on cooperation with public and private organizations for the use of
digital data in the layout of the resort and recreation area of Issyk-Kul lake, to use the
data in the infrastructure cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad, and for sharing GNSS / GPS base
stations.

Under the project the coordinate system’s accessibility has been achieved. The approval
of the open coordinate system is one of the legal conditions of the Financing Agreement,
which is key for investment in the second component. Official recognition of the new
geodetic reference system (approved new national coordinate system Kyrg-06 based on
the international system (ITRF- 2005) Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic dated October 7, 2010 at number 235) was a necessary factor in the viability of
investments subcomponent 2b upgrading cadastral mapping (which, after the
restructuring of the project got almost $ 2.4 million of total project funds).

Reduction in Time to Process Transactions: Transactions time reduced from 4 days to 1
day. Previously, to process transaction, a technical survey, receiving certificate from a
LRO, to process a transaction by a notary and register again a transaction at a LRO were
mandatory. During the 2009 reforms, normative legal acts were revised, cancelling
mandatory technical survey and notary’s certification and registration time has been
reduced. As a result, a purchaser has an option in processing a transaction: in a notary
office or in a LRO. Currently 85 percent of transactions are processed within LRO’s as
time and cost for transaction processing has been significantly reduced.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: Analysis of the DCR
database (as of September 30 2013) showed that number of registered property to women
increased as compared with 2012 by 1,6 percent. Property owners are 60,3 percent are
male, 39,7 percent - female.		

                                            62	
	
	
Thanks to the good registration system and state security of registered rights, in 2013 the
number of registered property achieved 2,92mln units, which is 21,7 percent higher than
in base 2007 year. The market stabilization enabled the growth of property involved in
mortgage operations for receiving credit. During the reporting period number of
mortgages was 71980, which is 66,1 percent higher as compared with the base 2007 year.
Implementation of the open national coordinate system enabled wide employment of
cadastral data in public cartographic materials and reduce number of land disputes in
various economy sectors.	 The ARS implementation and its development enabled
improvement of clients servicing. 	

Institutional Change/Strengthening: During the project implementation period, the
focus was on introduction of various innovations and capacity building directed to
increase effectiveness, encouraging good management, and resolving registration
challenges. The project continued further development of undertaken steps towards
establishing modern and open organization and mechanism ensuring institutional
succession and further development upon the project completion.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts: To date, the creation of digital maps due to
the need to solve problems that arise in solving the problems of socio-economic
development of the country, in the operation and interaction of automated systems
created different categories of citizens in the area of information services. Every year
there is an increasing demand for relevant real estate data and digital maps and in various
other areas of public administration as the development of network communications,
records of citizens, accurate voter lists, measures to protect the environment and prevent
emergencies, territorial development planning regions, agriculture, cartographic support
infrastructure projects. To implement these tasks, it is necessary to create a National
Spatial Data Infrastructure (fully functional GIS system).

LESSONS LEARNED

Generally the project achieved significant outcomes in resolving established goals. The
successful project implementation is confirmed by a range of obvious lessons:

       Establishing the PSCU group was effective for ensuring DCR activity
        improvement. The monitoring system is the cornerstone of improving operations
        of DCR, and includes the monitoring of local office performance, staffing and
        finances, maintaining quality control, analyzing the results of monitoring,
        formulating improvements, communicating findings to staff and management, as
        well as to key stakeholders. The monitoring system considers social development
        issues as well. It used a quantitative survey, plus focus group discussions,
        structured interviews and observations to measure indicators of service provision
        (information dissemination, levels of access, assessment of complexity, and
        costs), staff professional competence (accuracy and speed of services), and client
        relations (perceptions of friendliness, convenience). On the base of analysis and
        recommendations, DCR takes measures to address good land governance.

                                            63	
	
       Working groups comprising PIU and DCR staff and others became rather useful
        as a coordination tool, ensuring progress in project implementation of different
        project subcomponents. On each direction of the project, working groups together
        developed work plans, discussed strategic goals.
       Step-by-step implementation of IT and employment of low-cost methods allowed
        to ensure uninterrupted work on registration and effective transition to the
        automated systems. Originally, a method for step-by-step employment of IT
        together with use of paper based version. New or modified software products
        were implemented nationwide only after testing in several offices. Software was
        developed by local consultants and improvements were made as needed.
       A decision on restructuring of the project in maps upgrading through
        digitalization of paper based maps played a key role in development of digital
        maps for LRO’s. This decision was directed for further maintenance of mapping
        in digital. Conditions of paper based maps annually became worse in process of
        work and employment of which would have worsen accuracy of cadastral works
        in the future. Implementation of the open source coordinate system allowed land
        survey with use of new methods not only for DCR but also for private, public and
        municipal structures.
       Successful training of the DCR and LROs’ staff enabled development of human
        resources within cadastre and registration, playing an important role in executing
        effective activity of the system in all directions. Support of private real estate
        professionals enabled timely informing on the system operation, simplified
        procedures, innovations which had a positive impact on the DCR service.
        Development of training courses for education institutions and conducting
        different trainings enabled focusing training on DCR training directions,
        particularly on automated registration system, geo-information system, and
        implementation of GPS/GNSS technologies.
       The DCR has gained significant experience in project implementation. The
        implementation of the two projects funded by the World Bank enabled mastering
        of project proposals drafting skills, achievement of established goals. “Property
        rights security” project in cooperation with the Norwegian Mapping Authority has
        been started. The main project goals are expanding of GPS/GNSS network
        nationwide, geo-referencing of digital maps, and implementation of integrated
        information system on real estate. The issue on implementation of the project
        “Modernization of the Kyrgyz Republic cadastre system” in cooperation with the
        South Korea Cadastral Corporation in part of cadastral mapping and improvement
        of cadastral database is being discussed. Implementation of joint project
        implementation on state-private partnership in cooperation with the General
        Directorate on cadastre and registration in Turkey is being considered. These
        projects are directed to continuation of works started by the SLRERP.
