and Real\n            Estate Registration Project for Kyrgyz Republic were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: project implementation was\n            greatly aided by a robust monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) framework based on objective indicators that were\n            tracked consistently throughout the project and served as\n            useful tools to monitor outputs and outcomes. This allowed\n            for greater focus on what was important for PDO achievement\n            and course correction, when necessary. Building\n            institutional capacity was critical to the success of this\n            project, especially in the face of political instability.\n            This also enabled the successful roll out of the IT system\n            and the creation of the self-financed Geographic Information\n            System (GIS) Center, which has reduced the registration\n            services' reliance on the state budget and will allow\n            for future investments without straining the government\n            budget. Over the course of this project, separate digital\n            archives were maintained and updated regularly. This was\n            extremely valuable as records could easily be replaced when\n            paper records were lost. As noted, the ability to issue\n            certificates based on these records helped stabilize the\n            country in the aftermath of the violence in the South. Such\n            a practice should be followed elsewhere, especially in\n            politically volatile countries."}, "docdt": "2014-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
