                         noteworthy achievement is the lifting of the five year moratorium on transactions of lands with new house construction. Progress on the information technology part of the project has
                         continued to move ahead. The use of the Kyrgyz Land Information System (KLIS) has continued smoothly in all 49 local registry offices (LROs). The KLIS now provides information to

                         documents in the Bishkek office has been initiated. The total number of registered Real Estate Units in novostroiki areas has reached 23,013. Digitization of paper cadastral index
                         maps has been initiated in all planned lots; in 2011, 641,817 out of the targeted 700,000 parcels were digitized. In 2012, progress in digitizing amounts to 115,834 out of a target of
                         800,000 and the target is expected to be achieved as the pace accelerates with multiple contracted lots now working in parallel.
