                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress toward achieving the project’s development objectives is good and most of the outcome targets have been achieved and exceeded.. The number of transactions has
                         increased by 32.8% by the end of 2011 compared to the baseline level of 2007 and 26% target at the end of the project. The trend continues and it is expected that by the end of
                         2012 there will be an overall increase of 36.8%. Similarly, the increase of the number of credit-related transactions by 31 percent will be achieved by the Closing Date. By the end of
                         the year 2011, the number of credit-linked transactions in the registration system had risen 30.2 percent versus the base level of 2007. In the first nine months of 2012 the indicator
                         had continued to increase at an annualized level of 12%, which projects an overall increase of 56.2% versus baseline by the end of 2012. In addition, as a result of the project

                         activities, the legal framework for registration now ensures that property rights are clear and secure, and the information base is publicly accessible. Evidence for the increase in the
                         number of real estate units in the registry system shows that the number has continued to gradually climb throughout the life of the project, and now stands at 2.82 million (versus
                         2007 baseline of 2.4 million). The quality of the registration system is reflected in the technological progress of the Information Technology (IT) system, and in the average
                         transaction processing time, which is now 1 day for a standard purchase-sales transaction. The Kyrgyz system is ranked 17th in the world by the Doing Business Survey on the

                         estate and spatial data services. The sustainable financial and institutional reforms target continues to lag behind because the self-financing government entity planned for post-
                         project operation of the system has not yet been created.
