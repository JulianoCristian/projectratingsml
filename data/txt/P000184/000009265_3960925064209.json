report\n            (PCR) for the Integrated Rural Development/Ngozi III\n            Project. The principal objectives of the project were to:\n            (a) assists mall holders to improve the productivity of\n            coffee and food cultivation; (b) improve the quality of\n            exported coffee; and (c) improve rural living conditions by\n            building or maintaining water supply systems, rural roads\n            and forestry for fuel and timber. The project was to be\n            implemented over a period of six years. As a result of\n            project activities, a major increase in the cultivation of\n            rice and vegetables was achieved, although overall food\n            production has remained virtually stagnant, with a drop in\n            bean, maize and groundnut output but an increase in tuber\n            output. The complex and varying reasons for these changes\n            all had to do with whether profitable opportunities did or\n            did not exist (better yielding seed, better multiplication\n            methods, land availability, etc.). The extension component\n            does not appear to have succeeded in reducing soil erosion\n            and degradation, despite anti-erosion measures (like\n            afforestation on hilltops and agroforestry in coffee\n            plantations) and use of fertilizers."}, "docdt": "1992-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
