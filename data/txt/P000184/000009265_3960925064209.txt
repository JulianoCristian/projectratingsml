PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURUNDI
INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT/NGOZI III PROJECT
(CREDIT 1192-BU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Integrated Rural
Development/Ngozi III Project for which Credit 1192-BU in the amount of US$16.0
million was approved on December 8, 1981. Credit 1192-BU was closed on December
31, 1989, two years and nine months behind schedule, at which time the undis-
bursed balance of SDR 1.7 million was cancelled (12 percent of the credit).
The PCR was prepared by the Agricultural Operations Division of the South-
Central and Indian Ocean Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and
III). On llay 17, 1991 the Association sent the Borrower Parts I and III with the
request to prepare Part II by August 17, 1991; no reply was received.
Preparation of this PCR is based inter alia on the Staff Appraisal
Report, the Credit Agreement, Supervision Reports, correspondence between the IDA
and the Borrower, and internal memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPOkT
BURUNDI
INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT NGOZI III PROJECT
(CR. 1192-BU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Agriculture is the major economic activity in Burundi and generates almost
all foreign exchange, 90 percent of which is acco-rnted for by coffee. Foodstuffe
make up a little less than 10 percent of imports.  Impoverished soils and a
degraded environment constitute a considerable threat to the agricultural
potential of the country, 90 percent of whose population lives from farming in
circumstances where population density exceeds 190 inhabitants per km2. The
project was located in Burundi's most densely populated region and in its main
coffee growing area.
2.    The project signaled a change from the Government's previous agricultural
development strategy. Instead of centralized governmentas departments being used
to develop coffee production, Regional Development Comb L. ;s (RDCs) were to be
created as decentralized agencies, to be made responsib)r  for the integrated
development of their respective regions (fooderops,  coffee, infrastructure,
erosion control). One RDC was therefore set up under this project to carry out
the activities in the Ngozi region that had previousfy been the responsibility
of separate departments.
3.    The project was cofinanced by IDA, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), the Kuwait Fund and Gove.nment. 'he project was managed
according to annual work plans, which made it possible to adjust both activities,
budgets and Credit category disbursements in the light of constraints and
successes met during the execution process itself.
Obiectives
4.    The principal objectives of the project were to:  (a) assist smallholders
to improve the productivity of coffee and food cultivation; (b) improve ie
quality of exported coffee; and (c) improve rural living conditions by builcin£
or maintaining water supply systems, rural roads and forestry for fuel and
timber. The project was to be implemented over a period of six years.
Implementation Experience
5.    The project encountered implementation delays because of a change in the
focus of extension activities away from coffee toward foodcrops (the earlier
Ngozi I and II operations concentrated on increasing coffee production); it also
suffered from a high turnover among managerial and technical assistance staff and
from shortcomings in financial management.



- iv -
6.    More coffee washing stations were constructed than envisaged at appraisal
(28 cf. 15). Design and construction standards were satisfactory. In response
to price incentives farmers shifted deliveries of coffee from the old manual
pulping centers to the new stations.
7.    The extension service was not very effective during the initial phaae of
implementation.   Starting in 1987, however, increasing use was made of the
Training and Visit method and both performance and impact of the extension
services have improved.
8.    The project established a decentralized integrated project authority, the
RDC, but towards the end, deficiencies became sufficiently serious to convine'
both Bank and Government to reverse this decision. The reason was not deficienu
management; it was mainly that, in spite of the intention to make the RDC a
commercial operation, it continued to be run as a Government service, at cost
levels that were unsustainable. After a study of the functioning of the RDCs had
been carried out, the decision was taken to spin off the rewenue generating
activities as independent enterprises (notably the coffee washing stations) and
to revert back to Government the services oriented activities (notably extension
and road maintenance). These decisions were taken with the basic objective to
ensure the sustainability of project results in the long-run. The privatization
of the coffee washing stations is being implemented under the Ceffee Sector
Project (Cr. 2123-BUI); the transfe. of services back to the technical ministries
is being implemented under the Agricultural Services Project (Cr. 2024-BUI) and
should be completed by end 1992.
Results
9.    As a result of project activities, a major increase in the cultivation of
rice and vegetables was achieved, although overall food production has remained
virtually stagnant, with a drop in bean, maize and groundnut output but sn
increase in tuber output. The complex and varying reasons for these changes all
had to do with whether profitable opportunities did or did not exist (better
yielding seed, better multiplication methods, land availability, etc.).  The
extension component does not appear to have succeeded in reducing soil erosion
and degradation, despite anti-erosion measures (like afforestation on hilltops
and agroforestry in coffee plantations) and use of fertilizers.
10.   In coffee-growing, the project resulted in the planting of more trees than
anticipated.   Although the total number of productive trees is not known
accurately, coffee yields are declining in the project area because of tailure
to fertilize adequately, faulty pruning, aging of trees, and the location of new
plantations in marginal areas.   Washing stations are well managed and are
contributing to the considerable increase in the volume of fully washed Burundi
coffee, which is of the high quality anticipated at appraisal.
11.   The very successful expansion of the wet coffee processing method was
largely due to (a) good expatriate technical assistance and good training of
Burundian counterparts; and (b) the payment of an incentive price, which made
farmers enthusiastic deliverers of cherries and encouraged Government to respond
by accelerating the establishment of washing stations. The incentive price was
justified by the expectation of a premium price on the world market for fully



-v -
washed arabica coffee (about 15 percent on average).   This premium was not
real4zed until 1989, however, due to problems downstream in the coffee chain
(hull_ng, storage and transport). The implicit subsidy was indirectly financed
through outside fundtng, but was in the end justified when the quality problems
were recognized anr. esolved (outside the context of the two projects).
12.   In reforestation and road building, goals were also exceeded, in part due
to active commun.  * participation.   No water supply points were developed
primarily because W.2 lower than expected community participation.
13.   The project was successful in raising farm incomes, albeit less than
estimated at apprais6l.  Surveys show that the value of production per farm
(including consumption) reacaed an estimated FBu 78,140, or LBu 55,480 at 1981
prices. At appraisal, it was anticipated that 10 years after project commence-
ment, the value of farm production would be FBu 68,000.
14.   The economic rate of return for the project is reestimated at 25.7 percent,
or at virtually the same figure forecast at appraisal (26.3 percent).   The
similarity between the rates of return can primarily be explained by project
ma.ageme.-I'n eff,..;-.ttveness in reducing investments on unproductive activities and
incx3asir.' investmerts in successful activities, which is fully explained by an
attitude of flexibility and adjustment during implementation.
Sustainab2-tv
15.   Towav' the end of the project, following a study of the operation of the
RDCs, it apr..:red that, owing to the difficulties inherent in managing numerous
interrelated ac 'on programs, the institutional sustainability of the project
could not be assured.   As a result, it was decided to discontinue the RDC
experiment and to divide the activities in question between the public sector
(extension, research, infrastructure) and the private sector (waahing-station
management, marketing of inputs, seed multiplication and plant propagation). The
future role of the RDCs will be to coordinate these actions within their own
regions.
Findings and Lessons Learned
16.   The major lessons the Bank and the Government can draw from this project
are:
(a) Managing the project according to annual work plans made it possible
to adjust activities, budgets and Credit category disbursements in
the light of constraints and successes met with during the execution
process itself. More coffee washing stations could thus be built and
the operating costs could easily be adjusted in light of the
activities of the extension service.
(b) The project, in contrast to the two earlier projects in the region
that were IDA financed (Ngozi I and II), was successful in promoting
rice and vegetable production.



- vi -
(c) Emphasis by the extension service on cooperatiorn with local communi-
ties on a participatory basis led to active local participation in
key project activities (anti-erosion works and maintenance of tree
and coffee nurseries).  It has also laid the groundwork for more
active private sector involvement in the follow-up projects (Coffee
Sector Project and Agricultural Services Project).
(d) The lack of research-extension interaction limited the effectiveness
of the extension service.   No messages could be developed that
addressed basic farmer needs and that could have been instrumental in
combatting plant diseases and erosion.
(e) Extension workers are not always able to deliver their messages to
women, even in cases where they are the ones doing the actual farm
work. Sociological constraints hampering women from having access to
extension services should be addreszed during project design.

2.   Backaround
2.1   Agriculture is the major economic activity in Burundi. Over 90 percent of
Burundians derive their livelihood from it, working approximately one million
farms averaging less than one hectare in size. It accounts for approximately 62
percent of GDP and generates almost all foreign exchange, 90 porcent of which is
accounted for by coffee. Nevertheless, food makes up about 10 percent of all
imports, indicating the presence of a chronic food production deficit.
2.2   The Government's third Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan
(1978-82) had as its main agricultural sector objectives: soil protection, food
self-sufficiency, import substitution (wheat, sugar, tobacco, wood), expansion
and diversification of exports (quinine, fruits and vegetables), development of
livestock and fishing, arresting deforestation, and increasing the return on
existing investments. To achieve these objectives, the Government encouraged the
creation of cooperatives and established Regional Development Companies (RDC).
Tte RDCs were intended to take on responsibility for all rural development
activities, financed either by the Government itself or from the proceeds of
external loans. The RDCs were organized as autonomous parastatals, and were
expected to become self-financing. Two Bank-financed projects, this project and
th. Kirimiro Rural Deve3anment Project (Cr. 1165-EU) l/, involved two of the
firbt RDCs.
3.    Proiect Obiecti .- and Description
3.1   Objectives.  The project had as objectives:  (a) assist smallholders to
improve the productivity of coffee and foodcrop cultivation; (b) improve the
quality of exported coffee; (c) improve rural living conditions by building or
maintaining water supply syetems, rural roads and developing wood resources to
be used as fuelwood, building poles and timber, and (d) enhance the management
capability of the RDC.
I/   This rural development project was implemented during roughly the same
period as the project under review, in a neighboring region.



3.2   Descripti2n. The project, which was to be implemented over a period of six
years on the basis of annual work programs, had the following componentss
-     a program to provide extension services and inputs for ccffee and
fooderop development;
-     building and management of 15 washing stations, and improvement of
hand pulping centers in the prcject area;
-     a reforestation and erosion-control program;
-     selective improvement of the rural road n'twork, including construc-
tion of bridges;
-     improvement of the water supply system and 'c social infrastructures
-     studies, a research program, and establishment of - monitoring and
evaluation system;
-     a personnel training program;
-     establishment of a Regional Development Company (RDC) and provision
of technical assistance;
-     a pilot swamp development program, with special emphasis on the
permanent cultivation of valley bottomlands; and
-     construction of marketing warehouses.
4.    Project Deslin and Organization
4.1   The underlying concept was to establish an RDC to carry out the Govern-
ment's policy of integrated and decentralized rural development. Preparation
work on the project was assigned to SOMEBU (Socift6 mixte d'6tude du Burundi, a
Burundi consulting agency), with the resulting studies to be reviewed by the
various ministries involved.   The Bank's Nairobi office assisted SOMEBU in
general matters a>-i in its discussions with the Government on the studies, as
they progressed. This phase of preparation by a Burundian team, punctuated by
exchanges of views with the Bank, meant that the goals of the projects and
the resources they would make use of were well understood by the interested
parties. 2/
4.2 For Burundi, the project was innovative, in the sense that the approach to
agricultural development was new in various w&ys: (a) the emphasis was placed
on crop diversification, and inclusion of both environmental (reforestation,
erosion control) and social elements (water supply); and (b)  tw administrative
2/    The preparation work for this project was jointly carried out with the
preparation work for the Kirimiro Rural Development Project (Cr. 1165-BU),
which is the subject of a separate PCR.



-3-
structures were created by eliminating the centralized vertical type of
organization and replacing it with autonomous regional entities, RDCs.
4.3   Thu project was well prepared, given the objectives and the strategy
chosen. During appraisal, the Government and the Bank agreed that the project
be simplified, so as to lessen the risk of time overruns.   Thie risk was
considered very high, because an RDC had to be set up that was obviously going
to be inexperienced from a technical, organizatioaal and managerial perspective.
S.    Project Im21ementation
!.1   Credit Effectiveness. The project, initially scheduled to become effective
in June 1982 was not declared effective until June :'33.  The main reasons for
this delay were the slow pace of negotiations for financing from the Kuwait Fund
and delays in meeting the conditions of effectiveness (audit reports and release
of government coanterpart funds). The technical assistance component and the
main extension programs were launched under PPF financing before the actual
effectiveness date of the project.
5.2   Implementation Schedule.  Primarily as a result of effectiveness delays,
closure of the Ngozl III project was delayed by 33 months.  The decision by
Government and IDA to use part of the undisbursed balance of the credit to
finance ongoing activities in the neighboring Kirimiro project (Cr. 1165-BU) area
also contributed to the delay.
5.3   Project Costs.  Project costs were lower than estimated at appraisal,
because: (a) road construction, forestry planting and coffee nurseries costed
less as a result of local participation; (b) devaluation of the local currency;
and (c) the Project did not rehabilitate the water supply system.
5.4   Disbursements. The estimated and actual disbursements for the two projects
are given in Table 3.C of Part III. The credit was closed on December 31, 1989,
and the last disbursement wao on July 20, 1990, at which time the undisbursed
balance of SDR 1.7 million was cancelled.
5.5   Changes in Project Design.  The designs of the project was not altered to
any great extent during the execution period, except with regard to: (a) the
number of coffee washing stations, which was increased from 15 to 28; and (b) a
component to encourage wider interest in livestock activities (higher incomes,
source of manure), which was added to the project.
5.6   Decisions which contributed to the smooth execution of the project were:
(a) to have the project managefment team and IDA agree on annual work plans, which
allowed flexibility in responding to newly identified needs (under the terms of
the Credit Agreement, 95 percent of proceeds were unallocated); (b) to ascertain
periodically that the coffee washing stations were not polluting the water supply
to a significant degree; and (c) to introduce the Training and Visit (T & V)
extension system as a means of improving the effectiveness of extension services.
5.7   There were, however, also a number of other steps that could have added to
project impact and effectiveness:   (a) improving the quality of project
management by negotiating staff selection criteria with the Government; (b) more



-4-
intensive implementation of the livestock component, which was neglected;
(c) emphasizing implementation of the water supply points component, which was
ignored; and (d) since all Ngozi II extension agents had been specialists in
coffee production, the selection and training of agents on foodcrop production
should have been speeded up.
5.8   The major potentie. risks pointed out at the time of appraisal of the
project were: (a) the di.L'iculty of overcoming the complexity of the project
(the numbar of components anA the type of technical messages to be extended--
most of which were new not only to farmers but also to extension agents); b) the
practice of the local government in Ngozi of selling fertilizer on credit even
though repayment was low; and (c) full integration of the various "horizontal"
services--extension, erosion control, washing station management, building of
infrastructure, etc.--within a relatively short time period (five years), against
the background of an' overall objective which called for the RDC to be run like
a corpo.ation and not like a branch of a public service agency.
5.9   Extension - Foodcrops.  The major technical messages disseminated through
the project weret widespread use of improved seed; planting of banania trees
under better conditions (construction of contour embankments and planting of
protective grasses such as setaria or tripsacoma); aid use of fertilizers and
pesticides. Because of poor organization and agent training, extension services
did not prove very effective during the early years of the project, which
t'1erefore opted for the Training and Visit method in 1987. A shortage of subject
matter specialists still persists. The extension service succeeded in increasing
fertilizer use and erosion control where foodcrops are concernQd. Furthermore,
it bolstered the efforts of farmers in rice production and vegetable crops in
wetlands, but was unable to prevent a decline in the production of crops like
beans, maize and groundnuts--a consequence of soil degradation, a reduction of
the land area kept under foodcrops, an increasing area devoted to coffee, and the
spread of diseases. Unider the project, the extension system was backed up by
seed multiplication plots initially managed by the RDC but subsequently more and
more by farmers themselves with RDC assistance, the aim being to lower the cost
of seed and involve farmers more closely. The value of these plots was limited,
however, as varieties grown were not of much interest to farmers, or gave
mediocre yields because of disease, poor choices for plot locations, and poor or
absent linkage with the research apparatus. Production of quality seeds is still
less than demand. Research is still poorly integrated with extension programs.
5.10 Extension - Coffee. The technical messages for coffee growing centered on
the propagation and distribution of seedlings, mulching, fertilizing, pruning,
and pest control. Distribution of young plants greatly exceeded goal& (3 times),
the main consequence being an increase in the total land area under coffee.
However, most new plantations have been established on land that is only
marginally productive and showe low yield potential. Project management was
successful in involving farmers in the production of young plants: the Ngozi RDC
itself managed 40 percent of nurseries by Credit closing, the other 60 percent
being managed by planters with assistance from extension agents (in 1991, all
nurseries in Ngozi were managed by farmers). Mulching rates to depths of 15 cm
or more were used by only 30 percent of the farmers (shortage of mulching
materials). Demand for fertilizer (urea) declined because both planters and
researchers regard it as unprofitable for coffee, so much so that usage in 1990



was virtually nil.  Pruning tools were less and less used because they were
regarded as too expensive.  Spraying with insecticides was practiced in 100
percent of cases. Yields of coffee parchment per tree are very difficult to
determine and estimates from independent sources vary widely. A complete survey
was to be carried out.
5.11 Coffee Washing Stations. These facllties already existed to a limited
extent in the Ngozi project area, as a result of the previous two projects.
Farmers have massively shifted the delivery of their :offee from manual pulping
centers to washing stations during the project period; the only limiting factor
being the distance between the farm and delivery point. The main reason for this
shift was that the price offered to farmers for cherries delivered to washing
stations was the same as the price offered for the equivalent amount of parchment
coffee.   As it saved the farmers from certain intermediary tasks (drying,
depulping), this amounted to an incentive large enough to make farmers
enthusiastic deliverers of cherries and encouraged Government to respond by
accelerating the establishment of washing stations. The incentive price was
justified by the expectation of a premium price on the world market for fully
washed arabica coffee (about 15 percent on average).   This premium was not
realized until 1989, due to problems downstream in the coffee chain (hulling,
storage and transport). The implicit subsidy was indirectly financed through
outside funding, but was in the end justified when the quality problems were
recognized and resolved (outside the context of the two projects).
5.12 Washing stations were correctly designed and built. In addition, the waste
waters created by the washing process do not create pollution. Several tests
were done and all were negative. Maximum station production capacity was reached
after three years at Ngozi, in accordance with expectations at appraisal. In the
Ngozi region, the cherry to parchment ratio is good (4.9) and is in line with
forecasts, thanks to rigorous management (washing station management handbooks
are available and the stations are run relatively independently of the project
authorities) and to sorting of cherries prior to weighing.
5.13 Reforestation and Erosion Control. Thanks to a determined effort to obtain
community participation, tree nurseries are now managed by groups of planters.
Major planting efforts were undertaken, particularly on the summits of eroded
hillsides. These planting programs, which exceeded the original goals, were
carried out either with project resources or by communes or private planters.
5.14 Erosion control activities were undertaken with community participation.
Hillside communities were organized by project agents to dig contour ditches,
plant anti-erosion hedges, and encourage farmers to rotate crops and take greater
care in planting banana trees.
5.15 Rehabilitation and Development of Water Supply Points. The project was to
develop or rehabilitate 440 water supply outlets. Iowever, no new supply points
were actually developed or old ones rehabilitated by the project. The lack of
community participation led to a decision by project management, in agreement
with IDA, to neglect this component and concentrate on washing stations and roads
instead.

6.    Proiect Results
General
6.1   The project contributed to the success of the Government's export policy
by increasing the output of washed and fully washed coffee. Operations initially
conducted by the RDC (sale of inputs, running of coffee and forest plant
nurseries) have been increasingly taken over by the ;-sivate sector (farmer
organizations,  cooperatives,  traders).    The  extension  program  emphasized
participation by the population rather than technical matters, a factor that will
facilitate the Government's current sector strategy as seen in the two new
projects (Coffee Sector Project and Agricultural Services Sector Project) that
are intended as extensions of the project.
6.2   The project was successful in meeting most of its objectives.  One key
objective it could not achieve was reversing the worsening erosion; underestima-
tion of the problem at appraisal, combined with increasing population pressures
and geographic factors (hilly terrain) made it impossible to make much progress.
The project succeeded in increasing farm household incomes in real terms and is
expected to meet most appraisal targets.
Individual Components
6.3   Extension - Foodcrops.  Although the technology used in growing foodcrops
has scarcely changed (except in the case of rice-growing), farmers in the region
have become sensitized to the need for improvements in cropping practices (crop
rotation, planting of banana trees, on-farm erosion control m2asures, ridge
cropping and row seeding).
6.4   Total fooderop production remained stagnant.  Production of traditional
foodcrops declined because of a variety of factors, which include plant diseases
(especially in the case of beans), low soil fertility, and a decrease in acreage
as A result of a shift in production emphasis. The production of new foodcrops
(rice, vegetables and tubers) increased.   However, in view of the extension
effort made, particularly the emphasis on fertilizer use and erosion control
measures, extension agents and researchers tend to believe there would have been
a real decline in fooderop production in the Ngozi region without the project.
6.5   Coffee-growing. Total output of parchment coffee (washed and fully washed)
rose only slightly:   from 17,422 metric tons (average for 1982 and 1983) to
19,861 tons (average for 1989 and 1990), or an average increase of 1.5 percent
per annum, as against the 2.8 percent per annum anticipated at the appraisal
stage.  Allcving for the impact on production of the plantations established
during the Ngozi I and II projects, it has been estimated, after discussions with
extension and research officials, that the incremental production ascribable to
the project should be estimated at 0.5 percent per annum.
6.6   Coffee Washing Stations. In the Ngozi area, twenty-eight coffee washing
stations were constructed (as against 15 anticipated at appraisal) during the
course of the project. They have been responsible for a cumulative output of
18,100 tons of fully washed parchment coffee of very high quality (95 percent
grade A) with a cherry to parchment ratio of 4.9 and a green to parchment ratio



-7 -
of 81 percent, as predicted at appraisal. As a group, the throughput of the
washing stations built under the three ?gozi projects is equivalent to 41 percent
of the coffee cherries produced in t'' region in 1990 (as against 17 percent in
1982).
6.7   Reforestation and Erosion Control. Approximately 5,800 ha of woodlots were
planted.   Although these are now beginning to generate income (fuelwood,
charcoal, poles and wood for construction), the RDC was unable to provide data
on actual income flows. At the time of the project completion mission, the
plantations inspected appeared to be in good condition. An important agrofores-
try program (with Grevilea) was undertaken in coffee plantations on an individual
basis.
6.8   A total of 6 km of protected ditches were dug in the course of the project.
These measures, however, have been insufficient to stop erosion and soil
impoverishment.
6.9   Rehabilitation and Development of Water Supply Points.  No new supply
points were developed or old ones rehabilitated by the project.
6.10 Marketing Warehouses. One ccmponent of the project called for the building
of 10 warehouses to enable farmers to market their products. Only three were
built, however, and are used exclusively for the storage of farm inputs. The
farmers themselves do not appear to be interested in these facilities.
6.11 Monitoring and Evaluation. The Monitoring/Evaluation Unit performed well,
although it needs to be reinforced. Information was collected and processed and
was acceptable for coffee plantings.
6.12  Livestock.  Introduced late in the course of the project (1988), this
component focused on small stock and emphasized the distribution of young chicks
and vaccination. The resources in play were very limited and no results are
apparent.
6.13 Incomes. The project was successful in raising farm incomes. Surveys show
that the value of production per farm (including consumpt'on) reached an
estimated FBu 78,140, or FBu 55,480 at 1981 prices.   At appraisal, it was
anticipated that 10 years after project commencement, the value of farm
production would be FBu 68,000.
7.    Economic Results
7.1   The economic rate of return on the project is reestimated at 25.7 percent,
or virtually the same as forecast at appraisal (26.3 percent). Project costs
were lower than anticipated (technical assistance, inputs, seed multiplication
plots, nurseries, and roads) thanks to a high level of community participation,
and also to the fact that the proposed development of water supply points did not
go ahead. Even though the project led to a slight increase in output volume,
returns have tended to decline. Total revenues on foodcrops, however, are in the
vicinity of what was forecast at appraisal, since the decline in the output of
traditional crops was offset by higher prices, while revenues for the new crops
introduced under the project (rice and vegetables) increased.  The long-term



-8-
production increase in coffee production due to the project was estimated at 0.5
percent. Where coffee washing stations are concerned, account has been taken
only of marginal gains (the increase in the price of fully washed coffee by
comparison to the price of merely washed coffee, less station construction and
operating costs). It proved impossible to ascertain what income was obtained on
forest plantations (fuelwood and construction wood), for lack of information on
volumes produced and prices obtained; it has therefore been excluded from the
rate of return calculations. The general consensus is that this component was
successful.
8.    Project Sustainabilitv
8.1   Ex-post analysis of the execution of the project highlights the fact that
the strategy of creating a decentralized RDC to handle the implementation of a
whole series of integrated programs was a very difficult one to put into prac-
tice.  The obstacles to managing a parastatal entity as if it were a commercial
company were underestimated. The RDC proved difficult to administer, not only
from a technical standpoint (agents lacking specialist skills), but also organi-
zationally (slow decision-making, the need for coordination among departments and
divisions) and financially (lack of separate accounting arrangements for each
activity, failure to eliminate several activities that were not worthwhile).
Thus, in 1987, the Government and the Bank realized that the concept of the RDCs
was not sustainable and would need to be revised.  It was decided that a new
strategy was necessary: the RDCs would be split up and retain only a coordinat-
ory role in their own regions, while government services (e.g., extension,
research, reforestation, health measures, etc.) were to be handled by the tech-
nical ministries, and revenue generating activities (seed and plant propagation,
marketing of inputs, management of washing stations, etc.) were to be entrusted
to the private sector (cooperatives, producer associations, private enterprises).
The implementation of this new strategy has been taken up since by the Coffee
Services Project (Cr. 2123-BU) and the Agricultural Services Sector Project (Cr.
2024-BU).
9.    Bank Performance
9.1   The general view is that the Bank, from the outset, succeeded in esta-
blishing a climate of confidence both with the RDC and the central authorities.
This proved to be of particular value for the approval of annual work plans,
which made it possible to respond to both the constraints and successes achieved
during the actual course of execution of the project. Project management found
supervisions effective and helpful.
9.2   The project was monitored on a regular basis, and missions consisted of the
right specialists needed to resolve the particular problems encountered. On the
whole, the RDC appreciated the assistance afforded them by the supervision mis-
sions, both in the organizational and technical spheres and in abiding by the
general policy underlying the project. Nevertheless, the teams supervising the
project should have visited the project area more often, should have been more
consistent in composition and would have been better advised to place more
emphasis on effective project management.



-9-
10.   Borrower Performance
10.1 The performance of the RDC was less satisfactory during the early years,
becaueos (a) the difficulties which extension agents experienced in adapting to
their new task. (integrated rural development) compared with their responsibili-
ties under Ngozi II (development of coffee production); and (b) the management
team, which had difficulties working with technical assistance staff and assuming
such organizational matters as project finance and accounting, supplies, person-
nel administration and extension. No meaningful connection had been established
between research and extension, primarily because the focus of the research
service, at the time, was supply driren and donors had little interest in on-farm
activities.
11.   Consulting Services
11.1 The project made use of technical assistance, particularly in the sphere
of general management (finances, supplies, monitoring). The degree of turnover
among technical assistance staff (two successive teams) was considerable and gave
rise to tensions, except where the washing stations were concerned, since the
consultant here retained his position, was effective, and helped form a valuable
replacement team. One lesson both the Borrower and the Bank should learn is that
project management teams should make sure that terms of reference for technical
assistance clearly define not only tecbnical duties but also training responsi-
bilities (especially toward the end of the contractual period), so that, once
they have departed, local counterparts will have been formed to take over.
12.   Proect Dbocumentation
12.1 According to the project management team, the Staff Appraisal Report was
particularly useful in defining the general policy underlying the project and the
strategy to be followed in drawing up annual work plans. The Credit Agreement,
in its turn, was particularly useful in defining and prescribing the use of
administrative procedures (requests for disbursement, procurement methods, etc.).
Foodcrop production data was obtained from the RDC or Bank files.

Comments:
At identification, the main issue was either to strengthen government
services, or to create a regional development agency to ensure an
integrated development. The last prevailed.
Preparation was done by local consultants (SOMEBU).
At  appraisal,  some  components  of  the projects were  eliminated  or
simplified.
