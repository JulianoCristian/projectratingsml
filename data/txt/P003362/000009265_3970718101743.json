limited fabric finishing capacity (bleach, dye\n            or print) to match grey fabrics output and partially replace\n            the obsolete and uneconomical finishing facilities in some\n            of the small weaving plants. The plant will finish 16.6\n            million linear meters per year of fabrics of medium quality\n            for shirting and suiting. The project would also demonstrate\n            the feasibility of operating at a level of capacity\n            utilization higher than currently practiced in the textile\n            industry in Burma. The project includes consultancy services\n            for assistance in design, engineering, implementation,\n            commissioning services, upgrading the financial, accounting\n            and management information systems and training of staff.\n            The Government will also undertake a study of the textile\n            sector which will focus on measures to improve the\n            productivity of the existing plants, and prepare a long-term\n            development strategy for the sector."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
