Power Rehabilitation\n            Project is rated as satisfactory, sustainability as likely,\n            institutional development impact as substantial, bank\n            performance as satisfactory, borrower performance as\n            unsatisfactory. The most important lesson learned from the\n            project is that profitable, efficient commercial operation\n            of energy enterprises in Georgia is difficult to achieve\n            under public management. The recovery of the sector requires\n            involvement of private strategic investors with sufficient\n            clout to resist the political pressure and vested interest,\n            and whose commercial interests are derived from a sustained\n            and efficient operation of the companies rather than\n            short-term political and commercial deals. Investment\n            projects have to be accompanied by institutional and policy\n            reforms needed to sustain project benefits. Actions on both\n            fronts are needed as they are mutually re-enforcing.\n            Coordination with other donors provided significant leverage\n            and synergies, both within the project and through the\n            associated Bank's operations. Ownership of the project,\n            as well as of the accompanying reforms, is critical. At the\n            project level, intensive technical assistance to the\n            implementing agency in procurement, financial management,\n            contract administration, and project management, and close\n            supervision of the project have been very important."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
