stabilize electricity supply; b) establish\n            Tbilsresi as a commercially independent and financially\n            self-sufficient generation company; and c) improve the local\n            capability and assist in project management, corporate\n            management and commercialization and privatization of power\n            enterprises. The project consists of the following\n            components: a) rehabilitation of a 300 MW unit at the\n            Gardabani thermal power plant; b) increase in working\n            capital at Tbilsresi; and c) technical assistance to\n            Tbilsresi for project management, corporate management and\n            development of a privatization strategy for the company."}, "docdt": "1997-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
