FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1657-HA)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth
Education Project in Malaysia, for which Loan 1657-HA in the amount of
US$38 million was signed on Match 14, 1979. The loan was fully disbursed
two months before the original Closing Date of June 30, 1985.
The PCR is a summary of three technical reports on the three
project components (lower secondary schools, National Institute of Public
Administration - INTAN, and National Institute of Educational Management -
NIEH). These reports were prepared by a team from the University of
Science Malaysia in Penang with the help of the Government agencies
involved in project implementation. The PCR was supplemented by a section
entitled 'Observations and Lessons Learned by the Bank' and prepared by the
operational staff. No project completion mission was undertaken.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for coment in
February 1989. Comments received are reproduced as Attachment I.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1657-MA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       This project arose  from  Government's  concern with a more equal
spread of educational opportunities, particularly for secondary education
in rural areas, and its perception that the country's civil service train-
ing system, especially the teaching force, needed upgrading and strengtlen-
ing, in line with the increasing demands that the development of the
country and its administrative structure made on it (PCR, paras. 1.4-l.t.
The project was identified by UNESCO and prepared by the Bank in
March/April and August  1977,  respectively.    Appraisal followed in April
1978 and Board presentation, in January  1979.   The US$38 million loan in
suppotr of the project became  effective  in May  1979, one month ahead of
schedule, and all funds were disbursed two months before the original
Closing Date, June 30, 1985 (Basic Data Sheet and PCR, para. 3.20).
Obiectives and woatent
The project aimed at developing secondary education In disadvan-
taged areas by constructing and equipping 76 lower secondary schools in
low-enrollment districts in eleven of Malaysia's thirteen states (the other
two being above the national enrollment average) and to assist the National
Institute of Educational Management (NIEN) and the F1tional Institute of
Public Administration (INTAN) in their development. Technical assistance
was to supplement the physical investments an4 participate in the develop-
ment of a long-term plan for vocational trakning; the last component ws
subsequently dropped from the project and financed from other sources (PCR,
paras. 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1).
Implementation Experience
The project did not experience major implementation difficulties.
There were, however, some initial difficulties with site acquisition and
preparation for the secondary schools which delayed the start of civil
workR. By the time of the Closing Date, 65 of the 76 schools were com-
pleted, with all but one of the unfinished schools being in Sarawak, where
the t,rocess of lazd acquisition had been complicated by the existence of
customary land rights. However, the Government financed the completion of
these facilities from its own budget (PCR, paras. 3.2, 3.7, 3.8)
Project costs were M$322.2 million (US$134.2 million), an overrun
of lZ over the appraisal  estimate.   Individual component costs, however,
showed wide variations, from an overrun of 2262 for NIEM to an underrun of



'.41 for the secondary schools.   Most  of the cost overruns stemmed from an
increase in building standards during Implementation rather than inflation
(PCR, Annex 5 and Observations, paras. 3 and 4b). Because of Government's
assumption of post-closing funding responsibilities, the loan financed only
281 instead of 311 of total proje4t costs as estimated at appraisal.
The PIU within the Development and Supply Division in the Ministry
of Education worked together with the State Education Offices and the
Public Works Department to implement this project (PCR, para. 4.1). It
handled its task well, which encouraged the Bank to iiiitiate sector lending
(Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project, Ln. 2685-MA of May 23,
1986 and Second Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project, Ln. 2987-MA
of August 11, 1988).    However,  the  PCR  offers critical comments on the
irregular occurrence and less than appropriate staffing of Bank supervision
missions (PCR, para. 4.4, Observations, paras. 4a and 4i).
Results
The project  has  been  successful.    Enrollment  capacity of the
secondary schools is slightly higher than appraised (PCR, para. 5.1) and on
the whole access to secondary education is more equal, although some states
(among them one of the two not included in the project) saw a deterioration
in tne availability of lower secondary school places relative to the number
of primary school leavers between 1977 and 1985 (PCR, para. 5.2 and Annex
3).
INTAN and NIEM have developed beyond appraisal expectations, with
the numbers of annual course participants being 35Z/1171 higher (PCR,
paras. 5.16 and 5.22).   Participants  in INTAN courses find these programs
helpful and relevant (PCR, paras. 5.17 and 5.18), as do NIEM trainees (PCR,
para. 5.23).
Sustainability
The sustainability of this project should not present problems
provided adequate funding levels are maintained.   it appears that capita-
tion grants for maintenance and other operating expenses in primary and
secondary schools have net changed since  the mid-1970s (PCR, para. 5.4 and
Observations,  para.  4d).    However,  the  Second  Primary  and Secondary
Education Sector Project (Lu.  2987-MA)  introduced a provision to increase
and maintain an adequate funding level for schools (SAR, paras. 4.16 and
5.1).  The PCR notes  the  establishment of adequate maintenance capability
at INTAN but for NIEM this is still lacking (PCR, paras. 6.8 and 6.11).
Findings and Lessons
The project  proved  the  existence  of  impressive implementation
capabilities in  the  MOE  which  encouraged  the  subsequent movement into
sector lending (PCR, Observations, para. 4a).
Area and construction standards appear to be on the high side (and
above the appraised levels), a tendency which should be carefully monitored
during implementation of subsequent education projects (PCR, Observations,
para. 4).

COMPLETION REPORT PREPARED BY THlE COVERNMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Socioeconomic Setting
1.1       In 1980, when implementation of the Fifth Education Project came on
stream, the population of Malaysia totaled about 13.7 million persons, 83Z of
whom resided in Peninsular Malaysia, with 81 in Sabah and 91 in Sarawak. In
Peninsular Malaysia, 541 were indigenous Malays or Bumiputeras, 351 Chinese,
101 Indians and 1X other groups. The population at the time was relatively
young, with 39X in the 0-14 age group and another 291 in the 15-29 age
group. The median age was 20 in 1980 as compared to 17 in 1970. More than
half of the population in 1980 was in the working-age group of 15-64 years
which put substantial pres,ure on the employment market. Despite a decline in
the age-dependency ratio 1- from 92Z in 1970 to 761 in 1980, the ratio
remained relatively high, causing a high demand for public expenditures,
particularly for education and health.
1.2       The rate of economic growth in Malaysia in 1980 was relatively high,
at 7.81 in real terms. Thereafter, however, the country's economic
development faltered due to the prolonged world-wide recession and constraints
within the domestic economy. By 1982, the economy was growing by only 3.71
p.a. and little improvement was registered in subsequent years. This meant
that only three quarters of the growth projected under the Fourth Malaysia
Plan (1981-85) was achieved. The primary sector--agriculture, mining and
quarrying-grew at a higher rate than expected, while the secondary sector
manufacturing and construction activities--expanded at only half the rate
expected in the Plan. The tertiary sector, services, performed better than
the secondary sector but was still below the projected rate for the 1981-85
period.
1.3       The sluggishness of the national economy also hampered the achieve-
ment of those aspects of the New Economic Policy which aimed at eradicating
poverty and restructuring society to eliminate the identification of race with
economic function. The overall incidence of poverty in Peninsular Malaysia,
for example, increased slightly from 29% in 1980 to just over 30% in 1983,
although the percentage declined remarkably in Sabah and Sarawak. Also,
although ownership by Bumiputera of share capital in the corporate sector
increased from 12% in 1980 to 19% in 1984, Bumiputera still accounted for a
very low proportion of employment in the higher-earning professions and in
involvement in industry and commerce.

working age group, 15-64.

B. Educational Setting
1.4       Over the last 20 years, the Malaysian Government has sought to
redress the social and economic imbalances inherited from the colonial
period. Policies were designed to allow the rural majority to participate
more fully in the economic life of the nation. However, the inherited struc-
ture of segregated schools perpetuated inequalities in educational oppor-
tunity. The former English-medium urban secondary schools had historically
prepared an elite for clerical work, the civil service and the lower and
middle rungs in the modern sector of the economy. Feeder schools for these
schools were an assortment of English-medium primary schools (both government
and aided) which were again largely urban. Primary education in the vernacu-
lar languages was largely rurally-biased and terminal.  Thus a large Malay
rural majority was trapped by a type of education that did not facilitate
mobility.  For this reason, the principle of equal educational opportunity has
been the primary theme in the country's education policy since independence.
1.5       The Government supported this objective by providing reasonably
adequate budgets for education.  Under the Third Malaysia Plan (1976-80),
M$1.55 billion, or 7Z of total public development expenditure, was allocated
to education and training; the Fourth Plan similarly allocated 7.6X of public
investment to the sector (Annex 1). Educational development under the Third
Plan was particularly focused on the lower secondary level, i.e., the last
three years of the nine-year program of basic education in Malaysia. Under
the Plan, enrollment at this level was targeted to increase by about 25Z or to
812,000 in total.  This increase was to be brought about through a major
construction program for lower secondary schools and abolition of a then
existing selection examination for entry into the lower secondary level.
Despite these measures, however, substantial disparities in opportunity for
education reu-izned and there was a further need under the Fourth Plan to
equalize access to secondary education.
1.6       At this time, the qualifications of personnel directly or indirectly
involved in the management of the education system were also less than
adequate, and the vast majority of both the professionAl and administrative
staff of the national education system lacked appropriate training and
sufficient experience to conduct their professional roles effectively. In
addition, courses at INTAN, which has been responsible for civil service staff
training in Malaysia since 1972, had begun to proliferate and the facilities
available had become inadequate. INTAN is a federally-funded agpncy of the
Public Services Department and has benefited from steady government support
and skillful and dynamic leadership.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Project Formulation and Objectives
2.1       The first three World Bank loans to Malaysia for education projects
(Loans 599-MA of May 1969, 810-MA of April 1972 and 974-MA of April 1974)
provided a total of US$43.3 million for development of the sector, with
particular emphasis on occupational training to produce skilled middle-level
.



- 3 -
manpower. The Fourth Education Project (Loan 1329-MA, approved in September
1976, US$35 million) emphasized equity in access to education and focused on
primary education. The importance given to equity considerations was
continued under the Fifth Education Project which was designed to redress
three critical problems identified during its preparation:
(a)  unequal access to the second cycle of basic education (i.e., lower
secondary education) had led to unequal opportunities for full
participation in the social and economic life of the nation;
(b) a lack of systematic managerial training of education staff,
especially headmasters, had led to inefficiencies in the education
system. Managerial problems of this nature were, in fact, common to
all government departments since current management training
capacity was insufficient; and
(c) the most appropriate skill mix for graduates of basic education
(grade 9) was unclear.
2.2       In response to these needs, the Fifth Education Project had three
main objectives:
(a) to equalize access to lower secondary education throughout Malaysia;
(b) to improve the planning, implementation and management capabilities
of public administration staff through training; and
(c) to assist in preparing an overall plan for occupational training of
graduates of basic education.
B. Project Components
2.3       As approved, the project provided buildings, equipment, furniture
and technical assistance for four major components:
(a) Lower Secondary Schools. To equalize access to lower secondary
education, 76 lower secondary schools would be established in
disadvantaged districts to have an enrollment of about 46,500
students and an annual output of about 15,000 graduates. The
schools were to be located in selected districts in all the states
of Malaysia except Melaka and Perlis (Annex 2);
(b) The National Institute of Educational Management (NIEM).2' To train
educational personnel in management and administration, a new staff
training institute would be established with a capacity for 400
trainees and an annual output of about 4,000. The Institute was to
be located at Sri Layang, Genting Highlands, Pahang;
2/   Formerly called the Ministry of Education Staff Training Institute
(HESTI).



- 4 -
(c) The National Institute of Public Administration (INTAN). To
increase Government's capacity to train civil servants, four INTAN
campuses would be established to replace and expand the existing
campus, with an estimated enrollmenc capacity of 1,250 and an annual
output of about 15,000. The main campus was located at Bukit Kiara
(Federal Territory), with the regional institutes at Kluang
(Johore), Kemaman (Trengganu) and Sungai Petani (Kedah); and
(d) Long-range Planning of Occupational Training. The Government would
develop a long-term plan for vocational training.
C. Loan Pro',essing
2.4       The project was appraised in November/December 1977.  The loan was
negotiated in December 1978, following fulfillment of three conditions:
creation of three technical posts in the MOE's Implementation Unit; survey of
about one-fourth of all project sites; and appointment of consultant
architects for INTAN and NIEM, and, for the secondary schools, a government
commitment to have the Public Works Department (PWD) complete designs for this
component by a specific date. These conditions were required to prevent
possible delays in project implementation. The Bank loan for US$38 million
was approved by the Board on January 30, 1979, the Loan Agreement was signed
on March 14, 1979, and the loan became effective on May 7, 1979. There were
no conditions of effectiveness.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Revision of the Project
3.1       Due to a Government decision to fund the occupational training study
from other sources, the study was dropped from the project. Designs of the
NIEM and INTAN buildings were also changed following loan signing, which
resulted in a considerable expansion of some facilities (paras. 3.12-3.13).
B. Physical Works
Overview
3.2       By the time of the closing date of June 30, 1985, 65 of the
project's 76 lower secondary schools had been completed. This included 50 of
the 51 scheduled for Peninsular Malaysia, 9 of the 19 in Sarawak and all 6 in
Sabah. By January 1, 1986, the remaining school in Peninsular Malaysia was
complete as were 4 more in Sarawak, leaving 6 in Sarawak at various stages of
completion. Even though World Bank funds were not available to help finance
these schools, MOE allocated its own development funds for their completion.
3.3       Construction of the INTAN campuses was carried out under two
packages, the first package comprising the main campus at Bukit Kiara in Kuala
Lumpur and the second including the three regional centers. Construction of
the main campus was completed one year later than planned at appraisal.



Delays began during the planning and approval stages, although preparation of
contract documentation and the tendering of the construction contracts, were
handled efficiently and speedily, reducing the earlier delays to a minimum.
Further delays occurred during construction, due mainly to the need to under-
take unforeseen civil works and to coordinate problems between the main
contractor and his subcontractors.
3.4       Development and construction of the three INTAN regional centers
were completed within the implementation schedule agreed at appraisal. The
design for the center at Kemaman was used as a prototype for designing the
other two centers, thus saving some time. The only delay occurred during the
planning and approval stages.
3.5       Construction of NIEM was expected to be completed by mid-1984 but,
due to unavoidable problems faced by the contractor, completion took seven
months longer than the 30 months planned.
Site Selection
3.6       Lower Secondary Schools.  Geographical inequality of access was used
as the main criterion for determining the location of the lower secondary
schools. Areas with the greatest 'need' for lower secondary schools were
identified using an enrollment index (EI) that related enrollment in lower
secondary 3chools to enrollment in primary schools in a particular
district.'  Forty-nine districts were identified as being below the national
mean of 34.2 and were located in all the states of Malaysia except Melaka and
Perlis whose EIs in 1977 were 41.3 and 57.7, respectively (Annex 3).
3.7       Once the sites were selected, problems in acquiring them led to
delays in the start of construction. When the land was not already state or
federal property, the process of simply locating the owners in many cases
posed serious problems. Furthermore, in Sabah and Sarawak, because of the
existence of customary land rights, there was no proper documentation as to
the legal owners of the land, resulting in many claimants. The process of
establishing the rightful owners therefore took considerable time, as did
protracted negotiations over the amount of compensation to be paid. Owners
expected the Government to pay more than market value for their land and
employed delaying tactics to force this payment. Problems with squatters also
contributed to the delay in land acquisition as the squatters refused to
3/  This scale is defined as a percentage scale of enrollments in Forms 1 to
3 (grades 7 to 9) as a proportion of enrollments in Grades 1 to 6 in the
same year. For example, a state with 60,000 students in six-grade
primary schools and 30,000 in three-grade lower secondary schools could
accommodate all primary school leavers in secondary schools and would
have an EI of 50. The EI would have a maximum value of 50 if there were
no dropouts, repetitions, migration or deaths among school children and
if birth rates remained constant. The EI is a direct reflection of the
effective demand for junior secondary places since it is dependent upon
the cohort already in primary schools.



- 6 -
vacate the land unless they too were paid compensation or were given alterna-
tive sites. Administrative red tape also contributed to the delays. Site
acquisition therefore proceeded slowly, and the last site was not acquired
until June 1984.
3.8       At that, some of the sites chosen posed serious problems.  In some
cases, especially in Sabah and Sarawak, accessibility to the sites was
difficult. New access roads had to be constructed before equipment and
materials could be transported to the sites. Site clearance, too, took more
time than anticipated. There were instances where the sites were found
unsuitable only when piling work was undertaken and huge rocks were
uncovered. This made piling impossible and the sites had to be relocated,
setting the process back to the initial planning stages. The equatorial
climate of Malaysia also contributed to further delays, since in times of
heavy downpour, sites located in low-lying areas were prone to flooding. Not
only did these sites need to be filled with -arth to raise them above the
flood level, even after construction had started, frequent downpours forced
work stoppages.
3.9       NIEM.  A 121-acre site for NIEK was chosen at Sri Layang in the
Genting Highlands in Pahang. The site, along with several semi-completed
buildings located there, was originally acquired by the Government in 1974.
3.10      INTAN.  Bukit Kiara was selected as the appropriate site for INTAN's
main campus because of its location within one of the less congested areas in
the Federal Territory, while the regional campuses were appropriately located
to serve the eastern, northern and southern regions of the Peninsula.
Building Designs
3.11      The lower secondary schools were built to a standard PWD design, and
differed only in terms of their orientation and layout on the sites. This
resulted in functional and economical buildings. A full-sized school has
facilities for 960 pupils while smaller schools in the more remote areas have
facilities for about 480. The scope of completed academic and communal facil-
ities for typical lower secondary schools constructed under the project is
reasonable when compared with appraisal estimates for schools with the same
projected enrollments (Annex 4). The largest increase in area was only llZ
for two of five typical schools studied in detail. There is, however, a wider
variation for hostels constructed under the project, which are as much as 31Z
above and below the areas for the same capacity estimated at appraisal. Staff
housing falls in-between, with the typical headmaster's house 22% larger than
planned. Of the 50 lower secondary schools surveyed, nearly all consisted of
several 2- or 3-story concrete buildings. The rest of the schools were made
up of single-story buildings. In general, each consists of three to six
buildings or blocks. These blocks are usually linked with each other by
covered walkways. In terms of layout on the site and orientation, the
arrangements of the school blocks are commendable and this is the rule rather
than the exception. Most of the smaller schools had large vacant land areas
available for future expansion.|



- 7 -
3.12      Designs for the INTAN component were satisfactory but, in their
final form, reflected a substantial expansion of facilities in line with the
Institute's perception of its needs. Floor space at the main campus in Bukit
Kiara was increased by about 28%, from 178,110 square feet to 228,575 square
feed (Annex 4). This expansion was mainly in the staff quarters (an
additional 5,160 square feet) and the hostels (an additional 23,480 square
feet), and included 6,050 square feet for a surau not originally planned
for. The three regional centers were also expanded by 10-12% over the areas
planned at appraisal.
3.13      The NIEM facilities as designed also reflected substantial changes
from the scheme agreed at appraisal. In addition to a 17% increase in the
area devoted to academic rooms, which was considered acceptable in view an
expansion of the Institute's program, space for boarding accommodations was
increased by 80Z and staff housing space by 33Z. The major increase in
boarding facilities resulted from the conversion of all student boarding to a
single room arrangement. Although the Bank initially questioned this change,
it was later agreed to, with the Government covering the cost overruns that
resulted.
Construction
3.14      Contracts for construction of the lower secondary schools were
awarded to local contractors. While most of the contracts covered only one
school, in a few cases, two or three schools were packaged into one con- D
tract. The latter sometimes led to delays since the contractors took on more
work than they could handle. This overextension of the contractor's commit-
ments, spreading thin his skilled workforce and resources, meant that some of
the jobs could not be completed on ti,ne. Most of these contractors were also
short of funds, leading to delays in the payment of workers' wages, so that
they left for other employment. In addition, underestimation of construction
costs often led to too low tenders. In one instance, a contractor abandoned
his project and the work had to be retendered. Construction of schools in
rural areas was also delayed by a lack of electricity and water, which had to
be provided before the contractors would begin work. Delays also sometimes
arose from the need for variations in the original plans which led to a re-
estimation of costs and then the resubmission of the revised plans to the
relevant authorities for comment and approval.
3.15      Construction of the NIEM component was satisfactory in terms of
quality but took longer than expected due to extensive road, grading and
infrastructure works on the site, which had not been included in the original
plans. The three regional INTAN centers were constructed satisfactorily by
mid-1983 and the main campus was completed and handed over in March 1984.
C. Costs
3.16      The completed project cost M$322.2 million (US$134.2 million), or
11% higher than the appraisal estimate of M$290.7 million (US$121.1 million).
However, costs of the individual components ranged from 226% above estimates
(for NIEM) to 46% below (for secondary schools in Sarawak). A comparison of
appraisal estimates and actual costs is given in Annex 5. All cost overruns
were financed entirely by the Government.



3.17      The 76 lower secondary schools were estimated at appraisal to cost
about M$227.5 million (including contingencies but excluding land costs).  As
of January 31, 1986, the total expenditure for this component was M$196.1 mil-
lion (also excluding land costs) or 161 less than expected, despite the
inflationary situation in Malaysia which affected other project components.
In fact, the actual areas of the schools were very close to those planned at
appraisal (para. 3.11) which helped to keep the costs down compared to other
project components. Actual expenditure for furniture and equipment for the
schools was lower than the estimates by about 81%, since many of the planned
items had only been partially paid for at the time of preparation of this
report. Funds had not yet been utilized since the real need for equipment and
furniture only became obvious once construction was complete and the schools
were fully operational. In addition, government policy does not allow aided
schools to be furnished or equipped to a higher standard than unaided schools
so there may have been some overestimation of these costs at appraisal.
3.18      As of March 1986, the actual cost of development of the four INTAN
campuses amounted to M$77.5 million or 65X higher than the appraised estimate
of M$47.0 million. This substantial increase was due to (a) the replanning
and expansion of the campuses following loan signing, and (b) the inflationary
situation then prevailing in Malaysia which raised the cost of building
materials and wages. The bulk of the cost was for civil works which totalled
M$62.7 million or 81% of the actual cost. Of the M$77.5 million spent, the
main campus at Bukit Kiara in Kuala Lumpur accounted for M$38.7 million,
followed by the regional campus in Kemaman at M$14.1 million, and Sungai
Petani and Kluang at about M$ll million each. Of the total M$91.2 million
provided by the Bank loan, M$16.6 million was originally allocated to finance
the INTAN component. However, as of March 1986, INTAN had claimed M$24.6
million of the loan. This was allowed since the INTAN component cost more
than expected and delays in construction of the lower secondary schools caused
the Governm'ent to allocate a portion of the MOE's share of the loan for school
development to INTAN in order to avoid unnecessary commitment charges on the
undisbursed portion of the loan.
3.19      Although the Fourth Malaysia Plan estimated the cost of establishing
NIEM as M$66.8 million, only M$14.9 million was allocated for this purpose at
appraisal. The value of the contract for construction, including some extra
works and the renovation of the existing buildings, was M$45.3 million. This
is more than 300% over the construction cost estimated at appraisal of M$11.3
million and was largely due to the design changes introduced after loan
signing, in part to reflect the wider role being given to NIEM by
Government. Thc cost of furniture and equipment for NIEM was estimated at
M$0.9 million at appraisal, although the Government allotted M$2.0 million for
this procurement. In fact by June 30, 1985, M$1.5 million had been spent for
furniture and equipment, 67X over the appraisal estimate.
D. Disbursements
3.20      The appraisal and actual schedule of disbursements under the loan by
fiscal year is shown in Annex 6. In the first three years of implementation,
the loan was disbursed on or ahead of the appraisal schedule. During the
final three years, disbursements slipped slightly but were never lower than



- 9 -
882 of estimates. The final disbursement was made on April 23, 1985, more
than two months ahead of the June 30, 1985 closing, date. Considering that
disbursement of all previous Bank-assisted education loans to Malaysia was
completed substantially behind the appraisal schedule, the rapid disbursement
of this loan should be considered an achievement.
E. Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.21      The loan covenants were substantially fulfilled as indicated in
Annex 7, although yearly submission to the Bank of information or NIEM's
teaching plans was somewhat irregular, and preparation of this PCR was long
delayed.
IV.  INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE
A. Project Administration and Management
4.1       Three main agencies were responsible for managing the implementation
of the school construction and NIEM components in P3ninsular Malaysia: MOE's
Development and Supply Division (DSD), the State Education Offices and the
PWD. The DSD was established to oversee the provision of physical facilities
for education throughout Malaysia by:
(a) planning and preparing five-year development programs for MOE;
(b) planning, implementing and controlling education development
projects and supervising their implementation;
(c) managing the purchase and supply of furniture and equipment for
schools and for the various MOE departments;
(d) implementing foreign-assisted projects; and
(e) purchasing land as necessary for construction of education
institutions.
DSD currently has 130 on its staff, organized into four administrative
units: Development, Supply, Overseas Loan and Administrative. A Project
Implementation Unit responsible for this project was established in the
Overseas Loan Unit, although the Supply Unit handled furniture and equipment
procurement. Each State Education Office has an officer in charge of devel-
opment who relays information and all matters relating to construction and
development of schools to the DSD. The PWD is the technical advisor and
implementation agency for MOE. The flow of authority through PWD begins at
its Headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, which has a section to oversee MOE
projects. Each state PWD also has a separate section to coordinate education
projects at the state level. Day-to-day implementation of the project,
however, was handled by the district engineers who acted as project engineers
for construction of the schools.



- 10 -
4.2       In Sarawak, project works were supervised by the State PWD, although
one school, which had suffered from a long delay in construction, was
eventually turned over to an architectural consultant, and pre-fabricated
building materials and methods were used to hasten completion. In Sabah,
supervision of project works was entirely handled by consultants.
4.3       The INTAN component was implemented by INTAN itself.  The INTAN
Director and Deputy Director assumed overall implementation responsibility on
a part-time basis. A Project Implementation Unit, including a resident
engineer and an architect, was also created within the Institute to be in
charge of construction, the supply of furniture and equipment, and maintenance
of project institutions.
B. The Role of the Bank
4.4       During the project implementation period of 6-1/4 years, the Bank
sent ten review missions to Malaysia, averaging just under six months apart.
Bank supervision of the project was, however, not wholly satisfactory.
Supervision missions occurred at irregular intervals (see Basic Data Sheet)
and there was little continuity in mission staffing. For example, 16 months
elapsed between the third and fourth missions, at which time two consultants
were sent on the fourth mission, followed by a single Bank economist 6 months
later on the fifth mission. Educators (of whom one was a consultant) were
included in only five of the ten missions and architects in nine. Two of the
latter were consultants and, as a result, no Bank architect visited Mbaaysia
to review the project between April 1980 and October 1983. Architects
reviewed the project alone on four of the nine missions in which they partici-
pated. Due to the frequent changes in supervising staff, it was not until the
last four missions that the same architect participated throughout, but even
at that time, two different educators participated in the missions.
V. PROJECT RESULTS
A. Lower Secondary Schools
Enrollment
5.1       Overall, the project was successful in providing lower secondary
education in the disadvantaged areas. By 1982, seven project schools were
already providing about 3,470 student places, and by 1983, 26 schools were
operational, providing about 10,620 places. As indicated in Table 5.1 below
(and in Annex 8), by 1986, 70 schools were providing about 45,690 places. The
addition of the six uncompleted schools would bring total student places
established under the project to 46,560 places, somewhat higher than estimated
at appraisal.

The demand for places in the project schools is increasing at a fast rate. In
12 schools, demand had exceeded the places available, resulting in the
introduction of double sessions. At the time of preparation of this report,
ten of the project schools were also offering upper secondary education. At
least 2,500 pupils were attending classes at Forms 4 and 5 (Grades 10 and 11)
in these schools.
5.2       Enrollment Index.  The project was also reasonably successful in
raising EI levels, at least to the national mean of 35.7 planned for 1980
under the Third Malaysia Plan. By 1986, only Trengganu and Sabah, at 31.5 and
32.4, respectively (Annex 3), had not reached this level. However, Els in
Kelantan, Perlis, Trengganu and Sabah were lower than they had been in 1980.
The mean average for the entire country had also risen from 35.7 in 1980 to
41.7 in both 1985 and 1986.
5.3       Figures for 1984-85 indicate that the dropout rate in the lower
secondary schools was generally very low, with about 75Z of the schools
indicating dropout rates of less than 52 between Forms 1 and 2 (Grades 7 and
8) and between Forms 2 and 3 (Grades 8 and 9). The dropout rate was low even
in rural areas. A few schools, however, have very high dropout rates, and
should be investigated by the educational authorities to determine the reasons
for this problem. There has also been a large increase in the number of
children obtaining full certification through the Lower Certificate of Educa-
tion. The number of children receiving overall grade A's has likewise
increased, although this might be due to the increased enrollment rather than
to any improvement in the quality of the education provided. An analysis at
the school level showed that, at the individual schools, the increases were
not significant.

5.4       The recurrent costs of the schools were about US$150 per child per
year for 1984 and about US$128 for 1985. These figures were relatively low
and will decrease further when all the schools operate at full capacity. The
largest share of this cost (about 822) was for teachers' salaries, whereas the
cost for teaching materials and equipment was only about 52 or M$14.60
(US$5.80) per child for 1985 (Annex 9). This amount is very low and may be
insufficient to pro:ide an enriched environment for the pupils in the schools.
5.5       Socioeconomic Profile of Pupils.  The project team carried out an
extensive survey of pupils' socioeconomic backgrounds on a 10 sample (4,100
pupils) of the project school population. The information collected concern-
ing race and religion confirmed the preponderance of indigenous groups in the
rural areas. Seventy-six percent of the sample population was either Malay,
Iban or Kadazan, and 74X of the sample professed the Islamic faith
(Annex 10). Hence provision of prayer rooms becomes important for all these
schools.
5.6       The rural population has always had poorer and lower educational
attainment levels for various historical and economic reasons. Seventy-seven
percent of the fathers of children in the project schools had some form of
education, mostly at the primary level, reflecting the paucity of educational
facilities and infrastructure for secondary education in the rural areas.
Among the fathers, only about 22 had some form of college or university
education. Family income levels in the rural areas is also low. Forty-eight
percent of the children reported that the family income was below M$200 per
month which is well below the subsistence level for Malaysian families.
Another 392 of the children reported that their family income was between
M$200 and M$500 per month. Only about 1l1  reported that the family income was
above M$500. The occupations of the parents of che pupils attending the
schools also reflected the nature of rural living. About 542 of the fathers
were farmers and about 32 were fishermen. The second most common form of
employment was in the civil service (11) where the parents were employed as
teachers, clerks, policemen and local government authorities. A relatively
small number of parents (other than farmers and fishermen) were self-employed
(4x). A fairly large number of the pupils (62) reported that their fathers
had died. Also, the mothers of the children surveyed were reported as
predominantly housewives (92Z). This would seem to indicate that the majority
of the women were not contributing monetarily to the family income. Only
about 2Z were reported to be farmers, i.e., helping out on the padi farmt,
although this figure is suspiciously low.
Supply of Teachers
5.7       On the whole, the supply of teachers seemed to be adequate at the
project schools which had a teacher:pupil ratio of 1:25, better than the
recommended levels. The majority of teachers (642) in these schools have the
Malaysian Certificate )f Education and were trained for two to three years at
Colleges of Education, specifically to teach at the lower secondary level.
Relatively few (82) graduate teachers were employed in the schools since they
are, for the most part, trained at local universities to teach at the upper
secondary level. There were relatively low numbers (72) of untrained
teachers, and 36X of the schools reported having no untrained teachers. Half



- 13 -
of the untrained teachers were school leavers, usually waiting for entry into
the Colleges of Education. This does, of course, imply thet 28Z of the
teachers were below the academic level required. Even excluding some
specialists in manual skills, domestic science, etc. who do not need a teacher
training college certificate, there remains a high proportion of under-
qualified teachers.
5.8       A large number of teachers at the schools originated from outside
the district. where the schools were situated. This was to be expected in the
rural areas. However, the presence of a large number of teachers from urban
areas could be problematic as there is a general reluctance to work in the
rural areas and consequently there has been a high teacher turnover. From
1982 to 1985, the teacher turnover rate increased from 6.2Z to 12.1Z, largely
due to the transfer of eligible teachers to their home states or towns. The
large number of teachers from outside the school districts also means that
there are very few teachers actually living in the communities being served by
the schools.
Evaluation of Facilities
5.9       The majority of buildings provided under the project were newly
constructed on new sites, although some were extensions to already existing
facilities and others were replacements for old and dilapidated buildings.
Three-quarters of the 50 schools surveyed for this report started operations
as soon as the buildings were complete and had been given an occupancy
certificate. The remaining surveyed schools started operations in borrowed
premises before their buildings were completed. Some of these schools were in
existence three to four years before they moved into their new buildings.
5.10      In addition to providing school buildings, the project also called
for the construction of some hostels for students and living quarters for
headmasters and teaching staff. School hostels were constructed in five of
the states, i.e., Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah, Sabah and Sarawak. These
hostels allow children from the more remote areas to participate in the
educational system. The availability of hostel facilities also helps keep
pupils in school, who might otherwise drop out, given the distance of the
schools from their homes.
5.11      Nearly a third of the schools had no water supply when the school
started functioning. At least nine schools experienced delays of between one
and three years before water became available. Electricity supply was also a
problem, with nine schools experiencing delays of between one and two years
before receiving electricity from the National Electricity Board, and another
ten schools waiting between one and ten months. In addition, ten schools met
their electricity requirements with their own generators.
5.12      When the schools started functioning, the furniture provided
apparently met the requirements. The furniture was supplied for the full
school and not just for the pupils occupying the beginning Forms. In some
schools, the furniture arrived long before the schools were completed.



- 14 -
5.13      The provision of equipment, however, was less satisfactory.  Nearly
half the schools expressed dissatisfaction at the amount of equipment in the
industrial arts workshops. Some schools overcame this problem by borrowing
basic tools from neighboring schools. At least 32Z of the schools were
unhappy over the incompleteness of equipment for the home science rooms.
Science laboratories and libraries were similarly affected by slow or incom-
plete provision of equipment. The delays in the supply of equipment once the
schools were opened was thus quite serious, and resulted from a lack of
coordination between the central and district levels. The contracts for the
supply of equipment for the schools in Peninsular Malaysia were awarded
centrally by the DSD of the MOE. Uormally, equipment is supplied immediately
after the completion of a school, but due to poor communications, suppliers
were sometimes not alerted in time so as to allow them to deliver a full
complement of equipment to a school before it opened. In some cases, local
suppliers seemed to be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations at all
by the end of the agreed period.
5.14      Utilization of Facilities.  Teaching facilities have generally been
well-utilized. Most schools reached their capacity in a remarkably short
time. While science facilities are well used in the project schools, there is
a relativelv lower usage of home science and industrial arts facilities,
reflecting the elective nature of these courses. About 55X of the schools
reported a usage in the latter facilities of fewer than four out of eight
periods a day.
5.15      Of the support facilities, the libraries were generally underused.
About 80Z of the schools reported usage of less than half the school day.
Libraries were often in the timetable for each class, but in many schools each
class would typically have only one to two periods a week for library.
Apparently students do not have free access to the libraries, as a result of
the rigidity of the curriculum and the timetabling.
B. INTAN
Courses Offered
5.16      The INTAN campuses built under the project were officially operating
by 1983, when 396 courses were offered to 13,500 trainees. By 1986, the
number of courses had almost doubled to 547 for 20,300 trainees compared with
appraisal estimates of 15,000 to be trained annually (Annex 11). The types of
training offered included:
(a) management development--including programs in management science,
management training, personnel management and executive development;
(b) strategic studies and development--including programs in project
planning and management, public enterprise, strategic studies and
agricultural development;
(c) local government, urban and regional administration--including
programs in local government, housing development, urban develop-
ment, regional development and rural development;



- 15 -
(d) international relations and diplomacy--includirg programs in inter-
national management, international relations and international
economics;
(e) computer training--including training in computers for management
and basic and advanced technical training;
(f) financial management and training--including programs in budgeting
processes, financial management for professionals, contract manage-
ment and contract works, supplies and materials management, basic
accounting, investment management, internal audit, costing and
others;
(g) training development unit-including a program in training method-
ology and a training seminar; anm
(h) supervisory training-including programs in general administrative
services, general management and languages including Mandarin and
Chinese dialects, English, Arabic, French and Japanese.
5.17      Evaluation of Courses.  INTAN asks all participants in its courses
to evaluate them. The results for 1985 were an&lyzed as follows. When polled
before starting the course, the participants did not have a very positive view
as to the relevance of the courses to their career needs, although the score
is slightly higher for main campus participants (2.5 out of a top score of
5.0) compared with branch campus participants (2.2). The prospective
perticipants at the branch campuses also had a rather low expectation of their
ability to solve problems relevant to their work (2.1) while the expectation
of the prospective participants at the main campus, in this respect, was much
hii,her (3.6). However, the post-course scores obtained from the same parti-
cipants are nearly double the pre-course scores. Almost twice as many respon-
dents thought that the courses they had just attended provided knowledge
relevant to their career needs. The score for the main campus was 4.1 (as
compared to the pre-course score of 2.5) while the score for the branch
campuses was only slightly lower (3.8). The post-course score for 'the
ability of the course to help solve relevant problems' increased slightly for
the courses offered at the main campus (4.0) while the branch campuses
achieved a score of 3.7, considerably higher than the pre-course score of 2.3.
5.18      The participants generally felt that the courses provided them with
both knowledge and skills, although groups of participants at all campuses
felt that the courses gave a heavier emphasis to the provision of skills. The
main campus achieved higher scores for both 'knowledge' (3.7) and 'skills'
(4.0) when compared to the branch campuses (3.1 and 3.6). The participants
considered their interaction with lecturers as the most important means of
acquiring knowledge and skills, followed by interaction with course-mates.
Some skills and knowledge were also acquired through interaction with partici-
pants who were following other courses.

Staff Qualifications
5.19      At appraisal, INTAN had 98 staff which it proposed to increase over
the life of the project to 150 full-time equivalent teaching staff and an
additional 30 research and evaluation staff. A fellowship program was
provided under the project to help train this staff. Seventeen of the 24
project fellowships were actually used, atthough whether these staff will be
retained at INTAN is questionable due to ae practice of staff rotation (see
t,elow). By 1986, INTAN had a staff of 204 (Annex 12) although no breakdown is
available as to whether these are teaching or research and evaluation staff.
Between 1979 and 1986, the numbers of staff with bachelor's and post-graduate
degrees doubled, especially at the master's degree level. Thus, by 1986, just
over 66Z of the staff had a bachelor's or post-graduate degree.
5.20      INTAN currently has two categories of teach-ing staff:  about one-
third are permanently appointed and are mostly diploma level graduates; the
remaining two-thirds Pre drawn from a common-user service and are temporarily
posted to INTAN, normally for five years. These staff usually have degrees.
However, the fact that they rotate means that currently about 20 leave each
year and are replaced by new recruits from the common-user service. The new
recruits Are given a twc-week course in the basics of teaching before entering
the classroom, followed by occasional workshops to upgrade their teaching
skills. This seems insufficient. Diplonma holders on the permanent staff are
sent for training to obtain at least one specialized qualification in addition
to their general diploma. Degree-level staff are also sent for master's
degrees if they do not already have them, although the high turnover of this
staff means there is a perennial need to provide advanced training of newly
posted staff members. In addition, all teaching staff are encouraged to do
10X teaching and 30Z research.
Evaluation of Facilities
5.21      With the exception of only a few minor facilities considered
inadequate, the facilities available at INTAN's main and branch campuses were
positively evaluated by survey participants.
C. NIEM
Courses Offered
5.22      In 1985, NIEM offered 109 courses, which increased in 1986 to 138
courses but declined to 101 courses in 1987. At the same time, the total
number of participants involved in the courses steadily increased, from 6,235
participants in 1985, to 7,774 and 8,665 participants in 1986 and 1987,
respectively. These numbers compare very favorably with the estimates at
appraisal, when only 4,000 participants were expected annually. In 1987, of
the 101 courses offered, 29 were offered by NIEN itself while the remaining 72
were offered by other government agencies, such as the Ministry of Education,
and by voluntary and private organizations. Of the 8,665 participants in
1987, 34% attended courses offered by NIEM. About a third of all participants
or 980 were headmasters compared with 840 headmasters expected at appraisal to
be trained annually (Table 5.2).

5.23      Evaluation of Courses.  Overall, current course participants
interviewed felt that NIEM is an effective organization for the training and
upgrading of MOE and other staff. Eighty-nine percent of those surveyed gave
a positive evaluation without reservation, while 9Z of the respondents thought
otherwise. The vast majority of the current participants consider the
approaches used by the lecturers in conducting the courses effective in
helping them to understand and increase their knowledge of the subject
matter. Similarly, most of the utst participants interviewed (91) considered
their participation in the coutz., as useful in improving their understanding
and knowledge in the respective subjects they undertook. They were able to
recall and apply ideas, advice, concepts, skills and techniques learned in
carrying out their daily tasks. The vast majority of those surveyed (901)
wished to have the orportunity to attend additional courses at NIEN.
Staff Qualifications
5.24      Of NIEM's 42 staff members, five (12Z) had PhDs, 30 (71Z) had
master's degrees and 7 (17Z) had bachelor's degrees. Originally, 40 fellow-
ships for master's degree training overseas and 100 fellowships for short
courses, also overseas, were to be provided under the project. Out of the
total, only 57 fellowships were utilized. Three NIEN staff went for master's
degrees and 54 for short courses, all overseas. Fewer than expected staff
were sent abroad for master's degree training in order to optimize the finan-
cial resources available so that a larger number of students could be trained
locally. It was estimated that the cost of sending one student overseas for
training at the master's degree level was equivalent to the cost of training
seven students locally. NIEM was also preparing intensive short-term, 3-month
courses with the cooperation and involvement of local universities in order to
reduce the necessity of sending staff overseas for such courses.
Evaluation of Facilities
5.25      A survey of current and past NIEN course part.cipants and of MIEN
professional staff and occupants of the flats at Sri Layang reveals that
almost 90X of the respondents considered NIEM's academic and communal facili-
ties as "adequate" or "very adequate." The positive evaluation was further



- 18 -
strengthened by the respondents' view that NIEM management is supportive of
and responsive to their needs. Ninety-three percent of the respondents
evaluated management either as "satisfactory" or "very satisfactory." How-
ever, only 33Z of the occupants of the flats considered the overall condition
of the flats to be satisfactory. Twenty-nine percent considered the flats as
only fair and 38% were quite critical of the overall conditions which they
considered unsatisfactory. This indicates maintenance problems which should
be further investigated.
5.26      Four out of every five respondents considered the location of NIEM
at Sri Layang as suitable and agreeable. The relative isolation of the campus
from Kuala Lumpur and the agreeable climate were the main reasons given.
However, 15Z of the participants did not feel that the location was suitable
as it is too isolated and distant from medical, police and fire fighting
facilities in case of emergencies. About half of the professional staff
resided at the staff quarters provided at NIEM, while the other half were
domiciled elsewhere. Problems cited by the staff regarding the campus loca-
tion centered around transportation and medical problems, which in turn
increased the financial burden on them. Almost a quarter of the staff
commuted daily on the NIEM shuttle bus from Kuala Lumpur.
VI. LESSONS LEARNED
A. Lower Secondary Schools
6.1       Inadequate Information Systems.  Evaluation of work done under this
component was hampered by the lack of an adequate information retrieval system
at MOE as well as at the federal and state PWDs. While education projects at
the PWDs constitute only a portion of their tasks, they should nevertheless
have a proper documentation system for these activities, particularly in view
of their high staff turnover. With the rapid expansion of the duties and
tasks of both MOE and PWDs, computerization of information and data is
probably the answer to this problem.
6.2       Delayed Equipment Delivery.  The major problem encountered by the
schools when they began operations was the delayed and often insufficient
supply of equipment required for the science laboratoriec, industrial arts
workshops, home science rooms and libraries (para. 5.13). This naturally had
negative consequences for the pupils. In order to promote efficiency in this
area, (a) there should be better coordination between the State Education
Offices and the DSD of the MOE; and (b) the award of tenders for equipment
should be decentralized, with the State Education Offices responsible for this
procurement.
6.3       High Land Costs.  While the project cost overruns were in large part
unavoidable, the cost of land owned by the State Governments and sold to MOE
for development was sometimes excessively high. Since education is a social
service which ultimately benefits the state, the land should be made available
to MOE at nominal prices.



- 19 -
6.4       Benefits.  Evidence suggests that the schools constructed under the
project have resulted in an increase in physical infrastructure for the
surrounding communities, including water and electricity services and road
networks. Furthermore, if social changes are seen as changes in values and
attitudes, particularly towards education, then the schools have had a
reasonable measure of success. The demand for education from the communities
is increasing, not only for the lower secondary level but also for the upper
secondary level. This increased demand for extension of secondary education
is seen by most Directors of Education as indicative of the changes in a
community's perceptions of the value of education.
B. INTAN
6.5       Building Design.  The building design and lay-out for the INTAN main
campus at Bukit Kiara is both functional and attractive. Although this is
generally also trae of the regional centers, their compact design, with all
facilities grouped under one roof and with little or no penetration of
sunlight, lacks the brightness and openness of the main campus buildings.
6.6       Choice of Materials.  The location of the Kemanan campus near the
South China Sea should have been considered more carefully in determining the
types of materials used for the building. Due to the building's exposure to
salt-laden wind and to sea water itself, metal components of the windows, the
water tank and the air-conditioning system tend to rust and need to be checked
frequently.
6.7       Factors Responsible for Smooth Implementation.  During implementa-
tion of this component, the INTAN administration worked to reduce substan-
tially the bureaucratic red tape that often hampers or delays project
implementation. INTAN campuses were planned, tendered and constructed within
the implementation schedule agreed at appraisal despite a one-year delay
during the early stages. Three factors facilitated the smooth and successful
implementation of the project works: (a) INTAN management delegated
considerable power to the Director of the Project Implementation Unit to make
day-to-day supervisory decisions on the spot, without the need to refer to the
other parties; (b) the architectural and engineering consultants appointed had
a good working relationship with INTAN and finished their tasks on time and at
a cost l.ower than that for other projects of a similar nature. The
consultants were generally responsive and aware of INTAN's needs and any
changes made were acceptable to both parties concerned; and (c) the Bank
showed Zlexibility with its client when faced with the need to replan and make
alternative decisions.
6.8       Creation of a Maintenance Capability.  A capacity and organization
to handle maintenance of project facilities has been established successfully.
Maintena-se committees on each campus handle all maintenance problems, without
the need to obtain approval from the main office in Kuala Lumpur. Only major
repairs are referred to headquarters. Each committee is headed by the Campus
Registrar and supported by domestic and building supervisors and an odd-job
worker who makes on-the-spot repairs.  In addition, the Project Implementation
Unit, which assisted the maintenance committees to solve major problems during
project implementation, has been converted into INTAN's Realty Management Unit
so that continuous monitoring of physical facilities is ensured.

C. NIE
o.9       Campus Location.  Overall, NIEM is an attractive institution with a
promising future as a training center, not only for MOE, but also for other
government agencies. However, while its somewhat removed location makes it a
more attractive facility than perhaps the INTAN campuses, the relative
remoteness of the site creates certain strains and anxieties for the teaching
and administrative personnel who live on campus (para. 5.26). These concerns
could be somewhat minimized through an expansion of facilities and activities
available at the Institute. In particular, telephone cables which have been
promised to NIEM should be installed and, as a matter of high priority, the
post of medical officer should be created and filled by MOE to relieve anxiety
over the lack of medical staff on the premises to handle emergencies.
6.10      Design Consultations.  Site meetings carried out monthly during the
construction of NIEM enabled the Director and Deputy Directors to contribute
ideas which helped modify designs and the physical environment. Nevertheless,
more discussions could bave been held to ensure that the physical environment
at the Institute facilitates maximum learning by providing an optimal learning
environment. More attention particularly needs to be given to student comfort
which is important to the learning process. For example, as constructed,
seating in the lecture theater rises at too steep an angle and there is
insufficient space for physical movement.
6.11      Need for a Maintenance Capability.  Like all newly-completed
buildings, NIEM needs certain repairs to correct faults already identified.
The condition of NIEM flats particularly requires attention (para. 5.25).
However, the Institute lacks a building mainten.ance capability and its
relative isolation means that it cannot rely on other government agencies and
departments to help with the repairs. What is urgently needed is the training
of a team of NIEM staff to handle minor and nonstructural faults and
repairs. In addition, a maintenance crew from PWD headquarters should be
stationed at NIEK for a period long enough to observe and correct faults,
erosion and other problems.
6.12      Benefits of Design Flexibility.  Although the final cost of building
the Institute was considerably higher than originally envisaged, the provision
of special facilities such as single-occupancy hostel rooms provided the
Institute with an environment more conducive to learning. Although the Bank
initially opposed the idea of single-occupancy hostel rooms, it was later
convinced by the Ministry of this need, an example of the Bank's willingness
to be accommodating on certain aspects of the design and planning of the
projects it finances.

OBSERVATIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED BY THE BANK
A. Observations
1.        The project more than achieved its overall enrollment and training
objectives although with some cost and time overruns. Regarding the latter,
as the loan closing date of June 30, 1985, drew near, and the loan was almost
fully disbursed, it became obvious that even without the loan to draw upon,
the Government, based on the Bank's past experience in education lending in
Malaysia, would complete the project on its own, which is, in fact, what
occurred. This made extension of the closing date and/or the revision of
disbursement percentages unnecessary.
2.        The 76 lower secondary schools constructed in disadvantaged dis-
tricts were for the most part correctly located to raise the UIs in the states
in which those districts were located to levels above the EIs in 1977 (the
statistics used at apprainal). The aim was to bring EIs in all states up to
the national average projected for 1980 of 35.7. By 1986, only two states
were below the projected average, Trengganu and Sabah, although the PCR team
does not give any explanation as to why this is so. The national average did,
of course, also increase over the years so that by 1986 it stood at 41.7, witb
six of the 13 states still below the average. For the most part, these were
the same states that were below the average in 1977 (Annex 3). Also, although
the state Els increased, the El of some districts within a state sometimes
remained low. Statistics should probably reflect the district-level situation
to highlight imbalances within the states.
3.        NIEN and INTAN and its branches have emerged from the project as
successful, fully-functioning institutions in newly constructed campuses of
their own design. This is largely due to dedicated and inspired management in
both institutions and Government's commitment to the objectives of each.
There were, however, large cost overruns in the construction of the new cam-
puses, very large in the case of NIEM (para. 3.18), that could possibly have
been avoided. While the mAnagement of both institutes naturally wanted the
best campuses possible, the Government was unable to restrict the size or the
location of the Institutes. Indeed, the agency responsible for this control,
i.e., the Standards and Costs Division in the Economic Planning Unit of the
Prime Minister's Office, has standards which are already more generous than
those used in most Bank-funded projects. Regarding the locations of the new
institutions, both NIEM and INTAM's original main facilities were located in
reasonably adequate buildings in Kuala Lumpur and perhaps a closer examination
of those buildings and the land around them would have allowed their remodel-
ing and expansion at a far lower cost than that incurred from relocating both
to expensive new sites.
B. Lessons Learned
4.        A variety of lessons have been learned under this project, some of
which have already been incorporated into subsequent projects, while others
are reflected in the design of the proposed Second Primary and Secondary
Education Sector Project. The most important findings, both positive and
negative, are as follows:



- 22 -
(a) Institutional Capabilities. Most importantly, and most positively,
this project, along with the Fourth Education Project (Loan 1329-MA)
which concentrated on primary schooling, proved that the Government,
through MOE's Development and Supply Division working with the
Public Works Department, is capable of undertaking large subsector
projects in education. Thus have followed the Primary and Secondary
Education Sector Project (Eighth Education Loan, Loan 2685-MA)
approved in early 1986 and now being successfully implemented, and a
proposed Second Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project
negotiated in June 1988. The first Sector Project focused, among
other things, on providing adequate school facilities and educa-
tional resources to districts with below-average facilities/
resources to help overcome disparities still remaining at the
district level;
(b) Area and Construction Standards. Standards adopted for the MIEM and
INTAN components were probably too high. Thus, in subsequent proj-
ects, the Bank has emphasized the need to use reasonable area and
construction standards, although with mixed success. Facilities
constructed under the first Sector Project are appropriate, but some
facilities included in the University Development Project (Loan
2887-MA, 1987) are oversized, partly because most of the buildings
had already been designed when the Bank became involved in the
project and partly due to the Standards and Costs Division's own
generous standards;
(c) Need for an Integrated Project Action Plan. Several problems that
arose under the project, i.e., slow acquisition of sites (para. 3.7)
and delayed provision of utilities (para. 5.11), might be best
addressed through the preparation of an integrated project action
plan that would strengthen coordination among the various government
agencies involved. Even with this, site acquisition may still be a
problem, and may continue to require planning and purchase well
ahead of need;
(d) Maintenance Allocations. The per capita annual grants made to each
primary and secondary school in Malaysia for each enrolled student
for maintenance and other operating expenditures such as supplies
and teaching materials and equipment has not changed since the mid-
1970s. In 1985, the grant for materials and equipment stood at only
about US$5.80 per secondary student (para. 5.4). In order to
rectify this deficiency, the proposed Second Sector Project would
require the Government to increase the per capita grants in its 1988
budget to make up for past erosion in their real value and, subse-
quently, to continue to increase the grants in amounts sufficient to
offset local inflation;
(e) Teacher Qualifications. Teachers' qualifications under the project
were not always adequate (para. 5.7). This should be constantly
monitored during project implementation to ensure that academic
standards are maintained;



- 23 -
(f) Curriculum. In light of some underutilization of facilities under
the project (paras. 5.14-5.15), the place of domestic science,
industrial arts and school library work within the curriculum should
be reconsidered. Workshops are too costly for elective subjects
only and school libraries should be part of a student's daily
activities and not merely used during scheduled class periods.
These recommendations are being discussed with Government in
relation to a new secondary school curriculum under preparation;
(g) Overseas Training of Educational Managers. Government largely
avoided sending educators for overseas training under this project,
despite the fact that some training needs could not be met by
locally available programs (paras. 5.19 and 5.24). In future
projects, the proper mix of overseas and local training should be
clarified with the Government. In particular, the recent
ministerial guideline to avoid fellowships abroad should be
clarified with regard to long-term (one school year and above) high-
level training and specialized training unavailable within the
country. A trade-off between a reduction of fellowships abroad and
an increase in foreign specialist services, to assist local training
institutions in preparing and starting local training programs,
should be considered:
(h) Procurement. Despite the PCR team's recommendation in para. 6.2
that equipment procurement for project schools should be decen-
tralized to the State Education Offices, the Bank recommends that
this function continue to be handled through the DSD, which has
handled procurement under all subsequent education projects except
for works in Sabah and Sarawak, which do their own procurement.  DSD
has more experience than the State Offices in bidding under Bank
procurement procedures, especially in international competitive
bidding, and, by buying in bulk, can gain more favorable prices. As
the PCR recommends, bowever, better coordination is needed between
the State Education Offices and the DSD; and this has been addressed
under subsequent projects; and
(i) Bank Supervision Missions. Less than adequate supervision of the
project by the Bank led to some of the problems mentioned above. It
is necessary for the Bank to send supervision missions at regular
intervals and to involve staff from all necessary disciplines, most
particularly educators, in all such missions to ensure proper
monitoring of project implementation and educational quality.

primary schools and 30,000 in three-grade lower secondary schools could
accommodate all primary school leavers in secondary schools and would have
an El of 50. The EI would have a maximum value of 50 if there were no
dropouts, repetitions, migration or deaths among school children and if
birth rates remained constant. The El is a direct reflection of the effec-
tive demand for junior secondary places since it is dependent upon the
cohort already in primary schools.
