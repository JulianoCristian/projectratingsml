APPRAISAL OF A FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1. DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS AND STRATEGY
Recent Economic Development Trends
1.01      Economic growth in Malaysia has been impressive during the two
decades of independence. Real growth of GNP is estimated at 6% annually
during the 1960s and 7.1% annually during the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP),
1971-75. Per capita income (US$860 in 1976) is more than two-thirds higher
than it was two decades ago in real terms. There have been modest rates of
inflation except during 1973-74; unemployment rates have declined steadily
during the 1970s (to 6.6% at present); and the distribution of income -
especially through public services - has improved perceptibly. The value of
exports has nearly quadrupled in the last five years alone (while imports
tripled); foreign exchange reserves stand at more than six months of imports,
and the debt service ratio is a modest 3.9%.
1.02      Structural change, while steady, has been unspectacular.  Agricul-
ture still accounts for almost half of all employment (but less than 30% of
output), and manufacturing - though growing in real terms at more than 12%
annually during the 1970s - still accounts for only 11% of employment (and
16% of output). The economy was, and is, heavily dependent upon the produc-
tion and export of primary sector commodities - rubber, tin, palm oil, timber
and, more recently, petroleum - though exports of manufactures have doubled
their share during the 1970s and now approach rubber in importance. Exports
account for a large portion of the GNP (45% in 1977), hence shifts in inter-
national commodity prices have a strong influence on Mialaysian incomes. In
current prices the GNP rose by a spectacular 27.9% between 1972 and 1973
(only 10.5% of which represented domestic inflation), in spite of a fall
in real output of 11.9%.  But overall, the international terms of trade have
shifted against Malaysia during the 1970s, with export prices rising at 6.5%
annually and import prices at 6.8%. While the economy's dependence on exports
is expected to continue, the rapidly rising share of manufacturing will
reduce the country's vulnerability to dramatic shifts in primary commodity
prices.
Development Goals and Strategies
1.03      The "New Economic Policy" formulated in the SMP sprang from the
belief that the central task facing the country was the promotion of national
unity. This would be pursued by (a) reducing poverty, irrespective of race,
and (b) correcting economic disparities, and in the process reducing the
identification of race with economic function (now usually referred to in
Malaysia as "restructuring")./I The incidence of poverty in 1970 was about
/1 Malays accounted for 47% of the population in the 1970 census, Chinese
for about 34% and Indians for about 9%; others (chiefly in Sabah and
Sarawak) accounted for about 10%.



twice as high for Malays (65%) as for non-Malays (29%); more than twice as
high in rural (59%) as in urban areas (25%) and half of all poverty groups -
whether defined by occupation, race or urban-rura:L status - were concentrated
in three states (Kedah, Kelantan and Perak). Soc:Lal services were also
unequally distributed.
1.04      The Third Malaysia Plan (TMP), 1976-80, continued implementation
of the New Economic Policy. Its main socioeconomic objectives are to:
(a) reduce the incidence of poverty in both urban and rural areas through
improved employment opportunities and access to economic services;
(b) enhance the quality of life through expanded social services; (c) achieve
more proportionate representation of the major raeial communities in all
income sectors, occupations, and ownership of productive assets; (d) encour-
age private investment; (e) promote the fullest use of human and natural
resources; and (f) develop the nation's social and physical infrastructure in
support of the above.
1.05      Since the concentration of poverty in certain states and in rural
areas remains (para. 1.03), the TMP has given particular attention to the
development of economic and social infrastructure in these areas. About 20%
of public development expenditure for the TMP will be directed to five
poverty states which account for 12% of GDP and 25% of the population.
Continued efforts are also devoted to involving rural Malays in higher
productivity and modern sector occupations, particularly nonagricultural
ones.
1.06      The TMP postulates an accelerating rate of GNP growth (8.2% annually)
to enable both restructuring and reduction in poverty through growth rather
than outright redistribution. In sectoral terms, agriculture is expected to
maintain rapid growth (6% annually) through continuing modernization, indus-
trial exports are expected to maintain high growth in manufacturing (13%
annually), and these sectors are in turn expected to promote continuing high
growth in tertiary activities, aided by a rise in public consumption. The
latter will continle to increase its share of GDP (from 20% to 23%), though
public investment - which rose at a rate of 18% annually during the SMP - will
decline marginally to 9.1% of GDP by 1980. Employment growth is expected to
accelerate from 3.3% annually during the SMP to 3.5% p.a., with manufacturing
accounting for 23% of the jobs created, public services for 21%, and agricul-
ture for 17%.
1.07      The Government's developmefit strategy (para. 1.04) cannot be imple-
mented without extensive government intervention in economic decision making
and in the management of large programs, public elnterprises and development
projects. These activities require knowledge and skills that were almost
unavailable in the Malaysian bureaucracy before 1965 and for which few Malays
possessed academic preparation or practical experience. Public agencies have
expanded at a rapid. rate and a host of public corporations has been estab-
lished. Though their functions cover complex areas of economic and social
policy, they have been staffed with young officers who have little preparation
for their managerial responsibilities. Past and projected growth trends in
the tertiary sector illustrate this development:

1.08      A second problem for the public service administration is that
personnel, especially Malay professionals, increasingly tend to leave the
public service to head companies or establish their own firms once they have
acquired some experience. This drain of trained personnel from government
service, while desirable in another perspective, puts an additional strain on
public administration. These circumstances explain in part the serious
implementation delays of several government development programs (including
the school construction program). The Government recognizes the importance
of improved administrative performance and has taken some steps to achieve
this, such as the recent establishment of the Malaysian Administrative
Modernization and Manpower Planning Unit (MAMPU) in the Office of the Prime
Minister. The Government also emphasizes civil service staff training as a
means of distributing benefits to both the individual and the respective
Government departments at modest cost without major institutional and pro-
cedural changes. The Government has thus established a public administration
training institute (INTAN) and has subsequently introduced specific course
requirements for promotion to certain Government posts. However, current
training programs are insufficient to cope with even the growth of the system
(4% trained each year compared to an annual growth rate in excess of 5%) and
specialized training programs for education administration staff have not
been provided.
2. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Overview
2.01      Malaysia has a comparatively strong system of formal education and
spends high proportions of its GNP (6.7%) and Government budget (25%) on it.
The overall school enrollment of 2.9 million corresponds to 65% of the 6-18
year olds and to 23% of the population. Participation rates have been
equalized for the three major racial communities and the system in this
respect has made a significant contribution by deliberate planning toward the
major aim of national unification. The system also provides education of
generally good quality: curricula with few exceptions are balanced and
include a reasonable proportion of practical subjects; teachers are generally



-4-
qualified and trained; textbooks of good quality are made available to all
schools; educationaL radio and television broadcasts are extensive; and
school facilities are mostly of a high standard. The dropout rate within
each cycle is low. The following three problems appear to be of particular
significance for future development:
(a) access to secondary education still varies substantially according
to geographical area or socioeconomic status;
(b)  adjustments need to be made in the type and amount of occupational
training provided in the education system in view of the currently
low proportions of such training in the system; and
(c) implementation efficiency in major development programs, as well as
routine administration, has not always been satisfactory; this
problem is shared by most government departments (para. 1.08).
Structure and Education Finance
2.02      The Malaysian education system comprises a six-year primary cycle,
a three-year lower secondary unit and a two- to four-year upper secondary unit,
followed by a variety of higher education courses with one- to three-year non-
degree programs, three-year bachelor degree programs, and limited postgraduate
facilities (Charts 2 and 3). As schools may use dlifferent languages of
instruction,/1 a transition year ("form remove") is added for those students
who transfer between primary and secondary schools of different media.
2.03      Education and training is a federal responsibility in Malaysia.
The Ministry of Education (HOE) is responsible for primary and secondary
schooling, teacher training and the universities, but it is only one of
many agencies involved in education and training. Programs ranging from
preschool to adult literacy and community education are run by the Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development. Vocational training programs are
operated regularly by the Ministry of Labor and Manpower, Ministry of Youth
and IMajlis Amanah Ra'ayat (MARA), and on an irregular basis by numerous other
agencies. In principle these programs are coordinated by several standing
committees within the Prime Minister's Office (e.g. National Development
Planning Committee), but in practice the agencies have considerable autonomy.
1MAMPU and a proposed Manpower Development Unit are expected to give much
firmer guidance than in the past to these vocational programs and to coor-
dinate their expansion with the remainder of the system.
2.04      Funds for education are provided almost exclusively by the Federal
Government; states have few responsibilities in this respect (though Sabah-
Sarawak relinquished theirs only in 1974); private enrollments are small
/1 Malay, Chinese, Tamil and to some extent also English.



-5-
except for the 32,000 Malaysians studying abroad /1 and no school fees are
charged through the first nine years of education. The level of education
expenditure is high in Malaysia. The MOE budget alone accounted for 22% of
federal government recurrent expenditure in 1976 (a share which has remained
stable over the last ten years); together with the education/training expend-
itures of other agencies, the total share was 25%. Public educational
expenditure as a proportion of GNP was 6.7% in 1976, or 7% with the addition
of private expenditure. Among the 94 countries listed in Annex 1 only one
exceeds Malaysia in both of these measures of education expenditure.
2.05       Annual recurrent costs per student amount to US$113 for primary
schools and US$1,370 for universities. Unit costs at the secondary level range
from US$170 in ordinary secondary schools to US$840 in fully residential and
science schools. The high unit cost in the latter (with 1.5% of total
enrollments) is due in part to the costs of accommodation (which amount
to about US$130 per residential student at ordinary secondary schools) and
to higher levels of staffing and funding.
Major Aims and Achievements within the Education System
2.06       At the time of independence (1957) Malaysia had four separate edu-
cational streams at the primary level - one for each major ethnic group, plus
an English language stream - which varied not only linguistically, but also
in terms of structure, content, quality and accessibility. There were also
major variations in the education systems of Peninstilar Malaysia, Sabah
and Sarawak. Recognizing the implications of this diversity for social
cohesion, a major study (Razak Committee Report of 1956) defined unifying
guidelines for post-independence evolution of the education system. The main
elements were: rapid expansion, education in the three main languages but
with a unified structure and national standards on curricula, teacher train-
ing and class sizes, free primary education, and substantially increased
support for all schools. Education was subsequently made free and promotion
notionally automatic through the lower secondary school. The Third Malaysia
Plan (1976-80) (TMP) reiterates some of these aims but with important modifi-
cations and additions. Its main objectives are to:
(a) strengthen the educational system to promote national integration
and unity, inter alia through:
(i) structure: eventual integration of the educational systems in
Sabah and Sarawak into the national system;
(ii) language: phased introduction of Bahasa Malaysia as the main
medium of instruction at all levels; and
/1 Enrollments in private schools are declining and currently account for
0.3% and 6% of total enrollments at the primary and secondary levels
respectively. Foreign tertiary level enrollments are of the same order of
magnitude as local ones.



- 6 -
(iii) enrollments: narrowing the gap in educational opportunities
between rich and poor, and among the various racial communi-
ties and regions, through more equitable distribution of
facilities;
(b)  orient and expand the education and training system towards meeting
nationa:L manpower needs, especially in science and technology;
(c) improve the quality of education, reduce wastage and increase
effectiveness; and
(d)  expand the research, planning and implementation capacity to meet
the above objectives.
The following paragraphs discuss the success of the Government in meeting the
above objectives midway through the third plan period.
2.07      Structure and Language Policy.  The goal of a uniform structure has
been achieved, except for some minor variations in Sabah and Sarawak (e.g.,
within teacher training) that cater to special circumstances of access and
language usage (Chart 1). Curricula have also been standardized and are now
the same throughout the country irrespective of language of instruction.
2.08      The Government's language policy has undergone an important change
during the second decade of independence. Contrary to the recommendations of
the Razak Committee Report, the TMP explicitly states that Bahasa Malaysia
will be made the main medium of instruction at all levels of education,
including primary. However, it gives no timetable for its introduction at
this level. Except in Sarawak, where implementation of the language policy
lags behind the rest of the country, the English language stream had been
phased out in pub:Lic primary schools by 1976 and will be eliminated at the
secondary level by 1982. The Malay medium of instruction is gradually becoming
the norm: only 38% of Peninsular Malaysia students were enrolled in Malay
medium schools in 1970, but this proportion had increased to 67% in 1977.
2.09      Enrollment.  Universal basic education of nine years was a
stated long-range goal already before the third plan period. This is a
reasonable goal for a country in Malaysia's stage of development. The TMP
adds, however, the important policy objective that universal enrollment
through grade 9 should be pursued with equity as a guiding principle. This
has substantial irmplications at the lower secondary level where facilities
are unevenly distributed.  At higher levels of education, particularly beyond
the upper secondary level, the emphasis is on meeting national manpower
needs.
2.10      Actual enrollment targets for education and training during the
TMP are summarized in Table 2.1. At the primary level they reflect the
expectation of continued growth to eliminate the last pockets of underenroll-
ment. At the lower secondary level, however, enrollment targets indicate
that universal enrollment will be pursued aggressively only in Sabah, where
growth should be higher than in states with greater concentrations of poverty.
Upper secondary enrollments will continue their steep climb while vocational-

technical enrollment growth is expected to taper off. Post-secondary
enrollments would continue their rapid growth, but diploma-level enrollments
are projected to drop to a rate below that of degree programs - contrary to
intentions stated elsewhere in the TMP. Construction programs in support of
these enrollment targets have suffered a delay of almost two years. Renting
of facilities and frequent exceeding of the notional classroom capacity of 40
students, however, have compensated for this implementation inefficiency and
actual enrollment ltrends indicate that most enrollment targets will be met.
2.11      Quality.  The Malaysian education system has achieved some out-
standing strengths in terms of curriculum balance and standard of services
and facilities. Some of these strengths are described in the following
paragraphs.
2.12      Curricula generally have a reasonable proportion of practical
content./I For instance, the lower secondary school curriculum is diversi-
fied and includes prevocational courses, i.e., industrial arts, home science,
agricultural science and commercial studies. Pupils are required to take one
of these subjects Eor about 10% of overall instruction time, but the final
examination is voluntary. Science is taught exclusively in laboratories with
an emphasis on simple experiments. Textbooks (with workbooks, guides and
associated equipment list) are being developed by a Curriculum Development
Center (CDC) and are mostly of high quality. The CDC has more than twenty
curriculum projects under way and has also begun to develop on a small scale
prototype equipment for local manufacturing. Few efforts to evaluate these
programs have yet been made, but inadequate understanding of the practical
implications of curriculum reforms among school managers and education
officers has been an implementation constraint. Most schools have libraries
but the supply of books is still modest (reportedly 1-2 volumes per pupil at
the secondary level). Educational radio and television are firmly estab-
lished in Malaysia and provide a strong link between centrally placed educa-
tors and field staff. Despite the extensive broadcasts (about 20 TV and 35
radio programs), media support to teaching is of low intensity amounting to
only 30 minutes per week, per subject for each grade for radio. TV coverage
is about one third that of radio. The qualitative impact would probably be
greater if the broadcasts concentrated on fewer subjects and grades.
2.13      Most teachers in Malaysia are formally qualified (primary 82%,
lower secondary 84%). The level of current teacher training is also reason-
ably high; primary and secondary school teachers are trained in 2-year
programs with a normal entry requirement of 11 years of education (Chart 2)
and consideration is being given to the introduction of a 3-year program from
1980 when most untrained teachers will have been replaced or upgraded.
However, Malaysia, as many other countries, has for a number of years been
forced to recruit teacher trainees at the best available level. As late as
1975 Sabah had to recruit primary school leavers as trainees and currently
/1 A notable exception is the upper secondary technical stream where less
than 10% of instructional time is devoted to practical work.



recruits at the Grade 9 level. Further, only 17% of secondary school teach-
ers (Grades 7-13) are university graduates. Many teachers are thus in need
of strong support and assistance from headmasters and colleagues. The output
capacity of existing teachers colleges (about 5,000 p.a. for a 3 year course)
compares fairly well with the anticipated demand of 5,600 by the end of the
TMP, and additional construction is under way.
2.14      The Inspectorate is charged with the responsibility of promoting
quality teaching and school management by means of school visits, and profes-
sional advice to teachers and headmasters. However, with a total profes-
sional staff of 80, the Inspectorate only manages to visit one school out of
four per year. In-service seminars and courses for active teachers are
arranged by several divisions (Schools, Inspectorate, Curriculum and Teacher
Training) of the MOE; most of these activities are conducted in teachers'
colleges during vacations, the remainder as short (weekend) courses at
other locations. However, because of the backlog of inadequately qualified
teachers, the focus is on formal upgrading. Insufficient attention is
devoted to staff development; teachers are usually appointed as headmasters
with no prior or subsequent training for their new tasks. There appears to
be scope for improved quality and efficiency by reinforcing professional
support services to schools. With Bank support under the Fourth Education
Project (Loan 1329-MA) Education Resource Centers are being tried in four
states as a partial answer to these needs. These centers will provide
inservice training of school teachers throughout the year. Mobile teams are
also planned to operate from these centers providing schools with a regular
source of support materials and professional advice. Another promising
avenue which has not been adequately explored would be training programs
for headmasters and school administrators on a national basis.
2.15      Recently constructed schools are built according to standard plans
and are of good quality, but there is scope for improved economy: (a) secondary
schools are normally designed with one classroom per class which stands empty
when the class occupies a specialized space (laboratory, workshop, TV-room,
etc.),/1 and (b) several spaces are either excessively large or poorly
used, i.e., workshops for industrial arts, 4,500 sq ft, with an occupancy
rate below 40% for an average size school. About 5% of school facilities are
rented, often in anticipation of new construction, and these are usually of
low standard. Renting facilities in anticipation of construction has the
advantage that a new school becomes fully utilized immediately upon completion.
Problem Areas
2.16      The next sections analyze the issues of equity of access to education,
possible adjustments in occupational training and inadequate capacity for
management training which affects educational development as well as the
implementation capacity of other government departments.
/1 Because of the pressures for increased enrollment, many schools have
introduced a more economical rotating classroom system. However, the
extent to which this has been done is not known. Schools also often
operate in two shifts.

2.17      Equity.  The Government's chief equity objective in the immediate
post-independence period was to narrow the gap in benefits among the three
major racial communities. The major policy thrust was expansion rather than
outright redistribution (para. 1.06). Enrollments were thus expanded by more
than 50% for all stages beyond primary school under the SMP (54% for the lower
secondary schools). However, the Government has also taken a number of steps
specifically designed to equalize educational opportunities. The introduction
of fully residential secondary schools and special science secondary schools
thus aimed at increasing the participation of Malays in the social and
economic life of the nation. Further, the conversion of English medium
schools to the use of Malay was part of the strategy for national integration
(para. 2.06) as well as an aid to evening out the quality of instruction,
since English medium schools received disproportionately high allocations of
funds and qualified teachers. A final example is the policy of distributing
newly graduated teachers to states on the basis of need. As a result, there
is little variation in the proportion of qualified teachers, in the case of
primary teachers from a low of 80% in Pahang to a high of 91% in Perlis.
2.18      Enrollment data indicate that by 1975 underrepresentation of Malays
had been eliminated at all levels of education in Peninsular Malaysia, and
that rapid progress was being made on their representation in fields vital
to modern economic development. This is shown by the following table where the
distribution of primary enrollments approximates the population distributions.

The proportion of Malays at all secondary schools exceeds that at the primary
level. At the upper secondary level they are adequately represented, even in
the science stream, while at the degree level the proportion of Malays among
science and technology students rose from 14% to 37% during 1971-75. Thus a
continuation of present trends in intake should eliminate the last elements

of racial imbalance in study programs by the end of the TMP, and thereby
fulfill the education sector's main contribution to restructuring the racial
composition of employment. Despite the impressive achievements in reducing
imbalances among the major racial communities, the variation in educational
opportunities between the different regions and between the rich and poor
were still great at the end of the SMP. For instance, upper secondary
enrollment in Sabah and Sarawak, at 15% of the age group, was only half
that of Peninsular Malaysia (30% of age group).
2.19      These inequities may be traced to the lower secondary cycle, the last
three years of the nine-year program of basic education in Malaysia. In 1972
enrollment ratios for age 15+ youth already varied less between the three
major racial groups (30-39%) than between the other two modes of grouping:
rural-urban location, 28-47%, and low-high socio-economic status, 17-65%./1
2.20      While attendance in the lower grades of primary schools is near
universal on Peninsular Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak lag somewhat behind), the
coverage of secondary schools remains incomplete throughout Malaysia and not
all children are provided with the full nine years of basic education./2
Dropout rates are low within each level of education (aggregating about 7%
from Grades 1 through 6) but on the average about 22% drop out between the
primary (Grade 6) and lower secondary (Grade 7) levels, mostly due to shortage
of places. Attendance of both sexes is fairly equal; in Sarawak, where
female participation lags most, girls account for 44% of lower secondary
enrollments compared to 49% of the age group. Until universal attendance
is achieved, the Government's strategy is to redress imbalances so that a
greater proportion of the poorest people gain access to basic education and
may participate more fully in the life of the nation (para. 1.03). This is
an ambitious goal: two types of benefits (access and quality) should become
equitably distributed under three modes of grouping the Malaysian population
(racial community, income and geographical area).
2.21      The distribution of access and quality is interrelated.  Access is
lowest in rural areas where the communication network is inadequate; these
areas are also the most difficult to reach for supervision or for maintenance
of facilities, and teachers generally prefer to work in towns.  Of the four
states with the highest proportion of temporary secondary school facilities,
three are below the mean in terms of access. This combination of lower
access and quality of service is also reflected in examination results with
rural area schools scoring somewhat lower (5-15%) than urban schools./l
/1 Source: Dropout Study, MOE, 1973.
/2 Enrollment ratios cannot be accurately estimated but might be 92% for
grades 1-6 and 60% for grades 7-9 (Bank estimate for 1976). The last
Census was taken in 1970 and published data are crude and inaccurate
(leading for instance to a primary enrollment ratio in 1976 of 96% for
Sarawak and 76% for Malacca). Notional enrollment ratios for the primary
and lower secondary levels (excluding the remove class) would be 82% and
65% respectively.

2.22      Although socioeconomic status appears to be a main determinant of
student participation in education, variations in access by geographical area
are more amenable to analysis and correction. Dal:a on school places by
district are readily available and schools can be built where shortage of
places is a limiting factor. The incidence of poverty is also known to vary
substantially between districts and to be higher in rural than urban areas
(para. 1.03). The following table presents varialtions in access to lower
secondary education by state and district (division or residency) in 1977 as
expressed by an "Enrollment Index" (EI) scale:/1

This table demonstrates substantial variations in opportunities for further
education among primary school leavers. There are some districts where
virtually all chilcLren who have completed primary education may proceed
to secondary schools (EI close to 50), and others where only a third of
primary school leavers have that chance (EI = 17). These disparities in
opportunities are further illustrated in Chart 1 in para. 5.01.
1  This scale was introduced because of the probLems associated with enrollment
ratios (para. 2.20). It is defined as a percentage scale of enrollments
in Forms I-III (thus excluding the remove class) as a proportion of enroll-
ments in Grades; 1-6 the same year. For examp'Le a state with 60,000 students
in six-grade primary schools and 30,000 in three-grade lower secondary
schools could accommodate all primary school leavers in secondary schools
and would have an EI of 50. The EI would have a maximum value of 50 if
there were no dropouts, repetitions, migration or deaths among school chil-
dren and if birth rates remained constant.  The EI is a direct reflection of
the effective demand for junior secondary places since it is dependent
upon the cohort: already in primary schools.

and Maps 1 and 2. The table also demonstrates that variations within states
are often greater than variations between the states. These large intrastate
variations are partially explained by the fact that equity criteria have been
used less extensively in the allocation of resources within states than among
states.
2.23      Expansion of the secondary school system under the TMP sought to
achieve certain overall enrollment targets and to reach areas inadequately
served. The program - which encompasses 214,000 places, about two thirds of
them in lower secondary schools - is now well under way; 48,000 places had
been occupied in 1977. Actual enrollment growth through 1977 and remaining
TMP construction indicate that the national enrollment target will be met
(target 812,000 against a probable outcome of 835,000) except in Sabah where
a downward adjustment of the high plan target (para. 2.10) has been made
(from 68,500 to a probable outcome of 53,000). A more detailed analysis by
district confirms that educational opportunities will have improved generally
after completion of TMP construction but also reveals that substantial
disparities in opportunity for nine years of basic education will remain.
This is clearly demonstrated by Maps 1 and 2. While the number of districts
with enrollment indices below 25 will have decreased (from 11 to 6) the
number of districts with indices above 46 will have increased (from 2
to 7). The average enrollment index will improve from 34.2 to 35.7, but
there will be no improvement in the Gini coefficient/I which will remain at
about 0.115. Allocations were low for certain states and not always dis-
tributed within states according to equity criteria. A reallocation of TMP
places is no longer possible as all places have been committed. There thus
remains a further need to equalize access to secondary education after
completion of TMP construction.
2.24      Occupational Training.  An effort by the TMP to disaggregate both
demand and supply of manpower by skill level for the period 1976-80 concludes
that there will be a substantial surplus of arts and humanities graduates, but
shortages of science and technology graduates, technicians, and possibly of
skilled level workers. The plan therefore postulates reversing the present
55:45 balance between arts and science graduates during 1976-80 but, as noted
above (para. 2.10), is inconsistent on the matter of technician level shortages
and is more hopeful than explicit on meeting needs for skilled level workers.
Despite emphasis during the last decade on training for employable skills and
a high projected growth rate within the manufacturing sector (para. 1.06), the
majority of courses maintain their academic bias, and even technical schools
are more academically than occupationally oriented. Table 2.4 provides a break-
down of opportunities for further education and training for students completing
Grade 9. Less than 7% of upper secondary students take vocational courses and
only 4% of Grade 9 leavers gain access to any kind of occupational training.
These figures are low by international comparison./2
/1 The Gini coefficient is a measure of the degree of inequality in the dis-
trIbution of two variables. It ranges from 0.0 for absolute equality to
1.0 for absolute inequality.
/2 Vocational proportions of upper secondary enrollments for some other coun-
tries are: Korea 40% (MOE Grades 10-12), Pakistan 10% (1972), Philippines
20% (1972) and Taiwan about 50% (Grades 10-12).

2.25      Occupational training has been expanding rapidly and may, supported
by Loan 1329-MA, more than double current occupational training outputs by
1980. The projected overall capacity is of modest dimensions and corresponds
to 15,000 places or 10% of post Grade 9 training opportunities in 1980.

However, the skilled worker in Malaysia has traditionally acquired his skills
on the job and expert opinions have differed on the extent to which the
current system can meet the future demand. The demand and supply situation,
including private sector and nonformal training, is currently being reviewed
by MAMPU (para. 1.08). The results of that review cannot be fully anticipated,
but the current low proportions of occupational training in the education
system and the growing surplus of arts and humanities graduates indicate a
need to channel the expanding numbers of lower secondary graduates into some
form of occupational training rather than into further academic education.
The development of a long-term plan for occupational training in Malaysia
remains a priority. The plan, in addition to industrial types of training,
should also address the need for rural nonfarm training. Tracer studies
should also be initiated to determine the effectiveness of current modes of
training.
2.26      Civil Service Staff Training.  The Institut Tadbiran Awam Negara
(INTAN) has been responsible for civil service staff training since 1972.
Since its inception as the Government Officers Staff Training Center, concerned
primarily with clerical training activities, INTAN has experienced a remarkable
expansion in the scale and level of its training programs (mostly in-service)
as shown by the following table of courses and participants:
Table 2.5: INTAN, ANNUAL TOTAL ENROLLMENT, 1974-78
1964     1970      1974     1978 (Projected)
Clerical/lower management          1,170    2,400    2,270         4,050
Top-middle management                290      720    1,800         2,120
Total                        1,460    3,120    4,070          6,170
2.27      Public administration training (preservice) is also provided by the
Faculty of Economics and Administration at the University of Malaysia with an
annual output of about 50 degree and 20 diploma level graduates, and from
1977 about 5 masters level graduates. These preservice programs do not
duplicate INTAN's in-service training programs.
2.28      INTAN is a federally funded agency of the Public Services Department
and has benefited from steady government support (para. 1.08) and skillful
and dynamic leadership. Its courses emphasize economic planning, implementa-
tion, management of public enterprises and administrative support services.
INTAN is organized with five centers and a bureau with the following functions:
(a)  the Center for Development Policy and Adminstration serves the
upper middle level of public officials. Major programs are related
to land and agricultural development, social development, and
infrastructure and industrial project planning;



- 16 -
(b)  the Center for Local Government and Urban Development provides
trainirLg for local government officiaLs to improve their contribution
to state and federal government development programs;
(c)  the Center for Employee Development trains officers at the executive
and subprofessional levels as well as the technical and clerical
groups. The center also assists government departments to set
up internal training programs on an ad hoc basis. Training is
conducted in seven local centers and covers such areas as office
management, supervisory techniques, government rules and regulations,
processing of pension documents, and language training;
(d)  the Center for Manpower Development provides a range of courses for
the micldle and upper levels of public service including a modular
program ending in a diploma in Management Science and a one-year
preservice program for some 100 university graduates to prepare
them for a career in the Administrative and Diplomatic Service;
(e) the recently created Foreign Affairs and Security Center will
provide courses in international relations, and multinational,
political and economic organization, international law, etc; and
(f)  the Bureau of Research and Planning conducts behavioral studies,
evaluates the results of training programs, and assists in developing
materials.
These centers work together and often adopt a project approach in training,
such as in Action Training Programs in which staff of all levels in one
administrative district participate to solve and learn from a particular
problem. An Adv:isory Council appointed by the Cabinet advises INTAN on its
operations and provides formal liaison with the state governments, federal
ministries and the University of Malaya.
2.29      The INTAN training programs for 1978 are scheduled to reach about
6,000 persons in 66 different types of courses ranging from a few days to a
fu'l year and aggregating about 30,000 man-weeks of training. Current INTAN
programs thus reach only 4% of the 150,000 federal and state employees,/1 less
than annual growtth and replacement rates within the civil service (5% p.a. and
A1 The main target groups for training are federal and state employees distri-
buted as follows (1977):
Federal         State
Professional and managerial            12,000          1,000
Executive and semiprofessional         45,000          6,000
Clerical and technical                 75,000          7,000
Total                             132,000         14,000
To these may be added about 25,000 public e!nterprise staff and some 30,000
district level staff which would raise the target group to about 200,000.
School personnel have not been included but. would add some 38,000 head-
masters, school support staff, and federal and state education officers.

4% p.a., respectively). Existing accommodation at the main center in Kuala
Lumpur and nine regional centers does not permit any further expansion; 30% of
current teaching is conducted in rented facilities. Most of the regional
centers are too small (typically two classrooms) to provide the requisite core
staff and facilities.
2.30      The INTAN faculty consists of 98 training officers and 14 Bureau of
Research and Evaluation staff. INTAN has a core of experienced and knowledge-
able staff, but less than 30% have a masters degree or higher qualification.
Although they are assisted by guest lecturers (about 200 p.a.) and some 140
administrative and general service staff, they still do not have adequate time
for research and preparatory work. Expansion of INTAN's successful program
is urgently needed (para. 1.08). Moreover, no systematic training is
presently provided for the Ministry of Education administrative staff. The
development of specialized education administration training is a priority
task (para. 2.14).
Bank Participation in the Education Sector
2.31.     The Bank has previously financed four education projects in
Malaysia. In aggregate the projects provided new training capacity dis-
tributed by type and level as follows:

This table reflects a lending program which has had the dual thrust of (a)
improving opportunities for basic education in rural areas and (b) providing
trained manpower for the country's development. Support of general education
is concentrated at the primary level; the component of general higher education
includes a science university.

2.32      The First Education Project (Ln. 599-MA of May 1969, US$8.8 mil-
lion) had two main objectives: (a) the reorientation of the general educa-
tion system towards an increased practical bias; (b) the training of skilled
middle level manpower (technical, vocational, agricultural). The completion
mission of this project concluded that the project appeared to have had some
success in meeting its first objective but fell short of meeting the targeted
output of the second objective because of shortcomings in student intake and
examination procedures. The Second Education ProJect (Ln. 810-MA of April
1972, US$15.5 million) supplemented the technical and vocational training of
the first project, but its main objectives were qualitative improvements in
science education, curriculum development and the use of education media.
The Third Education Project (Ln. 974-MA of April 1974, US$19.5 million)
completed the education media coverage begun in the Second Project. Improved
education quality was addressed in this project through improved teacher
training and provisions for higher technical training. Equity consider-
ations feature on a small scale in this project through the provision of
secondary schools in the poorly served areas of Sabah. Equity in access to
education played a major role in the Fourth Educat:ion Project (Ln. 1329-MA of
November 1976, US$35.0 million), which focused on primary education. Indus-
trial skills training under the aegis of the Ministry of Manpower and Labor,
was also supported. The first three of these proJects have suffered manage-
ment problems and implementation delays which received particular attention
during appraisal of the fourth project. Project maanagement improved during
FY78 (para. 4.09) as evidenced by increased disbursements.
2.33      The preceding analysis of the education system has highlighted three
problem areas within education and government servrices that should be
addressed:
(a)  unequal cipportunities for full participation in the social and
economic life of the nation are being established by unequal access
to the second cycle of basic education (para. 2.19);
(b) inefficiencies within the education sysl:em are caused by the
lack of systematic managerial training of education staff, espe-
cially headmasters, (para. 2.10, 2.12, 2.14 and 2.32). Managerial
problems of this nature are common to a'Ll other government depart-
ments andl current management training capacity is insufficient
(para. 1.08 and 2.29); and
(c)  the most suitable amount and pattern of occupational training
is unclear. In the near term an important policy issue is the
appropriate mix of skill training for graduates of basic education
(para. 2.25).
3. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Project Scope
3.01      The proposed project would pursue three major objectives, namely:
(a) to equalize access to lower secondary education throughout Malaysia;



- 19 -
(b)  to improve planning, implementation and management capability
of public administration through staff training; and
(c)  to assist in preparing an overall plan for occupational training of
graduates of basic education.
3.02      Lower secondary schools would be established in disadvantaged
districts to achieve the first objective. The second objective,
which has the ultimate aim of increasing the efficiency of public institutions,
would be pursued through training of civil service staff at national and
regional levels. General public administration training would be supported
through INTAN's network of institutions, and a specialized institution
(Ministry of Education Staff Training Institute, MESTI) would be established
for the largest single target group - administrative staff within the school
system. The third objective, a comprehensive vocational training plan, would
be sought through Government preparation of such a plan with technical
assistance.
3.03      Overall the project would provide the following facilities and
training capacities (Map 4):
Table 3.1: PROPOSED NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS AND ADDED CAPACITY

or replaced institutions that will result from the project.
Project Components
3.04      Lower Secondary School Expansion (proposed outlay, US$66.8 million
excluding contingencies). The proposed project would finance the construc-
tion, furnishing and equipping of about 46,500 lower secondary places in
about 76 new schools in disadvantaged districts. Geographical inequality of
access has been used as the criterion for determining location of schools./i
/1 The treatment of inequities of access as a geographical variable has the
advantage of a providing an easily quantifiable measure of relative need.
It is effective because (a) there is a strong correlation between enrollment
and poverty, and (b) at district level, there is a large variation in
access (para. 2.19). The district would be used as the basic unit of
account for the allocation of new investments under this project because
there is a larger variation in access between districts than states. In
Sabah and Sarawak residencies and divisions are used as the respective
units of account.

The 46,500 school places would be distributed among 46 of the 88 districts in
Malaysia as an equity complement to TMP construction (para. 2.23). Under the
project access to secondary education for all districts (except those in
Sarawak) would be increased to the national average projected for 1980.
3.05      More specifically, project allocations were determined as follows:
the enrollment index (para. 2.22) for 1980 was estimated by projecting both
primary and secondary school enrollments to 1980, taking into account both
population growth and the enrollment capacity added by TMP construction. It
was estimated that about half of currently rented facilities would be replaced
by the TMP and project construction together.  Places were subsequently
allocated to all districts with indices substantially below the national mean
of 35.7 so as to raise their indices to this level. Lower allocations were
made for Sarawak because of anticipated implementation constraints./l The
following table and Maps 1, 2 and 3 illustrate how access to secondary
education is expected to increase as a result of TMP construction and the
proposed project a]Llocations:

3.06      The proposed allocations by State and District are shown in Table 3.3.
Allocations to Sarawak, accounting for 23% of places, are about twice as high
on a per capita basis as in any other state, but overall opportunity for access
would remain 22% below the national average. To compensate for migration of
students across district boundaries, state authorities would be given some
flexibility in the application of these quotas. An acceptable tentative list
of schools has been prepared. During negotiations the Government gave assur-
ances that school construction and usage would adhere to the allocation of
/1  Sarawak is the least developed state as measured by the enrollment index.
About 25,000 places would be required to bring its seven divisions up to
the national average. A construction program of this magnitude is judged
by the State Education Department to be about twice as large as maximum
that can be reasonably achieved.

places by district as set out in Table 3.3, with allowance for modifica-
tion by up to 20% (or 120 places) for any one district allocation, at the
discretion of the Government. Alteration of district allocations in excess
of these figures would be mutually agreed between the Bank and the Government
prior to tendering.
3.07      New schools would be relatively small (from 480 to 1,200 places and
averaging about 615) in order to reduce commuting distances and minimize the
need for residential facilities. Nevertheless a need for boarding facilities
would remain in Sabah, Sarawak and five peninsular states where the population
density is low. About 9,600 boarding places would be provided for these
seven areas. Staff housing would be provided according to the standards of
current government practice, which are acceptable. A total of about 470
staff houses would be provided for the 76 schools. Workshops for industrial
arts and home science would be provided to meet the requirements of the
standard (diversified) MOE curriculum for lower secondary schools (para.
2.12). The facilities are planned for use on a one shift basis. Using the
facilities during two shifts could provide additional capacity for lower or
upper secondary enrollments, but scope for this type of expansion would be
limited by the rural location of most schools where commuting distances
become excessive. The proposed project schools would require about 1,500
additional teachers. These teachers can be supplied by existing and projected
teachers colleges (para. 2.13).
3.08      Ministry of Education Staff Training Institute (MESTI) (proposed
outlay, US$4.5 million, excluding contingencies). The proposed project would
finance construction, furniture, library books, equipment, vehicles and
technical assistance to establish a new staff training institute. No such
training institute exists at present. The purpose of MESTI would be to train
administrative school staff and government education officers. The strategy
of improving the effectiveness of the education system through the training
of key staff is supported by the findings of recent research projects.
The headmaster is consistently found to be a key to making the school (and
thus broader education programs) a success; the effectiveness of a school
administrator depends on the support received from higher administrative
levels. Such research has also demonstrated that constant communication and
exchange of ideas between all parties concerned with educational programs
(administrators, principals, teachers, students, parents and sometimes
employers) are essential to their success.
3.09      MESTI would be headed by a Director under the Director General of
MOE and would attempt to improve the overall performance of the education
system through training in managerial and administrative skills, and stimu-
lating communication and exchange of ideas between personnel at the various
administrative levels of the education system. The training programs would
be directed towards: (a) improving understanding of national and educational
objectives; (b) clarifying institutional or individual roles, and providing
the requisite skills for achieving these objectives; (c) improving resource
utilization (staff and pupil time, facilities, school funds, etc.); and
(d) improving the quality of education. Short in-service courses would be

developed for school managers as a first priority. The institute would also
conduct a six-month course for potential school managers and short courses
for top management and other professional groups. Overall, the institute
would provide training for the following types of staff:
Table 3.4: PROJECTED ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF WITHIN THE
EDUCATION SYSTEM (1980)
Headmasters                                          8,000
Senior assistants and supervisors                   17,000
Administrative school support staff                 12,000
Federal and state education officers                 1,200
Total target group, approx.                    38,000
Training for headmasters, senior assistants and afternoon supervisors
would seek to prepare them for effective management by focusing on curriculum
objectives and teaching methods, timetabling and school facility utilization,
personnel management and evaluation. Courses for administrative school
support staff would aim at improving maintenance of facilities, student
records, accounting and statistical data collection. A variety of courses
would also be developed for federal and state education officers ranging from
seminars on national policy analysis, planning, implementation and evaluation
to skill courses on topics such as statistical data analysis and accounting.
INTAN and MESTI would collaborate on some of these courses.
3.10      The institute would be a fully residential institute and have a
capacity of about 400 trainees at any one time. With a general course
duration of about 4 weeks, and 80% utilization rate over 48 weeks per year,
some 4,000 staff would be trained each year corresponding to 10.5% of
the target groups identified above. Considering the needs for replacement
and growth in numbers of personnel in the education system, this represents a
reasonable training capacity. Alternative means for providing the required
training such as vacation courses at teachers colleges have been considered
and abandoned as potentially less effective. An institution capable of
giving management training throughout the year would comparatively be more
effective because: (a) courses of this level require a core group of specia-
lized staff who could be effectively used only in an institution operating on
a continuous basis; and (b) incentives for personnel to participate would be
greater if courses took place also during regular teaching semesters. In
addition a national institution is preferred because centralized courses for
headmasters are expected to have a greater potential for improving the
communication and understanding between policy makers in the capital city and
field staff. The equivalent of about 45 full-time lecturers would be required.
This corresponds to a student teacher ratio of about 9:1 which is reasonable
in view of the time required for program development and evaluation. The
institute would have about 30 permanent staff complemented by short-term
lecturers, mainly government officers. Technical assistance would be provided
for staff development and for the development of detailed programs of study
and curricula.



- 24 -
3.11      MESTI has been formally established with staff positions effective
from January 1, 1979. A planning group has been appointed by the MOE and has
prepared (a) a tentative schedule of training programs for the first five
years of operation; (b) an outline of curricula in a few priority courses;
(c) a staff development program in support of these priority courses; (d) a
plan for incorporating a system of formative evaluation in MESTI's activities;
and (e) draft terms of reference for expert assistance to MESTI. These plans
and programs were reviewed during negotiations, but further discussions with
MESTI's staff on program emphases will be required. within three months.
During negotiations the Government agreed to submit to the Bank for comments
before the end of each academic year a plan for teaching programs for the
following year.
3.12      Institut Tadbiran Awam Negara (INTAN) (estimated outlay US$14.0 mil-
lion excluding contingencies). The project would provide construction, furni-
ture, technical assistance, equipment, books and vehicles for a new central
campus of INTAN (Kuala Lumpur) and three regional centers./l
3.13      New facilities for the main INTAN campus would be erected about one
mile from its present location. The new facilities would include teaching
localities with a maximum seating capacity of about 1,000, boarding for 350
trainees and housing for visiting lecturers. Existing central facilities
with seating capacity of about 250 would continue to be used for courses of
the Employee Development Center. Facilities for the three regional campuses
would include accommodation at each site for teaching, board for 260 trainees
(100%) and housing for visiting staff. Staff housing would be provided only
at the Eastern Regional center. Training programs now given in seven local
centers would be assumed and expanded by the proposed new regional centers.
3.14      The overall need for future training has been projected on the
basis of a main target group of about 200,000 civil servants in 1982 and an
average course duration of 4 weeks. The central and regional institutes,
with an estimated enrollment capacity of about 1,250 /2 (or 15,000 p.a. on a
48-week average) could reach 8% of the main target group each year, compared
to about 4% at present (para. 2.29). Courses tentatively scheduled by
INTAN for 1982 would absorb about two thirds of the projected capacity. The
balance of the capacity could be used by other government departments such as
the Audit Department and the Ministry of Land and Regional Development.
3.15      The Government proposes to increase the number of teaching staff by
about 50%, to 150 full-time equivalent members, and to increase research and
evaluation staff by the same proportion to about 30 staff. The proposed
/1  Proposed locations:  Kemaman, Trengganu State (Eastern Region);

(Southern Region).
/2  Estimated on an 80% utlization rate for the 780 places in the fully
residential regional centers and a 50% utilization rate for the seating
capacity (1,250;) of the central facilities. A 50% utilization rate for
seats is reasonable in an institution where group sizes are variable.



- 25 -
staffing appears reasonable provided staff spend about half their time on
consultancy or extension work, attachment to other departments and on
research. These functions are currently not adequately performed
(para. 2.30). Under these circumstances, and with full utilization of
facilities, the effective student-teacher ratio would be about 20:1. A
substantial technical assistance program (fellowships and expert assistance)
is included in the proposed project to (a) expand the staff and increase its
academic standard; and (b) develop curricula in priority courses.
3.16      Acceptable draft terms of reference for technical experts and a
fellowship program showing priority areas for faculty development have been
prepared. During negotiations the Government provided assurances that
staff who have satisfactorily completed one year or more of training abroad
would be retained by INTAN for a period of at least three years. The Bank
would be informed in the exceptional instances when individuals would not be
able to complete a three year period after return from training.
3.17      Long-Range Planning of Occupational Training./l  During negotiations
the Government agreed to develop a long-term plan for occupational training
during project implementation. The plan would formulate recommendations
inter alia on: (a) the appropriate occupational training options for Grade 9
graduates; (b) the appropriate long-term role of vocational and technical
schools; (c) ways to develop and provide rural nonfarm skills training for
young adults; (d) ways to expand and improve women's training; and (e) the
appropriate dimension and type of industrial training institutes over the
next decade.
Technical Assistance and Studies
3.18      Technical assistance would be provided as follows:

Technical assistance for MESTI and INTAN would focus on the development of
staff and teaching programs for staff. Fellowships at INTAN and MESTI would
primarily be used for degree programs. In addition, uncommited technical

assistance funds (US$0.4 million) would be included in the proposed project
preparation of future projects in the education sector. During negotiations
the Government confirmed that the scope and detail of evaluation of earlier
Bank-financed projects would be acceptable to the Bank.

ard sketch plans for lower secondary schools; (b) schedules of accommodation
for other institutions; and (c) December 1978 unit prices, derived from a
cost analysis of comparable institutions constructed recently. The following
unit construction costs were used:

- 28 -
The costs in Peninsular Malaysia are reasonable and compare well with con-
struction costs in other Asian countries. Building costs are higher in
Sabah/Sarawak because of:  (a) costly transportation of practically all
building materials, (b) high labor costs, (c) the need for extensive site
works because of generally underdeveloped infrastructure, and (d) less
competition in bidding. Building costs for MESTI and INTAN are derived from
costs for university level buildings and are, therefore, substantially higher
than costs for the secondary schools.
4.03      Furniture costs are estimated as percentages of construction costs
(10%) and equipment costs are derived from master equipment lists which were
reviewed during negotiations and found appropriate in scope and cost.
Technical assistance costs (about 3% of project total) are estimated at an
average of US$65,000 per man-year of specialist services for foreign and
local experts, and US$13,500 per man-year of felLowship training. Since
about 30% of the secondary school places would be located in the sparsely
populated rural areas of Sabah/ Sarawak, approximately one fourth of total
project costs would be allocated for boarding facilities and 14% for staff
housing (para. 3.07). The fees for professional services (4% to 15%) have
been estimated on the basis of: (a) experience from earlier Bank-financed
projects; and (b) the scope of proposed services in comparison with applicable
fee scales of Malaysian architects.
4.04      Areas and Costs per Place.  The following table shows unit areas
and costs for the lower secondary schools in Pen:insular Malaysia, net

The area per boarding student conforms with Government standards, areas
constructed under the First Education Project (Loan 599-MA) and are reasonable.
4.05      Contingency Allowances.  An average of 11.5% has been added to the
base costs of the project for unforeseen events. This physical contingency
allowance ranges from 5% for technical assistance through 10% for construc-
tion, furniture, equipment and professional services, to 20% for site works.



- 29 -
The comparatively large contingency allowance for site works is required
because of uncertainties about site conditions at most of the sites, such as
availability of water and power and load bearing capacity of the soil. The
price contingency allowance of US$25.5 million is based on the implementation
schedule agreed between the Borrower and the Bank (Annex 3) and the following
annual escalation rates:

Equipment & technical assistance        6.5       6.0      6.0       6.0
4.06      Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component has
been estimated as follows: (a) civil works 25%; (b) furniture 20%; (c)
equipment 85%; (d) professional services 10%; (e) fellowships 90%; and (f)
specialist services 66%. These percentages are based on a detailed analysis
during appraisal and have been derived by: (a) determining the costs of
civil works and furniture attributable to material, labor, overhead and
profit; (b) analyzing awards for equipment made under earlier loans; and (c)
estimating the number of foreign specialists. Including contingencies, the
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$38.0 million, or about 31% of
total project costs.
Financial Plan
4.07      The proposed Bank loan of US$38.0 million would finance 100% of the
foreign exchange component of the project. Local costs would be financed by
the Government. The distribution of project financing (including contingencies)
between agencies would be in accordance with the following table:

Retroactive financing of US$0.5 million would be recommended to cover 100% of
the cost of consultancy services incurred prior to loan signing.
4.08      Recurrent Costs.  The incremental recurrent expenditure generated
by this project would amount to about M$30 million p.a. (1978 prices). These
increments represent less than 2% of the budgeted government expenditure on
education for 1978. The additional expenditures could be accommodated in
projected budget increases without undue difficulity.
Project Implementation and Disbursements
4.09      Administration.  The first three Bank-fiLnanced education projects in
Malaysia (Loans 599-MA, 810-MA and 974-MA) suffered implementation delays of
about 2.5 years. The completion mission of Loan 599-MA concluded that the
complexity of that project, together with inadequate authority and staffing
of its executing agency, were major causes of implementation delays. The
issues of complexity, authority and staff shortages were specifically addressed
during appraisal of the Fourth Education Project (Loan 1329-MA): implementa-
tion organizations were created within relevant line agencies and provisions
were made for staff increases in the project unit and in the PWD at federal
and state levels. The Government has become increasingly aware of the effects
of implementation delays and the Project Unit within the Ministry of Education
(which remained understaffed until 1977) has during the past 18 months been
supplied with all the staff positions required under earlier project agree-
ments. The authority of the MOE Project Director was also increased in early
1978 through upgrading the Director's post and liaison with the Equipment
Supply Division of the Ministry of Education was improved during 1978 through
the designation of three officers to be in charge of procurement of Bank
financed equipment. Further streamlining and improvement of the PIU is



- 31 -
in progress; two educators were appointed during the past six months and two
technical posts (building engineer, quantity surveyor) were created immed-
iately prior to negotiations. These technical staff will be shared with the
division in charge of implementing locally financed development projects.
During negotiations the Government assured the Bank that it would maintain
current staffing and authority of the Project Unit throughout project imple-
mentation. The Bank recommends that the posts of an assistant project
director and two accounting officers be added to present staffing.
4.10      Administration arrangements of the INTAN component would be as
follows: (a) the INTAN director (or deputy director) would assume overall
implementation responsibility on a part-time basis; (b) a position of a
full-time assistant project director has been created; (c) a full-time
procurement officer would be designated; (d) a full-time project architect
would be appointed for at least one year during the sketch plan phase; and
(e) a resident engineer would be appointed on a full-time basis during the
construction period. During negotiations, the Government assured the Bank
that staff identified in (a)-(c) above would be appointed by June 1979 and
retained throughout project implementation; and staff (d) and (e) retained as
indicated.
4.11      The occupational training plan, evaluation of this project and
earlier education projects and project preparation work would be carried out
by the Government during project implementation. The Prime Ministers Depart-
ment will be responsible for assigning this study to an appropriate agency.
4.12      Physical Design Services.  The Public Works Department (PWD) has
been responsible for survey, design, tendering and supervision of the bulk of
earlier Bank financed education projects. Staff shortages in the PWD have
been a common cause of delays in earlier projects. To avoid repetition of
this problem, the Government has selected suitable local consultants for
survey, design and supervision of the secondary schools in Sabah and for
MESTI and INTAN. PWD capacity is adequate for the remaining physical design
services under the project, namely (a) tendering and supervision of MOE items
in Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia; and (b) sketch plan preparations in
Peninsular Malaysia. Existing PWD designs of standardized secondary school
components would be used to the extent feasible. Architectural sketch and
site plans for secondary schools in the first year construction program are
expected to be completed by June 1979. During negotiations the Government
gave assurances that: (a) the necessary consultant architects and engineers
for the second and third year construction programs would be employed at
least six months before the scheduled start of construction, and; (b) PWD
staff would be assigned to the project on a priority basis to permit completion
of designs in accordance with the implementation schedule (Annex 3). In



- 32 -
view of adequate capabilities within the Government to review architectural
designs, Bank review would not be needed in most cases. Bank review of
sketch plans would be limited to: (a) those for MESTI and INTAN; and (b)
secondary schools where areas to be provided differ by more than 15% from
those agreed to with the Government during appraisal. In all other instances
the Government would confirm to the Bank, without submitting designs, that
the designs conform with agreed schedules of accommodations and construction
standards. School maps, sketch and site plans for secondary schools would be
kept on file in the MOE project unit and would be available for inspection by
Bank review missions.
4.13      Sites.  Over 80% of the project sites have been identified.
Suitable sites have been acquired for about 35% of the secondary schools,
MESTI (where an existing building would be converted for MESTI's use and
necessary additions constructed) and INTAN. Suitable locations have been
tentatively identified for the balance of the project institutions. The
government's criteria for selection of the remaining sites have been reviewed
and found acceptable. Site acquisition problems typical of earlier projects
are, therefore, not expected to be repeated. Survey of one third of the
secondary school sites (first year construction program) is in progress and
scheduled for completion by April 1979. During negotiations the Government
agreed to acquire sites for the second and third year construction programs
at least nine months before scheduled start of construction.
4.14      Maintenance.  Earlier Bank-financed school facilities have, with
few exceptions, been reasonably well maintained. The Government provides
adequate budget for acceptable annual maintenance.
4.15      Procurement.  Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment
would be grouped to the maximum extent possible and awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines,
except as follows:
(a) civil works contracts (total value about US$30.0 million) costing
less than US$1.0 million each, which mostly would be for schools in
scattered locations that are unlikely to interest international
companies, could be awarded on the basis of locally advertised
bidding in which foreign firms would be allowed to participate;
(b) furniture and equipment bid packages estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 equivalent each, which are not expected to interest foreign
suppliers because of the variety of the contents of each contract;
(c)  sundry items not exceeding US$10,000 in each contract and aggre-
gating a maximum of US$250,000 equivalent which could be purchased
on the basis of a minimum of three quotations or on the basis of
Treasury contracts for bulk procurement; and



- 33 -
(d) books which would be purchased in accordance with normal Government
procedures.
Bid packaging would be reviewed by the Bank prior to bid invitation. In bid
comparison of equipment procured through international competitive bidding,
domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%, or the
existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. prices of compet-
ing imports. Contracts for items procured under (a) and (b) above could be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with Government procurement practices which are acceptable to the Bank.
Foreign bidders would be allowed to participate. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances to waive existing preferences to local con-
tractors in bidding, evaluation and award of civil works contracts under the
proposed project.
4.16      Disbursements.  The proposed loan would be disbursed for a period
of 5-1/2 years as shown in Table 4.7. Disbursements would be made for:
(a) 25% of the expenditures on civil works and furniture;
(b) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported
equipment, vehicles, books and educational materials;
(c) 100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured items;
(d) 70% of the cost of locally procured items; and
(e) 100% of the cost of technical assistance, fellowships and
professional services.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30, 1985. The estimated
disbursement schedule is given in Table 4.7.
4.17      Implementation Period.  Start of construction of the secondary
schools would be phased over a period of about three years. The proposed
project would be fully implemented in about 5-1/2 years from the estimated
date of effectiveness, but construction and procurement of the bulk of
project furniture and equipment should be completed for the Ministry of
Education project items in about 4-1/2 years, and for INTAN in about 3-1/2
years. Preparations for implementation are in an advanced stage and designs
for the first year MOE and INTAN construction programs are expected to be
finalized in March 1979. The first tendering is scheduled for July 1979.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01       Benefits.  The proposed prbject would reduce disparities in oppor-
tunities for secondary education. In 1977 there were 22 districts more than
20% below the national average, in opportunities for secondary education. After
completion of the proposed project there would be only five such districts.
The improvement in educational opportunities that would occur in the least
developed districts is reflected in the shapes of the frequency distribution
curves for enrollment indices as shown by the following chart:

The impact of the project is further visualized in Map #3 (A13727) and
quantified in terms of an equity indicator (Gini coefficient, para. 2.23)
which would improve by 35% (from 0.114 to 0.074). In human terms about
46,500 additional children age 12-15, essentially from rural disadvantaged
areas, would be accommodated in secondary schools.. Since the incidence of
poverty is greatest among children currently not enrolled, the children who
benefit would tend to come from low income families. Benefits would be about
equally distributed between the sexes.
5.02      The methods used in developing the proposed project have for the
first time in Malaysia demonstrated the value of surveying educational needs
at a low level of data aggregation (such as district rather than state,
para. 2.22). These techniques are highly applicable also for determining the
location of schools in the future. The proposed project can thus be expected
to make a contribution to improve planning procedures in the MOE. The pro-
posed project is also expected to reduce costs by introducing more economic
space standards than presently used for practical facilities in secondary
schools. During appraisal agreement was reached on the development of a new
type of standard workshop that could be built at 30% less than present cost
(para. 2.15).
5.03      In addition, the proposed project would contribute to improved
management, planning and implementation efficiency within federal and state
governments through expanded management training.  Managerial problems have
been cited as a contributory cause of poor implementation efficiency in
Bank Group completion reports, and managerial training suggested as a remedy.
The training capacity of INTAN would be increased from about 6,000 civil
servants p.a. to 15,000 p.a. and MESTI would be established with an annual
capacity of 4,000. Each year about 7% of all administrative staff (central
office and key field staff) could be reached by training programs or seminars
averaging four weeks. Present training programs can reach only 4% of the
relevant target groups and do not serve the MOE. The expanded programs at
INTAN and the courses to be established at MESTI would:  (a) improve mana-
gerial and administrative skills; (b) improve unde!rstanding among civil
servants of their specific roles in relation to gcovernment objectives and
plans; (c) intensify the exchange of ideas between the various groups of
personnel (different levels, and central and field.) that participate in the
developm,ent process; and (d) strengthen professional support to field staff.
School leadership, professional support to school staff and communication
within the system have in recent research projects been highlighted as
essential factors in the success of development efforts within education.
5.04      The proposed project would also promote the development of the
Malaysian education system by supporting long-range planning and studies
related to occupational training.
5.05      Risks.  There is a risk that the secondary school component may
accentuate pressures for further education, pressures which are hard to
resist since schools can sometimes be operated on double shifts to provide
both lower and upper secondary places. The project seeks to counteract this
risk by supporting planning work and studies related to occupational training,
inter alia, for graduates of lower secondary schools.



- 37 -
5.06      There is also a risk that the civil service staff training insti-
tutes (MESTI and INTAN) will attempt to provide too broad a spectrum of
courses instead of developing a m,re limited number of courses focussed on
priority areas. The monopoly position of these institutions makes it diffi-
cult for them to resist ad hoc requests for training from various government
departments.  This would tend to distract their attention from priority
tasks. The Advisory Council appointed by the Cabinet (para. 2.28) should
help set priorities.
5.07      Despite these risks, which will be kept under review during
project implementation, the project is justified by its expected contri-
butions toward: (a) more equal distribution of educational opportunities;
(b) improved implementation efficiency through expanded public administration
training; and (c) long-term planning of occupational training in Malaysia.
6.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations the Government and the Bank agreed on:
(a) criteria for allocations of secondary schools (para. 3.06); (b) schedules
for hiring consultants (para. 4.12); (c) site acquisition schedules (para.
4.13); and (d) an overall project timetable (para. 4.12).
6.02      During negotiations the Government provided assurances on:
(a) timely submission of MESTI's teaching plans (para. 3.11); (b) INTAN's
retention of staff (para. 3.16); (c) preparation of occupational training
plan (para. 3.17); (d) evaluation of earlier education projects (para. 3.18);
staffing and authority of project organizations (paras. 4.09-4.10); and
(e) waiver for local bid preferences (para. 4.15).
6.03      Subject to above conditions, the proposed project would constitute
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$38.0 million equivalent to the Govern-
ment of Malaysia for a term of 17 years, including a 4 year grace period.
