livestock owners in Southern\n            Kordofan to improve their standard of living.  To achieve\n            this, the project comprises (i) improved agricultural\n            services by strengthening selected agricultural institutions\n            in the project area; (ii) increased availability of farm\n            inputs; (iii) improved water supply and road infrastructure;\n            and (iv) improved crop production technology.  Cost recovery\n            systems would be established for appropriate services and\n            inputs, and measures would be taken to enhance environmental protection."}, "docdt": "1987-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
