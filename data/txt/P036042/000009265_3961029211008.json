"The ultimate objective of the Bank\n            System Modernization Project is to assist in the development\n            of a modern banking sector able to service the needs of a\n            growing economy, thereby increasing confidence in the\n            Vietnamese banking system. The immediate objectives of the\n            project are to: 1) improve payment services in the economy\n            in order to reduce float, speed up circulation of funds and\n            increase efficiency of funds transmission, while providing\n            convenience and service to users; and 2) strengthen the\n            institutional capabilities of participating banks in order\n            to stimulate commercial bank initiatives to improve internal\n            management and customer service. The project consists of\n            four components: 1) a national inter-bank payment clearing\n            and settlement system; 2) commercial banks' intra-bank\n            payment systems; 3) commercial banks' institutional\n            strengthening; and 4) project management support."}, "docdt": "1995-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
