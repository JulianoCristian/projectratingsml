The lessons learned indicate that overall\n            strong support and ownership from the Borrower during\n            project preparation and implementation contributed to the\n            successful completion of the project. A strong,\n            knowledgeable and well-staffed Project Management Unit (PMU)\n            was required to deal with the complex procurement processes\n            and to meet the demands from participating commercial banks\n            and the World Bank. Legal and regulatory changes have to go\n            hand-in-hand with the introduction of a new banking system\n            so that they can provide timely and consistent legal support\n            and build a legal environment basis for the new banking\n            system to operate effectively. Close supervision by the\n            Bank's task manager ensured that the project's\n            implementation schedule was on track. Clear operational\n            guidelines within the Bank are needed to avoid adverse\n            effects on the supervision and implementation of the project\n            in the client country, particularly when the Bank has to\n            resolve disputes arising from the implementation of its\n            guidelines. Capacity building and institutional development\n            activities that effectively address critical needs of an\n            economy in transition in general and of the banking sector\n            in particular can be sustained with ease beyond the life of\n            the project. Clearer procurement procedures and guidelines\n            help to better address complaints in the procurement\n            process. The need to focus on manpower training will be\n            critical for the successful implementation of these\n            projects. Technical systems such as the IBPS and intrabank\n            payment system require a back-up system. Physical security\n            and integrity of the IBPS and CBPS systems need to be\n            considered as the highest priority to protect the systems.\n            Clear definitions and guidelines regarding verification and\n            acceptance of deliverables as well as billing and payment\n            procedures should be established up front to avoid long\n            payment delays to suppliers and consultants."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
