proposed project would develop\n            coffee production through: (a) rehabilitating and developing\n            Ngoli and Kateshi coffee estates to 450 ha producing, at\n            full development, about 800 tons of clean coffee plus about\n            2,000 tons of maize; (b) rehabilitating and developing\n            smallholder coffee production in the Northern and\n            Northwestern Provinces and (c) strengthening the national\n            coffee research institutions. The project would save for the\n            country about US$2.2 million per annum in coffee import\n            substitution and earn about US$0.2 million per annum in\n            maize exports. It would provide annual employment for about\n            960 persons."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
