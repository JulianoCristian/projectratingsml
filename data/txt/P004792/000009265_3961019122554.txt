IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF THILAND
THIRD HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
(Ln. 3220-TH)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Highway Sector Project
(Ln. 3220-TH) to the Kingdom of Thailand in the amount of US$ 50.0 million equivalent which was
approved on June 7, 1990 and made effective on September 11, 1990.
The loan was closed on the original closing date of December 31, 1994. Final disbursement
took place on February 15, 1995, at which time the balance of US$ 872,694.71 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Ephrem Asebe, Consultant, EAIIN, Infrastructure Operations
Division of the East Asia & Pacific Region, Country Department I and reviewed by Vineet Nayyar,
Infrastructure Division Chief and Mr. Mohammad Farahandi, Acting Projects Adviser. The borrower
provided comments that are included as appendixes to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was initiated during the Bank's last project supervision mission in
November 1994. A separate ICR mission was undertaken in February 1995 to obtain Government
views and to assist the Borrower in the preparation of its own contribution to the report. It is based on
material in the project file. The Borrower further contributed to the preparation of the ICR by
providing views reflected in the mission's aide-memoire and providing a separate evaluation, which is
attached as Appendix B.

KINGDOM OF THAILAND
THIRD HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
(Ln. 3320-TH)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.    The Third Highway Sector Project (Ln. 3220-TH) was the 12th in a series of projects to assist
the highway sector, beginning with the National Highway Project (Ln. 341-TH) in 1963. In 1988,
because of the level of maturity reached by the Department of Highways (DOH), the Bank shifted to a
sector format of which the project under review is the third in a series which now numbers four. Up to
and including the Third Highway Sector Project, the Bank had lent a total of US$ 549.6 million to the
highway sub-sector in Thailand.. The project also represents the Bank's third and final financial
participation in the Government's 1987-1991 Sixth Five-Year Road Program, comprising an
investment of US$ 1,478.5 million financed by the Government, the Japanese Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and IBRD.
ii.    Past highway projects have often been implemented within budget and ahead of schedule by
the DOH, which is considered to be a mature institution. The Project Completion Report (No. 13768)
covering both the Highway Sector Project (Ln. 2984-TH) and the Second Highway Sector Project
(Ln. 3008-TH) showed higher economic rates of retums for the sub-projects than at appraisal despite
some initial delays and cost overruns experienced in implementation, mainly due to the economic boom
and heavy demands on the construction industry, which required rebidding of some contracts.
Project Objectives:
iii.   The main objectives of the Third Highway Sector Project (together with the Highway Sector
Project (Ln. 2984-TH) and the Second Highway Sector Project (Ln. 3008-TH) were to assist the
Government in further improving the overall efficiency of the highway sector and were aimed at: a)
improving the quality of interurban roads (by focusing on maintenance and rehabilitation); b) relieving
congestion (by improving capacity); (c) improving road traffic safety; d) reducing environmental
pollution from vehicle emissions and traffic noise; and e) improving policies on road transport and road
use.
iv.    The Bank financed a total of US$ 187 million under the first three highway sector projects out
of DOH's US$ 1,478.5 million Sixth Five Year Development Program. The Third Highway Sector
loan amounted to US$ 50.00 rnillion of which US$ 38.1 million was allocated for civil works
(rehabilitation/improvement of interurban roads and bridges); US$ 3.5 for equipment (to reduce air and
noise pollution) and US$ 8.0 million for consulting services and training.
v.    The Bank sought and reached agreement on: a) the level and composition of DOHTs 1987-
1991 Sixth Five Year Highway Development Program; b) the financing plan; c) the annual review of



lii
the program implementation; d) the priority of maintenance and rehabilitation over new road
construction during periods of resources constraints; e) the economic and technical criteria for the road
works; and f) the preparation of Action Plans for traffic safety, vehicular emission and noise pollution
and road transport industry efficiency by December 30, 1990. All of the aforementioned covenants
were relevant to maximizing benefits, and were complied with.
vi.    Thailand's rapid economic growth (averaging 12% per annum between 1987 and 1991)
combined with an average traffic growth on the order of 17% p.a in the late 1980's, and a vehicle fleet
growing at about 14% p.a., continued to place severe and increased strains on the country's transport
system. The Government's Plan for dealing with these complex issues was appropriate, and the Bank's
support timely. The project's civil works component were within the competency of the DOI-, were
realistically appraised, and presented no special problems. All the objectives were clearly formulated,
were designed to build on past achievements, and were properly phased for follow-on. The scope of
the Action Plans was realistic and they have established objectives and a program of action which has
enjoyed continued Government support under the Se HPlan (1992-96), which has continued to
focus on the implementation of the objectives established under the Action Plans with support under
the Bank's Fourth Highway Sector Project (Ln. 3446-TH).
Implementation Experience and Results.
vii.   The Project achieved all of its major objectives and is likely to achieve substantial development
results without major difficulties given the Government's commitment through follow-on projects. All
the road sections that DOH had selected for financing under the Project were successfully
implemented, generally before the stipulated dates and within the contract prices. They included 15
rehabilitation sub-projects, totaling 469.76 km, with an initial contract price totaling about US $67.2
million, and requiring loan funds of US$ 33.6 million. The ERR estimates for the sub-projects after
completion are higher than the minimum required Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 12%. With
respect to the Action Plans, most of the activities were completed. All the project covenants were met.
However, overall physical performance of DOH's Sixth Five-Year plan was only 70% completed and
the balance of the projects were carried over to the Seventh Plan. The main reasons for the relatively
lower performance were initial delays, high cost overruns due to sharp rises in construction costs, and
construction capacity constraints due to increasing private sector demands.
viii.   The Project is likely to be sustainable. Government's commitment, institutional capability, and
built-in incentives, supported by an outlook of continued sustained economic growth and budget
surplus provides a strong impetus to DOH's program. The Government is keenly aware that the
continued dynamic economic growth can be maintained only if the road sector, which handles 80% of
all freight ton-km and 90% of all passenger-km, does not become a bottleneck. As previously stated,
DOH is a mature institution capable of effectively planning and implementing a large scale investment
program, while the other primary implementing agencies, the Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MOTC) and the Land Transport Department (LTD), recognize their respective
current institutional weaknesses and are consequently augmenting their institutional capacity with
technical assistance partly financed under the Fourth Highway Sector Project (Ln. 3446-TH). The
Bank has maintained a dialogue on the project issues through its supervision and preparation of follow-
on projects. With regard to the urban environmental issues, it is clear that the Action Plan components



iv
have definite social impact considerations which in turn encourages Government to adopt policies
favorable to changes.
ix.    The key factors supporting sustainabiity are the same ones which made it possible to achieve
the initial project objectives: borrower commitment, institutional capabilities, built-in incentives, and
robust economic growth.
x.    The Bank's participation in helping to address road safety, air and noise pollution and road
transport efficiency issues through the Action Plans has had a catalytic impact and is favorably regarded
by the officials of the implementing agencies. The Bank fostered ownership of the program, starting
with the initial concept of the Action Plans, by recognizing the initiatives of the implementing agencies,
and by building support for the project through the participation of the relevant institutions in the Plans'
further development and implementation. With respect to DOH, the Bank recognized its relative
maturity and allowed DOH to select priority projects, and manage the overall program within the
parameters set in the Loan Agreement.
xi.    The DOH has performed most satisfactorily with respect to the implementation of the civil
works components of the project. Despite difficulties arising from the unanticipated high economic
growth (average planned GDP growth was 5% for 1987-91, while actual growth was 12%) the
Borrower continued to meet the loan covenants and achieved highly satisfactory results.  The
preparation of the Action Plans, while slower than anticipated, was also acceptable. It is clear,
however, that to improve on the results achieved to date, the Land Transport Department will require
additional institutional capacity as its current staffing levels are not adequate to deal with the emerging
complex issues that it will face in the future.  X
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Lessons Learned
xii.   Findings - Thailand's road transport development has entered a new phase towards the end of
the Sixth Highway Development Program. In the future, improving the quality of the existing road
network is equally as important as the physical growth of the network. The Bank's continued
involvement is playing a catalytic role in enhancing the quality and efficiency of the road transport
sector. The long term Bank and Government relations in the sector have produced a special
relationship which is mutually beneficial. While DOH has proved to be a viable institution capable of
implementing complex investment programs, this cannot be said of LTD, which has only recently been
a beneficiary of Bank financed project components.
xiii.   Future Project Operations and sustainability - The three Action Plans for the operational
phase of the project supporting its sustainability are: a) the follow-on program (Bank's Fourth Highway
Sector Project); b) the prioritizing of rehabilitation and, maintenance (DOH Seventh Highway
Program); and c) the use of sophisticated tools such as the Highway Design Model (HDMIH/LV) to
improve Thailand's Pavement Management System.
xiv.   Lessons for Future Projects in Thailand - The main lessons learned are that: a) the Bank
should have recognized that a more detailed appraisal of the project would have helped the Borrower
in the implementation of the project, particularly in view of the impact of the effect of rapid economic
growth on the project costs. At the same time, preparation of more detailed terms-of-reference for the



v
technical assistance components under the Action Plans would have helped to reduce the time required
between completion of the Action Plans and their implementation; b) the Bank should have recognized
the institutional weakness of the Land Transport Department and included specific technical assistance
in the project to assist in the institutional strengthening of the department as well as help in the
implementation of LTD managed components; and c) in Thailand, the impact of sustained economic
growth on the performance of the road transport system has resulted in negative externalities such as
problems of safety, noise and air pollution. Now that the country has built its basic road network and
the  investment strategy  shifts to include more complex socio-economic policies, a greater
understanding of the interrelationships between the macroeconomic environment and road transport
sector dynamics may be critical for future efficient aUlocation of resources in the transport sector.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF THAILAND
THIRD HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
(LN. 3320-TH)
PART I: IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
I     Background and Statement of Objectives - The history of the Bank's involvement in the
highway sector dates back to 1963 when the National Highway Project (Ln. 341-TH) was approved.
Up to the Third Highway Sector Project, a total of eleven loans amounting to US$ 549.6 million have
been for highway development. This project also represented the Bank's third and final financial
participation in the Government's 1987-1991 Road Development Plan, comprising an overall
investment of about US$ 1,478.5 million, financed partly by the Government, ADB, Overseas
Economic Cooperation Funds of Japan and the Bank. Thailand's transport system is multi-modal,
though road transport plays a predominant role - handling 80% of all freight ton-km and 90% of all
passenger-km. In 1990, the public road network consisted of approximately 189,414 kin, of which
52,451 km or 27.6% was under the responsibility of DOH. The average traffic volumes on roads in
the Central Region was nearly 8,000 vehicles per day. Despite large transport sector investments over
the last twenty years, Thailand's rapid economic development (averaging 12% p.a. between 1987 and
1991) continued to place severe and increasing strains on the country's transport system. With traffic
growth averaging 17% p.a. in the late 1980's and the vehicle fleet growing at about 14% p.a., the
reduction of congestion, vehicle emissions and air pollution, and increasing road safety and road
transport sector efficiency emerged as critical issues.
2.    Past highway projects had been successfully implemented by DOH, a mature institution, often
within budget and ahead of schedule. The project completion report (No. 13768 covering both the
Highway Sector Project (Ln. 2894-TH) and the Second Highway Sector (Ln. 3008-TH) produced
higher economic rates of returns for the sub-projects than at appraisal, despite some initial delays and
cost overruns experienced during implementation. These delays and cost overruns were mainly due to
the economic boom, which resulted in heavy demands on the construction industry.
3.    The main objectives of the Third Highway Sector Project were to assist the Government in
further improving the overall efficiency of the highway sector. Together with the Highway Sector
Project and the Second Highway Sector Project, the Third Highway Sector Project (Ln. 3220-TH),
was designed to support DOffs highway development plan for interurban (National and Provincial)
roads which aimed at: (a) improving the quality of interurban roads (by focusing on maintenance and
rehabilitation); (b) relieving congestion (by improving capacity); (c) improving road traffic safety; (d)



2
reducing environmental pollution from vehicle emissions and traffic noise; and (e) improving policies
on road transport and road use.
4.    The components designed to achieve the development objectives of the project were: (a)
specific sub-projects of DOH's road development plan selected annually on the basis of the procedures
and econornic criteria agreed upon under the loan 2894-TH; b) equipment, technical assistance, studies
and training to assist in the preparation of the three action plans to achieve (i) road traffic safety; (ii)
improving environmental conditions by reducing pollution caused by vehicular emissions and noise; and
(iii) improving the efficiency of road transport for freight and passengers. The Bank provided financing
equivalent to US$ 50.0 million, of which US$ 38.1 million was for civil works
(rehabilitation/improvement of interurban roads and bridges); US$ 3.5 was for equipment (reduction of
air and noise pollution); and US$ 8.0 million was for consulting services and training.
5.    Evaluation of Objectives - The Bank's support of the objectives of the Third Highway Sector
Project were a logical continuation of its earlier involvement in the sector with the First and Second
Iighway Sector Projects. The specific objectives of the Bank-financed components of the Third
Highway Sector Project were realistically drawn up and focused on the priority phase of the measures
necessary to achieve the objectives in the long run. The civil works component was clear, realistic, and
within the implementation capabilities of the Department of Highways. With respect to the Action
Plans, the Government had taken measures to improve road traffic safety under the First Highway
Sector Project (Ln. 2894-TH), and to improve the environment by reducing noise and vehicular
emissions pollution under the Second Highway Sector Project (Ln. 3008-TH). Preparation of the three
Action Plans represented the initial phase of comprehensively addressing these long term and complex
issues in Thailand's transport sector. The underlying concepts were relatively new, and the institutions
participating in drafting the Action Plans were many (National Safety Council, Office of the National
Environment Board, Department of Land Transport, Police Department, and the Ministry of Transport
and Communication). The principal implementing agency, the Land Transport Department (LTD), had
no extensive relations with the Bank prior to this project.
6.    In order to promote the overall objectives under the project, the Bank sought and reached
agreement on: a) the level and composition of DOH's 1987-1991 Sixth Five Year Highway
Development Program; b) the financing plan; c) an annual review of the program implementation; d)
the priority of maintenance and rehabilitation over new road construction during periods of resources
constraints; e) the economic and technical criteria for the road works; and f) the preparation of Action
Plans for traffic safety; vehicular emission and noise pollution, and road transport industry efficiency by
December 30, 1990. All the aforesaid covenants were relevant to maximize benefits and ensure
sustainability. To support the DOIHs Sixth Program, the Bank provided financing under the three
highway sector loans totaling US$ 187 million, or 6.2 percent, of the overall DOH Sixth Five Year
Highway Development program of US$ 3,084 million.



3
B. Achievement of Objectives
7.    The Third Highway Sector Project has substantially achieved both its overall sector and
specific objectives.
8.    Specific Objectives - The specific objectives of the project were for the most part achieved.
All of the 15 sub-projects identified by DOH, based on the economic and technical criteria agreed
upon, were successfully completed. Thirteen were completed ahead of the stipulated time in the
contract. The final cost of the 15 sub-projects was below the estimated cost. The economic rates of
return for 4 of the sub-projects were higher than estimated at appraisal, and the ERR for all other sub-
components was above the minimum 12% threshold set in the Loan Agreement. The fact that 11 of
the 15 sub-projects identified by DOH had ERRs below the estimate at appraisal, partially reflected
sharp cost increases resulting from the construction boom. The detailed engineering, including
environmental assessment of the Bangkok-Chonburi Road and the Bangkok Outer Ring Road was
financed under the project, while construction of these roads was financed by OECF. The preparation
of the Action Plans included under the project were completed by a committee chaired by LTD,
representing concerned agencies. Implementation of the Action Plan components dealing with road
safety and reducing environmental pollution were carried out as planned. However, for the Action
Plan dealing with road transport industry efficiency, the lack of clear terms-of-reference at appraisal
resulted in only a small beginning in this area. Implementation is continuing under the Fourth Highway
Sector Project, supported by the Bank.
9.    Sector Polices - The three highway sector projects focused on improving overall efficiency of
the highway sector through increased capacity and improved maintenance of the network under the
Sixth Development Program. In this sense, objectives relating to sector policies were substantially
achieved. The Program was initially based on the assumption that overall economic growth during the
1987-1991 period would average 5%. However, it turned out that the economy averaged about 12%
between 1987-91. The program was revised upward during the Second and Third Highway Sector
Projects from the initial US$ 998.6 million to US$ 1,316.8 mnillion and US$ 1,478.5 million,
respectively. DOH's development expenditure increases were due to the addition of new projects, and
to accomodate the sharp cost increases caused by the pressures on the construction industry. Actual
expenditures for the Sixth Development Program were estimated to be Baht 28,873.2 million (US$
1,354.2 million, a figure close to the medium forecast), and according to DOH, 70% of the physical
targets of the program were met. DOH's total final revised planned expenditure was Baht 77,100.1
million (US$ 3,084 million) compared to actual expenditures of Baht 74,1485 million (US$ 2,965.8
million).
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
10.   Specific Project - Unlike the first two highway sector projects, the Third Highway Sector
Project faced virtually no major problems in attaining its objectives, in spite of difficulties in attracting
sufficient bids for some contracts due to fact that the road construction industry was operating at full



4
capacity. Most of the sub-projects were executed within the contract price, either on or before the
estimated contract completion date. With respect to the Action Plans, there was an initial three month
delay in the submission of the individual Action Plans, although this delay did not affect their inclusion
into the Seventh Development Plan or their being financed under the Fourth Highway Sector.
11    DOH's Five-Year Program - Over the planned period, three factors affected the timely and
more efficient execution of DOH's Program. Firstly, the implementation of the Program started rather
slowly. This delay contributed to the carry over of DOH's program into the Seventh Development
Plan. Secondly, the economy was experiencing unprecedented and sustained high growth. The Sixth
Development Plan anticipated 5% annual growth rate, while the real GDP grew to be among the
highest in the world. between 1987 and 1993. The growth rate throughout the 1987-1991 period was
over 12% per annum, and since 1988, the budget has recorded a surplus for six consecutive years.
Throughout the same period, the structure of the economy changed, with the manufacturing sector
reaching 27% of GDP, the largest in ASEAN. These remarkable achievements in economic growth
and structural change created both opportunities and challenges for the infrastructure sector. The
anticipated budgetary constraints became non-binding. The high sustained economic growth created
rapid increases in the vehicle population and traffic growth, which aggravated infrastructure
bottlenecks, not only in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), but also in secondary cities, making
priority adjustments in the highway investment program a necessity. Particularly in BMR, the costs of
congestion, road traffic safety, and air pollution and vehicle emission emerged as serious problems.
Finally, in the early phase of DOH's program, the growth of private sector investments, which drove
the economic growth, heightened the demand for construction activities. There was high demand for
manpower, especially engineers, and there were few contractors available to bid on civil works
contracts. Accordingly, the costs of the sub-projects were substantially different than the engineers
estimates, as were the bid prices, which led in some cases to rebidding in order to be in compliance
with MOF requirements. Thus, initial implementation delays, higher-than-expected growth in traffic
demand, and high demand in the construction industry affected the timeliness of implementation of
DOI-Ts Five-Year Program.
D. Project Sustainability
12.   The sustainability of benefits arrived at under the civil works component of the Project is very
likely because of the Government's strong commitment to maintenance (see section H), the strength of
DOH's institutional capabilities, and the favorable macroeconomic environment and performance. The
Government is keenly aware that the continued dynamic economic growth enjoyed to-date can only be
maintained if the road sector, which handles 80% of all freight ton-km and 90% of all passenger-km,
does not become a bottleneck to the economy. The Project established Action Plans to improve traffic
saftey, reduce vehicle emissions and noise, and improve policies bearing on transport efficiency. While
some of these activities took place under earlier projects, they were for the first time institutionalized
under the Third Highway Sector Project, and continue to be implemented with strong support, both of
the Government and the Bank. Two of the five specific transport goals of the Government's current



5
development plan include the reduction of environmental damage resulting from traffic growth and
improving the structure and pricing (efficiency) of infrastructure, and the Bank's continued financial
support hinges on the dialogue and achievement of the targets set out in the Action Plans. One risk to
the continued institutionalization of this program of action is lack of institutional capacity in two of the
key implementing agencies, MOTC and LTD. However, both agencies recognize their respective
institutional weaknesses, and are augmenting their institutional capacity with technical assistance,
provided under the Bank's Fourth Highway Sector Project.  It has also become clear to the
Government that implementation of the Action Plans is required to alleviate the very negative social
impacts of increased road use, and public pressure provides strong incentives for the Government to
sustain these activities through a favorable policy environment.  Finally, Thailand's strong
macroeconomic performance not only aggravates traffic, but also provides the fiscal resources to
rectify the situation.
E. Bank Performance
13.   The officials of the implementing agencies were appreciative of the catalytic role the Bank's
recognition and support gave to the concept of the Action Plans. In particular, the Bank's participation
in the further development of the three Action Plans provided a much needed boost to promote their
familiarity among the agencies involved. One of the objectives of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1992-
96) for road transport is the further development of these Action Plans, and as such, the Government
has obtained a fiurther Bank loan under the Fourth Highway Sector Project for the ongoing
implementation of the Action Plans.
14.   The appraisal report was purposely abbreviated and focused on additions to the Sixth
Development Plan. However, in view of the initial delays in starting the program and the rapid cost
increases experienced during implementation, a more detailed appraisal would probably have been
beneficial to the borrower. The Bank recognized that DOlls program designated for 1987-91 would
require an additional two years to complete its targets. Accordingly, the completion date was
scheduled for December 31, 1993 and the closing date for December 31, 1994. At appraisal, the Bank
also accepted the government's position that the program was fixed regarding its total physical targets
(except where it is officially revised), but allowed for flexibility by a) adjusting annual targets in line
with changes in fiscal and economic conditions and b) adjusting the resources required to achieve the
targets.
15.   During supervision, the project's physical implementation was consistently rated satisfactory as
all the loan covenants were complied with. The quality of supervision was professional, objective and
had the respect of the implementing agencies. It was based on a solid understanding of the borrower's
institutional capabilities and the Bank's policies and procedures. An episode illustrates the type of
communication. Following the Bank's review of a design study financed under the project, the Bank
pointed out its shortcomings with respect to an environmental assessment issue.  In turn, these



6
concerns were addressed by DOH and new terms-of-reference were drawn up and further analysis was
carried out to complete the project.
F. Borrower Performance
16.   Feasibility studies for DOH's road program were generally done in house and the results
continue to be highly satisfactorily. Generally, about a third of the engineering is done by DOl, while
the remaining two-thirds is handled by consultants, mostly financed under the project. Detailed
engineering for the civil works financed under this project was carried out by DOH and under four
contracts carried out by consultants. These four contracts were signed in October 1990 for a total of
Baht 159.2 million (about US$ 6.26 million) and were satisfactorily completed in early 1992. The
preparation of the first phase of a comprehensive medium to long term Action Plan to improve traffic
safety, reduce vehicular air and noise pollution and to improve the road transport industry efficiency
was satisfactorily completed by a committee made up of representatives from the relevant agencies,
chaired by the Director General of the Land Transport Department (LTD).
17.   The project provided US$ 4.8 million for DOH's program to eliminate "black spots", begun
under the First Highway Sector Project. Implementation was satisfactory. Also the project provided
for 40 portable traffic counters, two sets of weights-in-motion equipment as well as four vehicles used
in the operation of the vehicle weighing program. Procurement of this equipment by DOH was carried
out in a satisfactory and expedient manner. Procurement of a second lot of equipment for LTD's
program to reduce air and noise pollution and improve traffic safety, however, had to be deferred as a
result of LTD's unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures. The amount of the loan canceled at
loan closing related entirely to the LTD equipment procurement. As a result of the extensive delays in
procurement, specifications had to be revised and it was determined that the equipment could be more
efficiently procured in combination with other similar equipment being procured under the ongoing
Fourth Highway Sector Project.
18.   The main implementing agency, DOH, had a record of highly satisfactory perfornance under
Bank financed projects, and this satisfactory performance continued under the Third Highway Sector
Project. The civil works components were all completed satisfactorily, either on or ahead of schedule.
Compliance with loan covenants was also highly satisfactory. The Loans Control Division, under the
Deputy Director General for Engineering, DOH, has developed an efficient system to monitor and
coordinate the execution of projects. With respect to the preparation and implementation of the Action
Plans, there were some delays in coordinating with all the agencies involved in their preparation. As a
result, more of their implementation than planned spilled over into the Fourth Highway Sector Project
which included a coordinating consultant to assist the implementing and maintain the focus intended.
The Action Plans were prepared in house rather than by a consultant, as originally planned, and this
contributed to the initial delays which were experienced. The overall result was, however, satisfactory.

G. Assessment of Outcome:
19.   The project has achieved all of its major objectives and is likely to achieve the forecast
development results, without major shortcomings. Its outcome can be judged as satisfactory. All of
the sub-projects executed under the civil work components were completed as planned on or before
the contract completion dates. The ERRs were all higher than the minimum rate of 12%. The Action
Plans prepared under the project, have been incorporated into the Seventh Highway Plan, further
assuring sustainability of the institutional objectives of the project.
20.   The overall physical outcome of DOH's Sixth Development was assessed at 70%. This is
satisfactory, especially when one observes that the Sixth Plan underestimated the rate of GDP growth
by more than 40%. The Sixth Plan, therefore, did not envision the shortages of materials, sharply rising
construction costs, nor the eventual need to rebid some of the contracts.
H. Future Operation
21.   To assure sustainability and the improvement of the quality and efficiency of road transport,
DOH will continue to use the Thailand-Pavement Management (TPM) System. TPM was first
introduced in 1984, and has been continually refined since then. DOH is further embarking on a course
to improve the TPM by incorporating into it elements of the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
Model (HDM IV). The TPM has so far proven useful in determining the economically optimal
allocation of available maintenance funds among road links on the basis of alternative maintenance
strategies.
22.   A survey carried out in 1990 showed that 66% of DOH's network length had a roughness of
less than 4 IRI (indicating good condition), while only 5% had an IRI above 6 (fair). According to a
1993 survey of all of DOH's paved roads (44,495 km), 62% was considered good, 20% fair and 18%
poor. By 1996, DOH expects to be allocated about US$ 8,000 per km for maintenance; up from US$
4,000 in 1992. The quality of the road network is, therefore, expected to show further improvement.
23.   The Government in its Seventh Plan, continues to build on the Sixth Development Plan
objectives, to achieve maximum utilization of existing infrastructure capacity, while at the same time
undertaking capacity-increasing investments to reduce transport bottlenecks that inhibit economic
growth.
24.   Finally, the Bank is expected to continue its support of the Seventh Plan and beyond, to assure
that the strategies initiated under the three Action Plans during the Third Highway Sector Project will
reach their goals, and to demonstrate its commitment for sustaining the quality and improvement of the
road system. Under these future operational conditions, the proportion of good quality roads, i.e.
roads with an IRI less than 4, would increase, and targets set for emission control and road safety
would be met.

I. Key Lessons Learned
25.   While the project was completed satisfactorily, there are lessons to be learned as described
below:
(i) The Bank should have recognized that a more detailed appraisal of the project would have
helped the Borrower in the implementation of the project, particularly in view of the impact of the
effect of the rapid economic growth on the project costs. At the same time, preparation of more
detailed terms-of-reference for the technical assistance components under the Action Plans would have
helped to reduce the time required between completion of the Action Plans and their implementation.
(ii) The Bank should have recognized the institutional weakness of the Land Transport
Department and included specific technical assistance in the project to assist in the institutional
strengthening of the department as well as help in the implementation of LTD managed components.
This TA is in place, financed under the Fourth Highway Sector Project.
(iii) In Thailand, the impact of sustained macroeconomic performance on the road transport
sector performance has resulted in negative externalities such as problems of safety, noise and air
pollution and reduced road transport efficiency. Now that the country has built its basic road network
and the investment strategy shifts to include more complex socio-economic policies, a greater
understanding of the inter-relationships between the macroeconomic environment and road transport
sector dynamics may be critical for future efficient allocation of resources in the transport sector.

THE KINGr .iM OF THAILAND
THIRD HIGHWAY SECI OR PROJECT (LOAN 3220-TH)
AIDE MEMOIRE
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR) MISSION
The Third Highway Sector Project was thae last in a series of three highway loans the Bank made in
support of the Government's Sixth Five-Year Development Plan. The loan was approved by the Board on
06/07/90 and declared effective on 10/11/90. The loan closed as originally planied on 12/31/94.
A World Bank lmplementation Completion Report (ICR) mission visited Thailand from 20 to 24
February, 1995, to solicit the views of the government and implementing agencies; to provide advice and
support to the government's effort to make its own contribution to the ICR; and to collect additional data for
the preparation of the ICC. The action taken and issues raised during the mission are summarized below.
The mission is grateful for the cooperation extended to it by officials of MOTC, DOH and LTD.
During the mission, the objectives of the newly introduced ICR requirements were explained to a
team designated by the Government to undertake the task of organizing and overseeing the preparation of
the ICR. The mission solicit the views of the government's representatives and those responsible for the
follow up of the implementation of the project. The mission has had opportunity to see A.Tak Fa - A.Tha
rako (Route 1145). The road was in very good condition.
The missioin encouraged the team to focus on: a) assessment of the project objectives, design,
imiplemiientation and operation experience; b) re-evaluation of the ERR of the sub-projects on the basis of
the miethiod used at appraisal; c) evaluation of the Governmenit's and the Bank's perforimanice during the
imiplemiientation phase of the project with the objective of drawing appropriate lessons fromii the
imiplemiientationl and operation experiences. The team appreciated the guidance offered by the missionl in
preparing the ICR.
The lmplementationi of the civil work components of the project were completed withini the
enginieerinlg cost estimates and the estimated time frame. However, the overall physical completioni of the
Sixth Highway Developmenlt Plan was about 70%. This was attributed to increase in construction prices,
material shortage and lack of adequate construction capacity experienced because of the boominlg economilic
growth.
The four contracts sigiled for detailed enginieering studies were satisfactorily executed. The detail
engineering studies of outer Bangkok Ring Road (62 kni), and Bangkok - Choniburi (83 krn) and thc
supplemental studies requested by the Bank on environmental impact assessment and resettlement issues
were completed.
The civil work component of the project is most likely to be sustainable. However, measures to
control axle-loads and adequate fund for road maintenance will be essential to assure sustainability. Furtiler,
the ongoing study to upgrade the existing Thailand pavement managenient system with HDM III/IV is also
likely to enhance sustainability. The mission agree that the data requirements and output of HDM for



30                              Appendix  A
maintenance scheduling and expenditure to be adequate parameters for subsequent monitoring and future
impact analysis.
Beside a civil work component, the Third Highway Sector Project loan had also the drafting of
three action plans to: improve road transport efficiency; reduce vehicular emission and noise pollution; and
improve road traffic safety.
These action plans were completed, after initial delays. The procurement of equipment for analysis
of traffic was completed in 1993. However, the procurement of equipment for testing vehicle safety and
emission pollution was not finaniced as planned from this loan.
The action plans provided the basis for subsequent dialogue on the future development issues in the
higilway sector. The concepts were later incorporated in the Fourth and Fifth Highway Sector Project loans.
The Government values the Bank's support in addressing the issues facing the country, particularly
congestion, safety, pollution and road transport efficiency. The Government acknowledged that the
participation of the Bank has played a catalytic role in facing these issues with foresight.
DOH was reassessing the Economiiic Rates of Return for Bank financed roads at the time of the
mission and expected to complete the analysis before March 15, 1995. As the actual traffic growth was
generally higher thani the planned figures, the ERR is expected to be higher than at appraisal.
The overall assessmenit of the project is highily satisfactory. During the missioni it was agreed that
the Department of lligihway will officially submit thc Governimienit's ICR on or before March 15, 1995. The
Bank missioni office in Bangkok has also agreed to follow up on the timely delivery of the Governmeit's
Implemenitation Completion Report.

THIRD HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT(LOAN IBRD 3220-TH)
1.  je scripMan
The nmain objective of the third highway sector project was to assist the
Deparment of highways(DOH) in further improving the overall efficiency of the
highway sector. The project would support DOI-'s highway development plan for nationl
highway with aimed at
(a) improving the quality of interurban roads (by focussing on maintenance and
rchabilication);
(b) relieving congestion (by improving capacity);
(c) improving road traffic safety;
(d) reducing environmenral pollutioni from vehicle emissions and Lraffic noise;
and
(e) improving policies on road transport and road use.
The project consists of following parts
Part A: Rehabilitation , strengthening, improvement and paving of
national highway.
Pai.3: lrnprovemenlts in road traffic safery, air and noise pollution
control and road transport industry efficiency.
T'he Third Highway Sector Project, Loan No. 3220 - TH for US $ 50.00 million,
was signed on July 13, 1990 . The loan became effective on July 13, 1990. The loan
closing date was December 31, 1994.

2. Py_oj.e,t Implementation ( for. Civil Woks)
The DOH selected IS sections of national highways is shown in Table 1,
totalling about 470 KM, to be constructed and improved under this project. These
highway sections included in the Five Year Highway Development Plan. The
supervision of construction of individual highway project was the direct responsibility of
the DOH Resident Engineer and hiis staff under the overall direction of the Project
Dircctor and other Department pnncipals The ConsUltant provided siaff and services
for the overall coordination and general sLupervision of the project activities.
Overall highlway construction and improvement was exectued relatively
well. The last section of highway construction and improvement was completced in
April 1994.

3. ?wiec.t Costs
Table 3 shows a comparison between the costs envisaged at bank's
estimate and the actual project expenditure.
4. Economic Rt. exAduation
The economic evaluation of each project road was carried out for each
roacl by comparing the costs of constructing and maintaining the road wicli the
anticipated benefits from the improvement over its assumed life (15 years) The
economic costs of the project represent outlays , net of taxes and duties , for the
feasibilicy study , engineering design , construction , and supervision of construction.
Also included were costs of routine maintenance and period resurfacing requied to
maintain the standard of road surface with and without the project. The benefits taken
into account in the economTic analysis were savings in vehicle operating costs. The
development benefits were also considered where appropriate.
Vehicle operating costs were caloulated for the eight types of vehicles
using die road , i.e. , motorcycle (MC) , cars (PC) , light bus (LB) , mcdiutn bus (MNB)
heavy bus (HB) ,light truck (LT) , medium truck (MT) , and heavy truck (HT) . The
basic running and fixed costs by vdhicle type , road surface and geometric condition
and operating speed were derived.
The re-estimated economic internal rated of reture (EIRR) for all 15
highway projects are between 16.0 % and 67.5 % which are higher than the discouted
rate of 12 %a
5. Zerformanceoflkxe&Bank
The project was closely monitored by the Bank. Durinig implementation,
Lhe Bank actively played a constructive role in many parts of Loan Projects. Close
monitoring by the Bank was of value in expediting implementation.
