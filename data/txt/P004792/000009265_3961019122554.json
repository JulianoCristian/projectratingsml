(ICR) for the Third Highway Sector Project to\n            Thailand. The main objectives of the Third Highway Sector\n            Project was to assist the Government in further improving\n            the overall efficiency of the highway sector and were aimed\n            at: a) improvingt he quality of interurban roads; b )\n            relieving congestion ; (c) improving road traffic safety; d)\n            reducing environmental pollution from vehicle emissions and\n            traffic noise; and e) improving policies on road transport\n            and road use.  Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) the Bank should have\n            recognized that a more detailed appraisal of the project\n            would have helped the Borrower in the implementation of the\n            project, particularly in view of the impact of the effect of\n            the rapid economic growth on the project costs; (ii) the\n            Bank should have recognized the institutional weakness of\n            the Land Transport Department(LTD) and included specific\n            technical assistance in the project to assist in the\n            institutional strengthening of the department as well as\n            help in the implementation of LTD managed components; and\n            (iii) in Thailand, the impact of sustained macroeconomic\n            performance on the road transport sector performance has\n            resulted in negative externalities such as problems of\n            safety, noise and air pollution and reduced road transport efficiency."}, "docdt": "1995-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
