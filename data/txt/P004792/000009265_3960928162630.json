The loan also\n            provides supplementary finance to the Department of Highways\n            (DOH) 1987-91 program.  The bulk of the loan will continue\n            financing components of DOH's road development program.\n            Specific subprojects to be financed under the loan will be\n            selected on the basis of agreed upon criteria and procedures."}, "docdt": "1990-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
