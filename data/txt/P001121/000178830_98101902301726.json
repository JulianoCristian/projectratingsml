It would consist of the second\n            phase of the Government's 1975 to 1985 Sewerage and\n            Drainage Development Program. It would be carried out from\n            1978 to 1981 and include supply and laying of primary sewers\n            and drains, sewer and drainage networks, construction and\n            equipment of a pumping station at the Treichville trunk\n            sewer, construction of drainage canals in the Banco area,\n            road surfacing and about 500 man-months of consulting\n            services. The road surfacing works would ensure the\n            stability of the drainage works. The consulting services are\n            mainly for detailed design, procurement, construction\n            supervision, management assistance, training and feasibility\n            studies for the third phase of the ten-year development program."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
