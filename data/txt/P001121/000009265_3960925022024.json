The project achieved some of its\n            objectives, institutional development was modest,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, there is a need for\n            realistic projections of project timetables, loan\n            disbursements, and public utility revenues. Second, rather\n            than relying on debt financing, it is important to generate\n            adequate internal cash, particularly in currencies subject\n            to possible appreciation. Finally, it is desirable to\n            maintain continuity of the Bank staff assigned to a project\n            and sector."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
