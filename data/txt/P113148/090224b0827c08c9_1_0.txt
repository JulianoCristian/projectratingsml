                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project aims to facilitate increased access to a wide variety of reliable and affordable telecommunications services for the majority of the Solomon Islands
                         population through efficient and well-regulated competition. The Project will support the development of a new regulatory institution#the Telecommunications
                         Commission#designed to promote good governance in the sector. Further, through support for enabling infrastructure, the Project will pave the way for more
                         widespread application of information communication technologies (ICT) supporting economic and social development, including greater opportunities for women.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Implementation progress, particularly for the regulatory support component, is on track.

                         ICT policy component. A formal request letter is anticipated.
