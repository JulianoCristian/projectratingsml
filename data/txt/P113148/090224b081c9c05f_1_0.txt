                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project aims to facilitate increased access to a wide variety of reliable and affordable telecommunications services for the majority of the Solomon Islands
                         population through efficient and well-regulated competition. The Project will support the development of a new regulatory institution#the Telecommunications
                         Commission#designed to promote good governance in the sector. Further, through support for enabling infrastructure, the Project will pave the way for more
                         widespread application of information communication technologies (ICT) supporting economic and social development, including greater opportunities for women.
