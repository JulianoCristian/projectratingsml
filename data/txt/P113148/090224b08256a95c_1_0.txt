                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project aims to facilitate increased access to a wide variety of reliable and affordable telecommunications services for the majority of the Solomon Islands
                         population through efficient and well-regulated competition. The Project will support the development of a new regulatory institution#the Telecommunications
                         Commission#designed to promote good governance in the sector. Further, through support for enabling infrastructure, the Project will pave the way for more
                         widespread application of information communication technologies (ICT) supporting economic and social development, including greater opportunities for women.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government is encouraged to expedite the recruitment of ICT Director at the Ministry of Communications, Aviation and Information Technology to strengthen its capacity in this
                         area, and consider the formal designation of a Chief Information Officer position. The Telecommunications Commission (TCSI) is recommended to enhance its efforts at public
                         awareness, communications and outreach. The Government has indicated its intention to seek an extension of the project's closing date--and possible additional financing still to be
                         confirmed-- to permit continuation of transitional support to TCSI pending availability of license fee income; a formal request letter is anticipated.
