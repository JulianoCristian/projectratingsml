    Project consists of: (i) irrigation improvement comprising\n            lining of 11 km of the main canal; construction of 77\n            control structures; increasing the carrying capacity of 400\n            km of canals; implementing a full package of on-farm\n            development on a 12,000 ha area; providing drainage networks\n            and improving 200 km of natural drains in the chaks; (ii)\n            construction and improvement of 206 km village access roads;\n            (iii) a pilot project for ravine erosion control; (iv)\n            strengthening agricultural extension and research services\n            and the cooperative system; (v) carrying out feasibility\n            studies for further staged development of the project area,\n            covering groundwater exploitation, canal lining to increase\n            delivery efficiency, reuse of return water flows,\n            reclamation of saline and alkaline soils, improvement of\n            district roads and further intensive on-farm development in\n            the command area; (vi) technical assistance to GOI for\n            preparing future command area development projects."},
