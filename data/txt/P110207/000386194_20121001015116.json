Human Influenza Preparedness and Response Project\n            for Uganda is to substantially reduce the threat posed to\n            the poultry industry and humans in Uganda by Highly\n            Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoo\n            noses and to prepare for, control, and respond effectively\n            to future Avian and Human Influenza (AHI) pandemics and\n            other infectious disease emergencies in livestock and\n            humans. Negative impacts includes: vegetation\n            clearance/removal; noise and vibrations from construction\n            works; dust; soil erosion; exhaust fumes from construction\n            equipment and vehicles; generation of health care waste that\n            may be infectious; and poor handling of health care waste.\n            Mitigation measures includes: 1) limit vegetation clearance\n            only to the construction site; 2) all construction\n            activities should follow national construction guidelines\n            and regulations; 3) sprinkle construction site with water\n            particularly during hot, dry and windy conditions; 4)\n            fertile topsoil should be removed, stored in an isolated\n            place and covered with plastic to prevent runoff/erosion; 5)\n            use appropriate methods of handling suspected cases; 6) use\n            appropriate methods for healthcare waste collection,\n            storage, transportation and disposal; and 7) use appropriate\n            methods of disposal of expired drugs by incineration at the\n            luwero industries limited incinerator."}, "docdt": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
