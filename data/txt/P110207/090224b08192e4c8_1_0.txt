                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall development objective is to substantially reduce the threat posed to the poultry industry and humans in Uganda by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to
                         prepare for, control and respond effectively to future AHI pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in livestocks and humans. To achieve this, support will
                         be provided in three main areas; (i) preparedness and prevention, (ii) outbreak response and recovery, and (iii) coordination, monitoring and evaluation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Good progress that has continued to be made since the March 2012 Mid-Term Review mission. Out of the ten agreed priority actions with implementation completion dates set during
                         the last mission in March 2012, nine have been completed satisfactorily. MAAIF and MoH have also both begun the civil works that include construction of one isolation unit and
                         upgrading of the two laboratories (both at Bio-Safety Level 3) at Entebbe. Under the overall leadership of the Permanent Secretary, OPM, the project coordination function has

                         continued to improve and is performing satisfactorily. The Permanent Secretaries of MOH and MAAIF have also continued to show strong commitments to the achievement of the
                         project development objective. The current major challenge observed in the project implementation is the pressure to finish the civil works in time. While the civil works of MAAIF are
                         at an advanced stage and are set to finish by June 2013, there is concern over the civil works of MOH which are at an earlier stage.
