All civil\n            works are already at an advanced stage. Specifically, as\n            required under the OP/BP10.00: (i) the project objectives\n            continue to be achievable, (ii) the performance of the\n            Borrower and other project implementing agencies have\n            improved significantly over the last two International\n            Development Association (IDA) missions and the current\n            project development objective (PDO) and Implementation Panel\n            (IP) ratings have been upgraded to moderately satisfactory,\n            and (iii) the implementing agencies have submitted\n            procurement plans demonstrating that remaining work will be\n            completed during the extension."}, "docdt": "2013-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
