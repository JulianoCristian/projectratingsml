Some lessons\n            learned included: for civil works contracts under execution,\n            it is important for the Borrower's contract managers to\n            supervise the contractor regularly (such as weekly) to\n            establish the capacity/readiness of the contractor. The\n            frequency of visits can be increased or reduced depending\n            upon the contractor's strengths or other measures taken\n            for noted poor performance. Adequately engaging key\n            parliamentarians about the project's broad scope and\n            the varied and persistent nature of the threats addressed\n            under the project could have potentially facilitated an\n            expedited and favorable consideration of the project in\n            Parliament.
