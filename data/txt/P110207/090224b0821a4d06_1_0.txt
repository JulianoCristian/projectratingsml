                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall development objective is to substantially reduce the threat posed to the poultry industry and humans in Uganda by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to
                         prepare for, control and respond effectively to future AHI pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in livestocks and humans. To achieve this, support will
                         be provided in three main areas; (i) preparedness and prevention, (ii) outbreak response and recovery, and (iii) coordination, monitoring and evaluation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project closes on December 31, 2013. Since the last implementation support mission, the implementation team under the guidance of the Permanent Secretaries of the Office of
                         the Prime Minister (OPM), Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) has undertaken significant strides to bring all envisaged
                         project activities to completion. The Project has increased the percentage of annual suspected HPAI cases in poultry that are reported and fully investigated in 15 high risk districts

                         from a baseline of 0% in 2009 to 100% percent thus exceeding the end of project target (80 percent). The proportion of veterinary facilities with capacity to diagnose HPAI in “at risk”
                         districts has increased from 0% to 75% (against an end of project target of 80 %); all districts in the country now have sufficient stocks of PPE, disinfection units, and burdizzos ready
                         for use in case of an AHI outbreak. Civil works for the Biosafety Level 3 laboratories at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) and the National Animal Disease Diagnostics and
                         Epidemiology Center(NADDEC) and the Isolation Ward at Entebbe Grade B Hospital are in their final stages and will be completed and handed over to government by December 17,
                         2013. 21.            Total disbursements as at 30 November 2013 amounts to US$10.59 million (US$ 8.61 million from the IDA Credit and US$ 1.99 million from the AHI Trust Fund).
                         The AHITF resources are fully disbursed while the balance (US$0.94 million) is fully committed and will be disbursed before project application deadline of April 30, 2014.
