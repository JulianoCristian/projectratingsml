                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall development objective is to substantially reduce the threat posed to the poultry industry and humans in Uganda by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to
                         prepare for, control and respond effectively to future AHI pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in livestocks and humans. To achieve this, support will
                         be provided in three main areas; (i) preparedness and prevention, (ii) outbreak response and recovery, and (iii) coordination, monitoring and evaluation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved most of its objectives with the exception of civil works that include construction of one isolation unit and two laboratories both at Bio-Safety Level 3 at
                         Entebbe. Whilst the project initially focused on avian flu, its scope has been extended during the project period to include all disease outbreaks which can be transmitted from animals
                         to humans, including Ebola. Under the overall leadership of the Permanent Secretary, OPM, the Permanent Secretaries of MOH and MAAIF have continued to show strong

                         commitments to the achievement of the project development objective. Civil works are at an advanced stage. Civil works of MAAIF are nearly complete and are expected to be
                         finalized by September. Civil works of MOH are to be completed by end November 2013.
