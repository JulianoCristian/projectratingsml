                         The overall development objective is to substantially reduce the threat posed to the poultry industry and humans in Uganda by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to
                         prepare for, control and respond effectively to future AHI pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in livestocks and humans. To achieve this, support will
                         be provided in three main areas; (i) preparedness and prevention, (ii) outbreak response and recovery, and (iii) coordination, monitoring and evaluation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of August 10, 2011, the project Implementing Agencies (IAs) had received US$ 5.04 million out of the total project IDA credit allocation of US$ 10 million. The IAs had also utilized
                         the full amount of US$ 2 million grant funding, received from the World Bank managed multi-donor Global Avian Influenza Trust Fund (TF) Facility, by the TF closing date of June 30,
                         2011. As a result of accessing the above project resources, significant progress was registered, by the Mid Term Review (MTR) mission during August 11-22, 2011 in the following

                         key project activities: (i) there was significant improvement in the coordination function both centrally in the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and within the IAs; (ii) out of the twelve
                         agreed priority actions with implementation completion dates set during the last mission in April 2011, nine had been completed satisfactorily; (iii) the project had begun submitting
                         withdrawal applications to document eligible expenditures by e-disbursement which is faster and more accurate and the Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were being submitted on
                         time; and (iii) the project outcome indicators showed that the project development objectives were at least being partially met at this stage. Out of the five outcome indicators, two

                         have already been met, two have substantially been met, and only one is partially met. The project team, therefore, recommended that the project rating be upgraded to Moderately
                         Satisfactory (MS). The major challenge observed in the project implementation was the continued procurement delays for civil works for the planned construction of two isolation
                         units by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and upgrading of diagnostic laboratories by MoH and Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF). The main concern is that
                         because the actual civil works have not yet started while the project itself is left with about nine months only to its closing date of June 30, 2012, it may not be possible to complete
                         the above civil works which, the government has pointed out, are crucial for the control and management of HPAI and other epidemic disease outbreaks in Uganda. Government of
                         Uganda (GoU) and the Bank have agreed on completion of key priority actions by November 15, 2011 in an effort to ensure completion of the civil works by the project closing date of
                         June 30, 2012.
