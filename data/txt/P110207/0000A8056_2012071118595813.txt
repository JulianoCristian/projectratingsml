                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall development objective is to substantially reduce the threat posed to the poultry industry and humans in Uganda by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to
                         prepare for, control and respond effectively to future AHI pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in livestocks and humans. To achieve this, support will
                         be provided in three main areas; (i) preparedness and prevention, (ii) outbreak response and recovery, and (iii) coordination, monitoring and evaluation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last Mid Term Review (MTR) mission in August 2011, there continues to be significant progress in implementation of project activities registered in the following key areas:
                         (i) the coordination function continues to perform well under the overall leadership of the Permanent Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) with strong support and
                         commitments from the Permanent Secretaries of Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF); (ii) all the agreed priority actions (except

                         for those related to civil works) with implementation completion dates set during the previous mission in August, 2011, have been completed satisfactorily; (iii) the US$ 2 million Trust
                         Fund Grant from the Global Multi-Donor Trust Fund was fully utilized and closed on schedule; (iii) total disbursements for the US$ 10 million IDA Credit was US$ 7.1 million by end of
                         May, 2012; and (iv) the project development objectives are at least being partially met at this stage since the targets for four out of the five outcome indicators have already been
                         met. The current major challenge observed in the project implementation, which is largely attributable to failure to meet the target for the fifth and last outcome indicator, is the
                         continued procurement delays for civil works pertaining to the planned construction of isolation units by MoH and upgrading of diagnostic laboratories by MoH and MAAIF. The
                         mission further noted that the delays in getting Parliamentary approval of the IDA Credit, which delayed project effectiveness for over 14 months, has also made it very difficult for the
                         IAs to complete the civil works by the planned project closing date of June 30, 2012. On the basis of the prolonged delays in project start up activities, and the continued progress
                         currently being registered in the overall project implementation, the Bank management has approved the government request for extension of the project closing date for one year
                         from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 so as to enable the completion of the vital project activities and attainment of the project development objectives.
