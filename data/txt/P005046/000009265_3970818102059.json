"The Small and Medium Scale Industry\n            (SMI) Project is designed to support the program for the\n            development of SMI through a line of credit to DIB and\n            technical assistance to individual enterprises.  It provides\n            a part of DIB's foreign exchange requirements over\n            1985-87 for onlending to SMI, with special emphasis on\n            small-scale industries (SSI).  It  also finances the foreign\n            exchange cost of continuing the program of technical\n            assistance to SMI begun under previous loans.  The project\n            provides further support for the Governments'\n            \"open-door\" policy.  By providing financial\n            assistance to SMI, it contributes to the development of this\n            important part of the private sector, while the technical\n            assistance component increases the productivity and\n            efficiency of SMI.  The project is expected to create about\n            71,000 new jobs."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
