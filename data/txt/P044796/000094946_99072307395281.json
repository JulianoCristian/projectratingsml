outcome of both the First and Second\n            Structural Adjustment Credit (SACs) projects was\n            satisfactory. The operations met the major objectives, and\n            sustainability is likely. The lessons learned indicate that\n            a highly educated background among policy people, is key for\n            a smooth and comprehensive reform program, as is the\n            continuity of both the counterpart and Bank's teams,\n            conveying far greater ownership. The composition of\n            supervision teams, when comprised of the core country team,\n            has the advantage of ensuring that SAC supported policies\n            will be directed towards sectoral priorities. Furthermore,\n            it is suggested that frequent supervisions by the core\n            country team, may be possible under the same SAC budget,\n            since the costs may be distributed among other sectoral\n            projects under their administration, in addition to the\n            added leverage advantage, off the adjustment operations\n            funds, to support their respective sector projects. The\n            pressure for financing gaps on tranche releases, may affect\n            policy considerations for their release, as was the case\n            with the second SAC operation. Thus, special consideration\n            should be given to premature releases, which may well weaken\n            compliance with the reform program. It is further suggested\n            to focus on intensive supervision, namely in new member\n            countries, to gain familiarity with Bank operations."}, "docdt": "1999-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
