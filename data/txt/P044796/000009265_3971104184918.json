          for Armenia supports the government's program to\n            consolidate macroeconomic stability and to lay the\n            foundations for sustained private-sector led growth over the\n            medium term. The program includes measures to: 1) improve\n            financial discipline in the private and public sectors, so\n            as to increase domestic savings, facilitate further external\n            adjustment, and ensure Armenia's creditworthiness; 2)\n            accelerate the growth and development of the private sector;\n            and 3) ensure the social sustainability of the reform\n            process and preserve Armenia's stock of highly-skilled\n            human capital. The government's strategy to improve\n            financial discipline is based on actions in three critical\n            areas: strengthening its resource mobilization capacity,\n            deepening energy sector reforms, and extending these reforms\n            into other critical, energy-consuming public utilities. To\n            accelerate private sector development, the government will\n            focus on completing privatization, strengthening the banking\n            sector, and developing capital markets. The credit supports\n            measures to improve targeting of social benefits and to\n            strengthen the social safety net. The program also includes\n            actions to reform the public pension system, introduce\n            private pensions schemes, and ensure adequate and affordable\n            long-term protection to the elderly. Lastly, the credit\n            supports health and education reforms, which have as a\n            primary goal ensuring equitable access to essential services."}, "docdt": "1997-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
