Two main lessons are suggested in preparing\n            irrigation projects. First, following the demonstration of\n            the economic rationale for rehabilitation, consideration\n            needs to be given to the supporting policy, and\n            institutional changes that must be made to boost and sustain\n            benefits. Measures are needed to provide farmers with\n            incentives to act as commercial operators, and to use water\n            sparingly, in line with its marginal cost. Second, if\n            farmers are to assume responsibility for operations and\n            maintenance following rehabilitation, they must be fully\n            consulted on the design of the proposed works. The creation\n            of farmer organizations needs to precede rehabilitation, and\n            building the capacity of these organizations-always a slow\n            process-needs to be given no less emphasis than the\n            engineering aspects."}, "docdt": "2004-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
