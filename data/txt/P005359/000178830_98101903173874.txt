REPORT AND RECOMkENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN' TO THE
CREDIT IMMOBILIER ET HOTELIER
OF MOROCCO WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE K7NGDOM OF MOROCCO
1.   I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$ 10 million to the Credit
Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH) in Morocco.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2. CIH, known until 1967 as the Caisse des Prets Immobiliems du Maroc, was
founded in 1920 by French banks. Until independence in 1956, it was chiefIy
engaged in financing housing and land purchases for Europeans. In 1960, thc
hovernment assumed control of the company through the Caisse de Depot et de
Jestion (CDG), a semi-autonomous State institution which is the depository
and administrator of several public funds. Since 1966, CIH has been the
lending institution chosen by the Government to channel funds to the touris-.
industry while, at the same time, retaining its activities in the financing
of housing.
3.   Since the mid-sixties, following preliminary discussions with the Ban}
regarding possible lending for hotels, CIH has taken successive steps to gear
itself to the type of project appraisals needed for hotel projects. CIH had
for most of its existence operated only as a mortgage lender, and the tech-
niques of appraising hotel projects were new. to it. It was therefore agreed
in 1966 that, as a transitional measure, the Banque Nationale pour le Deve]-
oppement Economique (BNDE), which had received Bank loans since 1962, would
assist CIH in project appraisal and would serve as a channel for Bank funds
to CIH. Although difficult to operate, this arrangement enabled CIH to ad-
just its organization and methods to the new field of hotel projects; at the
s'3ame time, members of the Bank staff advised CIH from time to time with a
view to bringing its policies and procedures to the standards required frcmn
a direct recipient of Bank loans. The appraisal of CIH was finally under-
taken in the course of 1969 and negotiations were started in Washington in
MVarch 1970, and pursued in Morocco in April and June. The CIII delegation
wras headed by Mr. Mohamed Lazrak, CIH's Director General; Mr. M'hamed Tazi,
,rom the Finance Ministry, represented the Guarantor.
4.  The proposed loan would be the tenth operation in Morocco by the Bank
Group. The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
.Ln Morocco as at June 30, 1970:

5.   The projects underway do not raise special problems except for the
implementation and disbursements under Credit No. 79 for education.   Prob-
lems of educational policy, which endangered the successful implementation
of the project, now show signs of improvement.   Although construction is
now progressing satisfactorily, disbursements are still behind schedule3
they are expected to increase significantly in the next few months as a
result of new measures taken by the MEnistries of Education and Finance.
Work for the Sidi Slimane Agricultural Development Project finariced under
Loan No, 389 is now almost completed, but disbursements have been slow and
it is expected that the balance of the loan will not have been fully used
by the closing date which was postponed by one year to October 31, 1970.
6.   Since 1963, IFC has held 25 percent of BNDE's share capital (now
equivalent to $1 million).   The Corporation also made in 1966 an invest-
ment and a loan totalling about $1.4 million in Compania Industrial del
Lukus (CIL), a company concerned mainly with processing and canning of
vegetables.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.   A report entitled "Appraisal of the Credit Immobilier et Hotelier -
Morocco" (No. DB-61a) is attachecd
9.   Morocco possesses several advantages favoring the development of
tourism: its geographical setting between the Atlantic Ocean and the
Mediterranean and mild climate for most of the year; its location rela-
tively close (about the same distance as Tunisia or Greece) to the Euro-
pean countries from which most of Moroccots tourists come; and its
colorful historical and folkloric attractions.   Tourism, which did not
start on a large scale in Morocco until the 1960's, has probably been
the fastest growing economic sector in recent years.   The number of
tourists (including cruise visitors) almost doubled between 1963 and 1969
when it reached 716,000, yielding gross foreign exchange receipts in the
order of $100 million.   This surge in tourism has both induced, and been
induced by, expansion of tourist facilities, itself supported by the existerce
of a generally adequate infrastructure. At the beginning of 1968, Morocco had



- 4 -
20,000 hotel beds available; two and a half years later the number had
i.ncreased to about 29,000, and nearly 20,000 additional beds are expected
to become available in the next two anid a half years. Projects owned or
sponsored by the Government or its agencies contributed substantially to
this expansion.
10. Tourism development is one of the priority areas of the Five-Year Plan
1968-72; accordingly, the Moroccan Government has over the last few years
taken major steps to encourage the growth of tourism.     Apart from creating
several state-controlled tourism development companies, it has provided
significant incentives to hotel investors, including: (a) an equipment grant,
usually ranging from 10-15 percent of the fixed investment in a hotel project.;
(b) a rebate paid by the State on the interest charged by CIH to its borrowers
for hotel projects and now amounting to 4.25 percent or nearly one-half the
8.75 percent CIH lending rate; (c) Government guarantees on loans made for
hotel construction and equipment which in practice cover about 50 percent of
the balance of CIHst outstanding hotel portfolio; (d) import duty exemption
for hotel equipment; and (e) tax privileges. In the light of the remarkable
growth of private investment in hotel construction, the Government has begun
increasingly to look to it for the major expansion in facilities in the
future rather than to invest through public entities in additional hotels.
Ul. While Government support has no doubt contributed significantly to the
expansion of hotel investment, it has also raised some issues. One is the
oossible misallocation of scarce capital resources that may be resulting from
nhe generous subsidies to the hotel sector.  The Bank Economic Mission that
7isited Morocco in April made a study of the general impact of subsidized
interest rates and other subsidies for industry and tourism and this, together
rnith additional data on tourist traffic and the economic effects of the
bourism subsidies, will provide, before the end of 1970, the basis for a
±eview and discussion with the Government of the justification for maintainirng
it their present level the subsidies, including the rebate on CIH's interest
rate, granted to the hotel industry.
12. CIH's present share capital of DH 20 million is held by public institu-
tions (40 percent) and private investors (60 percent), its main shareholder
being CDGm, with 26 percent of the stock. CIH's profitability in 1969 was
reasonably satisfactory; net earnings after interest and taxes amounted to
10 percent of net worth. A dividend of 8 percent was paid last year and
this year. As the main source of finance for hotels in Morocco, CIH's port-
folio of hotel loans has grown rapidly from DH 28 million at the end of 1960
to DH 63 million at the end of 1967 and to DH 163 million as of December 31,
9i969. Meanwhile, its portfolio of housing loans increased more slowly, and
camounted to DH 61 million at the end of 1969. In the coming years, hotel
:oans outstanding are expected to reach about DH 230 million at the end of
1971 and about DH 500 million in 1974.
-3. This considerable expansion calls for adjustments in CIH's methods
and resources. As regards methods, the need for thorough appraisals of



hotel projects and for a greater effort townards lowering investment costs,
b3coniiS increasingly acute in order to ascertain that investments are
tailored to satisfy the various tourist markets attracted by Morocco.   For
-hat purpose, it was agreed during negotiations that CIH would, as part
of its appraisals, attempt to estimate as precisely as possible the visitor
traffic and expected revenue and compute the internal economic return for
each hotel project.   It was further agreed that all projects to be financed
with the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan will be required to have an
internal economic return of at least 10 percent.   Other projects iill be
subject to end-use checks made by the Bank in its supervision of the loan
to CIH.   Finally, CIH agreed to strengthen its staff in order to improve
its review of the promoters' construction plans as well as its supervision
during construction, and ensure that hotel investment costs conform more
closely to the requirements of the market than has sometimes been the case
for past investments.
14. The planned increase in lending for hotels makes it also necessary
for CIH to improve its financial management.   So far, CIH had access to
three main sources of funds apart from its equity: 15-year bonds, medium-
term bonds and rediscounting facilities from the Banque du Maroc.   These
resources were hitherto considered adequate.   The recent surge in hotel
loars and their longer maturity have been weighing heavily on CIHIs re-
sources.   Over the past two years, CIH borrowed large amounts, a substan-
tial portion in the form of 5-year bonds, while its equity grew little and
its hotel loans carried terms of 15-20 years with important grace periods.
These factors led CIH into a high debt/equity ratio of almost 9:1 as of
end 1969, and resulted in an imbalance between the average terms of its
borrowings and of its lendings.   Though the proposed Bank loan, as well as
the loans channelled previously through BNDE, partly cover CIH?s needs for
resources with longer terms, CIH wrill have to keep under constant review
its future borrowings - and its future loans - in order to establish an
equilibrium between their respective terms.
15. As explained in paragraph 81 of the attached Appraisal Report, agree-
ment was reached during negotiations on a series of measures designed to
bring CIR{s terms of lending and borrowing into balance and to enable it
to incur additional debt.   These measures include:
(i) CDG has undertaken to subscribe in 1970-72 to bond issues by CLI
totalling DH 30 million, on terms equivalent to a 30-year loan
including 15 years of grace.   In the event of liquidation of CIH,
these bonds will be subordinated to all debt incurred originally
for a period of more than a year, including debt to the Banque du
Maroc.   The Government has guaranteed the execution of this
arrangement.
(ii) CDG has further undertaken to subscribe to, or underwrite, new 15-
year bonds to cover the debt service deficit expected in 1973-74,
up to a total of DH 30 million.
(iii) If the Banque du Maroc cancels or reduces the facility available
to CIH, the Government will provide long-term resources in an
equivalent amount.



(iv)  CIH is planning to increase its share capital by DH 10 million
in 1973.
As a result of these measures, CIH's capital structure would be brought
into better balance. The ratio of senior debt to equity plus subordinated
debt would not exceed six, which appears prudent in CIH's circumstances.
CIH may be relied on to manage its finance with prudence in the future.
160 The proposed loan would cover foreign exchange costs of the hotel
projects financed by CIH over a period of about one year. Disbursements
will be made by the Bank on the following basis: (a) 100 percent of the
c.i.f. cost of imported equipment; (b) A65 percent of the cost of goods
previously imported but acquired locally; and (c) 11 percent of hotel con-
struction costs, as certified by CIH, which has been estimated as the
import components of such costs.
PART IV - LEGAL INISTRUMEITS ANiD AUTHORITY
179 The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the CIH, the Draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of lorocco and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section h (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors separately. The provisions of the Draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements
are those generally utilized for loans to development finance companies.
ln addition, the issue of the subordinated bonds of CIH referred to in
paragraph 15 above is the subject of a condition of effectiveness (Section
7.01 of the Draft Loan Agreement).
PART V - THE ECONOMY
18. An economic report entitled "Recent Economic Development in Noroccol'
(No. EMA-14 dated August 29, 1969) was distributed to the ExecEtive Directors
',n September 22, 1969. The report of an economic mission which visited
Morocco in April 1970 is under preparaticn. A basic data sheet is attached.
19.  Morocco's economic performance has improved considerably since 1966
as compared with the earlier part of the decade, when a slight drcp in
real per capita income was recorded. Total output rose by 7 percent in
1967, despite poor rainfall, and by 12 percent in 1968 when a record
oereals crop accounted for two-thirds of the increase. In 1969 the output
lovel was maintained despite a drop of one-tnird in the cereals crop.
Tourism, irrigated agriculture, textile and electricity production have
shown particular buoyance. A moderately good crop in 1970 leads to the
expectation that the increase in GNP will be similar to the average annual
rate of growth of 6.5 percent in real terms between 1966 and 1969. Invest-
ment expenditures rose from an average of 11 percent of GDP during 1960-65
vo 13.1 percent during 1966-69, the rise being largely attributable to public
investment. Expenditures have been close to the rather modest targets of
the 1968-72 Plan and the latter have been revised upwards by 25 percent for



- 7 -
the remaining years 1970-72. Fiscal and credit restraint and higher revenues
in 1968 and 1969 have enabled the economy to maintain price stability as well
as to increase significantly public savings. The balance of payments situa-
tion improved in 1969 thanks largely to tourism and workers' remittances; bu-t
private capital outflows, though declining, still constitute a drain on
exchange receipts.
20. Problems of concern include chronic unemployment and underemployment,
shortage of skilled manpower (including secondary and college teachers), the
slow progress in land reform, stagnation of the rural rainfed areas, the
sloy growth of the main commodity exports and the low level of foreign ex-
change reserves in the face of possible droughts in the future.
21. Servicing of foreign debt represented 8 percent of exports of goods
and services in 1969 but the ratio is expected to rise to about 13 percent
by 1976 and to continue to rise thereafter as substantial additional foreign
debt is incurred to finance a higher level of public investment. Recent
economic performance and current outlook indicate that Morocco is credit-
worthy for additional borroiiing on conventional terms.
22. A Consultative Grcup for Morocco met in April 1967 and October 1969.
The next meeting is planned for November 1970.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEIMIT
23. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOTMMNDATION
24. I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
