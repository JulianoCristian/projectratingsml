to improve the institutional\n            capacity of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services\n            (MHMS) in the areas of public expenditure management and\n            sector performance monitoring. Such capacity development\n            will be critical to the overall success of the Health Sector\n            Support Program (HSSP) in improving health services delivery\n            and outcomes. The project's first component is: Public\n            Expenditure Management. This project component will\n            contribute technical assistance to complete the first\n            rolling sector Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and\n            improve national MHMS and provincial health planning and\n            budgeting systems and procedures, building on work done\n            during preparation, so that priorities are set within a\n            known resource envelope and linked to expected results. The\n            second component is: Sector performance monitoring. This\n            project component will provide technical assistance to\n            improve the sector-wide program's Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) framework to focus on a core set of\n            indicators covering the key dimensions of sector performance\n            along key dimensions. The third component is: training and\n            capacity building. This component will strengthen the\n            management capacity of senior managers and provincial health\n            directors to be more effective in strategic planning and\n            execution. It will also finance part of the MHMS strategic\n            human resource training plan."}, "docdt": "2008-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
