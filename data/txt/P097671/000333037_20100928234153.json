(HSSP) Technical Assistance Project for\n            Solomon Islands is to improve the institutional capacity of\n            the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) in the\n            areas of public expenditure management and sector\n            performance monitoring. Such capacity development will be\n            critical to the overall success of the HSSP in improving\n            health services delivery and outcomes. There has been\n            considerable delay in project implementation and although\n            the grant became effective on July 14, 2008, with the\n            exception of the purchase of a new photocopier, no\n            expenditure had occurred. The Ministry acknowledges the\n            delay was mostly due to lack of understanding of the project\n            arrangements within the Ministry itself and to a high\n            turnover of senior staff in 2009. As outlined in the aide\n            memoire from the April mission, good progress is now being\n            made as a result of assistance under the grant and Ministry\n            staffs are committed to maximizing the Bank's technical\n            support. The initial withdrawal application is being\n            submitted and further withdrawal applications will follow\n            regularly. The contract for the financial management\n            specialist, management training and other assistance will\n            occur throughout the calendar year 2011. Extending the grant\n            to December 31, 2011 will enable effective use of grant\n            resources as outlined in the attached revised procurement\n            and training plans."}, "docdt": "2010-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
