PROJECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Health Sector Support\n            Program (HSSP) Technical Assistance Project for Solomon\n            Islands were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project team took the right\n            decision to shift to a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL)\n            focused on the core building blocks for the HSSP support for\n            one sector program; enhanced Development Partner (DP)\n            coordination; and joint monitoring and strengthening of\n            Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) budget and\n            planning systems. This perhaps took too long because of the\n            collective regional commitment to a Sector Wide Approach\n            (SWAp) without being clear on what the up-front readiness\n            conditions should be. Another lesson is that enhanced\n            supervision and implementation support is needed,\n            particularly in fiduciary management for projects, in\n            countries such as the Solomon Islands, no matter what the\n            scale of the project. Procurement and particularly financial\n            management support from specialized staff in the Bank was\n            inadequate and typically not coordinated with review\n            missions. The separation of team responsibilities within the\n            Bank for different parts of the supervision process in the\n            recent past has reduced the effectiveness of the Bank in\n            supervision of projects. A key lesson is that the Bank needs\n            to develop a better business model for undertaking fiduciary\n            supervision in small countries where it cannot justify\n            locating fiduciary specialists in-country. Another lesson is\n            that persistence on the need for core Bank requirements\n            sometimes pays off. The executing agency often complained\n            strongly about the Bank's insistence, under the\n            project, to develop a procurement plan and follow it. The\n            MHMS now openly recognize that this is precisely what they\n            need for their own government development budget and are now\n            planning one for their 2013 development budget because of\n            significant delays in 2012 (and earlier) due to a lack of planning."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
