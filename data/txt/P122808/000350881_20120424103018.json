Fourth Agriculture\n            Development Policy Operation Project for Ghana is to enhance\n            productivity and market access among farmers, and to improve\n            agriculture sector management. Here are five main policy\n            areas. (1) Agriculture technology for improved on-farm\n            productivity will focus on improved research, extension\n            services, skills training and education in agricultural\n            sciences and farm management. (2) Market and value chain\n            development will provide a market place for farmers,\n            encourage stockholding, stimulate trade, improve market\n            transparency and price discovery, and collateral to leverage\n            commercial credit. (3) Irrigated agriculture and other\n            infrastructure services will improve irrigated agriculture.\n            (4) Fisheries policy area will focus on improving the\n            management of the fisheries sector. Licensing and\n            registration of the industrial and semi industrial fleet is\n            the first and most essential step in closing access to the\n            resources and restoring profitability and sustainability to\n            the sector. (5) Agriculture sector management  will feed\n            into an agriculture expenditure budget and tracking system\n            that will not only introduce consistency in accounting, it\n            will also provide a mechanism that promotes greater\n            inter-Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA)\n            coordination on priority setting and budgeting."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
