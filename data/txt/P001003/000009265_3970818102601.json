The major and significant factors that affected\n            implementation were: (a) resistance to the restructuring and\n            private participation in the public transport companies, and\n            (b) chronic delays in the availability of counterpart funds\n            and unwillingness of other donors to participate as\n            co-financiers. The Bank performance was generally\n            satisfactory, while the Borrowers performance was deficient\n            in implementation, particularly with respect to counterpart\n            financing, lack of financial accounting, and delays in\n            allowing the participation of the private sector in lie\n            transport companies. The key lessons learned from the IRP\n            are: (a) Project activities and their related costs need to\n            be carefully analyzed and take into account the further\n            deterioration of infrastructure that can occur between\n            project preparation and implementation. (b) cofinancing\n            should not be counted upon unless the cofinanciers give\n            their firm assurances. Reliance on a substantial amount of\n            cofinancing that did not materialize led to implementation\n            delays, changing priorities, scaling down of the project,\n            demoralized staff, and a revision in the Project Agreement.\n            (c) The Borrower should make a firm commitment for the\n            funding of maintenance and operations of the infrastructure.\n            A Special Account should be considered and established in\n            accordance with the norms of the Bank's Special Account."}, "docdt": "1997-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
