GUINEA-BISSAU: Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project-Credit 2074-GUB

Borrower) and the International Development Association (the

which a request was made to amend the table set forth in Schedule 1
to the Agreement by adding a new category entitled "rehabilitation
of ships and ferries" and by reallocating the credit proceeds
between existing categories.
     The Association hereby agrees with your requests relating to
the addition of a now category and the reallocation of proceeds and
proposes the following amendments to the Agreement.
