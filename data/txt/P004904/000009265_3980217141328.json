This\n            Project was approved by the Board on June 29, 1988. The\n            loan, to assist in the financial strengthening and\n            institutional restructuring of the public power utility,\n            SONELGAZ, was part of the Bank's strategy to support\n            Algeria's far-reaching program of public enterprise\n            reform, to improve the efficiency and viability of these\n            corporations. The project was designed to increase\n            SONELGAZ' capacity to implement the major investments\n            needed to meet increasing demand by optimizing energy\n            production and improving the quality of supply. The\n            longer-term goal was to use the reform of SONELGAZ as a\n            model for the reform of the country's other public\n            enterprises. The main objectives of the project were to: (a)\n            restructure and strengthen the financial position of\n            SONELGAZ, (b) gradually increase SONELGAZ' autonomy,\n            (c) help implement major investments that would help\n            optimize the productivity of the overall power system, (d)\n            improve the quality of the power supply and (e) improve\n            SONELGAZ's' management, planning and engineering capabilities."}, "docdt": "1997-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
