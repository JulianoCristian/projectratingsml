It will\n            strengthen the existing power system by: (a) the\n            construction of transmission lines to interconnect the power\n            station under construction at Jijel to SONELGAZ's bulk\n            supply systems; (b) the construction and/or extension of\n            seven transformer substations; and (c) the supply of\n            specialized equipment and vehicles to assist SONELGAZ in\n            improving its operational efficiency. The project will\n            support studies for: power system loss reduction; manpower\n            development; financial management systems; and optimal power\n            generation options. It will also support a substantial\n            training program for SONELGAZ staff through the provision of\n            improved technical and training materials."}, "docdt": "1988-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
