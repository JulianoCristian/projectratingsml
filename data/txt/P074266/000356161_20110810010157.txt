Project Context, Development and Global Environment
  Objectives Design
1.1.    Context at Appraisal
1.       The country context and the main rural sector issues at the time of appraisal in
2003 were described in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), which drew on
information from various sources, including the government’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The
following summary description based on the PRSP and the CAS remains valid today (the
statistics have been updated).

2.      Poverty in Chad. With an average annual income per capita under US$250, Chad
is among the 10 poorest countries in the world. Poverty is severe all over the country, but
it is most pronounced in rural areas, where about 80 percent of the population resides.
There is a marked disparity in incomes between rural areas (US$133) and urban areas
(US$328).

3.      The agricultural sector. Three out of four Chadians depend on agriculture for
their livelihood. The agricultural sector contributes about 40 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), accounts for about 50 percent of exports, and employs about 80 percent
of the active workforce. Women play a critical role in the sector, particularly in collecting
fruit, catching fish, raising cattle, and processing and marketing farm produce. Crop
production activities make up 50 to 65 percent of all agricultural activities. Cotton is the
main cash crop, followed by groundnuts and gum arabic. Livestock production activities
account for 30 to 40 percent of agricultural income, fisheries 12 percent, and forestry 7
percent. The sector grew about 4 percent annually between 1996 and 2001.

4.       Lagging rural growth. Despite the positive record of production growth, 55
percent of Chad's population remains below the poverty line (World Bank, 2009). The
persistence of widespread rural poverty illustrates the difficulty of bringing about a rural
development process that leads to widely shared growth. Agricultural production
activities are characterized by low land and labor productivity. Yields of most crops are
as much as 30 percent lower than those in countries with comparable agro-climatic
conditions. Year-to-year growth rates continue to be strongly affected by such exogenous
factors as world market prices and rainfall. The heavy reliance of Chadian agriculture on
highly uncertain rainfall underscores the importance of natural resource management
policies, especially those relating to management of soil and water resources.

5.     Challenges to be overcome. Chad's agricultural sector could, if adequately
developed, contribute significantly to growth and poverty reduction. Of the country’s
three main ecological zones, the northernmost Saharan oasis zone and the centrally
located Sahelian zone are subject to large climatic constraints that limit their potential as
engines of growth. The southernmost Sudanian zone has the best potential for production




                                                                                           1
of food and cash crops. But if agriculture is to contribute significantly to growth, a
number of problems will have to be addressed:

   •   low productivity at the farm level;
   •   inefficient agricultural marketing systems;
   •   weak producer organizations;
   •   poor delivery of agricultural research and extension services;
   •   an underdeveloped financial sector with limited penetration into rural areas;
   •   inadequate rural infrastructure
   •   weak capacity of public-sector institutions; and
   •   severely degraded fragile ecosystems.

The Government’s strategy and the rationale for Bank assistance
6.      Poverty reduction strategy. The PRSP, adopted in June 2003, sets out five
strategic priorities: (i) improving the social, judicial, political, and economic
environment; (ii) ensuring rapid and sustained economic growth; (iii) building human
capital; (iv) improving living conditions for vulnerable groups; and (v) safeguarding and
restoring ecosystems.

7.      Government strategy to address sector-specific issues. The objective of the
government’s rural development strategy prevailing at the time of appraisal was to
increase production in a sustainable way and preserving the environment while
reinforcing institutional and human capacities. The key elements of the strategy included:

   (i) increasing agricultural productivity and improving agricultural marketing;
   (ii) providing support to rural organizations;
   (iii) promoting sustainable management of natural resources and restoring
         production potential;
   (iv) improving the effectiveness of the public sector; and
   (v) improving the provision of basic services.

8.     To accelerate implementation of the country’s rural development strategy, the
government created an Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP). Within the IRDP
framework, and as stated in the CAS, the Bank supported the rural development strategy
and the cotton reform strategy with two projects: the Agricultural Services and Producer
Organizations Project (ASPOP) and the Local Development Program Support Project
(PROADEL). ASPOP and PROADEL were conceived as synergistic companion projects,
and they were prepared in parallel and implemented by the same agencies.

Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy
9.     The CAS, which was presented at the same time as ASPOP, aimed to help Chad
use its oil resources to reduce poverty by improving governance and providing
opportunities for more people to earn money outside of oil-related enterprises. The


                                                                                        2
second pillar of the strategy focused on developing the non-oil sector. Rural development
and increased agricultural productivity were core priorities identified in the CAS. ASPOP
was to be the main instrument of the CAS for enhancing agricultural services and helping
producer organizations raise agricultural productivity and rural incomes.

10.     ASPOP was conceived as part of a broader rural development strategy involving
several other Bank-financed operations that were to be implemented in parallel. To
complement the activities being supported under ASPOP, the national road network was
to be improved through the National Transport Program Support Project (PAPRONAT),
rural roads were to be constructed and maintained through PROADEL, and market
infrastructure was to be developed through the Urban Development Project (UDP).

1.2.    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
11.     The P roject Development O bjective (PDO) was to increase agricultural
productivity and rural incomes while preserving the natural resource base. The project
was to pursue this objective by financing activities to raise productivity and by
strengthening the institutional and technical capacities of producer organizations,
government institutions, and private support services.

12.     Key Performance Indicators (Outcome and Impact Indicators) were specified
in the PAD for the component of the PDO relating to increasing agricultural productivity:
“Project beneficiaries increase productivity of major crops and livestock by 10 percent by
the end of the project and reduce cereal crop losses from about 30 percent to less than 20
percent by project end.” No Key Performance Indicator was specified in the PAD for the
component of the PDO relating to increasing rural incomes.

13.    Baselines and targets for the agricultural productivity-related Outcome and
Impact Indicators appear in Section A.2 of the PAD.

14.    Output I ndicators a nd P rocess I ndicators were also specified in the PAD, in
Section A.2 and in the logical framework (Annex 1). Some of the Output Indicators and
some of the Process Indicators had multiple parts.

15.       The most relevant Output Indicators included:

      •   Beneficiaries: By the end of the project, at least 60,000 families are benefiting
          directly from the project.
      •   Subprojects: By the end of the project, at least 3,000 subprojects on productive
          investments have been approved, at least 90 percent of which have been
          implemented satisfactorily, and at least 40 percent of which have been
          successfully implemented by women.
      •   Extension services: By the end of the project, at least 30 percent of all contracts
          for extension services under subprojects on productive investments have been
          awarded to the private sector.
      •   Adaptive research: By the end of the project, at least 50 subprojects on short-term
          research activities have been satisfactorily implemented, and 35 technical sheets
          have been submitted to beneficiaries for implementation.
      •   Producer Service Management Centers: By the end of the project, 47 Producer
          Service Management Centers have been established, of which it least 90 percent
          are functioning satisfactorily.
      •   Rural radio stations: By the end of the project, three rural radios networks
          managed by producer organizations have been established and are functioning
          satisfactorily.

16.       The most relevant Process Indicators included:

      •   Environmental and social safeguards: By the mid-term review, at least five
          training programs on environmental management have been carried out for staff
          of the Ministry of Agriculture (MA), the Ministry of Livestock (ML), and the
          Ministry of Environment and Water (MEW). An environmental and social impact
          assessment has been carried out and approved for all subprojects.
      •   Cotton sector reforms: By the mid-term review, the texts regarding the legal
          status of cotton producer organizations have been substantially improved.
      •   Monitoring and evaluation: By the end of the first project year, a monitoring and
          evaluation system for rural sector activities has been established and is operating
          in a satisfactory manner.
      •   Project audits: By the end of each project year, all audit reports have been
          prepared and submitted on time.



                                                                                                         4
1.3.      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
17.    The PDO and Key Performance Indicators were not formally revised. During
implementation, the Bank supervision team recognized that an important component of
the PDO—income gains realized by project beneficiaries—was not being systematically
tracked. Therefore, a new indicator was added to the set of PDO Indicators recorded in
the Implementation Supervision and Results (ISR) reports: “Increase in revenues for
beneficiaries of subprojects.” Since addition of this indicator simply facilitated tracking
of progress achieved against the existing PDO, Board approval was not sought.

1.4.      Main Beneficiaries
18.    The main beneficiaries (and the avenues through which they were to be assisted)
included: (i) rural households in the project areas (through improved farming and off-
farm activities, higher productivity and ultimately higher incomes for further productivity
investments); (ii) private entrepreneurs (directly through technical and financial support
and indirectly through induced demand due to higher incomes in the agricultural sector);
(iii) consumers (through lower food prices); (iv) local communities (through
improvements in local infrastructure and indirectly, through the diversification of the
local economy and employment); and (v) targeted institutions, including research and
extension institutions, local and central administrations (through technical support and
capacity building activities).

1.5.      Original Components (as approved)
19.    The project included three components, each of which had numerous
subcomponents and activities: (1) Promotion of sustainable growth in agricultural
production, (2) Capacity building for agricultural services, and (3) Support to project
management.

Component 1: Promotion of sustainable growth in agricultural production

20.       Two sub-components were financed under this component.

(a) P roductive i nvestments. This sub-component financed demand driven productive
    investments (subprojects) proposed by producer organizations, along with the
    technical assistance required for proper implementation. Financing was to be
    provided through a matching grant system under which beneficiaries were required to
    make an up-front contribution representing at least 20 percent of the costs of
    subproject. Productive investments included among other things:
      •   Productive infrastructure: The project financed the identification, planning, and
          implementation of subprojects that supported the construction of small-scale rural
          infrastructure, including for example drainage and irrigation infrastructure for
          improved soil and water management; fish ponds and fish processing facilities;
          grain storage facilities; agro-processing machinery; and rural veterinary facilities.
      •   Agricultural development: The project financed the identification, planning, and
          implementation of subprojects that promoted agricultural diversification,


                                                                                             5
          including for example improvement of existing farming systems (e.g., cotton);
          development of conservation farming techniques; provision of demand-driven
          extension and training activities; and affording better access to high-quality seeds
          and planting material.
      •   Nonfarm productive activities in rural areas: The project financed the
          identification, planning, and implementation of subprojects that promoted
          nonfarm income-generating activities, including for example handicraft
          production; women’s weaving rings; building materials manufacturing; small
          machinery repair; and local blacksmithing.

(b) C ompetitive research g rant p rogram s ubprojects. This sub-component financed
    two- to three-year applied research projects that were designed to relieve constraints
    encountered during the productive investment subprojects, both cotton-related and
    non-cotton-related. ASPOP funds complemented funds provided by the French
    Development Agency (Agence Française de Developpement – AFD) and the African
    Development Bank (AfDB).

Component 2. Capacity building for agricultural services

21.       Four sub-components were financed under this component:

(a) Capacity strengthening of producer organizations: Activities to be financed under
    this subcomponent included the following:
      •   Technical advisory services provided by a variety of rural service providers to
          help identify, prepare, and support implementation of productive investment
          subprojects and manage Producer Services and Management Centers (PSMCs).
      •   Training, workshops, and study tours to enhance the ability of producer
          organizations to promote participatory approaches, develop basic accounting and
          procurement methods, and participate in state and regional steering committees.
      •   Dissemination of technical and economic information to producer
          organizations, with the help of rural radio networks, United Nations Development
          Program (UNDP), and AFD.

(b) S upport to c otton sector r eforms: This subcomponent was designed to support
    selected activities of the Technical Support Unit for Cotton Reform (CTRC), such as
    the following:
      •   Review of the legal status of cotton producer organizations, with the objective of
          realigning the organizations so as to better meet their socioeconomic objectives.
      •   Promotion of cotton farmers’ access to farm inputs, not by financing farm inputs
          directly, but rather by helping to reduce transaction costs for the supply of farm
          inputs through consolidation of orders, providing of training, and other means.




                                                                                            6
(c) Private-sector development. This subcomponent was expected to foster privatization
    by supporting the following activities:
      •   Promotion of private veterinary services through training of veterinarians in the
          legal and regulatory framework for the practice of veterinary medicine and
          through building veterinarians’ knowledge about the financial aspects of the
          practice of veterinary medicine.
      •   Strengthening of Producer Service Management Centers to improve access to
          services by small-scale producers and rural entrepreneurs and to help producer
          organizations gradually take over the operating costs of their PSMC.

(d) P ublic-service d evelopment. This subcomponent was designed to support the
    Ministry of Agriculture (MA), the Ministry of Livestock (ML), and the Ministry of
    Environment and Water (MEW) through:
      •   Training and capacity building designed to (i) improve the ability of MA and
          ML to prepare and implement rural investment programs, and (ii) strengthen the
          ability of MEW to monitor measures introduced to mitigate negative
          environmental impacts.
      •   Institutional reforms designed to strengthen the technical and institutional
          capacities of research units in MA and ML to implement agreed-upon thematic
          research activities.

Component 3. Support to project management

22.       Two sub-components were financed under this component:

      (a) Project administration and management was ensured through the establishment
          of a National Project Coordination and Management Unit (NPCMU) and six
          Inter-Regional Coordination and Management Units (IRPCMUs) within MA.

      (b) Monitoring and evaluation of project activities, and carrying out periodic studies
          to assess the impacts of project-supported activities.

Relationship of the Project Components to the PDO

23.     The project design was based on the assumption that agricultural development is a
complex, multi-faceted process that cannot be accomplished via one-dimensional
approaches; many constraints need to be attacked simultaneously to achieve a successful
overall outcome. The project components therefore were designed to support the overall
PDO by supporting activities intended to improve productivity and increase incomes
while at the same time strengthening the capacity of selected producer organizations,
government institutions, and private service providers. Component 1 was designed to
raise productivity and increase income at the farm household level, while Component 2
was aimed at strengthening capacity at the local and national levels to support primary
production activities.



                                                                                          7
1.6. R     evised Components
24.      The project components were not revised.

1.7.     Other Significant Changes
Changes in project design and restructuring
25.      No changes were made to the project design.
Reallocation of funds
26.     Actual expenses for project management and for vehicle purchases and operations
exceeded the appraisal estimates by 47 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Funds were
reallocated to cover the additional expenses from the “Civil Works” and the
“Unallocated” disbursement categories.


Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
27.     In assessing the implementation and outcomes of ASPOP, it is necessary to take
into account the unusually challenging circumstances that prevailed throughout most of
the project implementation period. Two factors in the external environment are
particularly noteworthy:

28.     Civil conflict: The project implementation period coincided with a period of great
turbulence in Chad. The government was (and continues to be) engaged in what amounts
to a low-level civil war, with opposition groups based inside and outside the country
mounting regular armed attacks designed to destabilize the economy and overthrow the
existing regime. The lack of security in many parts of the country, especially rural areas
including many of those targeted by the project, often made it unsafe for project staff to
travel to project sites and/or perform their activities in a normal way. The frequent
disruptions slowed implementation of many project activities and forced the
abandonment of some subprojects before they had been completed.

29.    Breakdown in relations between the Bank and the government: During project
implementation, the relationship between the Bank and the Government of Chad was
severely strained, mainly over matters relating to the financing, construction, and
management of the controversial Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline. Three times during the
implementation period, the Bank suspended its program in Chad, which led to the
temporary freezing of disbursements to all projects including ASPOP. On each occasion,
project activities slowed or stopped altogether before eventually resuming when the
suspension was lifted. These disruptions slowed implementation of project activities and
required many subprojects to stop and then re-start again from scratch.

30.     These two factors in the external environment, which were beyond the control of
the project implementing agencies and the Bank’s task team, delayed and/or disrupted the
implementation of many project-supported activities and complicated supervision efforts.
In this context, it must be appreciated that the outcomes achieved by the project


                                                                                        8
(described below) were achieved in the face of an extremely difficult environment that
posed severe challenges both for the project implementing agencies as well as for the
Bank’s task team.

Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

31.     Project preparation, design, and quality at entry were in general adequate.

32.     The team that prepared the project commissioned a number of background studies
to inform the project design. These studies allowed the team to benefit from: (i) lessons
learned under the earlier Bank-supported Agricultural Services Program (ASP), which
had successfully engaged producers in the design and implementation of subprojects
(similar to community-driven development programs); (ii) experience gained through
other Bank-supported rural development projects in neighboring countries; and (iii) the
recent OED evaluation of World Bank-supported agricultural research projects.

33.     A number of lessons learned from other Bank-financed rural development
projects in Africa were specifically mentioned in the PAD as having been taken on board
during project preparation:

 (i)    Projects must be designed by communities based on needs their populations have
        identified and implemented using partly their own resources;
 (ii)   Project implementation arrangements must take into account local social
        structures;
 (iii) Local development efforts must have strong political commitment from the
       center;
 (iv) The capacity of local NGOs and consulting firms must be strengthened, especially
      with regard to supporting producer organizations;
 (v)    Effective representation must be ensured with respect to women and women’s
        groups in community associations and other local organizations;
 (vi) Resources and responsibilities must be transferred to local government bodies;
      and
 (vii) Local accountability and ownership of projects must be assured.

34.     The predecessor project, ASP, had shown that strong producer organizations are
essential for improving productivity, because they can leverage the power of individual
farmers in seeking improved access to agricultural support services, production inputs,
and market outlets.

35.    In addition, the ASP experience had reflected the broader lesson emerging at the
time from the OED evaluation of Bank-funded agricultural research projects that if
research-extension linkages are to be effective, institutional reforms must be
implemented that create incentives for different actors to collaborate. Moreover, good



                                                                                       9
agricultural research requires careful selection of research activities, the introduction of
procedures into the national agricultural research system to enhance the relevance of
research, ensure scientific rigor (including scientific networking, adequate external
reviews and linkages), and provide competitive funding.

36.    The project design was based on the paradigm, already widely accepted within the
Bank at the time, that rural development is a complex, multi-faceted process that cannot
be accomplished via one-dimensional approaches (e.g., stand-alone projects focusing on
research or extension or rural finance). Many constraints need to be attacked at once to
achieve a successful overall outcome. The project design reflected this holistic view.

37.      The project objectives and the approach selected to achieve those objectives,
while avowedly ambitious, were appropriate. In seeking to increase agricultural
productivity and raise rural incomes while preserving the natural resource base, the
project was designed to: (i) cover multiple sectors; (ii) ensure active participation of all
groups within the targeted communities; (iii) provide financial mechanisms to satisfy
priority development needs at the local level while promoting activities to ensure long-
term viability of ecosystems and natural resources; (iv) make the principal cash crop of
the country, cotton, more profitable over the longer term while at the same time
promoting diversification of agricultural production; (v) make agricultural research more
responsive to the needs of end users; and (vi) introduce measures to privatize certain
activities related to rural development, such as provision of veterinary services.

38.     The project concept was fully endorsed by the government, which established a
working group to support preparation comprising members drawn from central
ministries, NGOs, and related donor-funded initiatives. Responsibility for supervision
was assigned to the existing Steering Committee for Rural Development, which included
representatives from the government, civil society, and producer organizations. In
addition to the Ministry of Planning (MP), the key ministries involved were the Ministry
of Agriculture (MA), the Ministry of Livestock ML), and the Ministry of Environment
and Water (MEW).

39.    Risks were reasonably identified, and mitigating measures were appropriately
conceived. Many of the risks identified in the PAD eventually materialized, but they were
successfully mitigated with the help of measures proposed by the project. The only risk
that was overestimated (it was rated moderate) was the risk that “the producer
organizations may have difficulty preparing subproject proposals.” As it turned out,
producer organizations (working with project-supported service providers) proved very
capable of preparing subproject proposals.

40.     One risk that was not foreseen—and it is perhaps not surprising, because there
was no historical precedent—was the risk posed by a dramatic appreciation of the FCFA
relative to the dollar. At appraisal, the exchange rate was US$ 1 = FCFA 700. During
project implementation, the rate fell as low as US$ 1 = FCFA 450. At project closing, it
stood at US$ 1 = FCFA 480. The steep rise in the value of the FCFA relative to the dollar
(which is an important component of SDRs) eroded the amount of FCFA-denominated



                                                                                         10
funding and adversely affected the ability of project management to fully implement all
planned activities.

Implementation

41.     Project implementation was mixed. The various implementing agencies
performed reasonably well, but they had to confront significant challenges that were
beyond their control and that were not adequately anticipated during preparation (e.g.,
lack of security in rural areas, multiple suspensions of the Bank’s programs in Chad,
reduced amount of FCFA-denominated funding). Even though implementation fell
behind schedule, the project was never judged to be at risk, and the project design was
not changed through restructuring. When eventually it became evident that the available
funds would not be sufficient to allow full implementation of the planned activities,
restructuring was ruled out, on the grounds that all components of the project were
considered essential to achieve the PDO. The Mid-Term Review made recommendations
for addressing the funding shortfall, but the Mid-Term review was delayed by more than
a year due to a suspension in the Bank’s programs in Chad (it was originally scheduled
for May 2006 but not carried out until June 2007). As a result, these recommendations
came very late in the day, and they were not fully implemented by the government.

42.       Project implementation was positively impacted by the following factors:

      •   Project implementation agencies were established and staffed quickly, allowing
          project activities to get underway almost immediately after project effectiveness.
      •   Community-based organizations responded quickly and enthusiastically to calls
          for subproject proposals.
      •   The line ministries involved with the project provided strong technical support
          throughout the life of the project.
      •   Supervision missions were carried out regularly by the Bank, the government, and
          project staff working in collaboration, and supervision teams included appropriate
          mixes of staff with project implementation skills and technical expertise.

43.       Project implementation was negatively impacted by the following factors:

      •   During project implementation, lack of security in rural areas prevented timely
          implementation of some project-supported activities and disrupted supervision.
      •   During project implementation, the Bank three times temporarily suspended
          disbursements to all projects in Chad; after each suspension, time and effort were
          required to re-start project-supported activities that had been stopped.
      •   During project implementation, the FCFA appreciated significantly in relation to
          the dollar which effectively reduced the value of FCFA-denominated project
          funds by 35 percent.




                                                                                         11
   •      During project implementation, an unanticipated sharp escalation in the cost of
          many materials rendered obsolete many of the unit costings that had been used
          during the preparation of the project cost tables.
   •      Payment of counterpart funds was often delayed, and the full amount of
          counterpart funds was not always provided.
   •      Because of the complexity of the project design, the attention of project
          management was drawn in many directions, reducing its ability to focus on
          emerging problems.
   •      Throughout much of the project, the M&E system failed to generate the
          information needed to effectively gauge implementation progress.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

44.    Funds for the establishment and implementation of the project M&E system were
provided under Component 3.

M&E design.
45.     The project M&E system complied with Bank guidelines prevailing at the time of
project appraisal. The logical framework laid out the objectives of the project, described
the causal relationships between project-supported activities and expected outputs, and
described how program actions were expected to lead to the intended outcomes.
Appropriate numbers of staff were assigned to M&E functions, and the budget allocation
to support their work was adequate.

46.  Even though it complied with Bank guidelines prevailing at the time, the project
M&E system suffered from three serious design weaknesses.

   (i)     No Key Performance Indicator was specified in the PAD for the component of
           the PDO relating to increasing rural incomes.
   (ii)    The logical framework, which is supposed to serve as a management tool,
           contained a large number of indicators. In the end it proved very challenging to
           track all of these indicators, making timely monitoring of project-supported
           activities very difficult.
   (iii) The project M&E system was not linked to the project financial management
         system, so information recorded in the M&E system about subproject
         commitments was not transmitted to the financial management unit.

M&E implementation.
47.    Implementation of the project M&E system got off to a slow start. Initially,
information was collected mainly on the number of subprojects approved, plus several
other measures of implementation progress. The Aides Memoire for the supervision
missions conducted up until the time of the Mid-Term Review commented on the
weakness of the M&E system and signaled the inadequacy of the information being


                                                                                        12
produced. M&E data were supposed to be collected at the village level, forwarded to
interregional project units, and then passed on to the National Project Coordination and
Management Unit, but the process was long and time-consuming and involved many
actors whose commitment was not always strong. Recognizing the futility of tracking the
large number of indicators appearing in the results framework, the Bank supervision team
reduced the number of indicators reported on in ISRs, but data were not always available
even for the reduced set of indicators. Despite the streamlining of the reporting
framework, some important aspects of project performance proved difficult to monitor on
a continuous basis, such as participation rates of women and youth, and environmental
impacts of project-supported activities. To compensate for the weakness of the M&E
system, the decision was taken to undertake periodic sample surveys, which facilitated
preparation of a relatively satisfactory end-of-project M&E report.

M&E utilization.
48.     Because the project M&E system proved incapable of tracking all of the
performance indicators specified in the logical framework, it was not able to provide
accurate and timely information for use by project management. This not only prevented
project management from knowing the progress that had been realized toward
achievement of key project objectives, but it also contributed indirectly to a significant
overcommitment of project funds. In the absence of updated data on the numbers of new
subproject approvals and the projected costs of approved subprojects, management was
unaware that commitments for new subprojects were outpacing the available amount of
funding. As a result, far more subprojects were approved that could be funded by the
project. By the time it became known that too many subprojects had been approved, there
were not even enough funds remaining to complete all the subprojects that had already
been initiated. The weaknesses of the project M&E system were repeatedly flagged
during supervision missions, but only during the latter stages of implementation were
these weaknesses addressed.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard policies. Five World Bank safeguard policies were triggered at the time of
project appraisal: OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.09 (Pest Management), OP
4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement), OP 4.37 (Safety of Dams), and OP 7.50 (Projects on
International Waters). An Environmental Assessment (EA) and an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) were prepared by the time of appraisal. Similarly, a Pest
Management Plan (PMP), a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and documents for
dam safety analyses were prepared by the time of appraisal. The notification process
required under OP 7.50 (Projects on International Waters) took place in accordance with
the policy.

49.     The Mid-Term Review carried out 15 months before project closing revealed
several shortcomings in the implementation of safeguard policies: (i) environmental
evaluation of subprojects was often insufficient, (ii) the unit charged with verifying the
security of dams was in place but non-operational, and (iii) farmers were not always
effectively implementing the PMP. Corrective measures were taken by project


                                                                                       13
management in response to these findings, resulting in substantial improvement in the
implementation of safeguards policies. The final ISRs rated the safeguards compliance
aspects of the project as moderately satisfactory (MS) to satisfactory (S).

50.      Fiduciary compliance. Project accounts, including the special accounts maintained
by the national coordination unit and the regional sub-accounts managed by the regional
coordination units, were audited regularly up to 2007. Completion of the 2008 audit is
experiencing delays due to (i) non-settlement of prior bills submitted by the auditor, and
(ii) lack of assurances by project management that future auditing fees will be settled. A
new deadline of July 31, 2009 has been communicated to project management for
submission of the final 2008 audit report to the Bank. The 2007 audit report was qualified
on (i) financial statements, and (ii) project bank accounts. The qualification on the
Special Account centered on an overdraft of approximately FCFA 31 million, reflecting
an outstanding liability that must be reimbursed by the project. During project
implementation, a number of problems arose stemming from a lack of budget control.
Because commitments for new subprojects were being made without any reference to the
amount of funding left in the project accounts, subproject-related commitments were able
to grow to the point where they significantly exceeded the amount of available funding.
The financial management function also exhibited shortcomings, although these were
relatively minor. For example, when funds had to be reallocated because of higher than
projected project management costs (inflated in part by unanticipated vehicle purchases),
project staff complained that the reallocation took an excessively long time because of
heavy Bank administrative procedures.

51.     Procurement. Procurement activities were routinely monitored during supervision
missions. A stand-alone procurement review was not carried out. No problems were
reported affecting the central procurement function, but several supervision missions and
the Mid-Term Review flagged issues relating to procurement activities being carried out
in regional offices. For example, it was reported that staff in regional offices and
subproject approval committees often failed to follow the proper procedures; that bidding
for technical service provision contracts was not sufficiently competitive; that
procurement documents were poorly organized; and that producer organizations lacked
training in procurement. These shortcomings may have stemmed from to the fact that the
project employed a full-time Procurement Specialist for only two years, and this person
did not have time to provide the extensive training and follow-up support needed to
manage the large volume of procurement work generated by the project.

Post-completion Operation / Next Phase

Note: This section is not required for a core ICR. It is however included because a
number of activities initiated under the project have not been completed, so the overall
impacts of the project will depend on what happens in the months and years to come.

52.    The Country Management Unit (CMU) has expressed interest in financing a
follow-on operation. The case for a follow-on operation rests on three main arguments.




                                                                                       14
53.    First, ASPOP has been instrumental in introducing the participatory, community-
led approach to rural development into the country. The approach has gained many
adherents and is now being promoted in government programs and projects, as well as in
donor-financed programs and projects. Several development partners followed the
progress of ASPOP and have taken up project-generated guidelines and manuals when
these have been relevant to their own programs. The positive achievements of ASPOP
have generated enthusiasm for participatory community-led approaches and have
encouraged increased investment in rural development activities.

54.     Second, rural development is a long-term endeavor requiring a sustained
commitment of funding. Many developing countries facing challenges similar to those
faced by Chad have chosen to implement decentralized rural development programs
based on multi-year, multi-phase Adaptable Program Loans (APLs). By the same logic,
the activities initiated under ASPOP will need to be sustained if they are to have their
intended effect of stimulating sustainable rural development.

55.    Third, because of the many challenges that arose during implementation, a
number of activities initiated under ASPOP could not be completed. In this context,
additional funds will be needed to allow Chad to benefit from the investments that have
already been made.

56.     These arguments in favor of a follow-on operation are somewhat counterbalanced
by several aspects of the ASPOP implementation experience that can only be described
as a negative legacy: the failure to implement fully the planned work program; the
inability of the project M&E system to document clearly the achievements of the project;
the failure of the government to honor fully its commitments to provide counterpart
funding; and delays in payments made to service providers that have left many service
providers reluctant to continue working with the project. These lessons will have to be
reflected in the design of any follow-on operation, whether supported by the Bank or by
other development partners.

Assessment of Outcomes
Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

57.    The objectives of ASPOP remain highly relevant. The project’s core focus on
reducing rural poverty by raising agricultural productivity and increasing incomes while
preserving the natural resource base is a major priority today, as was the case at appraisal.

58.     The main elements of the government's national rural development strategy at the
time of appraisal were as follows: (i) increase agricultural productivity and improve
agricultural marketing; (ii) provide support to rural organizations; (iii) promote
sustainable management of natural resources and restoration of production potential; and
(iv) improve the effectiveness of public agencies serving rural development. The
government’s overall development strategy has evolved in recent years as oil revenues
have increased, along with employment in the oil sector, but the current strategy for rural
development and poverty reduction still rests on the same pillars that prevailed at the time


                                                                                          15
of appraisal. These fundamental pillars include four that the project has supported:
(i) diversifying sources of growth; (ii) promoting agriculture and livestock production,
and preserving the ecosystems on which agriculture and livestock production depend; and
(iii) promoting cooperation between the public and private sectors, including civil society
organizations; and (iv) integrating formal and informal markets.

59.     The current CAS acknowledges that rural poverty poses a key development
challenge for Chad. World Bank assistance to Chad during the period 2008-12 will
support the pillars of the national development strategy. The CAS emphasizes the
importance of pursuing good governance and enhancing non-oil opportunities (including
rural development) while reducing sources of vulnerability, notably for the poor.

60.     Implementation modalities for the project were generally appropriate. The roles of
the implementing bodies were clearly defined, and responsibilities were appropriately
distributed among the project implementation agencies, other public organizations and
agencies, private and NGO service providers, and community-based organizations. This
is not to say that implementation was always smooth; as discussed earlier, because the
lack of security often made it unsafe for project staff to travel to rural areas,
implementation of many project activities was delayed, and some subprojects had to be
abandoned before they had been completed.

Achievement of Project Development Objective

61.     Achievement of the PDO is evaluated in terms of two quantifiable indicators:
(i) increased productivity of key commodities, and (ii) increased incomes of project
beneficiaries. The third component of the PDO—preservation of the natural resource
base—is not considered to be a measurable objective in and of itself, but rather refers to
the process through which the first two indicators are to be achieved. 1

62.      With regard to productivity increases in key commodities realized by project
beneficiaries, and taking into account those commodities for which data are available, the
project largely achieved its development objective. The paucity of data, however, reduces
the confidence associated with this conclusion. Productivity increases realized during the
life of the project varied by commodity, but target values were met or exceeded for most
of the commodities for which data are available (for details, see Annex 2). Productivity in
sorghum and millet, the main food crops in Chad, increased markedly (160 percent
compared to the baseline), as did productivity in irrigated rice (150 percent compared to
the baseline). Mortality rates in poultry decreased by more than the targeted amount, for
both local and imported birds. Not all of the productivity targets were achieved, however;
for example, productivity in groundnuts actually declined slightly (-5 percent compared
to the baseline), mainly because of inclement weather occurring in the final year of
project implementation. It is not possible to report on productivity changes in maize,

1
    With regard to the environmental objective mentioned in the PDO, it is important to recall that ASPOP
    was prepared in parallel with a companion project, PROADEL, that was designed to focus more
    directly on large-scale issues relating to environmental stewardship and natural resource management
    (e.g., management of watersheds, forests, and pastoral areas; preservation of biodiversity).


                                                                                                      16
cotton, and milk, because few or no subprojects involving these commodities appeared in
the sample of subprojects selected by the project to collect productivity data.

63.     With regard to income gains realized by project beneficiaries, no Key
Performance Indicators were specified in the PAD relating to income generation. For
purposes of the ICR, achievement of the income-generation objective was evaluated
based on financial analysis of selected subprojects—the same approach used by project
management to estimate income gains during the life of the project (for details, see
Annex 2). Based on this approach, the project can be considered to have partially
achieved its development objective. Using net profitability figures generated through an
in-depth analysis of eight representative sub-projects, the 1,173 completed subprojects
are estimated to have generated net revenues totaling nearly FCFA 1.4 billion (US$ 2.7
million), or slightly more than FCFA 66,780 (US$ 132) per year for each of 20,578 rural
households. This suggests that subprojects financed under the project were on average
very successful in generating income for beneficiary households. However, the number
of beneficiary households fell considerably short of the target of 60,000 households
specified in the PAD, because fewer subprojects were financed than had been projected.
The fact that fewer subprojects were financed than had been projected is explained by
two factors: (i) the reduction in local currency-denominated funding that resulted from
the appreciation of the FCFA, and (ii) the higher-than projected average unit cost of
individual subprojects.

Additional achievements measured against output indicators

64.     In assessing the achievement of the PDO, it must be recognized that the outcomes
of many project-supported activities are not directly captured in the PDO indicators. For
this reason, as described in the ICR Guidelines, it is reasonable to evaluate also the
progress achieved against the intermediate indicators specified in the PAD. These can be
grouped into four broad categories: (i) building local capacity to prepare and implement
subprojects; (ii) strengthening producer organizations; (iii) funding agricultural research
through competitive grants; and (iv) promoting private agricultural extension services.

65.      With regard to these four categories, the project achieved significant results (for
details, see Table A2.4 in Annex 2):

    (i) Building local capacity to identify, prepare, and implement subprojects

66.     One important achievement of the project was to build local capacity to identify,
prepare, and implement subprojects. During the life of the project, community-based
groups (supported by locally hired service providers) identified, prepared, and processed
2,500 subprojects.2 This was a remarkable achievement in a country in which CDD
approaches had rarely been used and in which rural development initiatives have
traditionally been conceived, designed, and implemented from the center, using top-down


2
    Not all of these sub-projects were eventually funded, however.



                                                                                         17
approaches. Local capacity-building efforts extended also to environmental dimensions
of subprojects; local government bodies, service providers, and community groups were
trained in environmental protection practices, and environmental assessments were
carried out for a large number of subprojects.

   (ii) Strengthening producer organizations

67.      A second important achievement of the project was to strengthen a large number
of producer organizations. The PAD did not set specific targets with regard to this
objective, but the project financed many activities in this area, with tangible results. For
example, the project helped establish a national federation of rural producers (Conseil
National de Concertation des Producteurs Ruraux du Tchad—CNCPRT), as well as a
series of regional associations. The national federation engages in activities such as
product promotion, training and capacity building, and representation of the membership
in discussions with the government. The federation enjoyed considerable success as long
as it was being supported by ASPOP, but management has expressed fears that its
activities will be curtailed unless a sustainable funding mechanism can be identified.

68.     Similarly, the project provided funds for promoting the development of producer
cooperatives around the cotton ginneries. This initiative was implemented through a
subcontract with CTRC and proceeded in stages. First, 90 trainers were trained in the
principles and practices of cooperative management. These 90 trainers then trained
39,343 cotton growers in 5,935 villages; these growers are members of farmer
associations that represent a population of 240,000 growers. Thanks to these efforts, a
solid basis was established for launching cotton producer cooperatives throughout the
country, but because the initiative was not completed prior to the project closing date,
actual formation of cooperatives has not yet taken place.

   (iii)Funding agricultural research through competitive grants

69.    A third important achievement of the project was to put in place an innovative
program to finance demand-driven, competitively funded agricultural research. Under the
program, a rigorous selection process implemented with the help of independent
evaluators was used to identify 31 priority subproject proposals. Of these, 16 were
funded, and the 13 that were successfully completed produced 25 technical notes destined
for use in the formulation of extension messages. The remaining 3 research subprojects
did not receive all three tranches of funding and could still meet their objectives, if
additional funds can be identified.

   (iv) Promotion of private agricultural extension services

70.    Only with regard to this fourth category of intermediate indicators did the
progress achieved fall short of expectations. Not all of the planned Producer Service
Management Centers (PSMCs) were constructed, and many of those that were
constructed still are not fully operational. As a result, the nation’s private extension




                                                                                         18
network remains underdeveloped, and many of the extension messages developed by the
research system have not been delivered effectively to farmers.

71.      Any evaluation of the achievement of the PDO must also recognize some
shortcomings. As detailed in Annex 2, approximately 45 percent of the subprojects that
were financed under Component 1 received only one or two tranches of financing (out of
three projected tranches), meaning that these subprojects have not been completed. In
addition, limited progress has been achieved with regard to the objectives set for some
activities financed under Component 2. For example, cotton sector institutional reforms
have stalled; several agricultural research projects have not been completed; and efforts
to strengthen private veterinary services have lagged.

Efficiency
(Not applicable for a core ICR)

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
72.     According to the ICR Guidelines, the overall outcome of a project should be rated
based on the extent to which the major objectives were achieved or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Although the project achieved many positive results, since the
outcome targets listed in the PAD have not all been met, the PDO cannot be considered
to have been fully achieved. The overall outcome is therefore rated as moderately
unsatisfactory.

73.    Factors considered in rating the overall outcome of ASPOP include the following:

 • Relevance of project objectives, design, and implementation: The PDO remains
    highly relevant given the development priorities and circumstances prevailing
    today. Agricultural development and diversification of the rural economy remain
    vitally important for the vast majority of Chadians. The project design was
    generally appropriate, even though it contained too many activities, some of which
    were only indirectly linked to the PDO. Implementation was moderately
    satisfactory in spite of an ineffective M&E system, especially in view of the severe
    challenges that arose during the life of the project.
 • Achievement of the development objectives: Based on the available evidence,
    achievement of the PDO is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Productivity
    increases in key commodities for the most part met or exceeded targets specified in
    the PAD, and although no clear target was established for income gains, the
    subprojects that were completed generated significant revenues for project
    beneficiaries. Evaluated at a higher program impact level, there can be no doubt
    that substantial progress was achieved in a number of areas important to agricultural
    and rural development in Chad, for example, building local capacity identify,
    prepare, and process subproject proposals; strengthening producer organizations;
    and successfully managing competitively-financed agricultural research. The


                                                                                      19
     empirical foundation for evaluating changes in yields is, however, weak, and many
     of the income generating projects remained unfinished.
 • Likelihood of completing the project activities started: Mainly because of the shortfall
     in funding, a significant proportion of the subprojects that were started remained
     incomplete at the time of project closing. For this reason, the risk to the
     development outcome is rated as high unless additional funds can be mobilized
     quickly. In view of continuing uncertainties about continued external financing, the
     most likely source of additional funding is the public treasury, since long-awaited
     oil revenues are now finally flowing.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
74.    Analysis of a sample of subprojects suggests that many of the subprojects
financed by ASPOP have increased the income (and presumably improved the welfare)
of more than 20,000 rural households, nearly all of which can be assumed to be poor.

75.     However the overall impact of the project on rural poverty in Chad has not been
evaluated. Rural poverty in Chad is determined by many factors lying outside the
project’s sphere of influence, so isolating the contribution of the project would be
technically challenging.

76.     The project empowered many women and enhanced confidence in their abilities,
as reflected in the 339 subprojects that were formulated by women’s groups and the 146
completed subprojects that were managed by women (see Table A2.4 in Annex 2).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
77.     The project has been an important instrument used by the government to build up
decentralized administrative capacity, specifically through the setting up of local
participatory networks to identify, prepare, and implement subprojects. This capacity
remains in place, and it is available to be used in future to implement participatory rural
development activities. In addition, the project facilitated the establishment of demand-
driven rural advisory services, which, if they can be fully operationalized and sustained,
could become a central force in advancing the agricultural and rural development agenda
in the country. Finally, the project improved the capacity of several government
ministries and agencies.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
78.    An unintended positive impact, not anticipated at the time of project preparation,
was the identification, preparation, and implementation by project-supported
organizations of many subprojects that did more than simply address the productive
needs of rural communities. For example, organizations established under ASPOP were
able to identify, prepare, and implement 86 environmental subprojects financed by the


                                                                                        20
Global Environmental Fund (GEF). These GEF-financed subprojects were accomplished
with the help of a memorandum of understanding negotiated between ASPOP and the
IDA-financed companion project, PROADEL.

Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

79.     Stakeholder workshops. The ICR mission participated in meetings and individual
interviews involving government officials, private sector representatives, development
partners, and NGOs. The results of the consultation process are summarized in Annex 6.

80.     Positive lessons learned under the project as articulated by stakeholders included
the following:

 • Almost all of the stakeholders expressed appreciation for the achievements of the
    project “on the ground.” They strongly endorsed the general approach of the
    project—i.e., bringing development finance to the local level and allowing rural
    communities to decide their priorities in a participatory manner. They also
    recognized that to be effective, the participatory approach needs to be accompanied
    by supporting actions and activities, for example, provision of information, training,
    and technical support.
 • The project sparked enthusiasm and generated self-confidence among local
    communities, encouraged people to organize for their own development,
    strengthened institutional capacity at the local level, allowed new leaders to emerge,
    and provided resources (money and know-how) that previously were not widely
    available in rural areas of Chad. The project also helped bridge the gap that had
    existed between development initiatives launched in the capital, N’djamena, and
    implemented in rural communities.
 • The competitive grant mechanism introduced under the project for funding
    agricultural research resulted in better proposals for more relevant research oriented
    toward the needs of producers. The competitive funding approach opened
    researchers’ eyes to the demands of the marketplace and its priorities, as well to
    means of identifying sources of funds for research.

81.     Negative lessons learned under the project as articulated by stakeholders included
the following:

 • The steep appreciation of the FCFA against the US dollar significantly reduced the
    amount of FCFA-denominated funds available to implement planned activities.
    Many stakeholders felt that the Bank has a role to play in insulating borrowers from
    external shocks.
 • The reduction in the real value of IDA funding was exacerbated by payment delays
    and shortfalls in the government-provided counterpart funding.
 • Political and social instability caused suspensions in payments, disrupted field
    activities, complicated the timely completion of supervision missions, and


                                                                                       21
     precluded full implementation of some project activities. Many project activities
     were subjected to several lengthy suspensions, after which they had to start again
     almost from scratch.
 • The lack of funding needed for subprojects created frustration among potential
    beneficiaries, many of whom made required bank deposits and continue to pay fees
    on their accounts. More than one-half of the subprojects that were prepared did not
    receive funding, and many subprojects that did receive funding received less than
    the amount originally promised.

82.      Beneficiary survey. No beneficiary survey was carried out. This was a
shortcoming, given the weakness of the project M&E system. In the absence of a
beneficiary survey, information about the benefits attributable to the project was
generated through an extensive review exercise carried out with stakeholders during the
ICR mission, as well as a financial profitability analysis of a sample of subprojects (for
details, see Annexes 3 and 6).


Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
83.     The high risk rating reflects an assessment of potential sources of risks and the
mitigating effects of existing arrangements and arrangements likely to be implemented.

84.     Lack of financing needed to complete unfinished subprojects. Achievement of the
PDO will be threatened unless additional financing can be mobilized to allow successful
completion of the many subprojects that are still in progress. At the end of 2008 (three
months after the IDA grant closed), 36 subprojects had received only one tranche of
financing (out of three scheduled tranches), and 421 subprojects had received only two
tranches of financing. In addition, the project owes substantial sums to service providers
who have provided services and who have not yet been paid. The final Bank supervision
mission estimated that approximately US$4.1 million equivalent will be needed to meet
these outstanding commitments, as well as other projected expenses (such as payment of
project staff salaries and operating costs). This figure could rise, as it may not include all
commitments already made to service providers.

85.    Failure of government to honor fully its commitment to provide additional
financing. During the final supervision missions, the financing of uncompleted
subprojects and the clearing of outstanding commitments was discussed with project
management and government officials. The Ministry of Planning promised to include
funds in the 2008 budget to complete unfinished subprojects and to clear all other
outstanding commitments. However, the allocation to ASPOP in the 2008 budget came to
only FCFA 1.6 billion (US$3.4 million equivalent), and of that amount only FCFA 550
million was actually disbursed (US$1.1 million). The risk that the financing gap will not
be covered would appear to be mitigated by the fact that the government remains
supportive of rural development and has promised to make good on the needed funds.


                                                                                           22
Evidence of the government’s commitment to the project can be seen in that it has
continued paying some of the arrears in the counterpart funds to keep the project going.
Still, in view of the government’s earlier failures to finance its share of the project costs,
considerable uncertainty remains as to whether it will make good on these promises.

86.     Uncertain prospects for continued external funding. While some have suggested
that the remaining subprojects could potentially be completed using IDA funds that
would become available under an eventual follow-on operation, considering the long
period that has already elapsed since many of these projects were initiated (more than two
years in some cases), it seems unlikely that funds from an eventual follow-on operation
would become available in time.

87.     Loss of experienced project staff. Because of the tight funding situation, many
trained project staff have not been retained. Some staff based in the project head office
and almost all staff based in the project interregional offices have been laid off (only two
persons have been retained in each of the interregional offices—the regional coordinator
and a maintenance worker). The erosion in implementation capacity will be difficult to
reverse quickly. Even if funds become available to allow the remaining subprojects to be
completed, it may be difficult to rehire the laid-off staff, in which case there would likely
be a substantial delay in restarting the project activities.


Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately satisfactory.
88.    The project design was based on the assumption that getting agriculture going in
one of the poorest countries in the world would not be possible through a narrowly
focused project. Convinced that many constraints would need to be attacked
simultaneously to achieve a successful overall outcome, the team that prepared the
project opted for a multi-component, multi-agency approach. This strategy, while
demanding, was nonetheless reasonable.

89.     Project preparation was adequately supported by the Bank. A Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) was approved, and experienced Bank staff were mobilized to carry out
background analytical work. During preparation, Bank staff interacted closely with the
government and also reached out to potential development partners (although in the end
none of the development partners who were approached joined as co-financiers).

90.    At the time of preparation, the objectives of the project were extremely relevant
with regard to the country’s development needs and fully consistent with the
government’s poverty-reduction strategy. The weaknesses of the country’s institutions at
the time dictated the need to promote development of human capacity at the national,


                                                                                           23
regional, and local levels. The lack of understanding in the capital city of the problems
being experienced in rural areas justified the use of a community-driven development
approach, and the vulnerability of fragile ecosystems on which rural livelihoods depend
warranted the emphasis placed on protecting the environment.

91.     The risk assessment was generally appropriate. The team that prepared the project
cannot have been expected to anticipate the dramatic decline in the value of the US dollar
that later played such a determining role in influencing the performance of the project.
Nor could it have been expected to anticipate the sharp escalation in the cost of many
materials that soon rendered obsolete many of the unit costings used for the preparation
of the project cost tables.

92.     As with all projects, with the benefit of hindsight one can say there are things that
should have been done differently. The project design was very complex, and it could be
argued that the preparation team should have known that implementation was likely to
overwhelm the government’s limited capacity. Similarly, the provisions made for M&E
were inadequate, especially with regard to more challenging tasks such as quantifying
income gains among project beneficiaries and tracking environmental aspects of project-
supported activities. That these shortcomings were not addressed during preparation can
be attributed in part to the fact that there was no formal quality-at-entry review. The only
review of the project design and implementation arrangements occurred during standard
project review meetings and decision meetings.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
93.     Bank supervision of the project was moderately unsatisfactory. Supervision
missions were carried out regularly (except during periods when Bank staff were
prohibited from traveling to the country), and most supervision missions involved
extensive interaction with project management and staff, responsible government
agencies, stakeholders, development partners, and beneficiaries. The teams carrying out
the supervision missions generally included an appropriate mix of seasoned operational
staff and technical specialists. Team members included mainly Bank staff based in the
region, which helped to keep the costs of the missions manageable. The Aides Memoire
prepared by the supervision missions were comprehensive and provided detailed updates
on project accomplishments, diagnosis of emerging problems, and guidance to project
management about how to advance implementation.

94.    Although supervision of the project was generally sound, especially in light of the
challenging circumstances, there were shortcomings in several areas:

 • Implementation performance ratings recorded in ISRs were overly generous in some
     respects. The ratings for most indicators were lowered to MS (moderately
     satisfactory) toward the end of the project when it became apparent that a shortfall
     in funding would prevent timely completion of the project as originally planned, but
     ratings for some indicators should have been lowered sooner, and in some cases


                                                                                          24
     they should have been lowered further based on lagging performance. To the extent
     that some of the ratings appear to have been lenient, this may have been because the
     supervision team received assurances from the Borrower that problems would be
     addressed, but then the Borrower failed to follow up.

 • The weaknesses of some project management functions, especially including the
    M&E system, were flagged repeatedly during supervision missions, but they were
    never resolved. This had dire consequences: in large part because of the weak
    management functions, the supervision team was slow to recognize the severity of
    the funding gap that emerged during implementation. The severity of the funding
    gap was recognized only at the time of the Mid-Term Review, which due to
    disruptions in the implementation schedule took place only 15 months before the
    project closing date. By that time, more than 2,500 subprojects had been approved,
    far more than could be financed with the remaining project funds.

95.     In considering the performance of the supervision team, it is reasonable to ask
why, once the funding gap was recognized and it became evident that achievement of
some targets was jeopardized, the team did not seek to restructure the project or request
additional financing. The team did explore these options with the Country Management
Unit (CMU) and the Sector Management Unit (SMU). The decision at the time was that
the government should be expected to make up the funding shortfall from oil revenues.
Since the government did not do so, the project was left with no recourse.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
96.     Overall Bank Performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. This rating
reflects (a) moderately satisfactory performance in ensuring quality at entry and (b)
moderately unsatisfactory quality of supervision. The Bank can be credited for having
prepared an innovative and relevant project, one that nevertheless had some weaknesses
in design. The Bank can also be credited for having managed to ensure that the project
was continuously supervised during a period of great turmoil when working in Chad was
very challenging, particularly in rural areas. However the supervision team was overly
lenient in assigning performance ratings, and it was slow to recognize the severe funding
shortfall that developed during implementation. Moreover, once the funding shortfall was
recognized, the team could have given greater weight to the risk that the government
would not make good on its promises to make up the longstanding arrears in counterpart
funding.




                                                                                      25
Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
97.     Government performance was mixed. The government made important
contributions both during preparation and during implementation. However it also failed
to live up to some of its obligations, particularly with regard to timely provision of counterpart
funds.

98.     During project identification, the government helped build momentum for the
endorsement of the project concept when it prepared its national poverty reduction
strategy and identified ASPOP as important instrument needed for the implementation of
the strategy.

99.    During project preparation and throughout implementation, the government
provided tangible support by:

  • Requiring ministries that were stakeholders or recipients of project funds to support
     the project’s field activities and participate in the multiagency teams that supervised
     the project.
  • Encouraging development partners that were active in Chad at the time to participate
     in the design and supervision of the project, and encouraging the uptake of the
     project’s implementation practices in other rural development projects.
  • Providing operational support to Bank supervision missions.
  • Introducing incentives to ensure that project staff remained in place throughout
      project implementation.
  • Providing counterpart funds throughout the life of the project (although not at the
      agreed level) and continuing to support selected activities following the formal
      closing of the project.

100. Despite these positive actions, however, the government’s performance in
supporting the project was lacking in three important respects:

  • The amount of counterpart funding provided was less than the amount to which the
     government had committed, and disbursement of counterpart funding was often
     late.
  • The government was slow to acknowledge the financing gap that emerged following
     the appreciation of the FCFA, and when it did acknowledge the gap, it failed to
     mobilize the additional funding needed to implement fully all project activities.
  • The government failed to mobilize the funding needed to initiate timely preparation
     of a follow-on operation.


                                                                                               26
(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory.
101. Implementing agencies performance was mixed as well. The various
implementing agencies, which included the project coordination and management unit
(PCMU), the Ministry of Agriculture (MA), and various organizations and agencies
responsible for implementing key activities—made important contributions both during
preparation and during implementation. However they also failed to live up to some of
their obligations.

102. Positive aspects of the performance of the implementing agencies included the
following:

    • The PCMU was staffed quickly, and it moved aggressively to recruit service
       providers in timely fashion to implement project-supported activities in all regions.3
    • The Ministry of Agriculture consistently provided active support for project
       management.
    • Up until the time that funding constraints set in, a large number of subprojects was
       identified, prepared, and successfully implemented. The implementing agencies
       working on financing competitive research, strengthening cotton cooperatives, and
       building regional and national producer organizations performed particularly well
       for as long as funds were available.
    • All of the implementing agencies conscientiously adhered to a major tenet of the
       project’s strategy by systematically encouraging popular participation and by
       regularly consulting with stakeholders and donors.
    • Toward the end of the project, the PCMU did not shirk from the unpleasant task of
       warning stakeholders about the shortage of funds.
    • After the severity of the funding gap became apparent, the PCMU worked hard
       (although ultimately without success) to mobilize additional financing to complete
       project activities.

103. Despite these positive actions, the performance of the implementing agencies was
lacking in three important respects:

    • The project’s M&E unit was unable to generate all of the information needed for
       management purposes, and even after this was recognized, the PCMU was slow to
       take remedial measures.
    • The project’s financial management unit did not exercise sufficient budget control, in
       the sense that it failed to track subproject applications and ensure that commitments

3
     With regard to both of these tasks, ASPOP benefited from the predecessor project.



                                                                                          27
     could be met using available funds; as a result, many more subprojects were
     prepared and approved than could be financed.
 • Project management did not always ensure service providers were paid on time (or in
     some cases, paid at all).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
104. Overall Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. This rating is
based on the moderately unsatisfactory rating assigned to the performance of the
government and the moderately satisfactory rating assigned to the performance of the
implementing agencies. The choice of the moderately unsatisfactory rating for overall
Borrower performance (the more unfavorable of the two constituent sub-ratings) is based
on the contribution of the borrower’s actions to the overall outcome of the project. One
can nonetheless note that: (i) the national project implementing agency moved
aggressively to recruit service providers in timely fashion to implement project-supported
activities in all regions, and (ii) the national project implementing agency and all of the
regional project implementing agencies conscientiously adhered to a major tenet of the
project’s strategy by systematically encouraging participation of project beneficiaries and
by regularly consulting with stakeholders and donors. This represented a major departure
from previous practice and remains one of the enduring positive legacies of the project.

Lessons Learned
105. A review of the ASPOP experience yields a number of lessons learned, both
positive and negative.

106. Participatory community-driven development can be successful. ASPOP
demonstrated that participatory community-driven development can produce substantial
results, even though it is challenging to organize the extended network of actors needed
at the provincial, district, and community levels. Factors that contributed to the success of
the approach pioneered by ASPOP included (i) the existence of a conducive legal and
regulatory environment allowing decentralized government decision-making; (ii) the
presence of competent service providers; (iii) the ability of the project to implement
effective training and capacity-building programs throughout the network of actors; and
(iv) the formulation of sound development plans characterized by realistic
implementation schedules.

107. Certain types of subprojects were more successful than others. Economic
analysis of a sample of 200 subprojects financed under ASPOP revealed considerable
variability in the profitability of different types of activities. Consistently more profitable
activities included poultry production, rice production, vegetable production,
establishment of banana gardens, and grain milling. Consistently less profitable activities
included production of basic cereals (sorghum, millet, beans, maize), small ruminant
production, and establishment of plant nurseries. The knowledge generated through



                                                                                            28
ASPOP about the profitability of different types of subprojects will be extremely valuable
in informing the design of an eventual follow-on operation.

108. Competitive research funding mechanisms can work even in poor countries.
ASPOP showed that the introduction of competitive funding mechanisms to support
agricultural research can work even in a poor country such as Chad. The competitive
funding mechanisms introduced under the project produced better research proposals and
led to more careful screening of proposals for eventual financing based on broadly
approved criteria that took into account the actual and current needs of the producers. The
approach opened researchers’ eyes to the demands of the marketplace and its priorities, as
well as to means of identifying sources of funds for research. Researchers and research
institutions came together to prepare joint proposals, engage in collaborative research,
and participate in training programs and workshops. The collaborative review and
monitoring process led to better results and papers, some of which were published. In a
few cases, educational degrees were upgraded.

109. Rural development projects must maintain a tight focus on a manageable
agenda. While there is no question that successful rural development requires a multi-
pronged approach, ASPOP showed that project effectiveness is diluted when there are too
many components, subcomponents, and activities. Thus there is a need to maintain a tight
focus on an agenda that is manageable given the constraints on implementation capacity.
Many of ASPOP’s so-called “complementary sub-components” were relatively easy to
implement, but they siphoned attention and energy from the main focus of the project,
which was promoting local development through productivity increases. Examples of
complementary activities include construction of veterinary laboratories, promotion of
private veterinary services, establishment of the “Cellule de cotton,” and financing
regulatory development efforts in the cotton sector.

110. Monitoring and evaluation activities must be linked to project financial
management systems. In the absence of an effective M&E system linked to the project
financial management system, project management and the Bank’s supervision team
remained unaware that many more subprojects were being prepared and approved than
could be funded with the available resources. As a result, the project vastly
overcommitted itself, and a large funding gap emerged that was not detected until late in
the project life cycle. The lesson that emerges is that it is critical to have in place an
M&E system that is linked to the financial management system, so that spending (actual
and commitments) can be tracked in real time. This allows management to be aware of
the balance of remaining funds and reduces the risk of commitments being made for
which funding is no longer available.

111. Privatization of agricultural extension is fraught with difficulties. Attempts
were made under the project to replace the failed public extension system that had been
based on the Training and Visit (T&V) system with a semi-privatized extension system
under which technology transfer functions were to be entrusted to producers associations,
cooperatives, and project-financed Agricultural Service Centers. However the private
service providers proved incapable of transferring the recommended technology packages



                                                                                        29
to farmers. As a result, the impact achieved by the project’s innovative agricultural
research financing mechanism was undermined.

112. There is a danger in overpromising and underdelivering. Early efforts to
publicize the project were very successful. Hundreds of rural communities were informed
about the potential economic, social, and environmental benefits of the project and were
led to believe that they stood a good chance of securing financing to implement
subprojects. Later when it proved impossible to fund all of the subprojects that had been
approved, frustration erupted among those who had prepared subprojects, especially
when beneficiaries had already mobilized their own contribution and deposited it into a
specially created bank account. This created a negative legacy that an eventual follow-on
operation will have to overcome.

      Data on total project costs, denominated in FCFA, were provided by project management. During
      project implementation, large fluctuations occurred in the FCFA:USD exchange rate, making it
      problematic to convert the FCFA-denominated total amounts into USD-denominated total
      amounts. In these tables, the FCFA-denominated amounts provided by project management have
      been converted into USD-denominated amounts using an FCFA:USD exchange rate of 588 for the
      IDA contribution (estimated as a notional “average” exchange rate that prevailed during project
      implementation) and an FCFA:USD exchange rate of 755 for the Borrower and Local
      Communities contributions (the exchange rate prevailing at the time of project approval, when the
      Borrower and Local Community contributions were paid).

1.       Over the life of the project, approximately 1,173 productive investment
subprojects received financing through Component 1 (Table A2.1). This number fell far
short of the appraisal estimate of 3,000, but the appraisal estimate was always somewhat
notional, because the average cost of each subproject could not be known with certainty
at the time of appraisal. The average cost of each subproject ended up being considerably
higher than anticipated, partly because of unanticipated increases in the cost of materials,
and partly because many of the subprojects that were approved were more elaborate than
the model subprojects that had been costed out prior to appraisal. In summary, the project
ended up financing fewer productive investment subprojects than anticipated, but those
that it did finance were more elaborate and yielded greater benefits.

2.       Table A.2.2 provides information about the types of productive investment
subprojects that were financed. The principal types included crop production (mainly
rice, groundnuts and sorghum), vegetable production, livestock production (small
ruminants, pigs, and poultry), grain milling, grain storage, and diverse non-agricultural
activities (sewing, ironworking, petty trading).

3.       As previously noted, not all subprojects financed by the project were completed.
Because of the funding gap that emerged, a significant number of subprojects received
only one tranche or two tranches of the planned three tranches of financing. Of the 1,186
subprojects4 that were financed and for which funding data are available, 652 subprojects
(55 percent) received all three tranches of funding and were completed. Of the remaining
subprojects, 290 subprojects (24 percent) received two tranches of financing, and 244
subprojects (21 percent) received only one tranche of financing. Generally speaking, the
rate of subproject completion rate was higher in the three regions in which project
activities were launched in Year 1 (Bongor, Mongo, and N’Djamena).

      This number includes the 1,173 productive investment subprojects referred to earlier, as well as 13
      private sector and capacity building subprojects.

4.      These data on the numbers and types of subprojects funded by the project provide
important insights that help to understand the project achievements. The picture that
emerges is mixed. Clearly the project ended up financing fewer subprojects than was
projected at appraisal (and although cost data are presented here, the average cost of each
subproject that was funded ended up being significantly higher than projected). This was
not necessarily a problem, however. In view of the demand-driven nature of the project,
the fact that the appraisal estimates of subproject numbers and costs turned out to be wide
of the mark is not entirely surprising, since there was no way to predict with certainty
what types of subprojects would be proposed, and since the average cost of different
types of subprojects varied considerably.

5.      What was a problem, however, is that many subprojects did not receive the full
three tranches of funding and consequently were not completed during the life of the
project. Without question, had these subprojects been completed, the impact of the
project would have been greater.

6.      Table A2.4 summarizes progress achieved against the key performance indicators.
What is impressive is that despite the lower-than-projected number of subprojects (and
the even lower number of completed subprojects), the PDO indicators were largely
achieved for the microprojects assessed. This speaks to the significant productivity
increases and income gains generated by the subprojects that were completed, as well as
to the robustness of the overall project design, as evidenced by the fact that the projected
benefits were substantially achieved even in the face of unanticipated implementation
problems.

7.     To provide a more complete picture of the project outcomes, additional
information is provided below concerning the achievement of the two PDO indicators: (i)
productivity increases in key commodities produced by project beneficiaries, and (ii)
income gains realized by project beneficiaries.

Productivity increases in key commodities
8.      Information about productivity increases resulting from project-supported
subprojects was generated through an evaluation of a sample of subprojects carried out in
2008 by the project M&E unit. Data were collected from a sample of 200 randomly
selected subprojects, representing 16 percent of all subprojects that were financed (fully
or partly) by ASPOP. The sampled subprojects can be considered representative of the
subprojects supported under the project. However because a random sampling procedure
was used, the sample included few examples or no examples of several types of
subprojects that were present in the overall population in very small numbers (e.g., cotton
production, milk production, maize production). In retrospect, it would have been better
to have used some sort of purposive sampling strategy to ensure that the evaluation
sample included a minimum number of all major types of subprojects.

9.      Most of the producer organizations that implemented subprojects financed by the
project achieved substantial increases in agricultural productivity. Table A2.5 presents
productivity increases in the commodities listed in PAD as performance indicators, as
well as for several other commodities noted as important during project implementation.

Income gains realized by project beneficiaries
10.    The same survey of a sample of 200 subprojects carried out in 2008 by the project
M&E unit to estimate agricultural production increases also evaluated the income
generated by subprojects for beneficiaries. The results are given in Table A2.6.

11.    Based on the data in Table A2.6, completed subprojects funded under Component
1 are estimated to have benefited 20,578 rural households. Assuming an average of six
family members per household, the total number of beneficiaries is estimated to have
exceeded 123,000 individuals.

12.    The average annual net revenue generated by subprojects financed under
Component 1 is estimated to have totaled FCFA 66,780 (US$132.5) per household, or
FCFA 11,130 (US$22.08) per person. With average annual per capita income in Chad
estimated at US$133, this represents a 16.6 percent increase in annual income.

          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
   1. Economic and financial analysis is not required for Core ICRs, and no overall
      financial and economic analyses were prepared at project closing. However,
      because the profitability of subproject investments will be an important factor
      taken into account when the time comes to consider a potential follow-on
      operation, information about the profitability of subprojects is presented below.

Profitability of project-financed subprojects
   2. Information about the profitability of project supported subprojects was generated
      through an impact assessment carried out for the government by an independent
      consultant after the project was completed. The impact assessment was carried out
      by an international consultant recruited by the government to prepare the
      government’s own evaluation of the project.

   3. Because of time constraints, as well as security restrictions that prevented the
      consultant from visiting all regions of the country, the sample of eight subprojects
      selected for the in-depth impact assessment was not representative for the entire
      population of subprojects. The eight subprojects selected for in-depth analysis
      came from only three provinces—Bongor, Mongo, and N’Djamena. However
      since these three provinces were those in which the first three ASPOP
      Interregional Coordination Units were established, the eight subprojects that were
      selected were representative of mature subprojects. No partly financed,
      incomplete subprojects were included in the sample.

   4. The consultant visited the eight subprojects in the sample and collected detailed
      information about costs (investment costs and operational costs) and revenues
      (calculated based on production and sales). The profitability calculations assumed
      an active life of 10 years for each subproject. The analysis was carried out using
      real prices, i.e., no inflation was factored in.

   5. Internal rates of return (IRR) calculated for the eight subprojects under a range of
      assumptions are presented in Table A3.1. Under the baseline scenario (Row 1),
      the highest IRR (95%) was generated by a dressmaking workshop (this workshop
      is operated by a group of 12 women). The other seven subprojects in the sample
      generated baseline IRRs ranging from 25 percent to 63 percent. These IRRs are
      significantly higher than the IRRs that were projected at appraisal.

   6. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine whether the IRRs are sensitive to
      changes in subproject costs and revenues. The results presented in Rows 2-9 show
      that all of the IRRs remain positive even if costs increase by 5 percent, 10 percent,
      or 15 percent. The same is true if revenues decline by the same proportions. Even
      if costs increase and revenues decline simultaneously by 10 percent, the IRR for
      only one subproject (irrigated rice) turns negative.

       7. Summary of key findings. The impact assessment concluded that most subprojects
          financed under the project were successful. Since financing of subprojects was the
          single largest activity funded under the project (accounting for 45 percent of total
          project costs), the fact that most subprojects were successful suggests that a major
          component of the project generated the expected results. To give a better idea of
          size of the economic benefits, the impacts assessment study estimated that about
          120,000 persons benefited from the subprojects (roughly 20,600 households
          averaging six persons each), about 2,900 seasonal jobs were created, and about
          FCFA 1,4 billion (about US$2.8 million) of value-added was generated.

       8. The impacts assessment concluded that project-supported subprojects contributed
          directly or indirectly to improvements in the welfare of thousands of rural
          households. A significant proportion of the beneficiaries were women, who
          benefited especially from the many subprojects that were managed and operated
          by women (e.g., dressmaking and cereal processing). Women benefited also from
          the many so-called “mixed” subprojects (e.g., rice production, irrigated vegetable
          production, small-scale livestock production, machinery workshops).

    Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
1. St     akeholder workshops
The ICR mission met with key stakeholder representatives in individual or small group
sessions. Stakeholders met included the following:

 (a)    the Director General and other senior officials of the Ministry of Agriculture,
        which is the supervising ministry for the project and which chairs the Steering
        Committee,
 (b)    the Directors General and other senior officials of the line ministries that were
        directly involved with the project (e.g., the Ministries of Planning, Livestock, and
        Environment);
 (c)    the Coordinator of the Cellule Permanente that is in charge of monitoring of all
        externally financed projects;
 (d)    officials of semi-public agencies and parastatals, including the CTRC (the center
        charged with monitoring cotton sector reforms) and several agricultural research
        centers;
 (e)    ASPOP management and senior staff;
 (f)    staff of ASPOP Interregional Coordination Units;
 (g)    private sector operators (Operateurs de Proximité and prestataires de service);
 (h)    producer associations and their national apex organizations; and
 (i)    the development partners that are most active in rural development in Chad (EU,
        SCAC, World Bank).

2. M      ethodology
Stakeholders were asked the following key questions:

   •    What was the relationship of your ministry/agency/organization vis-à-vis the
        project? In other words, how did your ministry/agency/organization engage with
        the project?
   •    What were the most significant results/achievements of the project?
   •    What were the main problems              encountered    that   negatively   affected
        implementation of the project?
   •    What are the most important lessons learned from the project and its
        implementation that can help to inform the design of a follow-on project in Chad,
        or similar projects in other countries?




                                                                                          49
3.       Main achievements
Almost all of the stakeholders interviewed expressed appreciation for the achievements
of the project. They strongly endorsed the general approach of the project—i.e., bringing
development finance to the local level and helping rural communities to decide priorities
in a participatory manner. They also recognized that in order to be effective, the
participatory approach needs to be accompanied by supporting actions and activities, for
example, provision of information, training, and technical support. Public agencies,
private firms, and NGOs all have roles to play in providing these supporting actions and
activities.

The stakeholders reported that the project had generated benefits in a number of areas:

     •   The project brought a new approach to the fight against the poverty in Chad, one
         that has been successfully integrated into the government’s strategic planning and
         decentralization effort (PS; DP). It mobilized donors that are active in the rural
         development field to coordinate better around a common set of decentralized,
         participatory approaches (DP).
     •   The project stimulated an entirely new level of enthusiasm and self-esteem in
         rural communities. It facilitated the establishment of many local community
         organizations and mobilized these organizations to participate in their own
         development. It built up local capacity and allowed new leaders to emerge. It
         provided resources (financing and know-how) that previously had been
         unavailable to most rural communities in the country (NPMCU; IRPCU; PSO;
         PS).
     •   The project instilled confidence in rural communities to take the initiative to act in
         their own interest. Previously rural communities had been used to waiting for
         government or donor-led projects to come to them (the top-down approach).
         ASPOP was the first large-scale project to stimulate rural development efforts at
         the grass-roots level. The project serves as an example for the government and
         donors on how to foster community-led local development (IRCMU; DP).
     •   The project built capacity at the local level for long-term development (DP). It
         organized and trained a large number of people in participatory democratic
         approaches (more than 2,500 groups were trained to draw up prioritized lists of
         development needs and to prepare subproject proposals for the leading priorities)
         (IRCMU; PO; PS). It trained Operateurs de Proximité, staff of IRCMUs, and
         members of coordination bodies and subproject approval committees (NPCMU;
         PS; PSO).
     •   The project organized a large number of workshops, seminars, and conferences on
         rural development-related topics at all levels, from the national level to the village
         level to the organization level (NPCMU, IRCMU; PSO).




                                                                                            50
     •   The project improved the effectiveness of the Government’s technical ministries
         by bringing in the appropriate technical resources to support the local subprojects
         and facilitate supervision (PS, NPCMU).
     •   The project facilitated the acquisition by government agencies, service providers,
         and beneficiaries of information technology and materials. It financed the creation
         of policies, manuals, and documents of good quality (including a new version of
         the Strategy for Reducing Poverty) that were widely used in training and
         implementing the project activities (NPCMU; IRCMU; PS; SPA).
     •   The project financed the establishment of the country’s first competitive
         agricultural research program. It funded 16 research proposals and monitored
         their implementation (SPA; NPCMU). The program has generated 25 technical
         messages (fiches techniques). Trained a large number of researchers in preparing
         competitive funding proposals (SP).
     •   The project introduced new income-generating activities into the country’s
         Sahelian zones, including aquaculture and poultry production (IRCMU; PSO). All
         of the subprojects that were fully funded generated significant income gains for
         the beneficiaries (PS, PSO).
     •   The project facilitated establishment at the regional and national levels of
         organizations that could lobby effectively for producer organizations and other
         community groups. It financed the launching of agricultural service centers and
         paid for the revision of national by-laws to govern the activities of these
         organizations (PO).
     •   The project facilitated the establishment of local radio stations dedicated to
         disseminating rural development-oriented information and other content of
         interest to rural audiences (PO, NPCMU).
     •   The project successfully identified potential members of producer cooperatives
         (originally the idea was to concentrate on cooperatives for cotton producers only,
         but the focus later expanded to include other crops). It provided training in basic
         principles of cooperative organization and management (unfortunately these
         activities failed to lead to the establishment of any new cooperatives) (SPA, PS).
     •   The project funded many environmental protection and improvement activities,
         including introduction of environmentally friendly crops and trees (such as gum
         arabic), reforestation schemes, enforcement of environmental standards relating to
         irrigation infrastructure, mosquito eradication programs, and integrated pest
         management schemes for agriculture (PS).
     •   The project financed training for project environmental staff and built capacity to
         carry out systematic environmental assessments of proposed subprojects (PS).
     •   The project strengthened the government’s capacity to plan and implement
         effective M&E activities, especially at the field level (PS, PSO).

4.       Problem areas and difficulties



                                                                                         51
Stakeholders also recognized that a number of problems had arisen during
implementation that would best be avoided in any eventual follow-operation.

   •   Delays in the disbursement of government counterpart funding resulted in
       frequent disruptions to the project implementation schedule, delaying the timely
       implementation many field activities and causing the eventual abandonment of
       others. Many subprojects that were forced to endure long months of suspension
       due to lack of funding later had start again almost from scratch (NPCMU;
       IRCMU; SPA; PS).
   •   The fact that the government did not provide the full amount of counterpart
       funding added to the shortfall that had resulted from the unanticipated devaluation
       of the dollar against the FCFA. Because of the funding, many approved
       subprojects did not receive the full amount of financing, and many other approved
       subprojects did not receive any financing at all.
   •   The dramatic weakening of the US dollar reduced the amount of FCFA-
       denominated funds available for project activities by approximately 35 percent
       compared to the amount estimated at appraisal (PS, SPA; NPCMU; PO).
   •   Several shareholders expressed the view that World Bank exacerbated the
       problems caused by the government’s unpredictable disbursement schedule by
       suspending disbursements during periods when its relations with the government
       had soured.
   •   The quantity and sometimes the quality of technical assistance provided to the
       project by the line ministries was sometimes inadequate, especially the technical
       assistance relating to management of water resources (PS).
   •   Excellent extension packages came out of the competitive research programs, but
       often the extension service proved incapable of transferring the packages to
       significant numbers of farmers. Efforts to replace the earlier Training and Visit
       System with a system of private service providers have not worked (PS, SPA).
   •   The cost projections during project preparation and reviewed at appraisal were
       unrealistic. The parameters used to develop the cost tables were too conservative,
       resulting in consistent underestimation of subproject costs. As a result, the
       projected numbers of subprojects to be financed was too large, and more
       subprojects were planned than could eventually be financed.
   •   Because the projected numbers of subprojects to be financed was too large, the
       targets for key project performance indicators were set too high. Thus, there was
       no possibility to attain the target numbers in subprojects and some other indicators
       (NPCMU).
   •   Project management and World Bank supervision teams were slow to address the
       disconnect between the number of planned subprojects and the amount of
       available financing. The total estimated cost of the project at pre-appraisal was
       nearly double the amount of the approved IDA credit, but the performance targets
       were not changed. The widening gap between subproject commitments and the



                                                                                        52
         amount of available financing would have warranted a restructuring of the project
         or at least an adjustment of some of the performance targets, but the possibility of
         restructuring was raised only at the time of the Mid-Term Review, which came
         very late in the project cycle, only 15 months before the closing date (SPA;
         IRCMU).
     •   The lack of funding generated a lot of frustration among potential beneficiaries,
         many of whom had mobilized their own required contributions and deposited the
         funds into bank accounts, where they were accumulating fees (PO; PS; IRCMU;
         PSO).
     •   Implementation of many subprojects was delayed by late payments to Operateurs
         de Proximité (ODP) and other service providers. Many ODP and service
         providers have not yet been paid for their services.
     •   The funding shortfall experienced by the project has still not been resolved.
         Currently the project is still in arrears on payments to ODPs to the tune of
         FCFA700 million.
     •   The project paid for the establishment of the Cellule Permanente and supported
         its operational costs during an agreed two-year start-up period. Since that time,
         however, the government has failed to provide adequate operational funds for the
         agency. The government-provided annual allocation is only FCFA50 million
         (US$100,000 equivalent), well less than required (SPA).
     •   The performance of the bodies that have been created to provide support services
         to producer organizations remains unknown. Regional Coordinators (and
         supervision missions) have visited many of these bodies, but no systematic audit
         of their performance has been carried out at the national level (NPCMU).
     •   The flow of funds was slow at all levels. Replenishments requests addressed to
         the World Bank took a long time to be honored (the average processing time
         exceeded six weeks), even though the Financial Monitoring System was supposed
         to speed up disbursements. Transactions between the central NPCMU and the
         regional IRCMUs and subprojects also frequently took weeks or even months,
         usually because the needed supporting documents had not been provided (PSO,
         NPCMU).

5.       Lessons learned
Based on the positive achievements of the project but also in recognition of the problem
areas and difficulties, stakeholder identified a lessons learned in a number of areas.

Improved donor coordination and harmonization
     •   ASPOP has played an extremely influential role in Chad in introducing a new
         approach to the fight against the poverty, one that has been successfully integrated
         into the government’s strategic planning and decentralization effort (PS; DP). It
         has mobilized donors that are active in the rural development field to coordinate



                                                                                          53
       better around a common set of decentralized, participatory approaches (DP; SPA;
       PS).
   •   PNDP has provided a platform for extensive discussions among international and
       national development partners and therefore has facilitated a certain degree of
       harmonization of external assistance in the rural development field. Development
       partners have actively reviewed and commented on project-generated documents,
       and they have adapted many guidelines and policies for use in their own
       programs.
   •   Collaboration with others in the field generally has been satisfactory. For
       example, FAO has provided technical expertise in the irrigation subsector.
       However, not all donor-funded projects and programs have been able to
       collaborate seamlessly with ASPOP. The effectiveness of ASPOP would have
       been enhanced through better collaboration with other donor-funded projects and
       programs, especially in zones where both were active.
   •   Thanks in part to strong leadership exhibited by PNDP, an impressive level of
       collaboration has been achieved among the implementing agencies. The
       teamwork between partners and the information flows that PNDP have fostered
       have been substantial and have allowed different development partners to feel that
       they are working toward a common goal and essentially using the same approach
       (DP).
Project design
   •   The project design was exceedingly complex, to the extent that it seriously
       challenged the government’s limited implementation capacity. The project should
       have focused on a smaller geographical area and restricted itself to a sub-set of
       core activities. The “Christmas tree” nature of the project design drew attention
       away from the main focus (IRCMU).
Project financial management
   •   Suspensions of disbursements by the World Bank slow down implementation
       progress, increase costs (because activities must be repeated), and compress the
       implementation time line. Therefore with projects such as ASPOP, the World
       Bank should be favorably disposed to grant extension requests, possibly along
       with approval of supplemental funding (PS; NPCMU). Alternatively, the World
       Bank should be favorably disposed to approve follow-on operations (all
       respondents).
   •   Late payment and non-payment of service providers was a chronic problem.
       Measures must be found to ensure that in future contractual conditions will be
       respected by the project and especially by project beneficiaries in charge of
       implementing subprojects. Operateurs de Proximité and other service providers
       must be paid and paid in timely fashion. One option would be to allow payments
       to be made by the project directly to the service providers (PSO).
   •   With the objective of ensuring equitable treatment for all service providers,
       ASPOP introduced a standardized country-wide payment schedule for the


                                                                                      54
       preparation and implementation of subproject costs. This turned out to be unfair,
       because the cost structure differed significantly in different parts of the country.
   •   Shocks stemming from global economic downturns, dramatic and unanticipated
       changes in the exchange rate, suspensions of World Bank lending programs for
       political or other reasons, and other external factors pose a heavy burden when
       they must be borne should by the Borrower alone. In the case of ASPOP, such
       shocks reduced the amount of FCFA-denominated project funds by nearly 33
       percent. Some stakeholders expressed the view that if the World Bank is a real
       partner in development, it should be willing to do more to help Borrowers in
       finding solutions (SPA).
Local capacity building
   •   Local communities benefited tremendously from the training and capacity
       building provided by the project. This empowered them to become organized,
       identify development priorities in their own communities, prepare development
       plans, and prepare and implement subprojects identified in the development plans
   •   Many local organizations that were awarded project-supported subprojects were
       initially unfamiliar with competitive bidding procedures such as those required for
       selection of service providers. Although introduction of the competitive bidding
       procedures in some cases delayed the initiation of field work, use of the
       procedures has enabled the organizations to choose the best and least expensive
       NGOs to carry out the field activities (NPCMU; PSO).
Competitive funding for agricultural research
   •   The competitive grant mechanism introduced under the project for funding
       agricultural research resulted in better proposals for more relevant research
       oriented toward the needs of producers. This approach also opened researchers’
       eyes to the demands of the marketplace and its priorities, as well to means of
       identifying sources of funds for research. Researchers and research institutions
       often were brought together to prepare joint proposals, engage in collaborative
       research, and participate in training programs and workshops (PS; SPO).
   •   Adaptive research, no matter how good, will have limited impact if the research
       results are not widely adopted. In Chad, the recommended technical packages
       coming out of the research program have not yet been taken by significant
       numbers of farmers. Efforts to replace the earlier Training and Visit System with
       a system of private service providers have not worked (PS, SPA).

   Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments
                      on Draft ICR
  Le Projet d’Appui aux Services Agricoles et aux Organisations de Producteurs (PSAOP) a
  démarré ses activités le 1er décembre 2003, suite au recrutement du personnel clé de
  l’Unité Nationale. C'est un projet d'envergure nationale avec six (6) Unités Inter
  Régionales installées à N’Djaména, Bongor, Mongo, Doba, Abéché et Faya. L'objectif de
  développement du projet est d'accroître la productivité agricole et le revenu en milieu
  rural, tout en préservant les ressources naturelles de base.

  Ce document a pour objectif de dégager les principales réalisations physiques et
  financières, les résultats enregistrés et les niveaux de performance atteints et de tirer les
  leçons.

I. NIVEAU D’EXECUTION ET D’ATTEINTE DES OBJECTIFS DU PSAOP

  1.1 Investissements productifs

  Le projet a financé 1,186 microprojets dont 1,173 sous projets, 10 Centres de Services et
  de Gestion (CSG), et 3 radios communautaires sur une prévision de 3,000 sous projets,
  47 CSG, et 3 radios communautaires.

  Les 1,186 sous-projets financés sont repartis comme suit: Bongor (298), Mongo (284),
  N’Djaména (289), Doba (183), Faya-Largeau (47) et Abéché (85).

  244 SPP attendent la deuxième et la troisième tranche de financement alors que 290
  attendent la troisième tranche. Ce qui fait qu’il reste à débourser la deuxième tranche
  pour 244 SPP et la troisième tranche pour 534 SPP.

  Le processus est très pertinent au regard de l’intérêt porté par les communautés; en
  terme d’efficacité, les couts unitaires des sous-projets ont été sous-évalués, et la
  répartition géographique de sous projets est défavorable aux UIRCGP de la deuxième
  année. La participation des femmes a été satisfaisante, de même que le développement
  des relations fonctionnelles entre les OPs et les IMF.

  Ces projets sont très rentables d’après l’étude, et l’analyse de sensibilité montre
  l’absence de risques potentiels

  Une pertinence évidente, une efficacité et une efficience moyenne, une rentabilité très
  intéressante et une durabilité assurée pour des sous-projets qui répondent aux
  préoccupations urgentes des populations bénéficiaires.

  1.2 Programme de Recherche sur Base Compétitive




                                                                                            56
Les sous projets PRBC ont été mis en œuvre sur la base de contrat de services avec des
institutions publiques et privées en équipes de recherche; les producteurs ont été
impliqués à l’identification, l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre des sous projets.

Sur les 31 sous projets sélectionnés 16 sont effectivement financés dont 13 exécutés de
manière satisfaisante, et 3 réorientés. Les 13 sous projets mis en œuvre ont permis de
générer 25 fiches techniques.

Le dispositif mis en place a développé un esprit de compétition chez les chercheurs avec
pour conséquence le développement de la culture de l’excellence scientifique.

Le processus qui rapproche la recherche et les producteurs est très pertinent, et son
efficacité est prouvé au regard des résultats obtenus.

Une pertinence garantie, une efficacité incontestable mais une efficience très moyenne
et un impact et une durabilité qui laissent des doutes.

1.3 Assistance Technique aux OPs

•   Un réseau privé d’opérateurs de proximité et de prestataires de service opérationnel;
•   Une faitière des producteurs mise en place et participant aux processus de prise de
    décision.
•   Un outil d’information et de communication pour les communautés en cours
    d’opérationnalisation, avec 02 Radios communautaires opérationnelles à Kélo et
    Gounou-Gaya, et une en phase d’installation à Amtiman (bâtiment construit, marché
    des équipements non achevé).
Des activités d’une pertinence indiscutable, d’une efficacité incontestable pour le
CNCPRT et les radios communautaires appuyées, une efficience qui reste bonne mais
une durabilité qui reste fragile.

Les performances des ODP et des prestataires sont faibles, en dépit de leurs rôles
stratégiques.

1.4 Appui à la Réforme de la filière Coton

•   L’adjudication du marché de l’audit technique et financier de la Coton Tchad est
    effective.
•   Installation des coopératives de producteurs dans 5,935 villages de la zone coton au
    cours du premier semestre 2007. Ces coopératives sont en cours de formalisation pour
    accueillir la réforme.
Une activité des plus pertinentes, mais une efficacité des plus nuancée.

1.5 Renforcement des Capacités du Secteur Public



                                                                                        57
Au niveau du secteur public, l’appui du projet a permis la publication régulière de
statistiques sur le secteur agricole et la mise en place d’une Centrale d’information sur le
Secteur Rural (Cellule Permanente).

Le Projet appuie l’ITRAD et le LRVZ dans l’exécution des thèmes prioritaires de
recherche thématique, lesquels thèmes n’ont pas été correctement achevés; les résultats
de leur mise en œuvre sont faiblement satisfaisants.

Au niveau des Ministères Techniques l’appui a permis la mise en le renforcement des
capacités des agents pour l’élaboration des plans et budgets et d’une base de données
documentaire; le suivi des programme et projets de développement; et le recueil des
données statistiques; la production d’annuaires statistiques et d’annuaires SIM (Système
d’Information sur les Marchés); la mise en œuvre du Recensement Général de l’Elevage
et de l’Agriculture et la préparation d’un Plan National pour le Développement de
l’Elevage.

Ces services ont, par ailleurs, contribué à la définition des stratégies sectorielles de lutte
contre la pauvreté, et à l’opérationnalisation de la Centrale d’information sur le Secteur
Rural.

Un outil de suivi du secteur très pertinent, mais non encore opérationnel sur le terrain.
Les activités de recherche thématique, bien que très réduits, n’ont pas été concluants:
manque d’efficacité, absence d’efficience et de durabilité.

1.6 Développement du Secteur Privé

Au premier janvier 2008, 10 CSG sur 15 prévus sont en cours de financement, mais non
encore opérationnels compte tenu des ruptures de financement.

Une pertinence incontestable, une efficacité encore douteuse, une efficience qui aurait
pu être démontrée moyennant un allongement du temps et des ressources
additionnelles, la durabilité du CSG opérationnel incontestable.

Les activités de renforcement des capacités des vétérinaires privés n’ont finalement pas
été initiées en raison de l’achèvement tardif des activités préparatoires et de difficultés
financières du Projet.

Une pertinence certaine des objectifs mais une efficacité et une efficience très moyenne
et un impact très mineur.

1.7 Appui à la Gestion du Projet

Le dispositif institutionnel est parfaitement adapté et d’une grande pertinence, d’une
efficacité réelle avec des nuances d’une UIRCGP à l’autre; mais l’efficience qui aurait pu
être bien meilleure, si les ressources supplémentaires avaient été dégagées et si une
meilleure affectation des ressources disponibles avait été envisagée à temps, la succession



                                                                                           58
des suspensions, la tenue tardive de l’évaluation mi-parcours, la sous-évaluation initiale
des activités, le déblocage tardif de la contre partie nationale et la décision précipitée de
remettre en cause l’option de financements complémentaires en est une cause suffisante.

Suivi-évaluation: Des résultats assez décevants

Un système peu efficace et peu efficient de remontée et d’analyse des données. Sur un
plan général, on constate: (i) Une certaine incohérence au niveau de pilotage du système
de suivi évaluation dans son ensemble; (ii) Une insuffisance au niveau de l’analyse des
indicateurs et données collectées pour créer des conditions favorables à un pilotage
efficace du Projet; (iii) Une grande déficience dans la maîtrise des logiciels de suivi
évaluation rendant difficile la production des tableaux de bord.

1.8 Conclusion

L’étude d’évaluation indépendante des résultats et impacts du Projet comanditée en mars
2009 a tiré les conclusions suivantes:

   1.   Une nouvelle approche qui responsabilise des bénéficiaires. L’approche utilisée
        dans le cadre du PSAOP permet de responsabiliser les populations des
        communautés et collectivités rurales dans le choix de leur développement en les
        impliquant dès l’identification des idées de sous-projets et leur permettant d’en
        assurer la gestion en s’appuyant sur des instruments d’appui et de conseils qu’ils
        ont eux-mêmes sélectionnés et contractualisés. Cette approche nouvelle de
        promotion du développement accompagne de manière efficace le processus de
        décentralisation.

   2.   Des acquis incontestables. Sur un plan général la mission a constaté que les acquis
        du PSAOP sont nombreux et méritent d’être renforcés et poursuivis dans le cadre
        d’une intervention ultérieure qui ciblerait essentiellement les OP dans une
        démarche similaire de réponse à la demande avec un accompagnement
        professionnel d’OdP préalablement formées.

   3.   La réalisation des Sous-projets Productifs: Une réussite. L’étude entreprise, même
        si elle a recherché à analyser toutes les activités s’est essentiellement concentrée
        sur la réalisation des sous-projets qui constituait la partie prédominante et
        essentielle de ce “Projet PSAOP.” Les sous-projets ont de manière directe ou
        indirecte contribué à l’amélioration des conditions de vie des populations. Qu’il
        s’agisse des sous-projets de couture, de coiffure, de moulin à céréales … qui ont
        surtout été pris en charge et gérés par les femmes seules, ou de ceux de forges,
        aménagements rizicoles, maraichages, élevage porcins, qui ont été entrepris par
        des OP mixtes, ils ont tous eu un impact significatif en matière de lutte contre la
        pauvreté rurale.

   4.   Des Sous-Projets productifs dégageant une rentabilité économique inattendue. Les
        travaux d’analyse de la rentabilité économique de ces sous-projets, a montré que



                                                                                          59
      les choix et dimensionnements des investissements étaient en général adéquats et
      que l’utilisation des fonds disponibles tendait à être optimale, les taux rencontrés
      allaient bien au delà des prévisions. On pourrait reprocher un excès de sélection
      de sous-projets dans certaines UIRCGP qui ont abouti à des suspensions à l’issue
      de la 1ére ou de la 2eme tranche, limitant ainsi certes les dérapages ultérieurs mais
      compromettant une utilisation rationnelle des ressources dont disposait le Projet.

5.    Un rôle stratégique des CDS à pérenniser. L’importance du rôle joué par les
      Comité Départementaux de Sélection (CDS), dont les membres doivent pouvoir
      se retrouver au sein des nouveaux Comités Département de Développement, peut
      certainement être accrue et professionnalisée par le recours systématique à des
      commissions techniques ad-hoc performantes.

6.    Un dispositif d’appui-conseil original, adapté et que se sont appropriés les OP: les
      CSG. Le dispositif de mise en place de CSG a montré qu’il était porteur, pour
      autant qu’il puisse s’adresser à des OP structurées et déjà bénéficiaires de sous-
      projets productifs. L’intensification de ce dispositif dans le cadre d’un autre Projet
      doit être envisagé sérieusement.

7.    LE PRBC: un mécanisme à pérenniser en adoptant des mesures prudentielles. en
      s’assurant au préalable que les destinataires finaux des travaux de recherche sont
      bien les OP et que l’aboutissement ne peut être que cette appropriation par les OP
      qui doit être la partie fondamentale et indispensable du processus. Le budget
      alloué à l’accompagnement et au suivi des chercheurs ne doit pas atteindre des
      proportions démesurées au risque de compromettre de manière définitive cette
      approche pourtant porteuse de résultats. Le rattachement du PRBC au dispositif
      institutionnel de recherche agricole est indispensable et sa pérennité ne peut être
      assurée qu’à travers la constitution d’un “Fonds National de Recherche
      Compétitive Multi-bailleurs” qui fait encore défaut.

8.    La Cellule Permanente: un outil au service des décideurs non suffisamment
      valorisé. Il est regrettable que les dispositions adéquates n’aient pas été prises par
      le Gouvernement pour assurer la pérennité des actions structurantes qui
      s’inscrivent dans la durée telle que la Cellule Permanente qui devrait devenir à
      terme le pôle de réflexion et d’orientation et de pilotage du secteur.

9.    Un appui aux Services publics peu performant. L’appui et les actions de
      renforcement de capacité apportés aux services de l’administration ont montré
      l’absence d’impact réel du fait d’un saupoudrage inefficace. Il conviendrait de
      porter une attention particulière à ce renforcement des capacités de
      l’administration a travers d’un Projet spécifique qui ne mélange pas le productif et
      l’administration.

10.   La nécessité d’une diversification des activités en zone cotonnière. La pérennité
      des filières coton semble compromise, tant au Tchad qu’ailleurs en Afrique et
      s’orienter vers une diversification des productions dans une zone ou d’autres



                                                                                         60
              cultures annuelles peuvent avoir leur place doit constituer ne priorité. L’action de
              la CTRC aurait pu avoir tout son effet si cette faitière avait pu être créée qui aurait
              donné beaucoup plus de poids et un fond structuré aux producteurs de la région
              qu’ils soient producteurs de coton, d’arachide ou d’autres spéculations.

        11.    Un dispositif de suivi évaluation à soigner pour l’avenir. Il est enfin dommage
              que par manque d’informations concernant l’exploitation courante, tous les
              avantages économiques des sous-projets n’aient pu être estimés au fur et à mesure
              de leur mise en exploitation ou l’ont été très approximativement. La conception
              d’outils simplifiés de suivi de l’exploitation des aménagements rizicoles, des
              aménagements maraichers, des unités de transformation, des forges etc. auraient
              du donner de tels résultats exploitables et transposables au bénéfice du Projet. Les
              quelques analyses faites au cours de la mission sur des échantillons le prouvent de
              manière incontestable.

        12.   Une durée minimale de 6 années nécessaire: la contrainte d’un tel type de Projet.
              Enfin la poursuite d’un tel Projet ou de tout autre Projet similaire qui pourrait
              suivre, ne peut, au risque de déstabiliser les populations en place, s’inscrire sur
              une période inférieure à six années pour autant que celle-ci ne soit pas
              entrecoupée de plusieurs périodes de suspension intérimaires. Il devra par ailleurs
              s’équiper d’un instrument et de moyens adaptés de suivi évaluation tant au niveau
              national que régional qui permettront de piloter les activités, de prendre les
              décisions opportunes et de capitaliser pour l’avenir, ce que n’a malheureusement
              pas fait le Projet qui s’achève.

       Les sous projets PRBC ont été mis en œuvre sur la base de contrat de services avec des
       institutions publiques et privées en équipes de recherche ; les producteurs ont été
       impliqués à l’identification, l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre des sous projets.

       Sur les 31 sous projets sélectionnés 16 sont effectivement financés. Parmi les 16 sous-
       projets financés, 13 sont ont été exécutés de manière satisfaisante, et les 3 autres sont
       réorientés. Les 13 sous projets mis en œuvre ont permis de générer 25 fiches techniques
       transférables aux producteurs.

       Impact institutionnel

       Le dispositif compétitif mis en place par le PRBC a développé un esprit de compétition
       chez les chercheurs avec pour conséquence le développement de la culture de
       l’excellence scientifique perçue dans la qualité des sous projets sélectionnés (31) et la
       qualité de la mise en œuvre des sous projets.
       En outre, le PRBC a permis de décloisonner les institutions de recherche et de
       vulgarisation du Tchad, avec 13 équipes de recherche pluridisciplinaires opérationnelles
       mis en place. Ceci a eu pour conséquence la mise en place d’un réseau dense de
       partenariat constitué des acteurs de la recherche (chercheurs, ONGs, privés et
       producteurs). Ce partenariat a brisé la rigidité thématique et les organisations par
       discipline, généralement moins efficients.




                                                                                                            62
Enfin le PRBC a contribué à renforcer les capacités opérationnelles des chercheurs en
élaboration des projets (31 sous projets sélectionnées sur 63), en rédaction scientifique (2
publications, 25 fiches technico-économiques), en traitement des données (publications et
fiches techniques).

En plus, les résultats des sous projets de recherche ont fait l’objet de 2 thèses dont une
soutenue et l’autre en instance. 2 mémoires de DEA ont été également soutenues dans le
même cadre.

2.               Réalisations financières

Les subventions au titre des investissements productifs aux organisations de producteurs
s’elèvent à 3.667.977.985 FCFA; à cela s’ajoutent la contre-partie des bénéficiaires de
20%. Cet investissement a généré des recettes supplémentaires annuelles évaluées à
1.374.242.868 FCFA.

Pour les SP PRBC les décaissements s’élèvent à 483.778.546 FCFA.

Des ressources supplémentaires, sollicitées à la revue à mi-parcours, n’ont pu être
dégagées comme prévu; ces ressources auraient eu pour effet de doubler ces réalisations,
au regard de la demande en instance (environ 1.800 requêtes de financement de sous
projets non traitées).

(b)    Situation des produits livrés aux bénéficiaires

Le Projet a été très bien accepté par les producteurs. Outre les résultats directs sur la
productivité et les revenus des populations bénéficiaires, la mise en œuvre des sous-
projets a contribué à la création d’environ 2600 emplois temporaires et /ou saisonniers.

De plus en plus de producteurs font appel à l’appui conseil des prestataires de services
dont l’émergence a été dans une large mesure, facilitée par l’avènement du Projet. Les
infrastructures construites avec l’aide du projet répondent en général aux préoccupations
des bénéficiaires.

La situation des investissements peut être regroupée par grands types:

•     Les petits périmètres irrigués sont aménagés pour la riziculture et le maraîchage.
•     Le petit élevage: C’est l’activité la plus pratiquée aussi bien par les hommes que par
      les femmes. L'engouement est réel et cela se traduit par le nombre élevé des sous -
      projets financés.
•     Infrastructures de stockage (magasins) dont la plupart appartiennent aux organisations
      féminines.




                                                                                           63
•     Unités de transformation: En général, il s’agit des moulins à céréales, la presse à
      huile, les unités de transformation des fruits et légumes et de fabrication des aliments
      pour les animaux.
•     Protection de l’environnement: Les organisations des producteurs s'intéressent plus
      souvent aux activités qui génèrent un gain immédiat. C'est pourquoi, le nombre des
      sous - projets de ce type est faible, comparativement à ceux d'autres domaines.
•     Activités non agricoles: ce sont les activités génératrices de revenus en dehors des
      activités traditionnelles issues de l’agriculture, de l’élevage et de l’environnement.
      Généralement ces activités intéressent les femmes la demande est restée faible.

En ce qui concerne la Recherche sur Base Compétitive, 25 fiches technico-économiques
ont été produites, mais 4 seulement ont été diffusées auprès des utilisateurs, en raison de
l’arrivée tardive des résultats.

•     Riz irrigué en double campagne: 75 % d’augmentation des rendements (de 4
      tonnes/ha à 7 T/ha Pour le riz irrigué, les rendements de 7 T/ha sont une agrégation
      des résultats des deux campagnes dans l’année (Contre Saison et Saison des pluies).
      Les résultats de la situation de référence sont ceux obtenus par les producteurs en
      conditions pluviales et sans production de contre-saison.
•     Riz irrigué en saison de pluies: plus de 45% d’augmentation des rendements (de 2
      T/ha à 3,637 T/ha); Pour le riz irrigué en saison des pluies sur les périmètres en cours

      canaux, acquisition d’équipements, formation, etc.) ont permis d’accroître
      substantiellement le rendement par rapport celui obtenu avant la réalisation de ces
      travaux.
•     Mil/sorgho: Plus de 100% d’augmentation (de 600 kg/ha à 1640 kg/ha) Les
      rendements élevés s’expliquent par le fait que ces rendements concernent la culture
      du bérébéré dans l’UIRCGP de Mongo (zone soudanienne) dont les rendements sont
      plus importants que ceux du mil/sorgho au niveau national (différentes zones agro
      écologiques).
•     L’appui aux OP coton en matière d’investissements productifs n’a pas été réalisé car
      leurs besoins (à savoir le financement des intrants agricoles) n’est pas pris en compte
      par le PSAOP; il en est de même pour la productivité de lait de vache, suite à une
      limitation des sous projets d’élevage aux petits animaux.

La mise en œuvre des sous-projets ont permis aux OP d’améliorer le niveau de leurs
revenus.

Le Projet a aussi produit des effets induits tels que:

•     Investissement dans la construction des écoles et scolarisation des enfants membres
      des groupements (cas de groupement Cedra Homme, VSDE et Lagapka)
•     Stockage et commercialisation de céréales (ODA2, Tingzou falissou)
•     Diversification des activités de certains groupements (Tonaye et Avenir)
•     Recours aux services des micro- crédits (épargnes et crédits)

Le PSAOP a apporté son assistance à d’autres Projets:

•      Le Volet GCE du projet PROADEL dans le montage et le suivi des micro-projets
      environnementaux au sein des UIRCGP de Bongor et de Abéché (86 sous projets
      financés);
•     Le Projet AELP dans le montage des sous-projets productifs dans les UIRCGP de
      N’djaména et de Abéché (14 sous projets financés grâce au partenariat avec le
      PSAOP).

(d)    Leçons retenues en terme de points forts et points faibles

Le sous-projet constitue un outil générateur de revenus pour les producteurs organisés;
par ailleurs les résultats et la valeur ajoutée augmentent avec la taille du sous projet, par
conséquent avec son montant.

Les points forts:




                                                                                          65
•    les sous projets sont initiés à la demande des communautés qui y participent de
     diverses manières; l’adhésion des communautés à l’approche CDD s’est avérée très
     forte;
•    le sous projets productifs étant conçue de manière intégrée, la plupart des problèmes
     potentiels sont anticipés;
•    les formations réalisées permettent une maitrise de la conduite des activités sur le
     plan technique et d’assurer la gestion des ressources générées; ces deux aspects
     contribuent à la durabilité du sous projet;
•    La Recherche sur Base Compétitive a laissé de nombreux aspects positifs, dont la
     coopération, la communication entre différents partenaires, et la démarche axée sur
     les résultats transférables.
Les points faibles:

•    un nombre important de sous projet n’a pas atteint le stade d’achèvement;
•    le système de suivi-évaluation n’a pas contribué à un pilotage efficace du Projet;
•    les retards de paiement des fonds de contrepartie;
•    les factures impayées des fournisseurs et des ODPs;
•    beaucoup de producteurs étant peu instruits, un suivi régulier permet la consolidation
     des acquis;
•    la durée du Projet étant relativement courte (exacerbée par les suspensions),
     l’organisation des producteurs à grande échelle (filière, fédération et unions de
     producteurs) n’a pas été réalisée.

1.              Réalisations physiques et niveau de performance

Assistance Technique aux OPs

•    Disponibilité des opérateurs de proximité formés dans toutes les régions du pays;
•    Fonctionnalité de la Cellule Permanente en terme de banque de données sur le secteur
     rural
•    Existence des locaux pour 10 centres de services et de gestion;
•    Deux radios communautaires à Kélo et Gounou-Gaya émettent sur un rayon
     d’environ 60 Km ;
•    faîtières des OP opérationnelle sur l’ensemble du territoire national;

Appui à la Réforme de la filière Coton

•     La mise en œuvre de l’audit technique et financier de la Coton Tchad en cours;
•     Les activités menées par la CTRC faciliteront l’émergence des coopératives des
      cotonculteurs en vue de leur participation à la privatisation de la Coton Tchad.

Au niveau des Ministères Techniques:

•     Ministère de l’Agriculture: les agents de la DEPP sont capables d’élaborer des plans
      et budgets du Ministère et il existe une base de données documentaire utile sur le
      développement rural et des annuaires (statistiques et SIM);
•     Ministère de l’environnement: existence de la base de données environnementales et
      renforcement des capacités des agents dans l’élaboration des plans et budgets du
      Ministère ;
•     Ministère de l’Elevage: existence d’une base de données; capacité des structures de
      suivi-évaluation des délégations régionales renforcées; et participation à la mise en
      œuvre du RGEA et du PNDE.

2.               Réalisations financières

Au niveau de cette composante, il a été décaissé au total y compris la contribution de
l’Etat d’un montant de 2.6669.641.919 FCFA.

(b) Leçons retenues

L’appui du Projet d’appui aux Servies Agricoles et aux Organisations des Producteurs
(PSAOP en terme de renforcement des capacités des OP et autres partenaires a été
fortement apprécié. Cet appui a permis non seulement de rendre opérationnels certaines
structures, mais également d’assurer leur visibilité sur le territoire national. Cependant, le
PSAOP a dispersé ses faibles ressources compte tenu de la multiplicité des appuis prévus.

IV. APPUI A LA GESTION DU PROJET

(a)          Principales réalisations

1.               Réalisations physiques

Cette composante comprend deux volets: (i) l’administration et (ii) le suivi-évaluation.

Les réalisations concernent: (i) la réhabilitation des locaux des Unités du Projet et de ses
composantes; (ii) leur équipement en moyens roulants, matériels informatiques et
mobiliers de bureau; (iii) la réalisation d’études, des services de consultants et d’audits;
(iv) la formation des personnels et des partenaires; (v) les prestations diverses et le
fonctionnement des structures et des partenaires.


                                                                                           67
La mise en œuvre du suivi-évaluation du PSAOP est organisée dans un cadre général
constitué de:

•     au niveau national, de la cellule de suivi-évaluation est dirigée par un Responsable
      national de suivi-évaluation (RNSE) appuyé par une responsable du Volet Genre;
•     au niveau inter-régional, des responsables inter-régionaux de suivi-évaluation;
•     les Opérateurs de Proximités assurent la collecte des informations sur les sous- projets
      en production;
•     au niveau départemental, des Comités Départementaux de Sélection (CDS),
      constituent le niveau de collecte des données primaires pour alimenter les bases de
      données inter-régionales et nationales.
Ce dispositif a été réduit suite aux recommandations de la revue à mi-parcours.

Les Comptes Spéciaux A et B ont été reconstitués d’une manière satisfaisante (au moins
1 DRF/CS/mois).

2.                 Réalisations financières

Au niveau de la composante 3, les décaissements y compris ceux de l’Etat s’élèvent à
6.042.464.320 FCFA; ceci s’explique par la sous estimation des appuis divers et des frais
de fonctionnement de nombreux partenaires, et à l’assistance technique aux organisations
de producteurs dans toutes les régions (CDS, comités adhoc, APD en aménagement, etc).

(a)            Leçons retenues

Le déroulement des activités du Projet, entrecoupé de trois périodes de suspension entre
2005 et 2007 présente de nombreux aspects positifs.


                                                                                                      68
Le Projet a fonctionné avec des équipes légères, mais la multiplicité des appuis prévus
ont sérieusement alourdi le dispositif, et créé des tensions permanentes de trésorerie.

La présence de spécialistes dans certains domaines (aménagement hydo-agricole,
aviculture, etc) faciliterait l’élaboration de référentiels techniques et la vulgarisation de
normes techniques adaptées.

V.   PERFORMANCE DE LA BANQUE MONDIALE ET DU
     GOUVERNEMENT DU TCHAD

Banque Mondiale

Les missions d’appui et les revues ont été régulièrement tenues; toutefois les effets
négatifs liées aux suspensions (perte de 13 mois sur la durée d’exécution), aux
ajustements financiers sur à la dépréciation du dollar, et aux problèmes de trésorerie du
Projet n’ont pas trouvé des solutions à temps.

Gouvernement

L’Accord de Crédit stipule qu’une avance initiale de 90 millions de FCFA sur la
contrepartie est déposée, et relevée à ce seuil dès que le montant descend à 45 millions
FCFA; cette disposition n’a pas été respectée; il y a eu de surcroit de longs mois
d’arriérés de salaires du personnel fonctionnaire détaché au Projet.




                                                                                          69
