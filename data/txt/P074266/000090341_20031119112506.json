The project finances demand-driven\n            productive investments proposed by producer organizations\n            and the technical assistance required for proper\n            implementation, through a grant system with an up-front\n            farmers' contribution of at least 20% of subproject\n            cost as defined in the Project Implementation Manual, and\n            (b) competitive research as demand-driven subprojects to\n            support short-term (two to three years) applied research\n            aimed at finding solutions to constraints on the productive\n            investment subprojects, both cotton and non-cotton-related.\n            The project complements support from the French Cooperation\n            Agency and ADB. It finances small equipment, inputs,\n            operational costs for the implementation of subprojects,\n            training and study tours, and activities that support\n            effective development of linkages between small farmers and\n            agribusiness. Component 2) will finance jointly with French\n            Cooperation Agency and ADB, (a) capacity strengthening of\n            producer organizations, including cotton producer\n            organizations; (b) specific support to cotton sector reform;\n            and (c) public and private sector development. Component 3)\n            supports: (a) the administration and management of the\n            project, and (b) the monitoring and evaluation of project\n            activities. The component finances the small works and\n            equipment required to establish a National Project\n            Coordination and Management Unit (NPCMU) and six\n            Inter-Regional Coordination and Management Units-IRPCMUs\n            within the Ministry of Agriculture. The component also\n            finances the training of staff and the operating cost of\n            these units the Competitive Research Committee and the\n            Departmental Selection Committees. It also finances studies\n            aimed at addressing unanticipated constraints and\n            opportunities arising from demand-driven subprojects. These\n            studies would cover: (a) identification of crop and\n            livestock development opportunities; (b) identification and\n            use of inputs and agricultural technology needs for a\n            specific region or department; and (c) assessment of the\n            institutional set-up and procedural arrangements and\n            mechanisms for agricultural service centers."}, "docdt": "2003-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
