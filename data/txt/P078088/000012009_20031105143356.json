Adjustment\n            Loan Project will support government actions in five key\n            areas: a) maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic\n            framework, consistent with sustaining economic growth to\n            reduce poverty; b) reform implementation of the\n            country's poverty reduction, and social protection\n            policies, to minimize exclusion, thus creating greater\n            access to social protection, and broader social services for\n            the neediest households (Chile Solidario initiative); c)\n            increased efficiency of social policy, through improved\n            targeting, and better use of information, through the\n            integration, and exchange of public and private household\n            data, relevant to social policy, into a national information\n            system; d) strengthening regular monitoring, and impact\n            evaluation of social programs, and policies; and, e)\n            enhanced sustainability of reforms regarding poverty\n            reduction, and social protection policies, through clearly\n            defined roles, and responsibilities between the central\n            government, municipal authorities, and civil society. While\n            the risks to this program are considered modest, and\n            Chile's excellent track record in economic management,\n            program implementation, and transparency outweighs potential\n            risks, several areas of implementation could prove difficult\n            for the Government, in particular closing the employment gap\n            among the neediest households, and ensuring the appropriate\n            targeting of Chile Solidario program, which includes\n            historically excluded groups, such as indigenous\n            populations, and, in addition, promoting greater local\n            government and civil society participation may prove difficult."}, "docdt": "2003-10-24T00:00:00Z"}
