                                   Exercise    of Drawdown        - Full Compliance

                              I .        PROGRAM          PERFOIUYIANCE:              OVERALL

 1         According      to Bank      policy    on IBRD       Loans     with   a Deferred       Drawdown       Option,    a
B~rrower's       request   to exercise       a drawdown       is granted     by the Bank        provided     that:  (i) the
macroeconomic        framework       remains    satisfactory;  and (ii) the Borrower         continues   to adhere to the
overall    program     set out in the Letter        of Development        Policy.      Staff  confirms    that these two
conditions     remain   satisfied.    The details of that analysis follow.

2          Macroeconomic           Framework.            Chile    continues      to   demonstrate       a  sound     policy
framework        and    strong     macroeconomic         fundamentals.          Recent      data   on    macroeconomic
performance       confirm   the positive     assessment made in the Program             Document.       Growth    for 2003
is estimated     at 3.4% and is expected to rise to 4.4% in 2004.                Inflation   in 2003 reached only l%,
the lowest      rate achieved     over the last 6 decades.          The estimate        of the fiscal deficit    has been
lowered     slightly  to 0.8% of GDP for 2003, consistent              with the 1% structural        fiscal surplus rule.
Monetary      policy   continues    to play an important       counter-cyclical      role.   During   January 2004, the
reference    rate was reduced        100 basis points     to 1.75%.      With public      debt at under 20% of GDP,
international     reserves    at almost      US$   16 billion,    and a well      regulated    and deeply      capitalized
financial    sector (the capital       adequacy    ratio is close to 14%), the economy              has many      cushions
against potential     external    shocks, including     against regional     contagion.      A temporary      1% increase
in the VAT        and lowering      of public     expenditure     in 2003,   in order to offset       the tariff  revenue
forgone    through    recent trade agreements         and to finance      additional    outlays associated with social
programs     (including    Chile Solidario),      have increased the credibility        of macroeconomic       policy.


3          Faster growth     in 2004 is expected to stem from both external               factors - improved      terms of
trade and low interest rates - and domestic              factors - higher investment         and consumer      demand in
response     to low     domestic      interest   rates,  country    risk premia       (under    100 basis points)       and
improved      overall   confidence.      Despite    the exchange      rate appreciation      vis-a-vis  the US dollar -
25% from its 2003 peak - Chile's exports are expected to continue                      growing   at a fast pace, favored
by the recently       signed     Free Trade      Agreements      (most    recently    with   the United     States),    the
strengthening      of the economies        of its trading   partners    and the US dollar        depreciation    vis-a-vis
other currencies.       Chile's    main    sources of vulnerability        are its insufficiently     diversified   export
structure,    dominated     by resource-based        products    (copper)    and agro-industry;        the external    debt
burden    of its corporate     sector; and regional     instability.    However,     these risks are mitigated      by: its
strong liquidity     and net international        asset position;     a track record      of sound and conservative
macroeconomic        policy    conduct;     structural  reforms    backed by broad political          consensus;    strong
institutions;    and proven resilience       during recent shocks.

4          Social    Protection       Program.         In   addition     to  the    maintenance      of   a satisfactory
macroeconomic        framework,      the Loan supports Government            actions in four key areas: (i) reforms
to Chile's     poverty   reduction     and social protection       policies,  to reduce poverty        and exclusion     by
creating   greater access to social protection          and wider social services for the neediest households
(the Chile Solidario      initiative);   (ii) increasing   the efficiency    and efficacy     of social policy through
improved     targeting   and better use of information         by gathering,     exchanging,      and integrating    into a
national   information     system, publicly       and private   held data on households          and relevant    to social
policy;   (iii)  strengthening      regular    monitoring     and impact      evaluation      of social programs        and
policies;    and   (iv)  increasing      the   sustainability    of reforms      to poverty      reduction     and   social

protection    policies,  through   clear assignment     of roles and division       of responsibilities   between
central government,      municipal   authorities  and civil society.

5          The social protection    program     supported   by the Loan is being fully implemented          by the
Borrower.      First, there has been progress       towards     the passage of the Chile        Solidario  reforrn
legislation.     On    December     10, 2003,    the  Senate    approved      unanimously     the  Government's
proposal.     Second,    the number    of families   participating    in Chile    Solidario  has risen from     the
80,000 mentioned       in the Program Document       to 101,709, as of December         2003.  This is 90 percent
of the enrollment       target.  The rates of refusal      to participate     or interruptions   in participation
continue    to be low (5% or less). Third, the Ministry        of Planning    and Cooperation     (MIDEPLAN),
the   agency    responsible    for  coordinating    Chile   Solidario,     has signed     4 additional    working
agreements      with   public  and private     agencies.    Fourth,     the   Program    continues    to be well-
monitored    by the Borrower,     including   the progress being achieved among the participant          families.
In addition,   in the area of monitoring     and evaluation,    the field work for the household       survey, the
primary     source   of data for the impact      evaluation     of Chile    Solidario,   was completed     during
November-December          2003.   The instrument   added questions needed for the impact evaluation.



                                            II .      CONCLUSIONS

6.        In view of the overall performance        and progress with the implementation          of the Program
supported    by the Loan, the Bank has informed        the Borrower      of its positive response to the request
for a second and final drawdown        for US$60 million.
