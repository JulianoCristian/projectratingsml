1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

 1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Poverty. At the time of project appraisal, poverty in Honduras was highly correlated with
living in rural areas. In 1999, 75% of rural households were below the poverty line, and 80% of
these were classified as living in extreme poverty. In particular, the situation of households living
in hillside forest lands was precarious. The principal determinants of social inequalities and
poverty in rural areas were inadequate access to basic resources, such as land and forests, and
insufficient support to production and marketing. Other factors contributing to impoverishment
were environmental degradation caused by demographic pressure, the low level of democratic
participation of poor people, and the weak operational capacity of most government and
community institutions, particularly at the local level.

2.      Forest Sector. More than 80% of Honduras' total land area was legally classified as
"forest land", the majority of which was under public ownership. About 42% of these lands were
deforested or severely degraded; deforestation rates were estimated to average 800 km2 per year
or 1.4%. Principal causes of deforestation and forest degradation were conversion for agriculture
and livestock, fire and pests, poor forest management, and illegal logging. Institutions in the
sector (e.g. the State Forest Administration-Honduran Forest Development Corporation [AFE-
COHDEFOR], the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment [SERNA], and the
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock [SAG]) had ambitious and unrealistic mandates not
matched with sufficient resources. As a result, they were unable to respond appropriately to
deforestation and degradation issues. The National System of Protected Areas of Honduras
(SINAPH), which comprised 3.3 million hectares (almost 30% of the national territory),
historically suffered from weak Government commitment to ensuring their proper management
and protection, resulting in continued degradation of forest ecosystems, many of them with high
and unique biodiversity, as well as significant value for environmental services (e.g. disaster
prevention, soil conservation, water, and carbon) and recreation 1.

3.      Among the main constraints for sustainable development in forest areas were: (i) the
uncertain and conflictive nature of land tenure in public forest lands; (ii) low priority given to the
systematic provision of support for production systems, such as infrastructure, technical
assistance and extension services, small-scale irrigation, training and access to markets, and
credit; and (iii) an overly top-down command, high discretion, and low transparency in the
management of public forest lands.

4.     Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Government of ·Honduras (GOH) recognized the
strong inter-relationship between addressing the constraints that affected the forest sector and
poverty reduction in the 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Government's forest
sector strategy took a multi-sector approach involving the modernization of the land
administration system, strengthening of territorial planning, promotion of decentralization, and

                                                                       1
improving sustainable management of forest resources. The strategy also recognized the
importance of sustaining environmental quality and investing in the prevention and mitigation of
impacts caused by natural disasters, particularly in vulnerable remote and inaccessible regions
where poverty is more severe.

5.     Bank Involvement. The Bank was uniquely positioned to both support the forestry sector
reform process and to strengthen the country's poverty reduction efforts in forest land. Since
1992, the Bank had supported GOH in the implementation of the Agricultural Modernization
Law through an adjustment credit (AGSAC, Cr. 2540-HO). The Bank supported natural
resources management and land administration pilot efforts through the follow-up Rural Areas
Administration Project (PAAR, P007398, effective 1997-2004). The successful implementation
of PAAR provided the basis for including this project in the 2003-2006 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS).

  6.      GOH requested that the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) take
  complementary roles to support forest sector reform. Under this agreement, the World Bank
. focused on supporting the decentralization of forest and natural resource management and
  protection, forest land tenure, and protected areas management and conservation, while IDB
  focused on supporting the development of the national legal and institutional framework, forest
  sector competitiveness, developing competitive mechanisms for commercial investment and
  strengthening the forest-industry-market value chain. IDB channeled its financial support through
  the Multiphase Sustainable Forest Development Program, PROBOSQUE project (l.506/SF-HO).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.     The PD~, as presented in the PAD; was to increase the economic benefits and
environmental services derived from forest ecosystems in selected low income municipalities
with high agro-forestry potential within the project area. In doing so, the project outcomes
included the generation of income, policies and actions that would contribute to the reduction of
poverty, the sustainable management of natural resources, and the reduction of vulnerability.

8.      Based on the discussion provided in the PAD, and the context for project preparation,
three lines of action were identified:

        (a)    Reducing poverty in poor rural areas, through: (i) income generation and
               employment creation initiatives (while addressing the basic issues relating to
               extension, technology adaptation, and access to finance); and (ii) validating the
               procedural approach to asset security (through land-titling);

        (b)    Improving sustainable natural resource management and conservation,
               through: (i) Decentralization of participatory strategic land use planning
               processes to local governments and community organizations with assured
               financing by preparing land use plans on a participatory basis and linking these
               plans for funding to sources of government financing; and (ii) Forest management,
               conservation, and maintenance by increasing forest/protected areas under
               management and reducing forest fires and pest damage (while focusing on


                                                2
               participatory preparation and implementation of management plans to introduce
               process transparency) and ensuring financing for maintenance through
               establishment of the Honduras Protected Areas Fund; and .

       (c)     Increasing disaster preparedness, through: (i) participatory preparation of
               development plans to mitigate risks and vulnerability to natural disasters; and (ii)
               participation of local communities and institutions to implement these plans.

The key PD~ indicators are regrouped around these three sub-PDOs to obtain a better
appreciation of their contribution to the overall PD~:

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.     The Project's area of influence covered 3,261 km2 and contained 630,325 inhabitants
(2001 Census). It encompassed thirty-six municipalities of the provinces of Yoro, Olancho and
Francisco Morazan that contain eleven protected areas and thirteen Forest Management Units
(FMUs). The Project's main beneficiaries were 25,800 poor rural families (35% of the total
population). Such beneficiaries included 22,000 indigenous peoples of the Tolupan and Pech
indigenous tribes, and 65,000 women.

1.5 Original Components

10.   The Project's four components: (i) Community Forestry; (ii) Forest Management, Tenure
and Conservation; (iii) Local Government and Disaster Preparedness; and (iv) Project
Coordination and Management, are summarized below.

           (a)        Community Forestry (US$8.6 million, 26% of total project costs). The
                      objective of this component was to provide extension services, training, and
                      funding to support community-demand driven initiatives in agro-forestry. This
                      component built on the pilot "Fund for Hillside Producers" established by the
                      PAAR Project2• Activities included (i) subprojects comprising extension, technical
                      assistance, training, and investment to improve the standard of living of the rural
                      poor occupying forest lands; (ii) applied research subprojects to demonstrate the
                      benefits of improved technologies and strengthen the National System for
                      Research and Technology Transfer (SNITTA); and (iii) a training program to
                      strengthen the capacity of key local actors in the implementation process of
                      subprojects, including municipalities, Private Technical Service Providers (PSTs),
                      and farmer leaders.

           (b)        Forest Management, Tenure and Conservation (US$17.2 million, 52% of total
                      project costs). The objective of this component was to support GOH's national
                      program for sustainable management of national, municipal, communal/private
                      forests and protected areas, thereby developing the economic potential of 1.4
                      million hectares of forest, and institutionalizing new models of public forest
                      management. Activities included: (i) forest management, planning and/or
                      protection; (ii) regularization of land rights of a limited number communities
                      living on national forest lands for the first time, based on the existing procedural
                      framework; (iii) better management of priority protected areas and of the
                      Honduras National Protected Areas System (SINAPH); and (iv) creation of a
                      Honduras Protected Areas Fund to finance protection and management in priority
                      SINAPH Protected Areas.



2 The PAAR Project successfully established the administrative framework and methodological approach to provide privatized extension services,
training and competitive funding of applied research to benefit rural poor living in marginal areas. These new project was designed to refine and
test innovations to this model including shifting service provision from groups to communities and strengthening the organization and role of
local farmers and women's groups to ensure the provision of service demanded by communities (COD).



                                                                       4
            (c)        Local Government and Disaster Preparedness (US$1.8 million, 6% of total
                       project costs). The objective of this component was to strengthen the capacity of
                       municipal governments and municipal associations (mancomunidades) to
                       strategically take account of local priorities in the other activities supported by the
                       project. Activities under this component included: (i) assistance to strengthen local
                       organization and capacity to carry out participatory strategic planning at the
                       municipal and regional (mancomunidad) levels to generate and apply information
                       for land use, zoning, and vulnerability planning, to integrate outputs into the local
                       development agenda; and (ii) developing proposals to implement priority actions
                       and seeking financial support from the relevant government program.

            (d)        Project Coordination and Management (US$S.2 million or 16% of total
                       project costs). The objective of this component was to cover the administrative
                       costs of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), monitoring and evaluation, technical
                       studies, and training required for project implementation, including preparation of
                       new investment proposals.

 1.6 Revised Components

 fl.  Project components were structurally maintained throughout project implementation, but
some changes were agreed with the GOH at the Mid-term Review (MTR, June 2007). These
changes are summarized below, and described with more detail in Annex 2:

            (a)        Community Forestry: The target of 25,000 beneficiary families was reduced to
                      ·19,000 due to: (i) an initial slow implementation (only 13% of funds allocated for
                       subprojects were disbursed by the time of the MTR); (ii) subproject unit costs
                       were found to be 35% higher than anticipated; and (iii) recognition that a
                       minimum of two years was needed to implement individual subprojects. The
                       subproject target remained unchanged, but clearly should also have been reduced
                       by about 20% from 100 to about 80 subprojects in line with the reduced number of·
                       beneficiary families; and

            (b)       Forest Management, Tenure and Conservation: (i) Certain areas of support to
                      the national forestry agency were curtailed (Le. support for those forest
                      management activities, including preparation of timber sales, that were to be
                      executed by the forestry agency [AFE-COHDEFORD, and more emphasis and
                      support was given to municipalities and local organizations to execute forest

                      pine forests and protected areas; (ii) The target for regularization of tenure and
                      traditional usage rights in forest lands (public, private, and communal) and
                      protected areas was reduced from 150,000 hectares to a pilot area of 7,700

           (c)        Local Government and Disaster Preparedness: Three new indicators were
                      added: (i) nineteen (19) of 36 municipalities were to have technical assistance
                      services initially provided by the project incorporated into their budget; (ii) thirty
                      six (36) municipalities were to have vulnerability plans certified by the national
                      Permanent Commission on Contingencies (COPECO) and implemented by
                      Municipal Emergency Committees (CODEMs), and Local Emergency
                      Committees (CODELs); and (iii) ten (10) municipalities were to have established
                      institutional relationships to obtain financing for preparing municipal plans for
                      Vulnerability Reduction and were to be implementing related activities as a
                      priority.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

12.     During the lifetime of the project some adjustments were made in emphasis, approach and
addition of new instruments (e.g. assistance to complete Municipal cadastres to enhance local tax
revenue collection to sustain the fiscal impacts imposed by the newly decentralized
responsibilities of natural resources conservation and development) as a function of project
learning/opportunities or due to external institutional and/or political factors.

13.    In January 2006, the GOR issued new policies and programs to support decentralization
of land use and local development planning, and update/modernize the Strategic Municipal
Development Plans (PEDM). Project components were aligned to respond to these changes since
they were fully consistent with project goals of promoting effective local management of natural
resources and local participation.

14.      In September 2007, Congress approved a new Forestry Law that introduced important
institutional reforms to the sector. The National Institute of Forest Conservation and
Deve~opment, Protected Areas and Wildlife (ICF) was created in 2008 (in substitution of AFE-
CORDEFOR) with a broader mandate to address management and conservation of forest
resources and wildlife. The project continued to work closely with ICF as its partner, and
responded to the reforms, which were consistent with project goals, particularly with regards to
decentralization of sustainable forest management to local producer organizations and
governments, and conservation and sustainable development of protected areas. The ICF,
however, has suffered from a lack of poiitical and budgetary support to fully implement this
reform and perform its new mandate.




rights. and demarcation of national forest lands (e.g. Property Law and new Forestry Law) to identify legal/procedural gaps and generate a
methodology to regularize these lands. The outputs of the pilot were planned to produce a systematic set of procedures and methodologies for
regularization of national forest lands that could have a generic application to other forest regions of the country. Also, this experience was
designed to provide analytical and operational guidance for the design of the second phase of the Land Administration Program (PATH), financed
by the Bank in Honduras, and currently under implementation.



                                                                     6
    15.    Credit funds were cancelled as a result of findings from an investigation conducted by the
    Department of Institutional Integrity (INT).4 This corresponds to a total of Special Drawing
    Rights (SDR) 28,279.63. 5 The cancellation represented 6 percent of undisbursed funds.

    16.      The Bank approved two reallocations of credit proceeds during the life of the Project, the
    first in January 2008, to conduct an internal restructuring of the PCU following decisions made
    during the MTR, and the second one in November 2008 to further support local governments and
    communities in moving ahead in the decentralization process. These reallocations had a
    significant impact on project results and helped to make investments more sustainable.

    17.    The Credit closing date was extended once, adding six months to the implementation
    period from January 31, 2010 to June 30, 2010 to allow the Project sufficient time to complete
    implementation that was slowed down due to the country's political crisis of June 2009 and to
    allow for adequate project evaluation and reconciling of accounts.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.     The project participated in the quality at entry evaluation. The QAE7 evaluation
recognized the good design and strategic importance of the project for rural development and
rural poverty alleviation in Honduras. It rated the project's overall quality at entry as being
satisfactory, with the sole exception of Risk Assessment that was rated as moderately
satisfactory.

19.     Project preparation was based on a thorough assessment of social, economic, and
environmental conditions. Aspects to be highlighted include: (i) a detailed social evaluation that
characterized beneficiaries and guided the preparation of an Indigenous Peoples Development
Plan that was widely accepted by participating indigenous groups; (ii) an Involuntary
Resettlement Framework was prepared even though the potential for triggering this safeguard
was low; (iii) a comprehensive environmental management plan; and (iv) a well supported
economic analysis that was based on an ex-post analysis of the PAAR project.

20.     The PDO was broad and, although the indicators were relevant to measure impacts,
there arguably were too many, which created both practical and conceptual difficulties.
Four of the indicators presented a high degree of complexity for their monitoring and
measurement. These were: (i) increased participation by women; (ii) reduction in deforestation
rates; (iii) increases in income; and (iv) job creation. Neither during design nor project
implementation appropriate baseline studies were carried out to meaningfully assess project
impact for these indicators.

5   This amount is equivalent to US$44,659.91 as per the exchange rate effective on the day ofthe cancellation (February 22, 2008).



                                                                         7
21.     Project design benefited from an important legacy of successful experiences and
investments accomplished through the Rural Land Management Project (PAAR). The
project design built upon the achievements of the PAAR project related to: (i) institutional
strengthening and refonns in the administration of public forest lands; (ii) forest management
that incorporated the rights and usufruct of forest dwellers and communities; (iii) improving of
biodiversity conservation; (iv) resolving land use conflicts; and (v) privatizing extension services
for the rural poor. Project components were also based on approaches that had been piloted and
proven to work during PAAR and other precursor operations financed by the Bank, namely, the
Natural Disaster Mitigation Project (Cr. 3361-HO) and the Environmental Development Project
(Cr. 2693-HO).

22.     The institutional and implementation framework was complex and involved a wide
range of actors. The project worked at the national, departmental, municipal ap.d community-
levels across three Departments and thirty-six municipalities. Still, based on the successful, prior
experience with the PAAR - which also included a full-scale land administration refonn
component and thus was of an even higher degree of institutional complexity - there was good
knowledge of the institutional capacities, as well as both valid experience and justification for
moving ahead with the institutional arrangements without any risk of failure.

23.    Some risks were not identified or were inadequately assessed during preparation.
Overall project risk was rated as "substantial". Although the most important risks were identified,
for some of these, the mitigation measures proved insufficient or inadequate, and an additional,
foreseeable risk not identified during preparation, materialized during implementation. The major
shortcomings in risk assessment were:

       (a)     Limited enforcement of land tenure laws and policies to implement land
               regularization. Forest land tenure activities suffered from an under-estimation of
               the institutional complexity of carrying out the pilot activities, and an over-
               estimation of the political will existing to see the pilot carried out and thus to
               ensure the full cooperation of the involved institutions;

       (b)     Weak implementation of public forest sector reforms, coupled with the failure to
               provide minimum adequate financing for public forest management and to
               implement agreed financial mechanisms to sustain conservation of protected
               areas. With the forest sector central to the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and a
               very high profile public debate over refonn of the sector, the design over-
               estimated the actual extent of the political will and commitment to support the
               refonn and funding, and the role that the national forestry agency (AFE-
               COHDEFOR) could play; and

       (c)     Limitations in the adequate and timely allocation of operating budget to co-
               executing agencies was not originally foreseen as a relevant risk at project
               preparation but became a· major constraint during execution. As a part of the
               overall institutional exit strategy, all the co-executing agencies' recurrent costs
             . were to be borne through the institutions' budgets and were not eligible
               expenditure under the credit. For AFE-COHDEFOR in particular, this implied

                                                 8
                       that the institution's own budget had to support its basic field presence and
                       standard operations and their associated costs. Government consistently failed to
                       provide AFE-COHDEFOR with operational budget resources 6•

    2.2 Implementation

24.      Policy and coordination efforts at the national level were inadequate to support
activities to be conducted in public forest lands. Project design focused on the decentralized
management of forest resources through local actors (communities, municipalities, grassroots
organizations and NGOs, and the mancomunidades), and Honduras already had the legal,
normative, and methodological frameworks in place for conducting such activities. Through this
decentralized approach, the project supported productive management of forests in private, ejido
and communal lands (e.g., with community groups in municipal forests and indigenous groups in
communal forest) as well as other productive activities (agriculture, livestock, horticulture and
agro-forestry) in public forest lands. Activities of large-scale forestry management· in public
forest lands could only be achieved with the participation of the forestry agency (AFE-
COHDEFOR, and later ICF). Despite GOH's commitment to reform in the forestry sector, this
agency lacked the political and financial support to fulfill its role in managing public forest lands.
Institutional weakness at the national level was identified as a risk during project preparation, and
close collaboration with IDB's PROBOSQUE project was considered one of the mitigation
measures. Nonetheless, reform at the national level proved to be more challenging than originally
thought, with PROBOSQUE being unable to achieve its objectives. 7

25.     Local-level actors had a stronger capacity to implement project activities and benefit
from decentralization processes than originally anticipated.                       Municipalities,
mancomunidades, and community organizations (as well as some national-level actors, such as
the Ministry of Governance and Justice [SGJD, gained ownership of the project early on during·
implementation and became strong partners. Policy reforms in favor of decentralization during
the first year of the 2006-09 provided the right enabling environment to achieve project's
objectives. The Poverty Reduction Program was channeled through municipal governments,
which demanded that local governments be accountable to both the central government and local
citizenry. Under these conditions, local governments were eager to collaborate with the project
and own the instruments developed through it. The reallocation of substantial project funds to this




6 For example, a "typical" annual budget would provide 100% of salaries but only 15% - 30% of the operational budget, with the expectation that
the forest agency would sell timber from national lands to cover the rest or would utilize ODA funds to cover recurrent expenses. The lack of
operational budget meant that forest management plans in public forest lands could neither be implemented nor supervised, resulting in an
inability to manage timber sales and generate income, as well. Note that the financing of AFE-COHDEFOR's budget through timber sales was in
contravention of several prior agreements between GOH and the World Bank and IDB.

7 As agreed between Government, IDA, and the IDB, the IDB-financed PROBOSQUE (Multiphase Sustainable Forest Development Program)
and the IDA-financed Forests and Rural Productivity Project would collaborate closely on institutional and policy reform issues with the IDB
project, financing, inter alia, the institutional and regulatory reforms and institutional strengthening activities for AFE-COHDEFOR and the IDA
project focusing on decentralized (municipal and community-level) aspects of forest management and conservation. The PROBOSQUE project
substantially failed to implement or achieve its institutional objectives. Approved at the end of 2003,63% of the total loan amount of $17.5
million was cancelled in 2006. The IDB project.is still active in 2010, having disbursed less than 70% of the $6.5 million that remained
following the cancellation.




                                                                      9
component following the MTR increased the sustainability of project impacts and the associated
project exit strategy.

26.      The land regularization initiative in forest areas suffered several setbacks. The
Project's co-executing agencies collaborated in a pilot effort to conduct land regularization in a
forest area in the Department of Yoro. The original targets for land regularization were not
achieved by the end of the Project largely due to an ambitious design that underestimated the
institutional complexity involved in the process, which required the collaboration of three
ministries and one autonomous agency. 8 It took three years for the agencies involved to develop
and agree upon the legal, operational, and institutional framework for the implementation of a
pilot in an area of 7,700 ha (original target was 150,000 ha). Once the pilot started, there were
some initial delays with updating of the cadastral database, but the framework was implemented
smoothly. The process was at the stage where public forest lands had been adjudicated to the
forestry agency (AFE-COHDEFORlICF), a preliminary step to formalizing the occupation and
usufruct rights of occupants, when the political crisis of June 2009 disrupted activities across the
Bank's portfolio in Honduras. As a result, only two-thirds of the regularization process was
completed. Nonetheless, the project successfully tested and validated the methodology for land
regularization, which other donors (particularly EU and IDB) were expected to use in their rural
development and natural resources management projects and programs.

27.    The GOH established the Honduras Protected Areas Fund but failed to make it
operational. The Protected Areas Fund mechanism was to boost the financial sustainability of
project investments by covering the recurrent costs for protected areas management and
maintenance of park infrastructure. In the absence of such a mechanism, only limited investment
in protected areas' infrastructure and staffing was possible. Project scope was accordingly
reduced to focus on assisting/strengthening local actors to take formal responsibility for protected
area management through capacity building, co-management contracts, updating of management
plans, and outreach and forest protection activities. In addition, the Coraz6n Transboundary
Biosphere Reserve Project in Honduras and Nicaragua (P085488, effective 2007), which was to
support the Honduras Protected Areas Fund and other activities in protected areas, jointly covered
by the two projects, faced severe structural problems preventing it from complying with these
commitments.

28.     The PCU was restructured in response to new institutional conditions during the
change of government administration in 2006. The PCU, which had been a multi-project unit
coordinating three interrelated World Bank-financed projects 9 , was dismantled and the project
staff reconstituted as a PCU physically located in the Ministry· of Agriculture and Livestock
(SAG, the project counterpart agency). This structural change occurred following a presidential
decree in 2006 to create PCUs in all line ministries. This change weakened the technical capacity


8 The three ministries involved were the National Agrarian Institute (INA, the land reform agency with Ministerial rank), Secretary of
Oovernment and Justice (S01), and the Secretary of Agriculture (SAO), and the autonomous agency involved was the Property Institute (IP). In
addition, these agencies needed to agree and cooperate with the National Institute of Forest Conservation and Development, Areas Protected
Wildlife (ICF).

Credit 3858-HO), and Natural Disasters Mitigation Project (Cr. 3361-HO)



                                                                    10
of the project and the effectiveness of its coordination with the Land Administration Project
(PATH, CR. 3858-HO), with initial negative impacts on implementation of the forest land tenure
regularization pilot. However, over time, the project overcame the institutional bottlenecks
resulting from these changes, acquiring sufficient trained staff as well as access to staff in co-
executive agencies. Improvements in the coordination with the PATH project during 2008-09
permitted the preparation of two regularization manuals (i.e. for forest lands and for protected
areas), which were approved by the Bank, and subsequently tested duril1g the implementation of
the forest land regularization pilot.

29.     Unfolding events and innovations resulted in the need to expand the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) to improve project execution. First, the lack of a functional public
forest agency counterpart generated the need for additional technical services and funding to fill
the institutional gap. Second, the increasingly heavy focus on decentralized management through
local institutions required additional technical support, consultancies and studies, and some
equipment purchases for national-level co-executors (National Agrarian Institute [INA], Property
Institute [IP], and SGJ). Third, project preparation underestimated the budget and staffing
required to operate a multi-sector, poly-centric natural resources and rural development project.
Fourth, the project's gender strategy was enhanced, adding a new element to support the GOH's
national network of "Women's Affairs Offices". 10 Lastly, there was a need for the PCU's direct
operation of micro-enterprise promotion and support due to the lack of technical capacity in
project areas and the dispersed nature of demand. All of these requirements placed a heavy
demand on the PCU's services, somewhat compromising its effectiveness.

30.     Some external events had an impact on the project schedule. The project
implementation schedule w&'; modified over time principally due to: (i) project startup difficulties
associated with election year politics; (ii) project administration and coordination were changed
in response to policies related to the 2005 Paris Declaration· on aid harmonization; (ii) the MTR
prompted an even deeper emphasis on a decentralized approach; (iii) institutional complexity and
political sensitivity of the forest land tenure pilot; and (iv) the political crisis in the project's final
year (2009). The aggregate effect of these was to slow project implementation, especially in the
first two years, but implementation pace improved in the post-MTR period, with adjustments
permitting the project to substantially complete its activities and disburse the credit fully within
the original timeframe.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.     Design. The design of the M&E system built upon that of the PAAR project, with
substantial attention given to creating the capacity for its implementation and developing
participation agreements with all co-executors and local institutions for dialogue, feedback and
learning. An M&E unit was included in the design of the PCV as was an independent contracted
"Monitoring and Certification Unit" (USC) to monitor subprojects. As noted by the QAE, a
detailed set of Key Project Indicators was developed including baselines and targets. The


10 This was a newly-constituted initiative of the Executive providing a heretofore missing institutional mechanism for the project to reach out to
women in areas of project concern (i.e., integration of gender equity and gender concerns into local development planning).



                                                                        11
principal sources of information to be drawn upon included: (i) field reports from the project
technical staff, the USC, and the project co-executors; (ii) a financial reporting and physical
progress tracking system; (iii) annual participatory evaluation carried out with involved
communities, groups and municipalities; (iv) special impact and. evaluation studies to be carried
out for both mid-tyrm and project closing; (v) periodic "client satisfaction" surveys and technical
audits; and (vi) remote sensing of forest cover and land use change. The QAE rated the M&E
design as "satisfactory".

32.     Implementation. The project attached high importance to implementing the M&E
system, particularly to ensuring the ability to manage the project, learn from experience, and
improve processes and impacts. The M&E unit was established and successfully managed a
fairly extensive network of informants from among the project staff, participants, and co-
executors. For the management of information a MIS was set up in the PCU. Databases required
by the project but which ultimately needed to be maintained by the relevant institutions, were set
up in those institutions. from the outset. This included: databases in AFE-COHDEFOR's Center
for Forestry Information and Statistics (for forestry-related information) and the Property
Institute's National Property Administration System and Registry of National Forest Lands (for
forest land cadastral, administrative limits, zoning and tenure information).

33.     Use. The M&E system functioned reasonably well. It was most effective for purposes of
learning and improving implementation quality and impact with participation of local
stakeholders. Major outputs from a "Systematization of Project Experiences" effort included ten
major products 11 , developed at the request of the specific end-users which were the national-level
and local-level institutions supported by the project. The system was only moderately effective at
monitoring natural resource impacts. It worked well for macro-level forest impacts, done through
remote sensing with the National School of Forest Sciences (ESNACIFOR), but it was weak at
capturing the direct and local impacts of project interventions on natural resources. It was weak
to very weak at capturing forest management-relevant information on public forest lands due to
the non-performance of ICF (formerly AFE-COHDEFOR). Its capacity to capture project
financial and economic impacts was also modest.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance

34.    The Project triggered OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats),
OP 4.09 (Pest Management); OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement), OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples);
and 4.36 (Forests).

                                                                  12
35.     Environmental Assessment and Natural Habitats. The project was classified as
Category B, and its impacts were considered positive, given its focus on promoting or expanding
environmental practices through land use planning and sustainable forest management. During
project preparation a thorough Environmental Analysis was prepared along with an
Environmental Management Plan. The environmental dimension was a central element in all
land use planning processes. An important outcome was the development and strengthening of
Municipal Environmental Action Plan (PAAM), whicb are instruments used by municipalities to
identify and mitigate environmental impacts in both, rural and urban areas. The project also
provided assistance to Municipal Environment Units (UMAs), strengthening the decentralization
process for the expedition of environmental licenses and permits. As part of the Community
Forestry component, environmental guidelines were used for the preparation and supervision of
sub-projects. Specific environmental assessments were conducted in 19 subprojects which
required a more detailed evaluation of environmental impacts. The PCU had an environmental
specialist who assisted communities to prepare environmental plans for subprojects, and then
supervise their application. In compliance .with the Natural Habitats safeguard (OP 4.04),
particular attention was given to activities financed in protected areas, where provisions were
made to prevent any extractive activities within the boundaries of legally-established protected
areas, as well as any investment that could have induced migration into these areas. Compliance
with the Environmental Management Plan was regularly evaluated during supervision missions.

36.     Pest Management. This safeguard was triggered as a result of project investments in
agricultural extension and agro-forestry sub-projects that may have required the use of pesticides.
As a basic project policy, pesticides were not financed, and traditional cultural practices and
biological controls were promoted instead. During execution, the project offered specialized
training courses to both technical service providers and sub-project beneficiaries on integrated
pest management practices, with an approach to favor the use of biological controls and reduce
the use of chemically-based products.

37,      Involuntary Resettlement. During preparation it was agreed with the GOH that no
involuntary physical displacement would take place in the project area. However since project
activities included the demarcation of protected areas, a process framework (PF) for mitigating
potential livelihood impacts was prepared. During implementation, efforts were made to avoid
project activities having a negative effect on the livelihoods of communities living within
protected areas or using their natural resources. The application of a fully participatory approach
in all land use planning processes sponsored by the project led to decisions being made on the
basis of consensus, ensuring that no stakeholder would be negatively affected. This highly
participatory approach was an important accomplishment of the project, and it helped prevent
livelihood impacts.

38.      Indigenous Peoples. During project preparation, a social assessment was carried out
which identified the main socio-cultural and socio-economic characteristics of the indigenous
peoples located in the project area, including levels of organization, land tenure situation, and
traditional knowledge regarding natural resources management and agricultural production, to
ensure the cultural and environmental appropriateness and sustainability of proposed project
activities. In compliance with OD 4.20, an Indigenous Development Plan for the Pech and
Tolupan tribes (Plan de Participacion y Desarrollo de los P'1eblos Pech y Tolupan - IPDP) was


                                               13
prepared and consulted. During implementation, a social scientist participated in all missions and
field visits to monitor compliance and provide guidance on social issues. The principle of free,
prior, and informed consultation was used by the project as a prerequisite for any financed
activity. By project closing, 33 Tolupan and 8 Pech communities had participated actively and
were benefited under the IPDP encompassing a total area of 115,000 hectares.

39.    Forests. The project provided support to introduce elements of sustainability and
environmental protection in the preparation of forest management plans in pine forests, and their
implementation for the production of timber and non-timber products. It also assisted in the
design and execution of municipal and regional plans for forest protection oriented to prevent and
reduce the incidence of forest fires and pests. Finally, the project assisted in the preparation of
environmental licenses for the use of forest extractive equipment; these licenses were then strictly
supervised to ensure compliance. All forest management activities financed under the project
were systematically supervised. by the Bank during supervision missions, in accordance with OP
4.36.

Fiduciary Compliance

40.     Financial Management (FM). During most of the implementation period, the PM rating
was moderately satisfactory, although the project faced several FM issues that affected
compliance. Inappropriate PM practices were identified in 2008 and subsequently PM rating was
downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory. In particular, it was noted that (i) the PCU had
financed project expenditures from other. bank-financed sources (PATH-PAAR Projects) due to
delays in the availability of project funds; (ii) the project had financed counterpart expenditures
with Bank funds due to delays in availability of counterpart funds, and (iii) several internal
control weaknesses were also revealed in an INT report disclosed in 2008. By project closing,
the last PM supervision to the project upgraded the PM rating to Moderately Satisfactory, as all
the pending PM issues were resolved. The final audit for the project had an unqualified (clean)
opinion.

41.     Procurement. The overall management of procurement processes by the PCU was
Moderately Satisfactory. Implementation started with a PCU staffed with qualified and
experienced procurement l;:onsultants. The project procurement specialist was selected on a
competitive basis for the PAAR project (Credit 2940-HO), and her services were retained for the
Forest and Rural Productivity Project. This was the basis for a Satisfactory rating in the first year
of implementation.

42.     In addition, the use of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) as a
procurement agent to be financed with counterpart funds, and specifically for international
biddings, was agreed during credit negotiations. However, this agreement was reconsidered due
to the few procurement processes to be carried out by the project and the good procurement
capacity of the PCU; therefore, no agreement was signed between the GOH and UNDP.

43.    A Procurement Post-Review in 2006 alerted the Bank to irregularities that were reported
to INT for investigation, resulting in a downgrading of the procurement rating to Unsatisfactory.
An action plan was agreed with the borrower and an independent procurement review was carried


                                                14
out later that year. The IPR identified some residual procurement issues which were corrected by
the PCU and the procurement rating was accordingly upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory, a
rating maintained through project closing.

44.    The INT report of this investigation was disclosed in January 2008 to Regional
Management and subsequently to the Government. As a result, US$45,792.52 equivalent were
cancelled from the Credit funds on February 22, 2008 due to mis-procurement. The Bank and
Government agreed on a fiduciary Action Plan, building on the efforts undertaken after the
Bank's Mid-term Review mission. The PCU demonstrated strong performance in procurement
management during the last two years of project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.     The project's focus on an institutional exit strategy throughout the entire project cycle
ensured its appropriate role as a facilitator and supporter (rather than as an implementer) of the
sector policies and programs to which it contributed. The recognition of this role by most of the
government agencies, supported at both the national and local levels, Jed to greater acceptance of
the project and significantly improved the likelihood that project investments and outcomes
would be sustainable.

46.     Institutional. At the local level, municipalities and mancomunidades have committed to
maintaining and enhancing the technical units for land use planning created under the project;
they have absorbed staff and operational costs within their budgets and are currently hiring
private technical service providers (PSTs) to assist in the design and implementation of new
investment projects. These units are now crucial in supporting municipal authorities in the design,
management, and updating of land use planning tools (PEDMs and Municipal Territorial Land
Use Plans [PMOTsD and municipal cadastres. At the national level, the 2007 Forestry Law
created a new legal and institutional framework for the protection and development of forests, but
GOH will need to provide more political and financial support to the ICF (formerly AFE-
COHDEFOR) to fulfill its mandate.

47.     Land Regularization. The pilot effort in Yoro left two important legacies that will
contribute to support and scale-up future efforts to regularize lands in forest areas: (i) an
operational framework and field-tested methodology to guide regularization processes applicable
to other parts of the country; and (ii) the formal establishment of the National Committee for
Land Regularization of -Rural Areas, integrating all relevant national and local government
agencies (INA, IP, SAG, ICF [formerly AFE-COHDEFOR], SGJ, and the Association of
Municipalities of Honduras [AMHOND. This Committee is an- important inter-institutional
coordination mechanism that was not there before. These instruments and lessons learned are
expected to be transmitted to other projects conducting similar activities. In particular, the
Honduras Land Administration Project (PATH) is expected to benefit from these efforts during
its second phase, which at the time of this ICR was under preparation.

48.     Economic. Strengthening social and human capital in communities and producers groups
has led to the creation of microenterprises and other productive community initiatives, which are
contributing to a more permanent improvement of livelihoods by increasing and diversifying

                                               15
income and generating employment. In this same area, the project helped to prepare forest
management plans for sustainable production of timber and other natural resources in more than
132,000 ha of pine forest, which when implemented would benefit communities, agro-forestry
groups and indigenous tribes with income and employment. On the provision of technical
assistance, the quality and demand for technical service providers (PSTs) increased significantly
after these services were privatized. In particular, donor and government-financed rural
development projects have had a positive effect on increasing the demand for these services. On
the supply side, Local Base Organizations supported by the project to become PSTs have
succeeded in gaining a more profound knowledge of local conditions, being in closer contact with
producers, and linking them with markets.

49.     Environmental. The project contributed to creating a culture of environmental awareness
and protection of ecosystem values and services among all stakeholders. All land use planning
instruments and processes have strong environmental elements that have been widely accepted
and applied. The project created long term management tools and/or co-management agreements
in 11 of the most important protected areas in the country, which will be managed locally and
under a strong participatory approach. Regarding the long-term financial sustainability of these
areas, the government failed to make the Protected Areas Fund operational which is critical to
maintain the SINHAP as a viable system. To overcome this obstacle ICF (previously AFE-
COHDEFOR) will have to receive adequate political and financial support, particularly to
improve its capacity to establish and manage this fund and address specific regions of the country
where threats to deforestation are more aggressive (e.g. Patuca, Tawahka and Rfo Pldtano
Biosphere Reserves).

50.     Social. Social development was a cross-cutting theme that permeated all project activities
and actions. By creating and strengthening social capital in all social groups, including vulnerable
populations (e.g. indigenous tribes, women and rural youth), the project contributed to
empowering them to become active stakeholders in all land use planning processes and improved
their capacity to access development funds and technical services that were not available to them
before.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.     Development Objective. At project closure, the PDO continued to be highly relevant and
consistent with GOB's current policies and programs for poverty reduction in general, and rural
development, decentralization, disaster prevention and mitigation, and forestry more specifically.
The project also remained highly relevant to the 2007-2010 CAS (agreed with the GOB on
November 2006), which fully supported government's PRS. The PRS comprised six pillars, one
of which was poverty reduction in rural areas, and had three over-arching themes of
environmental sustainability, decentralization and gender equity. Both the CAS and PRS stressed
the need to accelerate equitable and sustainable economic growth, with the PRS identifying four
sectors as having high productive potential. The forest sector was one of these, and was defined
as a national priority, requiring focused attention. Achieving sustainable management of forests



                                                16
 was identified as a prerequisite to ensuring economic growth, employment generation, and
 poverty alleviation in remote, forested rural areas.

52.      The 2007-2010 CAS, for its part, put forward four strategic objectives (pillars) and
identified a set of key interventions to achieve these, including: (i) accelerating economic growth
- by improving security of access to land, rural competitiveness and agro-forestry employment;
(ii) strengthening governance - by fostering decentralization; (iii) strengthening environmental
protection and risk management - through improving viability of Protected Areas and reducing
the impacts of natural disasters; and (iv) developing human capital - by strengthening capacity of
indigenous peoples to manage their development. The CAS highlighted that the Bank's
interventions in Honduras needed to continue with the provision of assistance to local
communities and governments to foster sustainable rural development in Honduras.

53.      Project Design and Implementation. During implementation the project adapted to
changing political and· institutional conditions.           Government's stance on furthering
decentralization and addressing rural poverty required the project to be aligned with these
priorities. The project design was refined and made more relevant to the context as it exists at
present. In particular, (i) the refinement in the "Fund for Hillside Producers" focused more on
base organizations due to their excellent performance which also contributes to a higher level of
sustainability; (ii) the expanded use of decentralized and participatory processes for natural
resources management and conservation planning and co-management by municipalities
following inadequate financing for the implementing agency helps maintain the forest
management effort at the local level; and (iii) linking local level plans with government program
funding facilitates implementation of the integrated land use plans and priorities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

A.         Reduce poverty in poor rural areas (Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory)
           A.I Income generation and employment creation (Rating: Satisfactory)

54.      The project financed 74 community subprojects that benefited a total of 18,798
households (including 3,111 households of the Tolupan and Pech Indigenous Tribes; target:
4000) against the formally revised target of 19,000 households. Subprojects were oriented to
respond to community needs and focused on the adoption of new technologies for agriculture and
natural resources production systems that contributed to increased productivity, improved and
diversified sources of income, and generated employment. Some key indicators of the outcomes
of this sub-PD~ are as follows 12:

          •          Communities were able to substantially increase productivity and broaden their
                     sources of income. Subprojects related to a variety of production systems

                                                                   17
                      including basic grains (e.g. corn and beans), coffee, pasture, diversification to
                      alternative crops (e.g. yucca, malanga and banana), agro-forestry, community
                      forestry, and forest value-added chains.
           •          The subprojects resulted in an estimated increase in average annual household
                      income of US$631 (62% increase over a target of 55%).
           •          In a sub-set of communities that included a Tolupdn indigenous tribe, pilot
                      community forestry subprojects covering an area of 34,388 ha and benefiting
                      1,182 households, were successfully initiated with a focus on adding value to
                      forest product chains. Initial estimation is that these subprojects resulted in an
                      increase in community income in as much as 304%.
           •          Beneficiary communities reported an increase in productivity - annual corn and
                      bean production increased by as much as 23%.
           •          Annual gross income generated in the project area from agricultural activities was
                      approximately US$17.8 million, of which US$15.4 million was from basic grains
                      and coffee, and US$2.4 million was from other diversified crops.

55.      Thirty-four new microenterprises were established, and an additional 54 microenterprises
- previously established under the PAAR project - were strengthened. These microenterprises
focused on the production, transformation, value-adding, and commercialization of a variety of
agricultural (e.g. coffee, yucca), forest (e.g. timber and non-timber); and handcrafts. These
activities benefited a total of 1,234 producers.

56.     Based on a sample of 15% of subprojects across the project area, the project generated an
average of 49 permanent jobs per subproject, yielding an estimated total of about 3,000 for the 74
subprojects, of which 67% were for men and 33% were for women. Based on multiplier of 1.8,
an estimated additional 5,400 (indirect) jobs were created.

57.      The project also established and strengthened a broad base of private technical and
extension services - as part of its overall strategy to assist rural communities - which are now
assisting many remote, poor forest communities that had limited access to these services before.
Special emphasis was given to create extension capacities of local base community organizations
(Organizaciones de Base) and to consolidate the government's strategy of family-to-family
extension (Familias Enlace Colaboradoras).              Another important outcome was the
institutionalization of participatory, demand-driven applied research processes for agriculture and
forestry in the overall approach to research and extension by SNITTA 13.

58.      The project also achieved its target to have 30% of women participating in project
activities. In addition, there was a 48% increase in participation by women in local decision-
making processes. Gender concerns were main streamed into PEDMs and local natural resources
management and conservation activities. Other noteworthy outcomes included: development and
piloting of an Agricultural Sector Gender Equity Strategy with the National Women's Institute
(INAM); organization and strengthening of twenty-six Municipal Women's Affairs Offices


13 The project worked closely with SNITIA to define research priorities for the provinces of Olancho and Yoro. These were the basis for the
development ofSNITTA's national applied research agenda.



                                                                      18
(OMM); 55% of project-supported microenterprises headed by women (48 of 88) and 62% of
total beneficiaries in project-supported microenterprises were women (760 of 1,234) and; thirty-
eight informal rural credit schemes established in conjunction with the DICTA Gender Unit.

        A.2 Forest Land Regularization (Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory)

59.     Asset security through formal access to land was a second element of the project to
address rural poverty. The goal of the project was not to reduce poverty through actual titling -
that would have been impossible for the project to achieve given its duration. The twin objectives
were: (i) to pilot a systematic application of the legal and institutional framework that had never
been attempted before to regularize forest lands; and (ii) in the process, provide asset security to
targeted rural poor in the pilot by regularizing 150,000 hectares of forest land. Once the
procedures were tested, validated, and updated, the process could then be formally extended
beyond project completion to provide asset security to the rural poor in the remaining forest
lands. Although this could have been attempted with a conservative target, the project initiated it
with 150,000 ha that was revised down to 7,700 ha at MTR, and finally partially achieved to
regularize only 3,700 ha with benefit to 729 land owners.

60.     This failure stemmed from an underestimation of the complexity of regularization
processes in forest areas, where the main constraints faced during implementation included: (i)
delays in agreeing on a legal, operational and institutional framework involving INA, SAG, AFE-
COHDEFOR (now ICF), and IP; (ii) delays in ensuring that the approach was acceptable to the
Bank and included the appropriate safeguard provisions; (iii) a new forestry law which was
passed in 2007, adding new changes to the institutional framework; (iv) need to update the then-
current cadastre; and (v) interruption of the process when the Bank suspended portfolio-level
disbursements during the political crisis of 2009.

61.      Despite the limitations faced by the project in reaching its physical titling target, it must
be highlighted that the main objective of "validating procedures through actual titling" was
achieved, with two important outcomes which are likely to contribute to support and scale up
future efforts by government institutions and related programs (e.g. PATH), to regularize lands in
forest areas: (i) an operational framework and field-tested methodology that complies with legal
and institutional frameworks, developed under a participatory approach involving all relevant
institutions and stakeholders, and which is readily available to guide regularization processes in
other parts of the country; and (ii) the formal establishment of the National Committee for Land
Regularization of Rural Areas, integrating all relevant national and local government agencies
(i.e. INA, IP, SAG, ICF [formerly AFE-COHDEFOR], SGJ, and AMHON). These two outcomes
provide technical, institutional and political elements that did not exist before, and which will be
available for future land regularization efforts aimed at reducing poverty in rural areas.




                                                 19
B.    Improve sustainable natural resource management and conservation (Overall
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory)

       B.l Participatory strategic land use planning (Rating: Satisfactory)

62.     The project significantly contributed to improve the capacity of local governments and
community organizations to identify and manage strategies for more sustainable rural
development. Strategic land use planning was conducted with extensive participation of local
stakeholders, which ensure that their priorities and needs were considered in the design and
implementation of rural development strategies. The project used existing official planning
instruments (e.g. PEDM - which identify and prioritize actions for economic development- and
the Municipal and Regional Territorial Land Use Plan [PMOT and PROT respectively]), and
worked to ensure internal consistency and promote integration of natural resources and
environmental management elements with other local development priorities. In assisting
planning processes, two additional elements supported by the project played a very important
role: a municipal geographic information system and the modernization of municipal urban and
rural cadastre systems.

63.    The key indicators of the outcome of this   sub-PD~   include:

       •   All 36 project municipalities (target: 22) had PEDMs which were completed through
           participatory process, and incorporated environmental and natural resources
           management concerns. These plans have been formalized by municipal governments
           and the GOH, and are currently under execution. Twelve of these municipalities have
           also incorporated the technical assistance services initially provided by the project into
           their municipal budgets; .

       •   29 municipalities (target: 36) developed PMOT, using a new methodology designed
           and tested by the project in accordance to the new regulations for territorial zoning
           promoted by Secretary of Governance and Justice (SGJ). This approach is now
           widely used in Honduras. All PMOTs have been formalized by municipal
           governments and the GOH. To oversee the execution of PMOTs, Municipal
           Committees for Territorial Zoning (COMOTs) have also been formally established in
           the 29 municipalities;

       •   4 Mancomunidades, which integrate most of the 36 municipalities of the project area
           and cover an area of approximately 25% of the country's territory, also developed and
           formalized Regional Territorial Zoning Plans (PROTs). These plans are internally
           consistent and build upon the participatory municipal level integrated land use plans;
           and

       •   More than 340 community-based organizations (target: 180) were strengthened to
           carry out planning, administration, and management of their own productive and
           natural resources management activities.



                                                20
64.      Another important outcome of the project was the strengthening of capacities of
municipal governments to access funds from various sources to invest in productive activities.
Resulting from the approval and registration of PEDMs by national authorities, the 36 project
municipalities were able to access 100% of the financial resources available to them from the
Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Honduras Social Investment Fund (FHIS), leveraging funds
for more than US$11.6 million. These funds are being used by local governments to implement
activities under their PMOTs, and generate productive projects in favor of poor local
communities. In addition, 14 municipalities that updated their cadastral systems with project
funds were able to increase their fiscal revenues by up to 133% during the first year of
implementation, compared to municipalities outside the project area that did not invest in this
activity.

        B.2 Forest management, conservation,and maintenance (Rating: Unsatisfactory)

65.     The project was able to incorporate 872,000 ha (62% of the original target of 1.4 million
ha) of forests lands under different regimes of sustainable management with community
participation:

        •      132,636 ha (target was 600,000 ha) under new or updated forest management
               plans for sustainable timber production in pine forests;
        •      659,048 ha of new and updated conservation management plans in the 11 priority
               protected areas assisted by the project;
        •      32,227 ha under protection plans in strategic upper watershed areas vulnerable to
               natural disasters; and
        •      48,000 ha under COmniunity forestry plans.

66.      The main reason for falling short in reaching the 1.4 million hectares goal was the limited
institutional and budgetary capacity of AFE-COHDEFOR to prepare forest management plans
and an operational strategy for the 600,000 ha target area of, pine forest. Although this was
recognized at MTR the target was not reduced. Instead the project moved its efforts to
decentralize forest management and conservation actions and responsibilities to municipal
governments, community organizations, NGO's and regional organizations.

67.     To evaluate impacts of project activities on lowering deforestation rates, the project
financed a study to assess land use change based on a multi-temporal comparison of satellite
images (2002-2009). The study was conducted by the National School of Forest Science
(ESNACIFOR), with assistance from Utah State University, and using NASA's MODIS images.
Results showed that for the project as a whole there was a net increase in forest cover of 122,000
ha, which could be related to the effects of improved forest management and conservation in
areas under pine forests cover. There were, however, some pockets under tropical forest cover of
the province of Yoro, and in buffer zones of the Patuca, Tawahka Asagni and Rio Platano
biosphere reserves, of the Province of Olancho, where the deforestation rate persisted, mainly as a
result of the advance of the cattle ranching frontier. Additional important outcomes of this study
were the 2009 Land Use Map of Honduras, and the updated 2009 version of the Ecosystems Map
for Honduras. These two products are now widely used in Honduras by government agencies,
academic institutions, NGO's and donor organizations.

                                               21
68.     Apart from the net increase in the forest cover, the project was able to create local
capacities leading such actions as:

       •       establishment of co-management agreements for protected areas with
               municipalities, mancomunidades and NGOs, currently operating in 8 protected
               areas (target: 6);
       •       execution of forest fire and pest control plans covering more than 100,000 ha by
               municipalities and agro-forestry producers groups;
       •       watershed management to protect water resources in 32,000 ha by
               mancomunidades; and
       •       nursery management and small scale reforestation by local communities.

69.    Another key outcome was the creation of the Model Forest of the Province of Yoro,
which was initiated under the leadership of the MAMUNCRAC (Mancomunidad de Municipios de
la Cuenca del Rio Aguan y Cuyamapa) regional organization. This initiative, promoted by the
Canadian Government, using project-promoted methodology, resulted in establishing a regional
forum to facilitate broad community participation to improve governance and achieve consensus
among local actors regarding the management of their forest resources.

70.     To assure maintenance of the protected areas, the Honduras Protected Areas· Fund was
established through an Executive Order during the 2001-2005 administration, with an initial
endowment of US$3 million. The project sponsored the establishment of the Honduras
Foundation for the Conservation of Nature (FHCN) as the proposed legal entity to administer the
fund, and it also assisted the development of its statutes (published in July 2007) and operational
procedures. The new Forestry Law in 2007 did not recognize the FHCN as an acceptable figure to
administer the fund, and even though the project reinitiated the dialogue with the new Forestry
Agency (ICF) , and the Ministry of Environment (SERNA) thereafter, the fund remained
inoperative.

C.     Increase disaster preparedness (Rating: Satisfactory)

71.      The project successfully assisted in the development of Land use and Vulnerability
Reduction Plans (PPR) in 26 Municipalities (target: 36). These municipalities are located in
critical watersheds of the four departments in Honduras most susceptible to natural disasters.
Vulnerability plans were prepared using a widely accepted participatory methodology, and in full
alignment with the regional and municipal zoning plans (PMOTs and PROTs). PPRs were
formalized by Municipal decrees, certified by the Permanent Commission of Contingencies
(COPECO), and are currently under execution by the Municipal Emergency Committees
(CODEMs). Fifteen of these municipalities (target: 10) established institutional relationships to
obtain financing to prepare their PPRs and implement related activities as a priority. The project
also established a close collaboration with COPECO to assist in the design and promotion of
regulations to reduce disaster and other environmental risks in urban and rural areas.

 3.3. Efficiency

 72.      The economic and financial analysis for the project at preparation comprised a series of
 economic and financial indicators, largely coming from the outcomes generated by the PAAR
 Project. The economic and financial analysis for this ICR is similarly structured, and a summary
 of its key findings is presented below. A more detailed account is provided in Annex 3.

 73.    Financial Feasibility of Subprojects. Net financial benefits were measured by analyzing
 a sample of 7 subprojects, or about 12.5% of all subprojects supported by the Community
 Forestry component. Data collected by the PCU was complemented by information obtained
 through a post-completion survey applied to the heads of households of the sampled subprojects.
 All indicators coming out of this analysis were positive, showing internal rates of return higher
 than 12%, the discount rate chosen to represent the opportunity cost of capital, net present values
 higher than zero, and benefit-cost ratios higher than one. It was estimated that when all net
 revenues went to household income, each family increased its income by about US$631 per year.
 Furthermore, it was estimated that, on average, each subproject generated around 49 jobs (full-
 time-equivalent) .

 74.    Funding benefits to municipalities supported under Component 3. Throu¥;h capacity
 building support, participating municipalities were able to secure 100% of their ERP 4-allocated
 funds, while adjacent municipalities that did not receive such support from the project, only
 secured 72% of their ERP-allocated funds.

75.     Economic Analysis. Economic benefits were derived from forest areas under
management plans financed by the Forest Management, Tenure and Conservation component in
an area of approximately 133,000 ha. Through an increase in forest yields, timber output was
estimated to have grown by as much as 14% or 2.35 million m3. This is equivalent to an
increment of about US$140.3 million, when compared to the economic benefits from a scenario
where forest yields remain constant as observed in unmanaged forests. The corresponding
benefit-cost ratio was estimated at 16.08.

76.     Also, the economic analysis for the Community Forestry component as a whole, yielded a
net present value of US$664,800, and internal rate of return of 47% and a benefit-cost ratio of
1.79. In addition, with respect to cost efficiency, it was estimated that per-family costs for
technical assistance decreased by 115%, when compared to the PAAR project. These cost
reductions came about mainly as a result of the new technical assistance delivery modalities
implemented by the project.

77.      Fiscal Impact Analysis. Fourteen municipalities received capacity building support
under Component 3 to establish and operate municipal cadastres. An analysis of the impact of
this support on municipal fiscal revenues showed that these increased by 55% from 2006 to 2007,
the first year after cadastre implementation, and by 47% from 2007 to 2008. Moreover, a cost-
benefit analysis with respect to incremental costs and benefits for 6 municipalities for which data

corresponding pre-cadastre ratios.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     The PD~ remains relevant in the context of the Honduran development initiatives. The
project processes and design were suitably modified during implementation to become
responsive to the legal, administrative and political realities. As such, therefore, the design is
replicable even in the post-project period. The project also contributed significantly to
developing and mainstreaming instruments, approaches and operational policies for central
government line agencies' (DICTA 16, SGJ 17 , IP I8 , INA I9 ) and other non-government actors'
(AMHON2o , ESNACIFOR21 ) implementation of decentralized programs.

79.     The impact of subprojects on income generation and employment was good; this can at
best be considered modest given that the gestation time for most of the productive investments is
in the range of three to ten years for agricultural, microenterprise, horticultural and forestry. The
project was successful in creating and strengthening social and human capital that led
community organizations and producer groups to diversify sources of income and broaden their
opportunities to access new markets. Communities are now also more empowered to access
technical services and influence decision-making processes of local governments for land use
planning and access to development funds.

80.     In respect of forest land tenure, the project succeeded in establishing a process framework
and a methodology to regularize forest lands, consistent with the current legal and institutional
frameworks, and endorsed by all relevant institutions. This outcome is a project legacy which
will guide future efforts to regularize forest areas in favor of poor rural communities. Due to the
complexities involved,however, the physical titling target could not be achieved.

8L      The project significantly improved the process of management and conservation of
natural resources with the full participation of local communities, producers groups, other local
organizations and vulnerable populations. Long-term, strategic land use planning instruments to
identify and manage economic and social priorities, environmental management, and protection
against natural disasters have been developed and institutionalized (at the national-level, with
SGJ, and at the local level with AMHON, mancomunidades and municipalities). Against the

                                                                    24
target of 1.4 million hectares, close to 875,000 hectares of forest land and protected areas were
incorporated into the participatory management approach resulting in a net increase in forest
cover during the project period. More importantly, the preparation and implementation of the
co-management plans are clearly replicable. However, the failure of GOH to implement the
Honduras Protected Areas Fund (FHAP) that would finance the recurrent costs of the
decentralized management of protected areas, is likely to affect long-term management activities
in these areas.

82.    Although the outcomes related to the sub-PDOs have been mixed, given their continued
relevance, and having achieved these with a mere six months extension in closing date, and
without compromising the ERR or the positive fiscal impacts, on balance, the achievement has
been rated as moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

83.      Poverty Alleviation. A strategy was developed to combine poverty reduction with a
territorial approach to sustainably manage natural resources leading to improve livelihoods and
sources of income and employment. The project succeeded in assisting almost 19,000
households -including indigenous populations- to improve their agriculture and natural resources
production systems and food security. The project did this by supporting local actors to improve
their capacity to offer extension and specialized technical assistance services, which included
many local based organizations and horizontal family to family support. The project also worked
closely with municipal governments and other regional and local institutions to create local
capacities to obtain funds from different governmental sources, and apply these to support
community development. As part of its efforts to create local capacities to improve land use
planning for sustainable rural development, the project promoted a highly participatory bottom-
up approach to identify and prioritize community needs to improve livelihoods. The planning
instruments that were introduced are of a long term nature and can be used to follow up on
actions and commitments made in favor of local communities.

84.      Gender Aspects. Natural resource and forestry management in Honduras has traditionally
been a male-dominated enterprise: women tended to have low levels of involvement in forestry
activities and especially at the decision-making levels.;fhe project provided a new space for
women's participation in forestry management: 90% of microenterprises and 44% of forestry
associations are led by women. From a municipal and community standpoint, efforts were made
to seek greater participation by women in decision-making, and for the issue of gender to
influence municipal development planning, as well as to promote support for women in order to
increase their participation in activities related to the management and conservation of natural
resources. The orientation of this issue was aimed at supporting the following policies and policy
measures: implementation of the Gender Equity strategy for the agricultural sector, in
coordination with the National Women's Institute (INAM); organization and strengthening of the
Municipal Offices of Women's Issues (Ojicinas Municipales de la Mujer - OMM); and proposal
of alternative solutions to municipalities, civil society and social organizations.



                                               25
85.     Rural Youth. The sustainability and adoption of new technologies promoted by the
Project have put new emphasis on the participation of rural young people, mainly in expanding
their knowledge and skills. The Project successfully trained 10 young adults from the Tolupan
tribe in San Francisco, Yoro, and 3,000 young adults in other regions on topics such as
envimnment, forestry management, agro-forestry production, and agribusiness. Another 12
young adults received grants for formal high school education, graduating in forestry,
environment agriculture and business administration.

86.     Social Development Overall, the project addressed the needs of indigenous communities
through the implementation of its Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. The project worked
with 33 Tolupan and 8 Pech tribes, representing a population of approximately 22,000 people in
an area of 115,000 ha Under each of its components, the project assisted communities by
providing support to activities that included: (i) productive subprojects including agriculture, ago-
forestry and community forestry; (ii) training and scholarships for mid school and technical levels
for agro-forestry, business administration and other topics;' (iii) transformation and
commercialization of agricultural and forest products: (iv) land use planning and institutional
strengthening and governance; (iv) community census and statues; and (v) legal advice for land
conflict resolution. The project established participation agreements with both the Pech
(FETRIPH) and the Tolupan (FETRIXY) Federations and agreed to assist on a strategy to
strengthen their technical and institutional capacities in favor of the tribes they represent within
the project areas. The total project investment in the IPDP was approximately US$1.5 million.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

87.      The project significantly contributed to strengthen local institutions by empowering them
to improve their role and mandate to promote rural development. In doing this, the project was
also able to influence national institutions and policies that affect the rural sector. The results and
impacts of the institutional strengthening of local level organizations were not only measurable in
increased income. The solidarity, collaboration and interaction among all local stakeholders
(Mancomunidades, Municipalities, Community Organizations) were impressively high, and the
dynamic created by the strengthening of municipal cadastres was of such magnitude that these
processes are now irreversible. By creating a wide network of more empowered and capable
loc.al institutions to capture the benefits of decentralization, the project offered a very fertile
ground to National institutions such as SGJ, INA, ICF (previously AFE-COHDEFOR), and IP to
apply their sector programs and instruments. A good example of this is the SGJ who was able to
operationalize its territorial zoning instruments. To a lesser extent, IP, INA and ICF also
benefited from the lessons generated by the land regularization pilot.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

88.     The Yoro Model Forest (YMF). The project invested efforts in creating and
strengthening a Model Forest initiative in Yoro, which was established under the guidance and
technical support of the [bero American Model Forest Network. The Model Forest concept is
based on the creation of an institutional framework to promote and open dialogue among all local
stakeholders to make decisions regarding the management and conservation of a particular forest
area or region. The YMF covers 5 municipalities of the Department of Yoro, and has a board of

                                                 26
 directors chaired by the head of the most important mancomunidad in the region
 (MAMUNCRAC). The YMF is a fIrst step to improve the governance and decision-making
 processes that affect local land owners living in these forests and benefiting from them. This
 initiative will help to sustain many of the project's investments in the Yoro Province.

89.    Microenterprise Development The Project established a specialized unit to promote the
development of micro and small enterprises through effIciency improvements, competitiveness,
and economic profItability. This unit became very successful but the Project only had funds to
support a limited number of enterprises. In response, the Bank assisted GOH in obtaining a grant
from the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) for the amount of approximately US$1.5
million to support new enterprises in the Departments of Yoro, Olancho and Francisco Morauln
(the Microenterprise Development for the Poor and Indigenous People [PRODEMIN] Project).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(N/A)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

90.     The overall risk to development outcomes was evaluated based on three main elements:
(i) continuation of participatory and decentralized land use planning and sustainable management
of natural resources; (ii) sustainability of livelihood initiatives through subprojects; and (iii)
productive management of forest resources (pine forests), management and conservation of
protected areas, and advancement in land regularization.

91.     Continuation of decentralized and participatory land use planning and sustainable
management of natural resources. Risk to development outcomes is low. The principal
instruments for local (mancomunidad, municipal and community) land, natural resources and
economic development planning have been mainstreamed within the national authority
responsible for implementing decentralization, and local planning and land use zoning processes
(Secretary of Technical Planning and External Cooperation [Secretaria Tecnica de Planeacion y
Cooperacion Externa, SEPLAN], after February 2010)22. The local level implementation of these
planning processes has been appropriated by local government units, and the capacity developed
to do so, at both the municipal and mancomunidad levels.

92.     The participatory plans themselves are instruments for providing continuity between
Municipal administrations, in that it would be difficult for newly-elected officials to ignore the
demands of communities as fonnalized through planning processes.                   Further, both
mancomunidades and the National Association of Honduran Municipalities (AMHON) would
also provide for continuity and follow up between municipal administrations by working with the
new administrations, providing institutional memory, technical support and training.


22 SEPLAN, which was created during the current administration (February 2010), absorbed the responsibility to implement land use planning
and decentralization policies and programs, previously conducted by the Secretary of Governance and Justice (SGJ).



                                                                    27
93.    Increasingly, programs for productive investment and natural resources management (e.g.,
PRSP funds, bi-Iateral funding) flow through local institutions (fiscal decentralization), with
completed and agreed land use and development plans being a prerequisite to receive funding and
to serve as a framework for the subsequent investments. The country's legal framework also
supports the continued application of these processes with and through local institutions and legal
frameworks (e.g., the Law on Territorial Development and the new Forestry Law).

94.      While not all national-level institutions (esp. the forestry agency; ICF) have internalized
their support for or reformed their organizational norms and procedures to support these
decentralized processes, the long term risk from these still remains low. First, because the
e.xisting legal framework has internalized GOH decentralization policy23. And second, because
public budgets increasingly reflect GOH and donor policies of (fiscal and political)
decentralization, requiring the national level agencies to adapt to their shrinking budgetary
resources.

95.     Sustainability of livelihoods initiative through subprojects. Risk to development
outcomes is moderate. Productive investments for agriculture, forestry, and value-added
processing of the major, locally-produced and marketable commodities have been incorporated
into the local participatory land use and economic development plans. Local communities and
producer groups have increased their technical capacities and, through project and GOH funds
(i.e., PRSP funds), have improved existing production systems and generated new sources of
income and employment.

96.      The demand for additional support services, extension and market access, will likely
remain high, while GOH capacity to meet that need through the (strengthened and more efficient)
privatized system will likely be limited by available resources. Some of this demand would be
met through local resources (e.g., through fiscally decentralized program financing and producer
organizations own technicians, paid for through sales of major commodities such as coffee).
Other donor projects, all of which support the privatized and demand-driven extension model, are
active in the project region and continue to support many of the project-assisted communities and
initiatives.

97.    Forest and Protected Areas Management, and advancement in Land Regularization.
Risk to development outcomes is high. Project investments generate economic benefits for local
communities where management plans were prepared for productive management and protection
of pine forests and protected areas. Continuity of these will depend on the political will of the
GOH to put into effect the reforms of the forest sector through the new Forestry Law, and to
provide the minimally adequate budgetary resources to develop and sustain the forest sector's
economic potential.




23 For example, where prior forestry laws focused on the public forest agency and its role, the new Forestry Law redefines the forest sector as its
set of public, private and civil society actors and institutional stakeholders. It also establishes community, municipal and departmental forestry
councils that comprise local stakeholders as having the role of "consultation, reconciliation, social control and coordination of the public sector
and the private and community organizations involved... inforest areas".



                                                                        28
98.     Development, testing and systematization of the process to regularize forested areas has
provided relevant institutional actors with a framework (individually approved by all) that can be
applied when GOB takes the decision to move forward on this activity critical to the future of
sustainable forest management and poverty reduction/economic development in rural areas.
However, future government support in these areas remains questionable.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.     QAG rated quality at entry for the Project as satisfactory. The Project was highly relevant
as stated in the PRSP and CAS, and fully-aligned with the forestry and land sector reforms
promoted· by the GOH at the time. During preparation, the Bank team conducted a thorough
assessment of sector and institutional conditions, and adequately reflected in the design the
important lessons learned from the PAAR and other predecessor projects. Targets set for two sub-
components of the project, namely, forest land regularization and sustainable forest management
in national lands, however were overly ambitious and suffered from an underestimation of the
political, institutional and budgetary support for their achievement. With land regularization, even
though processes were successfully initiated in a small pilot area, scaling up to reach the target of
150,000 ha became unrealistic and risky. The target of incorporating 600,000 ha under
sustainable forest management regimes was also hindered by the limited capacity of the forestry
agency to perform its role as a project co-executor, and the delays of institutional and legal
reforms expected to strengthen the mandate and performance of this institution.

100. The high relevance of the PDO and the satisfactory elements of project design with tested
components from the predecessor project offered an adequate framework for project
implementation, but there were significant shortcomings relating to targets and some risk
mitigating measures. As a result, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

 101. During project implementation, the Bank conducted regular supervision missions. The
Bank team included an adequate mix of multi -disciplined technical specialists and had two task
team leaders, both of whom were experts in community-based natural resource management.
During supervision missions, the Bank always conducted extensive field visits to learn about
project conditions on the ground and sought interaction with all beneficiaries (producers,
technical service providers, municipal mayors, local organization leaders, ethnic groups, and local
co-executors) to identify opportunities and constraints to improve project execution and achieve
its goals. The Bank team also had a permanent dialogue, and regularly met with national level

                                                29
co-executing government agencies (e.g. INA, IP, AFE-COHDEFOR, SGJ) and donors (e.g. EU,
IDB, GTZ) to identify solutions to implementation constraints, and explore new opportunities for
collaboration.

102. During the MTR, the Bank performed a thorough evaluation of project performance,
which justified modification of project components, adjustment of targets, and a restructuring of
the project to respond to ground realities, political changes and budgetary constraints. All of its
recommendations were incorporated into the project's execution strategy, which significantly
improved its performance in the post-MTR period. The Bank was also proactive in identifying
some minor procurement irregularities, which were immediately reported to INT and
subsequently resolved.

103. Finally, in response to the constitutional crisis of 2009, the team extended the project
closing date to ensure orderly completion of project activities and evaluation of project
performance.

104. Overall, the Bank adequately assessed the opportunities and constraints affecting project
implementation and was proactive in identifying concrete and timely corrective measures.
Therefore, Bank performance during implementation is rated as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

105. Given the less than satisfactory performance at preparation stage, and the highly proactive
performance during project implementation, on balance, the overall Bank performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

106. The GOH assumed a responsible, politically-committed stance on promoting project
preparation, given the high relevance that poverty alleviation and sustainable management of
natural resources had for the country. During initial discussions with the Bank, the GOH
managed to include the Forests and Rural Productivity Project (PBPR) in the 2003 CAS and in
doing so it had to reduce the financing commitment to three other IDA base case projects. The
project, however, had a slow start due to the change in government administration in 2006. The
original PCU, which managed two other projects (PATH and the Natural Disaster Mitigation
Project, PMDN) had to be restructured in response to a presidential decree to create individual
PCUs in all line ministries. The new PCU established under SAG benefited from a strong
political technical support from this agency to restate its capacities to conduct an efficient
implementation of the project. In general, government support continued during the life of the
project, although with some initial delays in the provision of sufficient counterpart funds, which .

                                               30
were resolved towards the end of implementation. With regards to the challenges faced by the
project to ensure a good perforrn:ance of the forestry agency as a co-executing partner, the
Government could have offered more support to provide the required operational funds and
advance in the institutional and legal reforms needed to achieve some project goals. Accordingly,
Goverrtment performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or. Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

 107. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG), as the executing agency of the project
offered strong and continuous political and technical support during project execution. SAG, in
its leading role to define the national policies for rural development in agriculture and forestry,
played a critical role as a liaison with partner line ministries (e.g. SGJ, AFE-COHDEFOR) and
other government institutions (e.g. IP, INA) to coordinate the dialogue and specific actions to
achieve project objectives. After restructuring the multi-project PCU under SAG in 2006, the
new unit went through an initial period of limited effectiveness, which was overcome once new
technical and fiduciary staff were hired and trained.

108. The new PCU evolved to playa very important role in project implementation. It had
highly experienced and committed technical and fiduciary staff that became very effective in
coordinating project activities with multiple agencies and other stakeholders at national and local
levels, promoted and supervised project actions in the field, and performed fiduciary activities
diligently. In early stages of implementation, there were issues with non-compliance in
procurement and financial management procedures. At MTR the peu was restructured to
strengthen the fiduciary capacities of the unit, and also to respond to new events and innovations
that required improvements in project execution, and new fiduciary and technical staff was hired.
Subsequent procurement and financial management evaluations did not find any major issues and
by project closure both procurement and financial management ratings were rated as moderately
satisfactory. Accordingly, the performance of the implementation agency is rated as satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

109. While Government's performance is rated moderately satisfactory, and the implementing
agency performance is rated satisfactory, the outcome of the PD~ is rated as moderately
satisfactory. Thus, overall Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

110. There are inevitable complexities in pursuing objectives of poverty reduction and
rural development through sustainable use of natural resources in a decentralized
environment, through bottom-up processes. Project design and implementation arrangements
must therefore allow for learning and flexibility to make adjustments in order to accomplish the
PD~ and key project results. This requires both good country knowledge and well-targeted
analytical efforts to understand prevailing socio-economic-political conditions that will affect and

                                                31
define the context for project execution. In this fashion, those critical areas where appropriate
flexibility and adaptability should be allowed may be identified and targeted to maximize the
potential for achieving desired impacts.

111. Effectively introducing and managing participatory processes requires a great deal
of effort and attention on the part of the project. The cost of this effort, in terms of project
staff time is likely to be significant and ought to be accompanied by above-average budget
resources. In terms of implementation budget, where government policies and legal and
institutional frameworks are supportive, the costs of the participatory processes themselves need
not be exorbitant. Rather, the approaches and instruments should be developed with a clear view
of providing a minimum, adequate framework that can be sustained through local (primarily in-
kind) and national resources. The process of developing these should also be done with and
through the responsible government institutions so that the institutionalization of the approaches
and instruments becomes one of the project's outputs. In the absence of a supportive institutional
framework and the minimum required budgetary resources, as in the case of the state forestry
agency, progress and results are significantly curtailed.

112. Strengthening existing local institutions (e.g., community-based organization,
municipal governments and their associated civil society institutions, and the
mancomunidades) and promoting a culture of civil society participation pays high dividends
in terms of transparency, ownership, accountability and quality of project investment. This
requires appropriate investments in strengthening local institutions and their social capital in
order to improve the governance of the local decision making processes and ensure that they are
both democratic and representative of local aspirations. Following such an approach in NRM
projects significantly increases the potential to sustain outcomes through the mainstreaming of
productive, conservation and protection concerns into the local framework for integrated rural
developnient.

113. Institution building has generally been identified as one area where World Bank
projects have had only limited success. The potential for success in this area and for achieving
institutional sustainability of project outcomes can be enhanced when project design and
implementation both focus on having and implementing an institutional exit strategy throughout
the entire project cycle. In effect, this will ensure that the project's role is the appropriate one of
a facilitator and supporter (rather than as an implementer) of the sector policies and programs to
which it contributes. By taking such a role, the institutions being supported (both nationally and
locally) will likely have a significantly greater level of acceptance of the project, improving the
likelihood of sustaining the project's investments and outcomes. Where such an approach is
unlikely to function is where support is desired for the implementation of dubious policies (e.g.·
SAG's 'bono tecnoI6gico', a politically-driven, unsustainable subsidy program) or for actions
incompatible with the legal agreement and/or good practice (i.e., AFE-COHDEFOR's demand
for project fmancing of the institution's basic operational budget).

114. For complex interventions, scaling up should be attempted only if the pilot itself is of
reasonable size and replicates. In case of forest land tenure regularization the complexity of the
process - technically in the field, institutionally, requirements for high quality spatial information,
need for conflict resolution, newness of the approach, and need for adequate decentralized


                                                 32
 information systems - makes the activity unwieldy and the results potentially very site and
 condition specific. Further replications to test methodological robustness and to make
 adjustments should be considered as essential next steps in the process of up-scaling. .

 115. In establishing a system for decentralized and privatized extension, there should be a
 combination of private and producer organization-based technical service providers. The
 former are needed where innovation andlor specialized services are required. The latter have the
 benefit of being decentralized already, and working with and through them builds local level
 capacity and creates the potential for more efficient expansion of the system locally, and across
 other crops and activities.      Further, working directly with producer organizations and their
 technical staff facilitates the process of embedding farmer demand into extension and research
 agendas of the national system. Such a system can not only be very effective in providing
 extension for traditional farming activities but also for more commercial activities such as
 marketing, commercialization of local produce, and technical assessment of processing
 investments. In the first instance, private technical service providers are more likely to have the
 knowledge and capacity to meet more advanced commercial needs. In all cases, where private
 technical service providers are brought in, their performance should also be measured in
 enhancing local capacity to carryon these services once project resources are no longer available.

 116.   Where there are complex institutional scenarios for project implementation, there is
 a good argument for locating project implementation responsibility at the policy-level
 rather than at the operational-level. This allows the project to operate within a multi-sector
 environment and maintain the required political support to achieve results and impacts that would
 not have been achievable if the project had been located within a line agency operating within its
 own limited mandate.

   117. Inevitably, natural resources management (NRM) must be based upon land use
  planning, the long history of which is characterized more by failure than success. When
  land use planning is pursued as an institutional process, rooted in the visions and aspirations of
  the de facto natural resources managers (community, municipality and mancomunidad), rather
  than as a technical process imposed by external technocrats, it can be a sound and successful
. instrument for facilitating rural development and sustainable NRM. In addition, where there is
  strong local ownership of the land use plans, they may become a basis for and be main streamed
  into local economic development plans and strategies; ensuring that sustainable NRM concerns
  are appropriately included. In this fashion, participatory, bottom-up land use planning at the
  community and municipal levels can be a powerful tool for promoting the sustainable
  management of rural landscapes and become the basis for guiding other programs andlor actions
  aimed at rural development and poverty reduction.

118.    Attention to offsetting the rlScal impacts of the decentralized processes is important
to sustaining project outcomes. In the case of the project, support for the modernization of the
municipal cadastre systems significantly improved the financial capacity of municipalities to
invest in rural development and NRM initiatives. To operate in a decentralized environment
where municipalities and mancomunidades are to play dominant roles in rural development,
sustained sources of income need to be ensured. Modernization of municipal cadastres is one
important source for increasing income.

119. Community forestry is a viable instrument to achieve sustainable NRM and
economic development of indigenous and non-indigenous communities under common land
property regimes. Project achievements will be greatest where a sound foundation of social and
human capital can be strengthened or created for good governance and decision-making around
the common property and where ongoing technical assistance can be provided to accompany the
communities throughout the productive management and production cycle.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by BorrowerlImplementing AgencieslPartners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

120. The GOH concurred with the draft ICR and submitted the following three main comments
through the Implementing Agency, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG):

       (i)     Comment: The main reason for the failure in achieving the target of assisting
               25,000 families under the Community Forestry Component was the increases in
               subproject costs in as much as 35%.

               Team response: this comment has been introduced into the final ICR.

       (ii)    Comment: The forestry agency (AFE-COHDEFOR and then ICF) and not the
               Ministry of Governance and Justice (SGJ) had an active participation in all land
               tenure regularization activities conducted by the project.

               Team response: the role of the forestry agency in land regularization has been
               highlighted in the final ICR.

       (iii)   Comment: Tbe project assisted the National System of Research and Technology
               Transfer (SNITTA) in the preparation of the research agendas of the provinces of
               Yoro and Olancho, and these were used as the basis for developing SNITTA's
               National Research Program.
               Team response: a section has been introduced in the final ICR to discuss this
               relevant project activity.

Component 1: Community Forestry

Estimated:            US$8.6 million
Actual:               US$6.3 million

The objective of this component was to provide extension services, trammg, and funding to
support community-demand driven initiatives in agro-forestry. This component built on the pilot
"Fund for Hillside Producers" established by the PAAR Project 24. Activities included (i)
subprojects comprising extension, technical assistance, training, and investment to improve the
standard of living of the rural poor occupying marginal forest lands; (ii) applied research
subprojects to demonstrate the benefits of improved technologies and strengthen the National
System for Research and Technology Transfer (SNITTA); and (iii) a training program to
strengthen the capacity of key local actors in the implementation process of subprojects,
including municipalities, Private Technical Service Providers (PSTs), and farmer leaders. This
component was a key element to the Secretary of Agriculture's development of its national
program for privatized extension services, and it served as a model to be replicated nationally.
Project investments strengthened the provision of technical services for natural resource-based
livelihood activities in marginal areas (sloping uplands and forest zones).

The component was subject to several key adjustments. First, the target to reach 25,000
households through productive subprojects was scaled back to 19,000 at the Mid-term Review
(MTR) mainly to a slow implementation, and the realization that a minimum two years was
required to implement subprojects. Subproject unit costs were also found to be 35% higher than
anticipated, further justifying the reduction in targeted households. Second, the MTR also
reflected private technical service providers' (PSTs) concerns that the number of activities·


24 The PAAR Project successfully established the administrative framework and methodological approach to provide privatized extension
services, training and competitive funding of applied research to benefit rural poor living in marginal areas. These new project was designed to
refine and test innovations to this model including shifting service provision from groups to communities and strengthening the organization and
role oflocal farmers and women's groups to ensure the provision of service demanded by communities (CDD).



                                                                     36
included, did not directly responded to community needs, were too numerous and diluted efforts
and impact. As such, subprojects were refocused on direct, productive and income generating
activities demanded by communities. Finally, experience in the first half of the project indicated
that there were opportunities in some locations to shift from private PSTs to local farmer-based
organizations as PSTs. At the end-of the project 11 of 26 PSTs were local organizations. While
the latter required some additional capacity building investments, building their service provision
capacity would ultimately be more sustainable.

Component 2: Forest Management Tenure and Conservation Component

Estimated:       US$17.1 million
Actual:          US$7.4 million

The objective of this component was to support GOH's national program for sustainable
management of national, municipal, communal/private forests and protected areas, thereby
developing the economic potential of and maintaining the environmental services provided by
forest ecosystems in about 1.4 million hectares of forest and institutionalizing new models of
public forest management. Activities included forest management, planning and/or protection;
regularization of land rights of communities living on national forest lands; better management
of priority protected areas and of the Honduras National Protected Areas System (SINAPH); and
establishment and operationalization of Honduras Protected Areas Fund to finance protection
and management in priority SINAPH Protected Areas.

The limited results accomplished under this component with regards to sustainable forest
management and conservation activities resulted from the inability of the public forest agency
(AFE-COHDEFOR) to perform its role. The project was intended to support decentralized,
large-scale management in public (pine) forest lands with dual conservation and production
objectives. Due to an almost complete lack of operational budget - which the project was not
designed to finance and was to come from the Agency's national budget - AFE-COHDEFOR's
field presence and forest management capacity were greatly reduced and largely ineffectual.

                                                       37
At MTR the scope of work was reduced focusing only on those forest planning and management
activities that could be executed in cooperation with and through municipalities, communities
and organized agro-forestry groups. Larger-scale forest management planning and management
activities on public lands - such as inventories, updating forest management and operations plans,
and preparation of timber auctions, expected to have been executed through AFE-COHDEFOR -
were halted. Only forest protection plans and management activities with communities were
continued; productive forest use was supported only through agro-forestry groups participating
in Component 1 subprojects. While this still permitted the achievement of forest conservation
and forest management decentralization objectives, productive and economic objectives were not
achieved.

The original target of land regularization in forest lands and protected areas of 150,000 ha was
also adjusted during MTR after recognizing that project design had underestimated the
institutional and legal complexity to complete the process. The decision made at MTR was to
establish a pilot project on a 7,700 ha area of the Agua Fria Forest Manag~ment Unit of the
province of Yoro (the PRAPAFY Pilot Project). The objectives of this activity were to test the
application of the existing national legal framework for delimitation, adjudication of legal rights,
and demarcation of national forest lands (e.g. Property Law and new Forestry Law) to identify
legal/procedural gaps and.generate a methodology to regularize these lands. The outputs of the
pilot were planned to produce a systematic set of procedures and methodologies for
regularization of national forest lands that could have a generic application to other forest regions
of the country. Also, this experience was designed to provide analytical and operational guidance
for the design of the second phase of the Land Administration Program (PATH), financed by the
Bank in Honduras, and currently under implementation.

Component 3: Local Government and Disaster Preparedness Component

Estimated:     US$1.8 million
Actual:        US$3.9 million

The objective of this component was to strengthen the capacity of municipal governments and
municipal associations (mancomunidades) to strategically take account of local priorities in the
other activities supported by the project. Activities under this component included assistance to
strengthen local organization and capacity to carry out participatory strategic planning at the
municipal and regional (mancomunidad) levels to generate and apply information for land use,
zoning, and vulnerability planning, to integrate outputs into the local development agenda, and to
develop and channel proposals to implement priority actions to the relevant funding source or
program.

The scope of this component was expanded in response to the high demand from the project
municipalities and their municipal associations (regional mancomunidades and national
AMHON) to conduct and expand actions for strategic land use planning, territorial zoning,
disaster preparedness, provision of technical assistance to local communities, and conducting
forest management and conservation activities by local stakeholders. During MTR, and as a
result of the very positive results achieved by the project at this time, an additional budget was
reallocated to strengthen and expand on its activities and improve the outcomes originally

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

The project's ex-post economic and financial analysis is based on PAAR's ex-post economic and
financial analysis. At the time of preparation, this project was considered the continuation of
PAAR's natural resources component; hence, the results from this component under PAAR were
used to assess the expected economic and financial benefits of this project. QAG's Quality at
Entry Assessment concluded that this approach provided a "good economic analysis,
incorporating technical features offorest production systems".

In the PAD, benefits were expected to be derived from the productive and natural resource
management activities under Component 1 (Community Forestry) and Component 2 (Forest
Management, Tenure, and Conservation), which combined represented over 70% of total
projected costs. However, due to changes in the scope of Component 2, the actual expenditure
share of these two components declined to only 55%, whereas the share of Component 3 (Local
Government and Disaster Preparedness) increased from 6% to 15.5%. Taking this reallocation
into account, the ex-post analysis only focuses on forest management activities under
Component 2 and adds activities under Component 3.

The following analysis is to evaluate economic and financial viability by component.

Component 1 - Community Forestry

Under this component, the project supported 61 productive subprojects through: (i) technical
assistance provided by technical service providers and local base organizations; (ii) matching
grants to finance the production and business activities of micro and small enterprises; and (iii)
applied research.

Data on a sample of 7 subprojects, which represent 11.5% of the subprojects' universe, was
collected to estimate the financial feasibility of these activities. The data included actual revenue
and operational costs. In order to make the sample as representative as possible, subprojects were
selected based on the type of activity, geographic area, and type of technical assistance received.

Table 1 shows the average parameters from the sample's aggregate flow of net benefits; the
parameters for the individual subprojects are included at the end of this section. At the individual
level, subprojects are financially feasible: internal rates of return are higher than the discount rate,
net present values (NPV) are positive, and benefit-cost ratios are greater than one. These
indicators are similar to those estimated at appraisal, when it was considered that subprojects
could have IRRs ranging from 34% to 41 % and benefit-cost ratios ranging from 1.8 to 2.0.

                  Present Value of Costs = PVC                          65,471
                  Benefit/Cost ratio = B/C = PVBIPVC                      1.71

A proportion of the project's administrative costs was added to calculate the economic efficiency
of the component based on the subprojects in the sample. The component has a net present value
of US$3,404, an internal rate of return (IRR) of 14.7%, and a benefit-cost ratio of 1.09, as shown
in Table 2. These parameters are more modest than those estimated at appraisal, when it was
considered that the community forestry component could have an IRR between 20 and 25% and
a benefit-cost ratio greater than 1.25.

                   Net Present Value                                     3,404
                   Internal Rate of Return                              14.7%

The increase in household income as a result of subprojects was also estimated as an additional
measure of economic benefits. In a sample of 10 subprojects, the analysis estimated an increase
in household income of US$631 per year. This increase in household is greater than the increase
of US$380 estimated for PAAR, which was used as point of reference in the PAp. No baseline
data of income was available for estimating the relative income increase for households
participating in the project. The basis for the estimation is shown on Table 3.

In terms of employment generation, in a sample of 9 subprojects it was estimated that, on
average, each subproject generated around 49 jobs (full-time-equivalent25). From these new jobs,
it was estimated that 67% went to men and 33% to women. The basis for these calculations is
shown in Table 4.

Looking at cost efficiency, the unit cost of technical assistance delivered by the project and
PAAR were measured and compared to assess any significant changes. By introducing



25 The average number of work-days per year fOT seasonal work is 87, whereas the average number of work-days per year for permanent work is
280.

innovative methods for technical assistance delivery, this project was able to reduce the unit cost
of technical assistance by 53%. As supported by the subproject's economic indicators, it can be
argued that no significant negative effects resulted from the increase in efficiency. The basis for
these calculations and results are shown on Table 5.

Component 2 - Forest Management, Tenure and Conservation

As mentioned earlier, the scope of work for this component was reduced during Project
implementation. The Forest Management Subcomponent only focused on the preparation and
implementation of forest management plan activities that could be executed in cooperation with
and through municipalities, communities, and organized agro-forestry groups. This resulted in
the project not supporting any tiIp:ber auctions in public forest areas, removing the most direct
economic benefit (sales of stumpage) expected from this component. Similarly, the Protected
Areas Management subcomponent focused only on assisting and strengthening local actors to
take formal responsibility for protected area management. The Regularization of Forest Land
Tenure subcomponent focused on establishing, documenting and formalizing the approach and
methodology for forest land tenure regularization for future replication by GOH.

This component did not directly generate financial benefits, but the economic benefits, as listed
below, were indirectly generated from the Project activities.

These economic benefits were generated from the implementation of forest management plans
developed or updated by the project. These forest management plans provided the basis for the
sustainable management of natural pine forests, focusing primarily on activities such as fire
prevention and control, pest management, thinning, and protection against encroachment. These
management interventions improved the potential for forest productivity compared to a scenario
without the project. These productivity gains are expected from an increase in timber yields and
environmental protection.

A total of 132,637 hectares of production (pine) forest was brought under management plans.
Under an optimum scenario of timber growth rate in the forest sites with the highest productivity

                                                44
potential, an incremental timber yield of 2-4 m3/ha/yr could be achieved. Over the rotation,
assuming a total cost of $300/ha for management and protection and a conservative increase in
total forest output from 270,000 to 400,000 m3 of timber at harvest, the incremental gross
revenue could range between $7-14 million.

Component 3 - Local Government and Disaster Preparedness

Strengthening the municipal cadastre and registries increased considerably the tax revenue
generated by municipalities. On average, all 14 municipalities supported by the project increased
their combined real estate tax revenues by 55% from 2006 to 2007, the first year after cadastre
implementation, and by 47% from 2007 to 2008.

A cost-benefit analysis with respect to incremental costs and benefits for six municipalities for
which data was available showed that all but one municipality increased its cost-benefit ratios
with respect to its ratios prior to project investments on the cadastre. The individual benefit-cost
ratios for these municipalities are shown on Table 6. According to municipal sources consulted,
the incremental fiscal revenue was used for investment projects (60%), hiring additional
personnel (20%), increase wages (15%) and other uses (5%).

It is also noteworthy that municipalities which received project support for capacity building
were more effective to leverage additional financing from the Poverty Reduction Strategy
(ERP) funds, than other comparable municipalities not benefited by the project. In the
Departments of Olancho and Paraiso, the 17 municipalities assisted by the project received 100%
of the ERP resources allocated to them, whereas the remaining 14 municipalities not assisted by

                                               45
  the project received on average only 72% of their allocation. The comparison between the
  approvals of ERP funds between the two groups of municipalities is shown in Table 7.

1.     Project Objectives, Design And Implementation

1.     The project development objective was to increase the economic benefits and
environmental services derived from forest ecosystems, generating revenue, actions and policies
to contribute to the reduction of poverty within the area of influence of the project (36
municipalities in the Department of Yoro, Francisco Morazan, Olancho, and EI Parafso, covering
approximately 3.2 million hectares), and to ensure sustainable management of natural resources
by reducing vulnerability to natural events.
1.1    Key Indicators

2.      The project's key indicators were: (i) at least 26 municipalities strengthened with
strategic municipal development plans under execution; (ii) 70% of local organizations
strengthened to carry out planning, administration and management of their own natural
resources management activities; (iii) 55% increase in per capita income of project beneficiaries;
(iv) 25,000 households benefited in community forestry, and jobs created from projects
investments; (v) 30% increase in direct participation of women; (vi) number of community
microenterprise increase by 10%; (vii) 20% of occupants in national lands regularized; (viii) 20
municipalities managed directly more than 30% of their own decentralized budget (ix) Protected
Areas Fund in execution by the second year; (x) 30% of protected areas self sustained; and xi)
100% of the municipalities with formalized land use plans. The PAD included other 27
intermediate indicators, plus six that were included after the project mid-term evaluation.

1.2    Components, Subcomponents and Strategic Themes

3.    To achieve the development objective, the project had four main components: (a) Local
Government and Disaster Preparedness; (b) Forest Management, Tenure and Conservation; (c)
Community Forestry; and (d) Project Coordination and Management.

       (a)    Local Government and Disaster Preparedness component had as main objective to
              strengthen the management capacity and administration of natural resources to
              reduce vulnerability to natural disasters. This component was subdivided into two
              subcomponents: (i) strengthening of local institutions, and (ii) disaster
              preparedness.

       (b)    Forest management, tenure and conservation component, which· aimed at
              benefiting local communities by expanding and improving the sustainable and
              productive management of natural resources. This component was subdivided into
              three subcomponents: (i) forest management, (ii) tenure; and (iii) protected areas.

       (c)    Community forestry component, designed to strengthen the process of adoption of
              agro-forestry technologies and production systems, and productivity growth,

                                               51
               contributing to reduce deforestation and improve of household welfare. This
               component was subdivided into three subcomponents: (i) forestry and agricultural
               extension, (ii) applied agricultural and forestry research, and (iii) training.

       (d)     The Project coordination and management component was designed to facilitate
               the implementation of technical components in collaboration with co-executing
               agencies (i.e. INA, AFE-COHDEFORJICF, SAG-DICTA, SGJ), participating
               institutions (i.g. SERNA, AMHON, COPECO, municipalities, communities and
               NGOs) and technical services providers. Additionally, the project designed its
               operational strategy with five transversal themes: indigenous people groups,
               microenterprises, rural youth, gender and environment.

1.3    Policies Supported by the Project

4.      The Project responds to critical areas of the rural development agenda of the Government
 of Honduras (GOH) , which are closely linked to the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and
specifically to agriculture, forestry, land use planning and vulnerability, governance,
decentralization, public sector modernization, and land tenure security. The most important
policy guidelines were: (i) to improve equity and security to land access for the benefit of small
independent and organized producers, as well as indigenous people; (ii) to promote sustainable
 development in high priority areas under mechanisms that ensure the participation of local
governments and communities; (iii) to improve rural competitiveness in order to increase
production and efficiency and competitiveness of small rural producers by facilitating access to
infrastructure and commercialization services, technical and financial assistance; and (iv) to
improve social conditions in rural areas, strengthening the social infrastructure and increasing
coverage of poverty reduction programs in rural areas with highest incidence of poverty.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

5.       The direct beneficiaries of the project were those families settled in the project's
influence area, as well as institutions that participated in the implementation of the project
activities. The local government and disaster preparedness component was addressed to all the
inhabitants of the project area, especially to marginalized groups that are typically most
vulnerable to the risks from natural disasters, municipalities, and indigenous people groups. In
the Forest management, tenure and conservation component, the direct beneficiaries were
families participating in the implementation of forest management and protected area plans, as
well as the beneficiaries in the regularization of rights in national forests. The community
forestry component benefited 18,798 families of small and medium producers, which were
incorporated into a system of training and technical assistance depending of the biophysical
potential of their communities and individual farms, and their technical assistance needs.

2.     Key Factors that Affected Project Implementation and Results

6.      In spite of the complexity and geographic dispersion of the project, the objectives were
clearly defined and harmonized with the components, sub-components and transversal themes.
The co-executing agencies and participating institutions were fully involved with sectoral issues


                                               52
and there was· a broad participation of local governments, communities, federations and
grassroots organizations that facilitated adjustments during implementation. Likewise,
safeguards related to indigenous peoples, involuntary resettlement, environment, use of
pesticides, protected areas, and impacts of forest exploitation were established and monitored.

7.      The main project risks identified by the technical team related to the complexity of the
project, the need for legal reforms in the forestry sector, and the institutional weaknesses, in
particular of AFE-COHDEFOR. To overcome these weaknesses, the Government's efforts were
focused in promoting a new forestry law that would allow the creation of a forestry sector with
policies and clear legal regulations.                                                            .

8.       External factor, as the disproportionate increase of international oil prices, affected the
project cost estimates for consultant services (formulation of land use plans, technical assistance
provider services), and project operating costs. The international economic slowdown at the end
of 2009 with decreases in demand of some exports and the reduction in family remittances has
little impact in implementation because the project was in its final phase of execution at that
time.

9.      One of the most important factors in the design and implementation of the project was to
develop a monitoring and evaluation system and an exit strategy, which was implemented by the
project coordinating unit with the assistance of the co-executing agencies and the project's
monitoring and certification unit (USC). Other mechanisms and instruments such as databases
and implementation methodologies and techniques for obtaining appropriate data were also
established.

3.     Results and Impact

3.1    Local Government and Disaster Preparedness

10.      The component was able to meet its overall objective by supporting the following
activities: (i) land use planning; (ii) development of strategic plan$ for municipal development;
(iii) promotion and creation of mechanisms for sustainable financing; and (iv) strengthening the
management and administration capacity of the territory, natural resources management and
reduction to vulnerability. The main results are presented in Table 1.

11.    Results in indicators 7 to 10 of the above table were not included in the PAD. However,
in view of its relevance, they were included in this report. It is also worth noting that an
agreement was reached with the Bank during the MTR mission to increase the allocation of
funds to this component to finance new priority demands generated by the methodological
processes promoted by the project.

Effects of the Results Obtained

       (a)    Rural communities and municipalities have improved their performance and
              administration capacity to manage their territory, with real participation and
              community cooperation and sustainability. These improvements have lead to the
              establishment of new policies and programs to promote rural development based
              on a territorial approach, which results from the demand of local actors and is
              oriented to reduce poverty.

       (b)    The component was able to consolidate and institutionalize the strategy of risk
              management to reduce environmental risks and vulnerability to natural disasters.
              The above is of vital importance, since the four departments in the area of

                                                54
                 influence of the project are located in watersheds of the Atlantic region that are of
                 greater environmental vulnerability.

Impact of Results Obtained

         (a)     Financial Sustainability of Municipalities. Municipality tax revenue has
                 increased on average by 133% and represents one of the major economic impacts
                 from the enhancement of local cadastres, key element of financial sustainability
                 for municipal governments.

         (b)     Environmental Sustainability. The decentralization of natural resources,
                 especially in those municipalities' and communities with important forest
                 resources and protected areas, has had a considerable environmental impact

3.2      Forest Management, Land Tenure and Conservation

12.      Major achievements include: (i) decentralized management and forest protection
activities by communities, municipalities and agroforestry organizations; (ii~ decentralization of
management activities of 11 protected areas to local governments and NGOs as co-managers;
(iii) technical and financial assistance for the preparation of management plans, protected areas
and micro watersheds plans; (iv) signing of co-management agreements in protected areas; and
(v) experience gained in land regularization of national forest lands. Table 2 shows the main
results of indicators .

Effects of the Results Obtained

       (a)    Increase in forest areas and forest under management. According to a study
              conducted by the National School of Forestry Sciences (ESNACIFOR), there was
              a gain in forest land from 2002 to 2009 year of approximately 122,000 ha. In
              addition, a scientific tool was developed for the monitoring of natural resources
              through the use of satellite images from a new NASA sensor called MODIS
              (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) and the use of National Land
              Cover Dataset (NLCD) algorithms of USGS and SEE 5.

       (b)    Reduction of forest fire incidence in national forest lands. Between 2005 and
              2009 the number of fires was reduced by 32% and the area affected by 92%,
              showing the effect of protection activities financed by the project and coordinated
              with AFE-COHDEFORlICF, municipal mayors, and rural communities.

       (c)    Establishment of a methodology and a systematic process for the regularization of
              land rights in national forest. The foundation for a process logically structured
              was established with the participation of each of the institutions directly linked to
              the topic. Moreover, tools and instruments required for the process were duly
              established and formalized.

Impact of the Results Obtained

       (a)    Institution~l.  Through decentralizing and de-concentrating the management and
              forest protection (fire and pests) and actions to improve management of protected
              areas, municipalities and co-management institutions acted as an important
              element of sustainability.

       (b)    Social. Grass root organizations and communities have a better capacity to
              sustainably manage their natural resources. A particular example is the Model
              Forest of Yoro (BMY) consisting of 65 organizations of five municipalities with
              medium and long term (20 years) planning instruments, and annual budgets.

3.3   Community Forestry
13.     The training, technical assistance and research generated and implemented by
beneficiaries, allowed increased productivity in production systems including community
forestry management and further consolidated the strategy of the Familias Enlaces
Colaboradoras (FAMEC) that provided technical assistance horizontally. The main results are
shown in Table 3.

Effects of Results Obtained

              (a)        Increased adoption of technologies by farmers, which. resulted in the improvement
                         of productivity levels in production systems, and incorporation of new crop
                         diversification including agro-forestry systems.

              (b)        Consolidation of horizontal extension strategy through the partner families
                         (Familia Enlace Colaboradora, FAMEC). This extension strategy has been very
                         successful in the project area in is being adopted in other region of the country. It
                         is important to point out the institutionalization of extension processes generated
                         by the project in the National System of Research and Agricultural Technology
                         Transfer (SNITTA).

 Impact of Results Obtained

              (a)        Increase in family income. Increases in agricultural productivity from production
                         systems of basic grains, coffee and diversified crops translated into a significant
                         increase of family income that reached as much as 62%26 in the project area.

                                                                       57
                   Communities who initiated community forestry projects linked to forest value
                   chains, were able to reach an initial revenue increase of as much as 304%.

          (b)      Employment generation. The final economic and financial evaluation of the
                   productive activities of community forestry subpr()jects showed that for each
                   subproject an average of 44.5 permanent jobs were created. This figure translates
                   into a total of approximately 2,715 permanent jobs associated to community
                   forestry activities supported by the project.

          (c)      Increase in food security. Although many productive units use a high proportion
                   of its production for their own consumption, the increase in productivity that
                   resulted from the technical assistance and productive diversification offered by
                   the project, has contributed significantly to generate higher production levels, as
                   well as a surplus for the local and national markets. This is reflected in increases
                   in productivity achieved in maize 26.9 qq/mz. (23% more than projected), in bean
                   14.9 qq/mz. (23% greater than without the project), and in coffee 11.5 qq/mz.
                   (similar to the projections) that has increased the flow of financial resources for
                   beneficiary families, estimated at L/. 337.7 million annually (L. 292.0 million
                   from coffee and basic grains,           and L. 45.7 million from productive
                   diversification) .

3.4        Transversal Themes

                                                           agricultural bachelors.

Indigenous People

15.    Under the IPDP the following activities were financed: legal advice, forest management
technical assistance, a population census, community forestry projects, scholarships to young
people; dissemination of the Tolupan indigenous language, training; and office equipment.
Under the Community forestry component two subprojects with the Pech and four with the
Tolupan in Yoro were financed, with 3,111 families, of which 2,172 (70%) were Tolupan in
Yoro, and 939 (30%) Pech in Olancho.

Gender

16.     The development of the gender theme had an impact on the quality, relevance and
efficiency in the orientation of the planning and implementation of social policies, financial
management with development programs and projects. Women are 55% in the governing bodies
of microenterprises, and 52% as participants of the co-investment funds. Municipalities, on the
other hand, have incorporated in their own budgets funds for operating costs of OMMs, and have
financed investments in support of microenterprises where women participation is a majority.

Microenterprises

17.     The main outcome in this theme was the production of goods and services in 88
beneficiary microenterprises, 46 microenterprises obtained its legal status, 11 obtained sanitary
registration, and 3 obtained brand registration, benefiting a total of 1,234 people.

Environmental Management

18.    The use of municipal environmental action plans (PAAM) is one of the most important
outcomes for overcoming the communities' environmental problems. Also, municipal
environmental units (UMAS) were certified and equipped, and consequently processes of
environmental licensing for small projects were decentralized.

Rural Youth

19.     The sustainability and adoption of technologies and new processes promoted by the
project focused on the participation of rural young people. In this process, a total of 10 young
people from the Tolupan tribe in San Francisco, Yoro, were trained, and 3,000 young people
from all regions received training on environment, forest management, agro-forestry production,
and agribusiness. In addition, 12 young people were awarded scholarships to continue with

4.     Lessons Learned

       (a)     Land use planning constituted the basis for land use management and creation of
               rural development strategies at the regional and municipal levels, ensuring
               sustainable long term economic growth (20 years) based on the economic,
               ecological and social potential of natural resources and with higher levels of
               participation and social equity. However, to make the process more effective and
               to achieve greater impact from an economic, social and environmental point of
               view, land use planning needs to be introduced at the COnlmunity level.

       (b)     Strategic municipal development planning (PEDM) involving community
               participatory mechanisms (public meetings, budget formulation, accountability
               and social auditing) guarantees an environment of good governance. This
               planning could be strengthened as long as the communities had an integrated
               community development plan.

       (c)     Investment in modernization of municipal cadastral systems and management of
               natural resources by municipalities, increase the financial capacity of municipal
               governments and generates more control and improved benefits for the
               popUlation. To achieve the sustainability of these investments, municipalities
               should make efforts to capitalize productive processes to better use the
               comparative advantages of their territory.

       (d)     Decentralization of natural resources management to local governments,
               grassroots organizations, co-management organizations (in protected areas),
               increases empowerment of stakeholders, local employment generation, reduction
               of transaction costs, and promotes accountability and social audits. This process
               was not effectively supported and monitored by the lead forestry institution (AFE-
               COHDEFOR/lCF); otherwise, there would have been greater coverage and
               efficiency in the transfer of responsibilities.

       (e)     Land tenure regularization in the national forest is a complex process that requires
               an appropriate strategy that takes into account such basic elements as: strong
               inter-agency coordination, clarity of the methodological and legal framework as
               well as experienced and committed staff. The creation of a National Council of
               Regularization of Rural Lands, that includes the State agencies involved in
               regularization (IP, ICF, INA, AMHON) is key for achieving regularization
               objectives.

       (f)    The concept of community forestry made possible the implementation of a
              multi sectoral technical assistance model that takes into account the community
              potential and needs from an environmental, economic and social point of view,
              within the framework of a short and medium term community development plan.

                                               60
      Consolidation of community enterprises and agro-forestry groups is a long-term
      commitment that requires continuity in strengthening social and human capital.

(g)   The technical assistance model using grassroots producer organizations as
      technical assistance service providers ensures the extent of the desired economic,
      social and environmental impacts, as well as the sustainability of actions.
      Grassroots producer organizations constitute a complementary effort of actions
      promoted by the public and private sector (integration of capacities).

(h)   Strategic indigenous peoples development plans designed in a differentiated way
      allow for the consideration of development of human resources in a cultural
      environment that takes into account the legal certainty of their territories and
      ancestral rights. Likewise, the consolidation of indigenous federations, .as the
      representative bodies of indigenous people's organizations, allows for the
      strengthening of governance, planning, management, and accountability aspects.
      It is important that institutions that support these efforts separate the defense of
      ancestral rights from the objectives of development of the indigenous
      communities, which must be complementary objectives.

(i)   The incorporation of an institutional exit strategy in the design of the rural
      development projects guarantees the technical and financial sustainability and
      institutionalization of its actions and interventions.

(j)   The project results and outcome indicators were very ambitious, and the project
      area was large compared to the limited budget. This caused dispersion of project
      actions, and difficulty in achieving some of the indicators. A better focus in
      project area and scope, and beneficiaries' targets, taking into account the potential
      of every region, would have assured greater efficiency in the implementation of
      the project.

(k)   Despite the seed money available from the State of Honduras and the project
      efforts, the establishment of a Honduran Fund for Protected Areas (FHAP) was
      not possible. The breach of inter-institutional agreements and the lack of political
      support were the main reasons. The allocation of project financial resources to
      activities that depend on external factors does not guarantee the implementation
      of such activities.

(1)   Inter-institutional coordination is essential for carrying out the objectives of the
      project, as well as a comprehensive social vision of rural development in forest
      areas.
