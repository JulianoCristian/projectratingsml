A. STRATEGICCONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country andsector issues

InHonduras poverty is highlycorrelatedwith living ina ruralarea. In1999,75% o frural
households were below the poverty line and 80% o f these were classified as living in extreme
poverty. On a countrywide basis, 59% o f poor households and 65% o f the extreme poor are rural.
For families livinginrural areas, issues relatedto accessto basic resources such as land and forests,
as well as to factors supporting production and marketing, are identifiedas being amongthe principal
determinants o f social inequalities and poverty. Poverty i s also linkedto other factors such as
demographic pressure and its effects on natural resources; the low level o f democratic participation
bythe poor; and the weakness o f local governments.

Poverty ReductionStratew.                The current GOHadministration entered office at the beginning o f
2002 having articulated its priorities and goals ina document entitled "My Commitment To You".
This document identifiedsix critical development areas where the new administration would focus its
attention. Soon thereafter, the new government affirmed its commitment and gave highpriority to
the recently completed Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). These two strategies, which are highly
compatible and complementary, are the basis for GOH's rural development policy.

The PRS stresses the needto accelerate equitable and sustainable economic growth and identifies
four sectors as having highproductive potential. The forest sector is one o f these. Concurrently, for
the reduction ofpoverty inrural areasthe PRS stresses the needto: i)improve equity and security in
access to land on behalfo f organized and independent small farmers and indigenous people, thus
allowing income improvement and food security for rural families; ii)promote sustainable
development inhigh-priority areas, under mechanismsthat guarantee participation o f local
governments and communities; iii)improve the competitiveness o f the rural economy, inorder to
increase production and improve the efficiency and competitiveness o f small rural producers,
facilitating access to infrastructure and to support services in markets, technology and financing; and
iv) improve social conditions inrural areas, strengthen social infrastructure and increase coverage o f
poverty-reduction programs inrural areas that are most depressed and have the greatest incidence o f
poverty. The strategy also recognizes the importance to long-term poverty reduction o f maintaining
environmental quality and mitigatingdisasters, as the poor are more vulnerable to their
consequences.

Sector Policies.        More than 80% o f Honduras' total land area i s legally classified as forest land2,
with the majority o fthis beingpublic land. About 42% ofthe country's forest lands have been
deforested and forest degradation processes affect a very significant percentage o f the remaining
forest areas. Forest resources are being lost at a rate estimated to be greater than 800 km2per year
(1.4% per annum). The bulk of the remaining forests are concentrated inHonduras' Central and
Eastern zones where 44,750 km2o f forest, representing about 80% o f the country's existing forest
resources are found. These two regions also contain 60% o f the country's deforested lands.


  The term "forest land" as usedinthis document refers to what in Hondurasis called "land of forestry vocation". This is
defined basedon criteria, which include: i)land with slopes greater than or equalto 30%; or ii)land below 30% slopewith
soils having a sandy-texture andlor a depth of less than 20 cm and/or more than 15% (by volume) stones with the presence
of rocky outcrops, andlor soils subject to inundation by tidal fluxes, andlor with restricting layers in the subsoil or with
impermeableparent material.




                                                               1

Percentage-wise, the western and southern regions o f the country are the most deforested. According
to the PRS, deforestation i s consideredto be the environmental problem to which the highest priority
attention should be given. Among the principal causes o f deforestation and forest degradationare:
conversion for agriculture and livestock; unmanagedexploitation for domestic uses such as
fuelwood; fire; and irrational logging. The problem i s magnified by the limited effectiveness o f the
State Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR). At the same time, highpriority i s given to
promotingthe rational and sustainable use o f forest resources as a means o f contributing ina positive
way to economic growth, employment generation and reduction o f poverty, especially inrural areas.
The country has a sustainable forest-production capacity much higher than current production.

Rivalingthe country's potential for sustainable forest-production are the real and potential
environmental and economic benefits generated by the country's National ProtectedAreas System
(SINAPH). The SINAPH, which comprises 2.7 million hectares (almost 25% o fthe national
territory), suffers from a weak commitment by Government to its protection and management
resulting in continued degradation o fprotectedareas (PAS), loss o f biodiversity, and loss o f future
economic benefits from ecotourism and other environmental services o f PAS. These areas provide
critical environmental services such as providing sources o f genetic material for agriculture, o f
potable water, o f food, inreducingvulnerability to natural disasters, and as habitat for country's
abundant plant and animal species. Also, as amply demonstrated by the Costa Rican example, the
potential economic benefits from ecotourism inand around well-managed and protected parks are
substantial. Tourism inHonduras i s now country's second most important foreign exchange earner.
Despite the impacts o f September 11,2001 on tourism, in 2002 tourism inHonduras grew by 7.5%
for a total o f 475,000 visitors that generated $260 million into the economy.

The populationinforest lands i s overwhelmingly poor. The National Program For Sustainable Rural
Development (2000) estimates that the poverty rate is 93% among this population. Between 250,000
and 350,000 households are estimatedto live in forest lands, representing from one-third to one-half
o f Honduras' rural population.

For the poor rural smallholders that constitute more than 70% o f all rural landholders, the GOH's
policy vision differentiates between households with relatively more and better land (lowlands,
valley soils) and households inmarginal areas (primarily forest lands). For the former, the focus i s
on development o f their productive capacity, improving market links and competitiveness. For the
latter, which constitute the majority o f the smallholders, the focus is on diversification o f the local
economy, household food security and community forestry, agroforestry and agricultural options.
Critical needs for achieving sustainable improvements insmallholder livelihoods include enhancing
tenure and resource access security; access to land, resources, and services; and gender equity.

Forestry inHonduras i s considered a subsector o f agriculture. Policy goals for the forest sector that
most directly support the PRS include: (i)     enhancing access to land and resources through the
regularization o f the traditional rights o f populations inand near public forest lands; (ii)increasing
employment and income o f rural poor through participation in public and private forestry activities;
(iii)strengtheningofcommunityparticipation,especiallyintheprocessofregularizationofrightsin
forest lands and through programs promoting and developing productive activities; (iv) sustainable
forest management, including a renewed focus on forest fire prevention and control, technical-
 assistance and credit programs for primary-forest activities and their linksto secondary-forest
 activities and development o f "green seals" for forest management; (v) development o f local capacity
 o f municipal governments and communities to manage and conserve forest resources; and (vi)

establishment o f a Protected Areas Fundto finance the adequate management and protection o f the
SINAPH.

Constraints.        To date, most GOHefforts at poverty reduction inforest lands have shown little
result. Among the principalreasons for this have been: (i)          the uncertain and conflictive nature o f land
tenure inpublic forest lands; (ii)low priority given to the systematic provision o f support for
production systems, such as infrastructure, technical assistance, irrigation, training and access to
markets, and credit; (iii)   an overly rigid, top-down command and control forest regulatory framework
that encourages illegal behavior; (iv) undue discretionality and lack o f transparency inthe
management o f public forest lands; (v) a diffuse and confusing legal framework antithetical to
encouraging private investment; and (vi) public policies which have implicitly directed institutional
attention toward generating income from timber extraction rather than toward forest and
environmental management and forest-based poverty alleviation programs.

Government's Response.             Major legislative reforms are being sought on territorial planning
(approved by Congress in October 2003)' property rights (beingdebated in Congress), and forestry
(submitted to C~ngress)~.Institutional reforms o fthe State Forest Agency (AFE-COHDEFOR) are
being implemented and the Ministry o f Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) i s finalizing its
restructuring proposal to support national programs for agriculture, forestry and rural development.
Among the programs are included those for the development o f agriculture, forestry and gender
equity among poor smallholders (campesinos); these include the National Agriculture and Food
Program (PRONAGRO), the Community Forestry Program (a component o f PRONAFOR), and the
MinistryofAgriculture's National Sustainable RuralDevelopment Program (PRONADERS).

Good progress has been achieved in reforming AFE-COHDEFOR. To date AFE-COHDEFOR' s
Board has approved a new organizational structure and the implementation o f the new structure i s
underway. The reform i s refocusingthe agency on the technical aspects o f its normative and
regulatory role. To deal with corruption and illegal logging, a high level Commissionto audit the
application o f forest managementplans has been formed inthe Department of Olancho (a center o f
illegal logging). The Commission is headed by the Minister o f SAG and includes representatives o f
the Attorney General's environmental enforcement unit, the Catholic Church, the police and local
environmental organizations. Next generation reforms are under development, pendingthe ongoing
reassessment o f the state's role inadministering and managingpublic forest lands. IDA through the
Rural LandManagement Project (Credit 2940-HO) has been supporting the legal and institutional
reforms processes for the last several years. More recently, IDA and the Inter-American
Development Bank have been working together with GOH on the reforms.

To attendto the fundamental problems stemming from tenure conflicts inpublic forest lands, GOH
has put a highpriority on scaling up its pilot activities to provide the rural landless poor with access
to productive lands and to formalize the traditional rights and usufruct o f populations inpublic forest
lands. Duringthe last year substantial expansion was also achieved inproviding assistance and
services to the rural poor. For example, PRONADERS reached 95,000 subsistence-level rural
households (close to 600,000 people).


   While reform o f the current forestry legal framework offers clear advantages-particularly removing overlapping
and outdated elements inthe current framework     -most o f the major reforms needed to resolve structural constraints
(see "Constraints") inthe subsector can be achieved under the current legal framework.

2. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

IDA is uniquelypositionedto bothsupport the forestry sector reformprocess and to strengthenthe
country's poverty reduction efforts inforest lands. Through the Rural Areas Administration Project
(Credit 2940-H0), known inHonduras as "PAAR', IDA assisted GOHto successfully introduce and
pilot new and more efficient administrative, technical, environmental and social models for the
management and conservation o f national forest lands and protected areas, for provision o f privatized
extension and training to ruralpoor, and for the regularization o f the traditional rightso f both
indigenous and non-indigenous populations inpublic forest lands. GOH wishes IDA'Sassistance to
capitalize on these successful experiences and replicate them within its national programs. They will
extend and deepen the pilots in order to apply them: (i)outside o f public forest lands inmunicipal,
communal and private forests; (ii)as a basis for forest sector institutional and policy reforms, and
(iii)tosupportthedecentralizedmanagementofnaturalresources. Theprojectisanintegralpartof
the SAG's national programs. It i s fully consistent with the PRS and the CAS (25873-HO o f May
29,2003), and complements existing and planned assistance from other development agencies for
strengthening SAG's rural development, natural resources, forestry, and protected areas programs.
The project also serves GOHto scale up the work initiated under other IDA-financed projects such as
the: (i)Natural Disaster Mitigation Project (Credit 3361-HO) by providing assistance to municipal
governments for disaster risk and vulnerability reduction; and (ii)    Access to Land Pilot (Credit 3435-
HO) by assistingto bringforest lands into the program and the ruralpoor to develop small forest
enterprises through accessing commercial credit. The rural The Government explicitly requested
IDAto include the project inthe Country Assistance Strategy as a highpriority (Le., as part ofthe
base case).

As part of SAG'Snational program, the project provides geographic coverage to priority poverty
areas inpublic forests with higheconomic potential. Thematically it strengthens GOH's National
Forestry Program (PRONAFOR) and National Agricultural Food Program (PRONAGRO) as well as
contributing to overall rural development. GOH has also requestedIDA to be the lead donor on
issues of forest land tenure and protected areas inthese programs. Also at GOH's request, IDA and
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) will work inclose coordination on forestry sector
technical, institutional, and policy issues with the IDB gradually taking the lead on these inthe forest
sub-sector and IDA continuing to lead in land administration and protected areas. Other principal
donors supporting forestry and protected areas include GTZ, CIDA, and USAID.

Finally, the PAAR's Project's Coordination Unit has served GOHwell in achieving donor
coordination on forestry issues such as legal reform, forest land tenure regularization, reform o f
AFE-COHDEFOR's technical and administrative practices, incorporation o f local stakeholders into
public forest management processes, and policy dialogue on protected areas reform. GOHplans to
capitalize on this capacity by utilizingthe already establishedProject Coordination Unitto both
coordinate implementation o f this and other IDA-financedprojects4and to take a lead role in
systematizing and replicating the successful pilot experiences within the national programs and
through other GOHprojects, such as the IDB-financedNatural-Resources Management in
Watersheds Project (1077/SF-HO) and the Sustainable Forest Development Program (1506EF-HO).




 Includingthe ongoing Natural DisasterMitigation Project (Cr.336l-HO), Access to Land Pilot (Cr. 3435-HO) and
the upcoming Land Administration Program (Cr. 27604-HO).

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

The Project directly contributes to three o fthe four pillars outlined inthe PRSP and the CAS:

(i)  Accelerating economic growth and increasing competitiveness by increasing the production,
     marketing and value-added o f agricultural and forest products and, together with the
     complementary Land Administration Project (P055991), enhancing landtenure and resource
     access security, increasing land values and productivity.
(ii)Promotingsustainabilitvbyimprovingcommunitymanagementofnaturalresources. Itdoesso
     through strengthening co-management o f protected areas; providing incentives for
     municipalities and residents to take greater responsibility inthe management and conservation
     of forests and protectedareas; promotingnatural resource management-based rural enterprises
     and generating employment among the rural poor inand around forest areas; institutionalizing
     improved management, production systems and funding mechanisms as well as strengthening
     appropriate institutions in support o f local stakeholder participation inthe use and conservation
     o f natural resources.
(iii)ImprovinggovernancebysupportingGOH'snaturalresourcemanagementdecentralization
                  -
     strategies, institutional reforms and improved local implementation mechanisms. Increasing
     transparency and accountability inthe management o f natural resources are central precepts o f
     the project.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The Government o f Honduras has requested IDA'Ssupport for this project be channeled through a
Specific Investment Loan (SIL). GOH i s inthe process o f reformingthe forestry sector, including
embarking on a long-term process o f reform o f tenure inpublic lands. IDA will provide long-term
support to the latter through an APL (Land Administration Program, recently negotiated) and the
PRSC (P074758, under preparation) which i s a vehicle that supports GOH inthe forestry, protected
areas and land access policy and legal reforms being sought and medium-termsupport to the former
through the proposedproject. As part o f the reform process, GOH i s seeking to consolidate the
project-level experiences o f the PAAR and other projects to create an institutionally sustainable
framework, capable o f supporting the implementation o f a long-term program. For the time being,
the improved coordination and institutional arrangements that the Project will provide through the
PCU give GOH the basis for the future program and scaling up. A S I L i s the appropriate instrument
for IDA to support this kindo f reform and investment program. See also Section 5. "Alternatives
considered and reasons for rejection" for a further discussion o f a SIL versus APL.

2. Project development objective and key indicators

The objective o f the project i s to increase the economic benefits and environmental services derived
from forest ecosystems in selected low income municipalities with highagro-forestry potential
within the project area (see Annex 4, Table 4). Indoing so, the project outcomes include the
generation o f income, policies and actions that will contribute to the reduction o f poverty and the
sustainable management o f natural resources and reduction o f vulnerability in some 3,200 km2o f
land.

under participatory management schemes with minimumfinancing ensured for recurrent protection
and management costs; and (xii) 70% reduction indeforestation rates inpriority protected areas.

3. Project components
The project's area o f influence consists o f thirty-six municipalities that contain eleven protected areas
and thirteen public Forest Management Units (FMUs). The total area and populationo f the thirty-six
municipalities is 3,261 km2and 630,325 inhabitants (2001 Census).

The project has four components: (i)Community Forestry; (ii)Forest Management, Tenure and
Conservation; (iii)Local Government & Disaster Preparedness; and (iv) Project Coordination and
Management. It i s integrally linked to a proposed GEF project, the Forests and Rural Productivity.
This will be a bi-national GEF project for Honduras andNicaragua, the global objective o f which is
to consolidate the management and protection o fNicaragua and Honduras' proposed Transfrontier
Biosphere Reserve, the "Corazttn de Corredor Biolttgico Mesoamericano". Honduras and Nicaragua
havejointly submitted a proposal to UNESCO to form the Corazttn Transfrontier Biosphere Reserve
as an overarching strategic instrument to manage the area extending in Honduras from the Plhtano
Biosphere Reserve through the Tawakha Indigenous Reserve and Patuca National Park to the
Bosawas Reserve inNicaragua and includes adjacent areas o f natural habitat inthe Mosquitia. In
Honduras, the two projects will functionjointly in community-level management o f natural
resources, particularly forestry resources and in strengthening o f the SINAPH. The GEF proposal i s
slated for approval in second quarter FY05. Project costs are summarized in Table 1.

CommunityForestry costs US$8.6 million. Itbuildsuponthe pilot "Fund for Hillside Producers"
establishedthrough the PAARto provide privatizedextension services, training and funding for
applied research for rural poor living inmarginal areas. Through the PAAR the administrative
framework and methodological approaches to be applied by this project were successfully
established. Next generation refinements to the model are to be introduced and tested, including
shifting service provision from groups to communities and strengthening the organization and role of
local farmers and women's groups to ensure service provision i s community demand driven (CDD).
Activities will include: (i)subprojects comprising extension, technical assistance, training, and
investment to improve the standard o f livingo f the rural poor occupying forest lands; (ii)applied
research subprojects to demonstrate the benefits o f improvedtechnologies and strengthen the
National System for Researchand Technology Transfer (SNITTA); and (iii)            a training programto

municipalities, Technical Service Providers (PSTs), and farmer leaders (men and women). The
component will finance community demand-driven subprojects (including seed capital for productive
investmenthevolving funds), applied research, consultant services, training and operational expenses.
An estimated 25,800 families, about 35% o fthe potential beneficiaries inthe project area, will be
directly benefited.

ForestManagement,Tenure and Conservationcosts US$ 17.2 million and will support GOH's
national program for sustainable management o f national, municipal, communal/private forests and
protected areas. The component will assist to develop the economic potential and maintainthe
environmental services providedby forest ecosystems inabout 1.4 million hectares o f forest and to
institutionalize the new models o f public forest management developed under the PAAR. Support
will be providedto: (i)forest managementplanningand forest protection innational, municipal,
communal, and private lands and forest management innational lands; (ii)strengthen and expand the
process o f regularization o f rights o f populations living innational lands; (iii)strengthenthe
management o f priority protected areas and of the Honduras National Protected Areas System
(SINAPH), including assistance to establish and implement a ProtectedAreas Fundto finance
protection and management expenditures inpriority SINAPHProtected Areas; and (iv) develop and
implement the policy and institutional reforms required to sustain these interventions. As a result,
among others, pilot experiences initiated under the PAAR in local provision and marketingo f
environmental services and inthe sustainable use and conservation o f biodiversitywill be replicated
and expanded upon. There are three subcomponents: Forest Management, Regularization o f Forest
Land Tenure, and ProtectedAreas Management. The component will finance goods, works,
technical assistance, studies, training, workshops, community consultations, vehicles, and operational
expenses.
LocalGovernmentand DisasterPreparedness is a US$1.8 millioncomponent that supports all
thirty-sixproject municipalities andthe five municipal associations (mancomunidades)to which they
belong. This component provides the strategic links between all o f the projects components,
providingthe assistance required in order for local priorities to be integrated into the Forest
Management, Tenure and Conservation and the Community Forestry components. Outcomes from
the this component will include: (i)local guidance to the Community Forestry activities regarding
 geographic and thematic priorities; and (ii)         strengthening o f local participation inestablishing

priorities and o f linkages between the local development agenda and the public forest and protected
areas' management activities. The component provides assistance to strengthen local organization
and capacity to carry out participatory strategic planningat the municipal and regional (mancomunaZ)
levels to generate and apply informationfor land use, zoning and vulnerability planning, to integrate
outputs into the local development agenda, andto develop and channel proposals to implement
priority actions to the relevant fundingsource or program. Vulnerability planningwill focus on
reducing environmental risks and vulnerability to natural phenomena (hurricanes, flooding,
landslides, etc.). There are two subcomponents: (i)Strengthening o f Local Institutions, providing
capacity buildingassistance and (ii)    Disaster Preparedness, supporting the development and
application o f land use, zoning and vulnerability plans. The component will finance consultant
services, goods, training and workshops, works, and operating costs.

Project Coordination and Management costs US$5.2 millionand covers the administration costs
o f the Project Coordination Unit and activities relatedto monitoring and evaluation, technical studies
and training as required for project implementation, includingpreparation o f new investment
proposals. The PCUwill be a critical instrument to ensure efficient administration o f the project and
effective coordination and cooperation with other forestry, protected areas, and land-related projects
inthe country. The component will finance consultant services, goods, vehicles, training and
workshops, studies and operating costs.

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

The proposed project assists GOHto replicate and builduponthe successful experiences o f the Rural
Land Management Project (PAAR). Inparticular, the PAAR was instrumental indeveloping and
piloting approaches for: (i)  institutional strengthening and reform inthe administration o f public forest
lands by the State; (ii)forest management which incorporates the rights and usufruct o f forest
dwellers and communities, environmental impact assessment, development and validation o f criteria
and indicators for sustainable management o f pine production forests, and implementation o f forest
management plans through community participation and outsourcing o f technical and operational
activities to community groups and the private sector; (iii)improvingbiodiversity conservation efforts,
evaluatingandprioritizingthe Honduras National Protected Areas System (SINAPH) and developing a
financing mechanism (National Parks Fund) to capture and channel resources from GOHand external
sources for the management andprotection o fpriority protectedareas; (iv) privatizationo f extension
services to the rural pool.; and (v) resolving forest landtenure conflicts through delimitation and
demarcationo f forest lands, developmento f methodologies for recognition and regularization o f
ancestral and traditional rights o f forest dwelling communities, and communal titling o f indigenous
lands (Tolupanes). This latter experience was judged a best-case example inparticipatory
demarcation in a recent Bank review, "LCSES Q A T Thematic Review, OD 4.20 inCentral American
Land and Biodiversity Conservation Projects." A comprehensive (draft) Borrower ICR, detailingthe
lessons learned under the PAAR, i s available inthe project files.

The project also buildsonthe preliminary lessons learned from the "Drivers o f Growth Study" which
point out that, to achieve poverty reduction, the rural poor must be providedwith multiple assets, in
appropriate sequencing. It does so by strengthening local participatory planningprocesses inorder to
develop consensus around needs and priorities, by enhancing access and access security to valuable
natural resources, by provision o f training and services to value and generate income from those
natural resources, and by facilitating access to other GOH programs (e.g., for rural infrastructure,
rural development financing, etc.) inorder to provide access to critical assets which the project itself
does not finance.

5. Alternativesconsideredand reasonsfor rejection

There were two project design options considered duringthe preparation phase:

(i)PAARPhase2,toincludebothapoverty-focusedprogramforareasofhighvalueproductive
   pine forests and a land administration program. This option was rejected for several reasons;
   chief among them was the difficulty o f efficiently institutionalizing and sustainingthe type o f
   complex, multi-sectoral and multi-institutional project that would have resulted. The decision
   was made to split out o f the Land Administration Component o f the PAAR as a separate but
   parallel and supportive project. This project, also prioritized inthe recent CAS, has recently
   completed negotiations.
(ii)Therewasconsiderationofaphasedlong-termforestryprogram,tobesupportedbyan
   Adaptable Program Loan. Indiscussions with GOH, it was decided that the magnitude o f
   external financingrequired for the forest sector was beyond what IDA could provide from IDA
   resources. GOHrequested that over the short to medium-term that IDA and IDBtake
   complementing roles in support o f forest sector reform and over the longer-term that each
    institution then focus on separatepriority aspects. Under this agreement, IDA will assist GOHto
   capitalize on the IDA'Sexpertise inthe sector. Inthe short to medium-termthis translates to
   assistance in consolidating and mainstreaming the forestry sector lessons and experiences
   developed under the PAAR. Inthe longer term this focuses the IDA support on two critical areas
   for the Honduranforest sector and the environment: forest landtenure within the broader land
    administration context and protected areas management and conservation. IDA also has
   recognized expertise and comparative advantages inthese latter. The IDB,through the recently
    approved PROBOSQUE, will initiate assistance to the forest sector inthe areas o f improvements
   to the regulatory and institutional framework and forest sector competitiveness, management and
    monitoring o f forest lands (national, municipal and private), financing o f forest land
    regularization, and developing competitive mechanisms for commercial investment and to
    strengthen the forest-industry-market value chain. Over the coming years the IDBwill transition
    into a role o f principal financier for public sector forestry, duringwhich period there will be close
    collaboration and constructive engagement with IDA inthe sector, among others, through the
    proposedproject, the PRSC, and the PATH (for land administration and land tenure).
    Subsequent to these discussions with GOH, as a key sector, forestry was selected by government
    for the development and implementation o f a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) inwhich the
    project functions to initiate activities with the context o f the SWAP and as a vehicle for dialogue
    between the Association and GOH as the SWAP develops.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements(ifapplicable)

The project i s integrally linked to a proposed, bi-national Honduras and Nicaragua GEF project
("Forests and Rural Productivity", P085488) to consolidate the management and protectiono f
Nicaragua and Honduras' transfrontier Biosphere Reserve, the "Corazbn de Corredor Biolbgico
Mesoamericano". Inthe Honduras, the GEF and the IDA-funded projects will be linkedoperations,
however the proposed GEF project is still under preparation and i s slated for approval in second
quarter FY05. While the two projects will functionjointly, the GEF funds are not co-financing for
this project nor would the IDA investment's objectives or results be compromised should the GEF
proposal not be approved.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

Institutionaland implementation arrangements are similar to those successfully utilizedby the
ongoing PAARproject. The overall implementing agency for this project i s the Ministryo f
Agriculture and Livestock (SAG). The existingProject Coordination Unit (PCU)' will continue and,
inaddition, will implement other IDA-financedprojects, includingthe ongoingNatural Disasters
Mitigation Project (Cr. 3361-H0), Access to Land Pilot (Cr. 3435-HO), and the upcoming Land
Administration Program (P055991). The PCU will coordinate the activities of several executing
entities and be responsible for financial management. UNDP i s to be retained as a procurement
agent, for which negotiations between GOHand UNDP are ongoing with a signing o f a Procurement
Agreement, satisfactory to IDA, a conditiono f Credit effectiveness. Private firms will be
subcontracted to evaluate, supervise and certify results o f the subprojects financed under the
Community Forestry component (Private Certification Unit).

The executing entities are: the State Forestry Agency (AFE-COHDEFOR), SAG'SDirectorate for
Agricultural Science and Technology (DICTA), the Ministry o f Governance and Justice (SGJ) and
the National Agrarian Institute (INA). The National Directorate for Sustainable Rural Development
(DINADERS), the Ministry o fNational Resources and Environment (SERNA), and the Association
of Municipalities (AMHON) are collaborating entities inthe implementation. Participation
Agreements will be signed between SAG and the executing agencies to formalize the roles o f each.
Similarly SAG will enter into "Municipality Agreements" with the respective municipalities where
project activities will take place (see Annex 6). Memorandum o f Understanding will be signed
duringimplementation with the collaborating agencies inorder to detail the areas of cooperation and
to facilitate planning. For the Community Forestry subprojects, tripartite "subproject agreements"
will be signed with the eligible beneficiaries and the Private Service Providers.

The project will have a high-level Council o f Governors, chaired by the SAG, with representatives
from the executing agencies and civil society. It will meet periodically and be responsible for
providingpolicy direction; identifying legal, institutional, and regulatory reforms; and supervising
compliance o f the project's key agreements such as Participation and Municipality Agreements. At
the local level, the projectwill work through and with existing community (Patronatos) and
Municipal-level organizations and Municipal authorities. Inthe case o f indigenous groups the
project will work directly with traditional authorities at the community-level, incoordination with the
indigenous Federations (FETRIXY and FETRIPH) on which the communities rely for assistance ina
number of areas (e.g., land issues, legal rights, political representation, etc.).

Credit funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for IDA funds). The
Special Account will be opened by the Ministry o f Finance (SEFIN) and maintained inthe Central
Bank o f Honduras. GOHwill allocate its counterpart funding into an operational project account,
also at the Central Bank. Procedures for flow o f funds from the credit and the required counterpart
contribution will be implemented with due regardto safeguarding project's resources and ensuring
timely execution o f payments. Annual project financial statements will be audited inaccordance



  An agroforestry Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP) is currently being developed by the Borrower. As a result, the
institutionalcontextand structure within which the PCU functions may change inthe nexttwo years requiring adjustments
to the current PCU. Any such changes will be discussedand agreed with IDA.

with International Auditing Standards by an independentfirm and inaccordance withterms of
reference, both acceptable to IDA (see Annex 7).

Procurement will be carried out in accordance with IDA guidelinesand the provisions stipulated in
the Development Credit Agreement. The proposedthresholds for prior review are based on the
procurement capacity assessment of the PCU and summarized in Table B, Annex 8. UNDP will be
contracted as a procurement agent to handle all procurement above the prior review threshold. The
PCU will carry out all shopping procedures, all NCB, and all selection o f individual consultants
under the thresholds.

The Operational Manual for the project will specify the duties and responsibilities o f all the
institutions involved inthe implementation o f the project. It will also include the procurement
procedures, the Standard BiddingDocuments to be used for each procurement method, and model
contracts for goods and works procured on the basis o f three quotations or shopping, respectively.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomesfresults

Buildingon the existing financial management andproject monitoringand evaluation systems put in
place under the PAAR project, the PCU will have a monitoring and evaluation unit to collect (largely
through subcontracting), consolidate and report on day-to-day project performance data as well as
periodic information on intermediate project results and higher level outcomes or impacts. The
primary sources o f data include: (i)field reports from the PCU's technical team, the Private
CertificationUnit, AFE-COHEDFOR and DICTA field staff reports, evaluation reports from
communities participating insubprojects, contractors, etc.; (ii)field reports and quarterly / annual
financial statements and performance reports o f executing entities; and (iii) specially commissioned
assessments, surveys, case studies, and participatory evaluations to be carried out annually and prior
to elaboration o f the project ICR. These will include client satisfaction surveys; technical and
environmental audits; and financial and economic analyses. All project-related informationwill be
maintained inthe PCU's Management Information System and in other relevant databases in sectoral
agencies (e.g., Forest Information and Statistics Center, National Property Administration System,
Registry o f National Forest Lands). Combinedwith other non-project data such as municipal
investments and poverty indicators, these will allow accurate geo-referenced data and reports on a
broad range o f implementation and impact issues.

4. Sustainability

The Government o f Honduras is fully committedto the project as demonstratedby its inclusion as a
highpriority inthe Country Assistance Strategy (Le., base case). Other indicators o f GOH
commitment to the proposed project are: (i)the strong commitment shown to the effective
implementation o f PAAR, as reflected in solid and recognized achievements involving substantive
strategic actions, especially to improve land security, expanded forest co-management and usufruct
mechanisms, and delivery o f improvedagro-forestry technologies; (ii)     active participation and
leadership o f senior-level GOH officials and local communities inthe project's preparation and
consultation process; and (iii)  concrete steps taken to date by GOH for forestry sector reform,
including utilizing the PRSC (P074758, under preparation) as a vehicle for the reforms sought, the
recent submission o f the new Forestry Law to the Congress, and the substantive first phase
institutional restructuring o f AFE-COHDEFORcompleted in 2003.




                                                     11

On the operational-level, the most important elements for sustainability o f project inputsand
outcomes include GOH's and SAG'Scommitment to: (i)institutionalize, replicate and scale-up the
project's activities; (ii)the resolution o f forest tenure conflicts through the regularization o f the
traditional rights o f forest populations; (iii)     the decentralization o f decision making to the municipal
and community-levels and provision o f support to assume these responsibilities; (iv) the development
o f environmental services payments and the ProtectedAreas Fundto finance basic operational costs
for the protection andmanagement o f priority ProtectedAreas. Finally, compatible with SAG'S
strategy for its national programs, the project designincludes an explicit exit strategy to ensure the
transfer o f capacity, roles and responsibilitiesto the relevant institutional actors over the life of the
project.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

The project i s expected to generate a variety o f benefits, including building or strengthening social
capital, increasingproductivity innatural resource use ina sustainable manner, promoting
biodiversity conservation, strengthening institutions at the central and local level inthe agriculture
and natural resource sectors, and contributing to the implementation o f the Poverty Reduction
Strategy. Economic and financial analyses focused on the productive and natural resource
management activities, which amount to 70% o f total project costs and 65% o f the IDA financing.
The other components and activities (regularization o f forest land tenure, protected areas
management, capacity building, local government and disaster preparedness) are regarded as
necessary pre-conditions for avoiding undesirable social, economic and environmental costs, creating
conditions for investment and sustaining outcomes. A substantial number o f positive environmental,
largely nonmarketable, benefits will also be generated.
As required under GEF financing guidelines, an Incremental Costs Analysis will be completed under
the further preparation o f the associated GEF financing ("Corazon Transfrontier Reserve" project,
P085488).
The economic and financial benefits indicate that the project is a good investment for Honduras,
Benefit cost analysis o f the PAAR project, upon which the productive and natural resource
management activities o f this project are based, was estimated by the Borrower to be 1.7 when all
project costs were charged against the productive and natural resource management activities. This



                                                          13

figure was calculated based on the actual project costs and the estimated project impacts on forest
and agricultural production. Other analyses of the economic soundness o f the project demonstrate
substantial benefits when compared to without project scenarios (see Annex 9).

A detailed analysis o f forest managementsuggested strongly that the model o f institutional support
and development proposed i s financially viable. Undervery conservative assumptions the benefit-
cost ratio was estimated at 11.9 with potential changes due to project investment leading to a
doubling o f the value o f national land and timber. Upto 18,000 full time jobs are expected to be
created through implementing forest management plans in 600,000 ha of pine forests.

The Community Forestry component is an extension ofthe FundFor Hillside Producers (FPL)
established under the PAARproject to fund agriculture, forestry and livestock subprojects for
households o f rural poor on marginal lands. Overall, the FPL had a positive internal rate o f return
(IRR). At the household-level, significant improvementsto family income were achievedthrough
introducingimprovedpractices to traditional production systems. A previous analysis o fthe FPL,
reported inthe Borrower's draft Implementation Completion Report, estimated that on average
households participating inthe FPL increasedtheir incomes by 57%, from $670 per year to $1,050
per year. Analysis carried out duringproject preparationfound that with reasonable expectations
related to market price and rates o f adoption that benefitlcost ratios between 1.3 and 1.4 could be
expected for households engaging in improved basic grain production with returnsto labor almost
tripling (from L35 per day to L99 per day).

As a pilotthe FPL providedimportant lessons as to what ,typeso f interventions resulted inpoverty
alleviation impacts, improvednatural resources management and acceptable rates o f return. It also
gave valuable informationon the types o f improvements required under the new project inorder to
enhance impacts and increase overall rates o f return. Applyingthese lessons, the improvements
being introduced under the new project include greater focus on micro-irrigation, agroforestry
(forestry combined with crop production through inter-planting and other technologies), natural
forest management for (pine) timber and non-timber products, marketingand commercialization
linkages, and, where possible, value-added production. Special emphasis is placed on marketing,
especially o f forest products where market linkages for communities are currently weak. Inaddition,
activities such as tree planting, soil conservation and livestock will no longer be promoted separate
from promotion o f improvements o f the overall farminglagroforestry systems. These activities, in
isolation, make little economic sense; Le., improved conservation practices and livestock will be
integrated into a more holistic household farmingllivelihood system approach. Giventhese changes
(and based on assumptions o f differing mixes of activities) the IRRfor the component i s expected to
be inthe range o f 20% to 25%.

2. Technical

The proposed operation i s technically sound, buildingas it does on successful experiences o f the
Rural Land Management Project (PAAR), as well as other relevant Honduras natural resource
management (NRM) projects. Given the opportunity and access to reliable technical support, the
rural poor have the capacity to identify their most pressing needs and develop innovative responses.
Project preparation studies have confirmed the availability o f local resource management innovations
that are financially viable and technically feasible (see Annex 9). A substantial number o f valuable
lessons were learned under the previous project and incorporated inproject design. As the project
assigns a significant implementation role to municipal governments, most o f which are not
adequately preparedand equipped to promote and facilitate local development, substantial capacity-


                                                    14

buildingsupport to the municipalities is anticipated inplanning, project preparation, implementation
and supervision. Technical support will be drawn from private sector service providers.

3. Fiduciary

The PCU has appointed a qualified accountant and budget officer to oversee all aspects o f financial
management for the project. The PCU maintains and manages an integratedmanagement
information system that was developed under the PAAR project and has an adequate financial
management system. The Management Information System (MIS), combining the financial inputs,
physical outputs, and results indicators, will be fully operational by Credit effectiveness. The project
accounting system meets IDA'Sfiduciary requirements and produces the financial statements
required for achieving satisfactory project management. GOH has agreed to appoint auditors for
both the annual and special audits under a multi-year contract. The overall projectrisk for financial
management and disbursements i s considered low.

An assessment o fthe capacity of PCUto implement the procurement actions under the post review
threshold for the project has been carried out and was approved by the Regional Procurement
Advisor on December 8,2003. The existing structure, considering the additional procurement officer
to be hired for the project, i s considered satisfactory. The Procurement Agreement will include a
mechanism to assure quality control o f all procurement activities carried out by UNDP. IDA will
reevaluate UNDP's performance after the first six months o f project implementation and if it i s found
not satisfactory new arrangements for procurement administration would be sought. This
understanding will be reflected inthe Procurement Agreement. GOHhas developed a procurement
plan for project implementation. The overall project risk for procurement i s considered average.

4. Social

As part o fthe preparation of the project a detailed social evaluation inthe area o f proposed influence
of the project was carried out. The evaluation: (i)identified and characterized potential project
beneficiaries; (ii)identifiedgeneral needs for self-management o f natural resources; (iii)  evaluated
local use and management o f forest resources; (iv) evaluated the legal status o f the common types o f
local organizations; (v) identifiedthe potential for negative impacts that mightresult from the
proposed activities, including for any possibility o ftriggering OP4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement;
(vi) identifiedopportunities and obstacles to implement project activities; (vii) developed the
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP); and (viii) developed a participation plan for
beneficiary involvement in design, execution and evaluation, with special emphasis on marginalized
groups.

The main conclusions and project design considerations generated by the social evaluation are:
0   Priority project beneficiaries constitute the landless rural poor who sell their labor to subsist,
    households with very small land holdings that rely greatly on selling their labor to subsist,
    households with small land holdings that seasonally sell their labor as a compliment to their
    subsistence, and the Tolupan and Pech indigenous communities.
0   Organizational structures at the community-level that will be supported are those that represent
    broadly felt needs, e.g., informal savings and credit groups, product marketing groups, supply o f
    materials and inputs; development o f agriculture/forestry micro-businesses, etc.
0   Governance mechanisms at the community-level that will be strengthened and supported are the
    patronatos and municipal corporations.



                                                      15

e   Support should be provided to register forest exploitation activities, inventories o f lands and
    forests, and inventories o f priority microwatershed includingtheir respective boundaries, zones
    and register o f occupants and their land uses.
0   Delegating responsibility for management o f small amounts o f financial resources should be
    attempted wherever conditions allow in order to buildcapacity.
e   Promotion, dissemination and communication are indispensable inorder to make potential
    beneficiaries and their communities aware o f the project and the legal framework regulating the
    management, use and protection o f natural resources.
e   The best practice approaches developed under the PAAR for incorporation o f gender will
    continue to be implemented boththrough training and monitoring o f the private technical service
    providers and o f the processes and outcomes at the community-level.

5. Environment

The EA concluded that the environmental impacts o f the proposedproject should be highlypositive.
The project promotes the conservationo f forests and naturalhabitats through strengtheningo f
management and conservation o f protectedareas and national forests, of improving communities'
management o ftheir natural resources, and strengthening local processesfor the reduction o f risk and
vulnerability to natural phenomena. Indirectly, through demarcation and regularization o ftenure in
productive andprotection areas, some positive changes are also expected inlanduse practices by forest
occupants. Potentially negative impacts to the environment were identified as: (i)   possibly greater
migration pressures on the national forests resulting from the process o f regularization o f the
occupancy o f forest lands; (ii)   timber harvesting operations inpine forests; and (iii)
                                                                                        introduction o f
certain technologies under the Community Forestry subprojects. The project's environmental
management plan defines mitigating measures with budget and institutional responsibilities for
implementation and monitoring o f the plan.

The safeguard screening category o f the project is S2. The project i s classified as Category B,
requiring some type o f Environmental Analysis but not a full-scale Environmental Assessment study.
Inaccordance with OP 4.01, an Environmental Analysis (EA) was conductedby a Honduran
consultant, and dated November 19,2003. While not required, an environmental management plan
was developed for the project. Important findings and useful recommendations from the EA are
integrated into project design (see Annex 10).

7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

The project meets the regional criteria for readiness for implementation. The fiduciary arrangements
are inplace. All key project staff and consultants, with the exception o f a senior procurement
specialist to work with UNDP, have been mobilized. Adequate monitoring and evaluation capacity
i s already in place. The Environmental Analysis, Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, and
Resettlement Process Framework were disclosed inthe country inworkshops on 13 and 18
November 2003 and are available at the Bank's Infoshop.

                           HONDURAS: Forestsand RuralProductivity

Countryand sector issues

InHonduras poverty is highly correlatedwith living ina rural area. In 1999,75% ofrural
households were below the poverty line and 80% o f these were classified as living in extreme
poverty. On a countrywide basis, 59% o f poor households and 65% o f the extreme poor are rural.
For families living in rural areas, issues relatedto access to basic resources such as land and forests,
as well as to factors supporting production and marketing, are identifiedas being among the principal
determinants o f social inequalities and poverty. Poverty i s also linkedto other factors such as
demographic pressure and its effects on natural resources; the low level o f democratic participation
by the poor; and the weakness of local governments.

Povertv Reduction Stratem.         The current GOH administration entered office at the beginning o f
2002 having articulated its priorities and goals ina document entitled "My Commitment To You".
This document identifiedsix critical development areaswhere the new administrationwould focus its
attention. Soon thereafter, the new government affirmed its commitment and gave highpriority to
the recently completed Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). These two strategies, which are highly
compatible and complementary, are the basis for GOH's rural development policy.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), on which the IDA'Srecent CAS is based, has six pillars: (i)
accelerating equitable and sustainable growth; (ii)  reducing rural and (iii)urban poverty; (iv)
enhancing investment inhumancapital; (v) strengthening social protection for vulnerable groups;
and (vi) ensuring sustainability through governance/institutional reforms and enhanced
environmental sustainability.

The PRS stressesthe needto accelerate equitable and sustainable economic growth and identifies
four sectors as having highproductive potential. The forest sector is one o f these. Concurrently, for
the reduction o f poverty in rural areas the PRS stressesthe needto: i)improve equity and security in
access to land on behalf o f organized and independent small farmers (campesinos) and indigenous
people, thus allowing income improvement and food security for rural families; ii)promote
sustainable development inhigh-priority areas, under mechanisms that guarantee participation o f
local governments and communities; iii)improve the competitiveness o f the rural economy, inorder
to increase productionand improve the efficiency and competitiveness o f small rural producers,
facilitatingaccess to infrastructure and to support services inmarkets, technology and financing; and
iv) improve social conditions inrural areas, strengthensocial infrastructure and increase coverage o f
poverty-reduction programs in rural areas that are most depressed and have the greatest incidence o f
poverty. The strategy also recognizes the importance to long-term poverty reduction o f maintaining
environmental quality and mitigatingdisasters as the poor are more vulnerable to the consequences
of environmental degradation and natural disasters. Addressing deforestation and encouraging
sustainable development inthe forestry sector are identifiedas priority responses to these issues

Sector Policies.      Morethan 80% of Honduras' total land area i s legally classified as forest land,
with the majority o fthis beingpublic forest land. About 42% o fthe country's forest lands have been
deforested and forest degradationprocesses affect a very significant percentage o fthe remaining
forest areas. Forest resources are beinglost at a rate estimated to be greater than 800 km2per year.
The bulko fthe remaining forests are concentrated inHonduras' Central and Eastern zones where


                                                     18

44,750 km2o f forest, representingabout 80% o fthe country's existing forest resources are found.
These two regions also contain 60% o f the country's deforested lands. Percentage-wise, the western
and southern regions o f the country are the most deforested. Deforestation i s consideredto be the
environmental problemto which the highest priority attention should be given. Among the principal
causes o f deforestation and forest degradation are: conversion for agriculture and livestock;
unmanaged exploitation for domestic uses such as fuelwood; fire; and irrational logging. The
problem i s magnified by the limited effectiveness o f the State Forest Administration (AFE-
COHDEFOR). At the same time, highpriority is given to promotingthe rational and sustainable use
o f forest resources as a means o f contributing ina positive way to economic growth, employment
generation and reduction o f poverty, especially in rural areas. The country has a sustainable forest-
productioncapacity much higherthan current production.

  - Landsthat are classified as best suited for forestry use.

The populationinforest lands i s overwhelmingly poor. PRONADERS (2000) estimates that the
poverty rate i s 93% among this population. Between 250,000 and 350,000 households are estimated
to live in forest lands, representing from one-third to one-half o f Honduras' rural population.

For the poor rural smallholders that constitute more than 70% o f all rural landholders, the GOH's
policy vision differentiates betweenhouseholds with relatively more and better land (lowlands,
valley soils) and households in marginal areas (primarily forest lands). For the former, the focus i s
on development o f their productive capacity, improving market links and competitiveness. For the
latter, which constitute the majority o f the smallholders, the focus i s on diversification o f the local
economy, household food security and community forestry, agroforestry, and agricultural options.
Critical needs for achieving sustainable improvements insmallholder livelihoods include enhancing
tenure and resource access security; access to land, resources, and services; and gender equity.

Forestry inHonduras is considered a subsector o f agriculture. Policies goals for the forest sector that
most directly support the PRS include: (i)           poverty reduction -through regularization o fthe
traditional rights o f populations inand near public forest lands, increasing employment and income
of rural poor from participation inpublic and private forestry activities, increasing productive
opportunities and investments,and development o fpayment o f environmental services schemes; (ii)
community participation - indecision making, inthe process of regularization o f the traditional
rightso fpopulations inforest lands, and through Community Forestryprograms aimed at promoting
and developing productive activities that can significantly contribute to individual and community
welfare; (iii)sustainable forest management-based on forest and environmental management
planning and implementation and an ecosystems focus to guide investment such that benefits from



                                                             19

productive activities can be sustained while protecting critical areas and ecosystem services; (iv)
forest fire control - by mainstreaming forest fire prevention and control among the many local and
regional actors and public agencies inorder to more effectively tackle this large and complex
problem; and (v) development of local capacity - among municipal governments and communities to
exercise their rightsand meet their responsibilities.

The approach for achieving these policy goals i s based on developing territorial-specific,
multiphase programs. Publicly supported programs inthis context would be those oriented
toward resolving tenure conflicts; promoting conservation andrational use o f water, soils, and
forests; integratedwatershed management; strengthening of the system o f protected areas; and
establishment o f "zones o f sustainable forest development" for commercial forestry purposes. In
all cases, generationo f direct livelihood benefits for communities locatedinnational forests and
protectedareas is to be a fundamental goal o f these programs. There i s also great interest in
developing andimplementing next generation mechanisms and incentives (e. g., payment o f
environmental services and environmental services markets) inorder to create incentives for
forest conservation and management and reforestation.
Constraints.      To date, most GOH efforts at poverty reduction inforest lands have shown little
result. Among the principal reasons for this have been: (i)    the uncertain and conflictive nature o f land
tenure inpublic forest lands preventing effective public and private investment and forest
management; (ii)low priority givento the systematic provision o f support for production systems,
such as infrastructure, technical assistance, irrigation, training and access to markets, and credit; (iii)
an overly rigid, top-down command and control forest regulatory framework that, while seeking to
ensure appropriate management, has hadthe opposite effect by creating disincentives and encouraging
illegal behavior; (iv) undue discretionality and lack of transparency inthe management o f public
forest leading to forest governance problems and limitingprivate investment; (v) a diffuse and
confusing legal framework antithetical to encouraging private investment; and (vi) public policies
which have implicitly directed the State Forest Agency's (AFE-COHDEFOR) attention toward
generating income from timber extraction rather than towards needed forest and environmental
management and forest-based poverty alleviation programs.

Government's Response.         Major legislative reforms are being sought on territorial planning
(approved by Congress in October), property rights (being debated in Congress), and forestry
(submitted to Congress). Institutional reforms o f the State Forest Agency (AFE-COHDEFOR) are
being implemented and the Secretary o f Agriculture i s finalizing its restructuring proposal to support
national programs for agriculture, forestry and rural development. GOH's policies for the agricultural
sector are focused on achieving two overarching goals: poverty reduction and enhancing
competitiveness. The overall sectoral strategy (currently being finalized through public consultations)
proposes eight priority themes:

     1. Finance, investment and riskmanagement;
    2. Trade;
    3. Innovationand technology;
    4. Sustainable natural resources management;
    5. Access to land;
    6. Rural infrastructure and irrigation;
    7. Education andtraining for development o f rural and agricultural enterprises; and
    8. Sanitation and innocuousness o f agricultural products.




                                                     20

Among the programs being developed to implement sectoral strategy are included those for the
development o f agriculture, forestry and gender equity among poor smallholders (campesinos): the
National Agriculture and FoodProgram (PRONAGRO), the Community Forestry Program (a
component o f PRONAFOR), and the National Sustainable Rural Development Program
(PRONADERS).

GOHhas been inthe process for some three years o f attempting to reform the Forest Law and, since
the last nine months, to restructure and reformthe state forest agency. The process to reform the
legal framework via a new Forestry law has beentortuous. The three year history o f the reform
process has seen unprecedented levels and intensity of public consultation; development o f
competing versions o f new laws by different stakeholder groups; unwieldy and internally
inconsistent consensus versions o f the proposed law; marginally successful attempts by government
to simplify and improve the consensus versions; decisions to forego the new law altogether and focus
on reform o f key sections o f the existing laws; and finally, most recently, a new attempt by
government to bringa consensus version o f the Forestry Law to the Congress. The difficulties this
process has faced reflect the strong and competing political, economic and social interests around the
forestry sector. While reform o f the current framework offers clear advantages -particularly as
regards resolving problems from the overlapping and outdated elements inthe current framework
that inhibitsector investment -most o f the major changes required to overcome the sector's
constraints can be achieved underthe current legal framework.

Greater progress has been achieved inreforming AFE-COHDEFOR. Among the real achievements
to date have been: (i) the development and approval by AFE-COHDEFOR's Board o f a new
organizational structure; (ii)a refocusing o f the agency on the technical aspects o f its normative and
regulatory role, including a substantial downsizing inagency staffto adjust the ratio o f technical to
administrative staff and field staff to headquarters staff; and (iii)
                                                                    ongoing development o f the next
generation reforms, includingthe reassessment o f the state's role inadministering and managing
public forest lands and development o f incentives frameworks to reduce the state's land
administration burden infavor o f appropriate involvement o f community, private, and municipal
entities. Also, to deal with corruption and illegal logging, a highlevel Commission to audit the
application o f forest managementplans has been formed inthe Department o f Olancho (a center of
illegal logging). The Commission i s headed by the Minister o f SAG and includes representatives o f
the Attorney General's environmental enforcement unit, the Catholic Church, the police and local
environmental organizations. IDA and the Inter-American Development Bank have been working
with GOHand AFE-COHDEFOR on the reforms.

To attendto the fundamental problems stemming from landtenure inpublic forest lands, G O Hhas
put a highpriority on enlarging existing landregularizationprograms for recognizing traditional
rightsand usufruct on public lands and on developingprograms to provide the rural landless poor
with accessto productive lands. To promote sustainable development inpriority rural areas, the
Honduran Secretary o f Agriculture's National Sustainable Rural Development Program
(PRONADERS) was createdwhich, with its supporting services, coordinates some 18 participatory
projects targeted to smallholders to increase productivity via improved natural resource management,
crop diversification, quality improvements and productionand marketingsupport services. During
the last year, PRONADERS expanded substantially, reaching nearly 95,000 rural households (close
to 600,000 people). This initiative, combined with favorable weather and passage o f the Solidarity
with the FarmingSector Law, appears to have achieved good outcomes thus far. Agricultural outputs
have increased significantly between 2001and 2002, especially inthe basic grains on which the rural
poor rely.

                                  Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
                           HONDURAS: Forests and RuralProductivity

Project development objective and key indicators

The objective o f the project i s to increase the economic benefits and environmental services derived
from forest ecosystems in selected low income municipalities with highagro-forestry potential
within the project area (see Table 4). Indoing so, the project outcomes will include the generation o f
income, policies and actions that will contribute to the reduction o f poverty and the sustainable
management o f natural resources and reduction o f vulnerability in some 3.2 million hectares o f land.

The project's development indicators include: (i)at least 60% o f project municipalities (22)
strengthened, with municipal development plans under execution and 100 % o f project municipalities
(36) with a completed Land Use and Vulnerability ReductionPlan formalized by Municipal decree;
(ii)50% oflocalorganizationsstrengthenedtocarryoutplanning,administration, andmanagement
o f their own productive and natural resources management activities; (iii)at least a 40% increase in
the per capita income o f project participants; (iv) numbero f households benefited andjobs created
from project investments; (v) increased participation by women (30% o f direct participants are
women); (vi) 10% increase innumber o f small-scale community enterprises; (vii) tenure o f 20% o f
the occupants innational lands inthe project area regularized through formal, long-term usufruct
agreements or titles developed with the assistance of the project or; (ix) Protected Areas Fundin
execution by Year Two of the project; (x) 1.40 million hectares o f national, municipal,
communal/private forests and protectedareas incorporated into appropriate forest management
programs for protection, conservation, and productive use; (xi) 30% o f the priority Protected Areas
(5 ProtectedAreas) operating satisfactorily under participatory management schemes with minimum
financing ensured for recurrent protection and management costs; and (xii) percentage reduction in
deforestation rates inpriority protected areas.

The proposed operation i s a part o f GOH's efforts to implement reforms in the public forest sector,
restructure the SAG'S extension and assistance programs to the rural poor and municipal
governments, and to strengthenthe processes o f decentralization to local governments. Specifically,
GOH seeks to institutionalize within its national programs and scale upthe successful pilot
experiences developed under the IDA-financed Rural LandManagement Project (Cr. 2940-HO).

The project's area of influence consists o fthirty-six municipalities that contain eleven protectedareas
and thirteen Forest Management Units (FMUs). The total area and population o f the thirty-six
municipalities i s 3,261 km2and630,325 inhabitants (2001 Census). At project closing, a total area of
1.40 millionhectares of national, municipal, communal/private forests and protectedareas will have
been incorporated into appropriate forest management programs for protection, conservation, and
productive use. Additionally, the project will work jointly with the proposed Global Environmental
Fund(GEF)projectwhich will support the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversityo fthe
Corazon Transfrontier Reserve (a bi-national reserve shared with Nicaragua), which is the largest and
most important remaining area o f natural habitat in Central America.

The project will have four components: (i)Community Forestry; (ii)Forest Management, Tenure and
Conservation; (iii)Local Government & Disaster Preparedness; and (iv) Project Coordination and
Management.

The project is integrally linkedto a proposed GEF project, the Forests and Rural Productivity. This
will be a bi-national GEF project for Honduras andNicaragua, the global objective ofwhich is to
consolidate the management and protection o fNicaragua and Honduras' proposed Transfrontier
Biosphere Reserve, the "Coraz6n de Corredor Biol6gico Mesoamericano". Honduras and Nicaragua
have jointly submitteda proposal to UNESCO to form the Coraz6n Transfrontier Biosphere Reserve
as an overarching strategic instrumentto manage the area extending in Honduras from the PlAtano
Biosphere Reserve through the Tawakha Indigenous Reserve and PatucaNational Park to the
Bosawas Reserve inNicaragua and includes adjacent areas o f natural habitat inthe Mosquitia. In
Honduras, the two projects will function jointly incommunity-level management o f natural
resources, particularly forestry resources and in strengthening o f the SINAPH. The GEF proposal is
slated for approval in second quarter FY05.

Total project costs are estimated at US$32.7 milliono f which the IDA contribution will be US$20
million. The costs and IDA contribution o f each component and sub-component are summarized in

Throughthe project, GOH desires to replicate and/or build upon the experiences developed under
Rural LandManagement Project (known as "PAAR'). These include:

Institutional Strengthening and Reform.

Institutional and legal reforms: A great deal of experience was gained indeveloping improved
conditions for forest investment through: (i)  improving stability, clarity and transparency inthe
administration o fpublic forest lands by the State; and (ii)inarticulating policy and development o fthe
new Forestry Law. Two phases o ftechnical and administrative restructuring o fAFE-COHDEFOR
were completed, with particular attention to strengtheningthe monitoring, evaluation and operational
control functions. Assistance took the form o f redefinition o f functions and structure,
decentralization o f functions from the central offices to the regional and FMUoffices and legal
delimitation o f forests.

Biodiversity conservation: The Honduras National Protected Areas System (SINAPH) has been
evaluated andprioritized for purposes o fbiodiversity conservation. The partner organizations managing
specific protectedareas have hadtheir institutionalcapacity analyzed and the financing needs for park
protectionestimated. ConservationAreas, consistingo f geographically grouped priority protectedareas,
have been proposedfor purposes o f enhancing efficiency o f SINAPH administration. A financing
mechanism (National Parks Fund) has beendesigned and recently initiated under a Honduran Non-
Governmental Organization (Fundacih Vida) to capture and channel resources from GOHand external
sources for the deconcentrated administration ofthe Conservation Areas. Norms for the management
and use of park bufferzones have been established.

Distribution o f Benefits from National Forest: An incentive system to promote sustainable use and
conservationo fthe national forests has been developed. Itrecognizes three segments o f society as a
basis for definition o fthe benefits (incentives) to be derived: (i)
                                                                   those that have lived inthe forests for
generations (generally indigenous groups); (ii)those that they have settled more recently (colonists); and
(iii) thatdonotresideintheforestsbutthatenterperiodicallyinordertoextractresources,for
     groups
example, for fuelwood and wood for domestic use, landless rural poor. The approach i s based on the
recognition and formalization o ftraditional rights,allowingthe continuation o fthe established activities
upon which livelihood depends. Limitations to these rightsinclude that no additional forest may be
cleared nor maturetrees be felled without obtaining the appropriate permit. Additional measures include
employment o fpopulations residing inthe forests to carry out forest management activities inpublic
lands, planning andtechnical assistanceto communities for sustainable management o ftheir natural
resources.

Access to information: The State Forestry Agency's Center for Forest Informationand Statistics has
developed the capacity to provide spatial data and information for national and regional forest
management planning. Inaddition, it i s developing as a center for training ingeographicalinformation
systems in association with the National Forestry School (ESNACIFOR).

Gender: The concept o f gender was applied across all activities. Best practices from national and
regional experiences were systematized and integrated into the project's methodologies and
approaches. A gender perspective was used to analyze economic opportunities inforestry and
agriculture. Goals were established and monitored inall extension and training programs and
planningmethodologies were modified to take the family unit as the basis for integrated livelihood
and natural resources management planning. Changes in laws and customs were successfully
promoted for land titling o f women.

Inter-Institutional coordination: The PAAR establishedframeworks for operational cooperation
betweenthe Secretary o f Agriculture, the State Forest Agency, the Secretary o f Environment and



                                                      31

Natural Resources, academic institutions (e.g., Escuela Nacional Forestal, Escuela Nacional
Agricola, and Zamorano), other donor projects (e.g., PROLANCHO, Proyecto Guayape), Honduran
Institute for Tourism, private sector associations, Professional Colleges (forestry, agriculture) which
has improved the efficiency o f government's forestry and extension programs through systematizing
instruments and approaches, reducing duplication o f efforts, and creation o f synergies between
programs.

Forest Management.

Incorporation o f communities into management o f public forest lands: Operational methodologies
and instruments were developed to provide for community forestry concessions to implement
activities under forest management plans and to manage forest. This was complemented with
extension assistance to the communities for household food security (basic grains, livestock) as well
as forest-based livelihoods (e.g., resin tapping, pine timber production).

Priority ProtectedAreas: Inassociation withthe GEF-financed Biodiversity inPriority Areas Project
(P044343) seventeeno f the country's thirty-four priority protectedareas have received support. By
area, these represent 53% ofthe priority protected areas. These have been delimited andtheir
management categories established and legalized. The core areas (&em nzicleos) for biodiversity
conservationhave been established and biological surveys carried out. Park management plans for core
and buffer zone areas have beendeveloped andthe implementation o fthe parks' management plans
initiated. Protected areas staff (government, NGO, and community) have been trained and equipped.

Management o f Productive Pine Forests: A complete system o f forest management planning and
implementation for productive forests was developed which includes identification and mapping o f
national forest lands, cadastre o f national forest lands, census o f populations innational forest lands,
socioeconomic diagnostics and stakeholder consultation. This will assist indefining traditional uses
and areas of usufruct o f populations innational forest lands, forest inventory usingmore efficient
statistical models, development o f forest management plans which incorporate the rights and usufruct
of forest dwellers and communities and environmental impact assessments, annual operating plans
and five-year plans, implementation o f forest management plans through community participation
and outsourcing o f technical and operational activities to the private sector, preparation o f five year
plans for public timber auctions to permitthe participation o f international buyers and make the
process more open and competitive.

ForestFire: The control andprevention o f forest fires was moved from being a sole responsibility o fthe
State Forest Agency to a cooperative effort between the State Forest Agency, local governments and
rural communities. Targetingwas introduced for preventionactivities to focus on the areas most
susceptible to fire damage. Preventionactivities were outsourced to communities wherever possible to
generate employment andto make the communities stakeholders infire prevention. The size and
incidence o f forest fires inthe project area were very significantly reducedas were the overall costs o f
forest fire prevention and control.

Municipal Land Use Planning: Participatory methodologies have been developedto assist municipal
governments to elaborate a municipal zoning and development planwhich includes areas vulnerable
to landslides and flooding; for productiono f water; agriculture - intensive production, and improved
practices for hillside cultivation and production (e.g., agroforestry); forestry; and for urban
expansion. For each zone a series o f norms and activities - local projects and projects requiring
external assistance -are developed. With this instrument, which has a 20-year planning horizon, the

municipality and its communities prioritize their natural resources and environmental management
that inturn orients and facilitates local and external investment infunction o f these agreed priorities.

Forest LandTenure.

Delimitationand Demarcation of ForestLands: The methodology for delimitation and demarcationo f
forest lands was developed and applied allowingnational, municipal, private and communal forest lands
to be identified and the legal limitso fpublic FMUsto be established.

Recognitionand Regularization o f Ancestral and Traditional Rights: Methodologies were
developed, tested and applied to define the areas o f influence and traditional usufruct o f forest
dwellingcommunities and formalize their access anduse within the forest management plans.

Resolution o f tenure and resource management conflicts in indigenous lands: Working with the
Tolupanes and the other affected actors issues stemming from inter-tribal disagreement over
community boundaries, occupation o ftribal lands by non-indigenous colonists (some with agrarian
reform titles), overlapping titles with municipalities, and exploitation o f the Tolupanes forest
resources by outsiders were resolved. Official recognition o f the limits o f tribal lands by local
authorities was obtained, communal titles were providedto the nine tribes (comprising about 10,600
persons, and community forest management activities (with both indigenous and non-indigenous)
were initiated. Through the process both methodologies and capacity were developed, suitable for
extension and application to many other areas with similar issues.

ProjectComponents

The Community Forestrycomponent (US$8.56 million) buildsuponthe pilot "Fund For Hillside
Producers" establishedthrough the PAARto provide privatized extension services and training and
fundingfor applied research for ruralpoor living inmarginal areas. The Fundsuccessfully
established the administrative framework and methodological approaches to be applied by this
project as well as demonstratedthat training and extension are highly effective at improving
household welfare and stimulating adoption o f conservation technologies among small basic grain
farmers and thus inmanaging lands most vulnerable to environmental degradation. The component
is a key element inthe Secretary o f Agriculture's development o f its national program for privatized
extension services; it serves as a model to be replicated nationally. Next generation refinements to
the model will also be introduced and tested. The refinements include: (i)shiftingfrom provision o f
services on a group basis to provision o f services on a community-basis; (ii)strengthening the
organization and role o f local farmers and women's groups to ensure that the service provision is
community demand driven (CDD); (iii)       municipal-level strengthening o f producer and community
organizations to develop consensus on lines o f assistance in order to benefit larger numbers o f
households and achieve greater efficiencies through economies o f scale in provision o f strategic
services, such as marketing, commercialization, and forestry; and (iv) an increased focus on
agroforestry, timberhon-timber forestry livelihood alternatives, marketingand commercialization,
and assistance to establish informal credit mechanisms.

Project investments will strengthen the provision o f technical services for natural resources-based
livelihoodactivities in marginal areas (sloping uplands and forest zones) in order to improve the
standard o f living o fthe rural poor occupying these areas through increased household food security,
market production and access to markets, and improved natural resources management. Activities
will include: (i)Subprojects for forest and agricultural extension, technical assistance, training and



                                                    33

investment, implemented with the assistance o f private technical service providers contracted by
communities; (ii)Applied Research subprojects, designed to demonstrate the benefits o f improved
technologies and strengthen the National System for Research and Technology Transfer (SNITTA);
and (iii) Training program to strengthen the capacity o f key actors inthe implementation process,
          a
including government promoters and supervisors, municipalities, PSTs, and farmer leaders (men and
women). The component will finance community demand-driven and applied research subprojects
(including seed capital for productive investment/revolving funds), consultant services, training and
operational expenses.

Forestrv and Agricultural Extension.          Through a process o f participatory diagnostics, subprojects
will be developedto provide extension, technical assistance, training and investments inparticipating
communities. Technical services will beprovidedby private technical service providers (PSTs)
under contract with communities. Individual subprojects may be upto three years. Inadditionto the
technology transfer and training aspects of the subprojects, activities will include: (i)       assistance to
establish revolving funds at the community-level to finance productive inputsand recurrent costs,
especially for highdemand investments such as micro-irrigation, productiono f seed and vegetative
material; (ii)facilitation o f access to alternative sources o f financing for productive investment (from
other GOH, NGO, and bi-lateral programs); (iii)         strong emphasis will be given to marketingand
commercialization assistance, especially for small forest producer groups who face great challenges
infinding and entering stable markets; and (iv) traininginorganization and administrationto
improve productionand marketingand strengthen community/farmer associations. Inthe GEF-
financed areas o f the Corazon Transfrontier Reserve, a strong focus will be sought on community-
based forestry and stabilizing subsistence agricultural activities.

Limitedapplied researchefforts to demonstrate the benefits o f appropriate hillslope production
technology has been a serious constraint to disseminating improvedproductionand resource
management approaches through adaptation and adoption o f proven systems. Traditionally, research
has focused one production inthe valleys. Participatory diagnostics with target rural producer groups
and households on applied researchneeds were carried out under the PAARproject and an applied
research strategy developed in consultation with GOH, PSTs, members o f SNITTA, and reinforced
by analysis o f market options. The implementation o fthis strategy will be supported by financing o f

applied research subprojects for the introduction, validation and adaptation o f technologies relevant
to project beneficiaries, including: (i)thesis research by Honduranuniversity students in
collaboration with project beneficiaries and Technical Service Providers; (ii)   promotion, motivation
and training activities targeted at farmers to carry out their own on-farm adaptive research, to
demonstrate the benefits o f improved technologies and to strengthen SNITTA; and (iii)      research
carried out by members o f SNITTA in collaboration with project beneficiaries and Technical Service
Providers.

Training.      This subcomponent will provide training inthree areas: technological, methodological
and organizational/administrative. Technological training will be focused on the management o f
hillslope production systems (forestry, agriculture, and livestock), analysis o f production systems,
integratedpest management, micro-irrigation and drainage and community forestry. Methodological
training will include extension methods, use o f media, incorporation o f the gender dimension,
participatory diagnostics, micro-planning, participatory monitoring and evaluation, establishment of
adaptive and validation trials, monitoring and supervision and evaluation, working with community
leaders and groups, and on gender and equity issues. Organizational and administrative training will
be provided in: organization and business management; formulation, administration and management
o f small projects; community organization; basic accounting concepts; and alternative rural credit
systems. Eligible recipients will be key actors inthe implementation process: government promoters
and supervisors, municipalities, PSTs, and farmer leaders (men and women).

Forest Management,Tenure and Conservationwill cost a US$ 17.2 million and will assist GOH's
national forestry program by supporting sustainable management innational, municipal,
communal/private forests and protectedareas. The component will assist to develop the economic
potential, to maintainthe environmental services provided by forest ecosystems inthe project area
and to institutionalize the new models o f public forest management developed under the PAAR.
Support will be providedto: (i)forest management planning and forest protection innational,
municipal, communal, and private lands and forest management innational lands; (ii)strengthen and
expand the process o f regularization o f rights o f populations living in national lands; (iii)
                                                                                               strengthen
the management o fpriorityprotected areas and o fthe Honduras National ProtectedAreas System
(SINAPH), includingassistance to establish and implement a Protected Areas Fundto finance
protection and management expenditures inpriority SINAPHProtected Areas; and (iv) develop and
implement the policy and institutional reforms required to sustainthese interventions. As a result,
among others, pilot experiences initiated under the PAAR in local provision and marketing o f
environmental services and in the sustainable use and conservation o f biodiversitywill be replicated
and expanded upon. The component will finance goods, works, technical assistance, studies,
training, workshops, community consultations, vehicles, and operational expenses.

Forest Management Subcomponent (US$7.67 million).               The subcomponent will provide support
primarily for forest planningand management activities inpublic forest lands. Management
activities, which must be carried out at landscape scales, will be extended to municipal, communal
and private forests as well. These activities consist o f forest protection interventions -forest fire
planning, prevention and control; watershed management planningand implementation; and forest
pest management and control. Innational lands, planningand management activities will be carried
out on some 680,000 ha o f productive pine forests; 75% o f which currently have approved
management plans. This will include environmental impact assessmentand development o f forest
protection plans inthe entire area. An estimated 245,000 ha o f municipal forest and 450,000 ha. of
private and communal forest (belonging to the Tolupanes and Pechtribes) will be included as
appropriate inthe forest protection activities. Institutionalassistance will be provided to the State

Forest Agency to transfer the knowledge and capacity required to adopt, sustain and replicate on
other national lands the forest management methodologies and practices developed under the PAAR
and further refined and systematizedunder the proposedproject.

Innational forest lands support will beprovidedto develop managementplans inForest Management
Units(FMU)that lackthem and, as required, to update existing managementplans inthe other
FMUs. Inadditionto forest and watershed protection activities mentioned above, the project will
also finance forest inventories, the preparation o f timber auctions inproductionpine forests; forest
nurseries and reforestation; forest regeneration; environmental evaluation and management; road
maintenance; and other silvicultural activities (e.g., thinning, prescribed burns, etc.). Institutional
support will also be providedto strengthen AFE-COHDEFOR. This latter includes assistance to
modernize the Forest Information and Statistics Center (CIEF) and to ensure database compatibility
with national data standards; logistical and operational support for forest management inthe project
FMUs; training o f agency field staff; andtechnical assistance inkey topics such as forest
management, development and application o f forest incentive and financial instruments,
environmental evaluation, gender, decentralization o f forest administration, institutional
reorganization, development o f operational manuals, and forest fire campaign evaluation. The
subcomponent will also finance community and municipal consultations, informal training and
dissemination materials to ensure localparticipation and inputs into the forest management planning
and implementation processes and enhance transparency. A Rural Youth pilotproject will be
implemented to educate rural youth and involve them in forest conservation activities.

Regularization o f Forest Land Tenure (US$2.72 million).          This subcomponent will be
implemented in close cooperation with the Ministry o f Governance and Justice, which is the
implementing agency for the IDA-financedLand Administration Program (PO55991). It will assist
GOH infurther developing its program to resolve tenure conflicts innational forest lands. At the
national-level, outputs will be policies, norms and instruments for the regularization o f the traditional
rightsofpopulations living innational forest lands, includingdevelopment o f appropriate deed and
usufruct restrictions to ensure the maintenance o f the forests and the environmental services they
provide. Support will also be providedto the implementation o f a registry system for national forest
lands that includes a registry o f national forest occupants (Catalog0 de Patrimonio Forestal
Inalienable). Inthe project area, outputs will include a finalized census ofthe occupants o fthe 13
FMUsand participatory rural diagnostics to verify the census data, ascertain length o f occupation,
occupants traditional uses, and to document the forest occupants perceptions o f their traditional
rights. The traditional rightsof forest occupants insome 150,000 ha o f national forest lands will be
formalized through titling, long-term usufruct contracts, or other instruments to be developed by the
project to provide tenurehesource access security appropriate to the circumstances and the lands in
question. Social promotion strategies and informal conflict resolution mechanisms developed and
successfully applied under the PAARwill be applied. Cadastral work will be carried out inorder be
to legally delimit and demarcate a total o f about 500 km. o f boundaries o f national forest lands and
protected areas.

The activities supported by the project for the regularization o fthe traditional rightso fthe
populations inNational Forest Lands will include: (i)delimitation o f areas (cadastre and parcel-level
demarcation; (ii) census o f forest occupants and forest users; (iii)socio-economic diagnostics,
consultations, and participatory processes to identify rights and avoid/mitigate conflicts; and (iv)
regularization processes, includingprovision o f Certificates o f Occupation, recognition and
formalization o f rights, support to the "mesas de negociaci6n" (local, informal conflict resolution
mechanism incl. legal assistance being established through the PATHproject), provision o f usufruct

contracts to families, groups, and communities, andjointly with the PATH project, development o f
new tenure and usufruct instruments for regularization and for provision o f incentives to traditional
users to sustainably manage forest and forest lands. The regularization process will be carried out in
a systematic fashion inall areas where the IDA-financed project has or will support forest
management inpublic lands in order to ensure that future conflicts are not generated by ignoring
traditional rightsand uses by local populations.

An estimated $1.1 million is neededto complete regularization ofthe Tolupanes inthe project area
and an as yet unestimated amount will be required to do the same with the Pech. The project, with
the PATHproject and the SGJ, will assist FETRIXY, FETRIPH and local indigenous councils to
develop and find financing for a long term program to resolve their land tenure conflicts, and
additionally, to strengthentheir local organizations, and sustainably manage their forests.

ProtectedAreas Management KJS$6.78 million).             The subcomponent will strengthenthe
Honduras National Protected Areas System (SINAPH) and support actions to consolidate
management ineleven priority protected areas. At the national-level, it will support the
decentralization and deconcentration o f the management o f (i)  protected areas; (ii)
                                                                                     the
implementation o f the Protected Areas Fundas a mechanism to finance basic operational costs o f
management and protection o f priority Protected Areas; (iii)  assist inthe development o f policies and
norms for payment o f the environmental services providedby the protected areas system and (iv) the
participatory co-management o f protected areas through community-based structures; (v) technical
assistance to facilitate changes in SINAPH's institutional and legal framework and (vi) develop
economic activities in support o f the use and conservation o f biodiversity within the SINAPH; (vii)
updating and dissemination o f the Ecosystems Map o f Honduras both to improve its accuracy as well
as an instrument for monitoring macro-level trends in ecosystem conservation; and (viii) the
strengthening o f AFE-COHDEFOR' s supervision capacity o f Protected Areas under community-
based co-management structures. Associated with the GEF-financing are activities aimed at the
conservation and sustainable use o f the biodiversity o f the Corazon Transfrontier Reserve, from a
biological perspective, the largest and most important remainingarea o f natural habitat in Central
America. The Corazon Transfrontier Reserve is a priority within the context o f the Mesoamerican
Biological Corridor (MBC).

At the protected area's level, the projectwill support: (i)the reconstruction and equippingof visitors'
and researchcenters where demand for such centers demonstrably exists and park fees (or other
sources) can maintainthem; (ii)construction o f the interpretive trails and maintenance o f park access
roads; (iii)participatory elaboration o f park management plans to involve local communities and
stakeholders in buffer zone and core area conservation and protection; (iv) maintenance o f the
demarcation o f protected area boundaries; (v) operational costs associated with the implementation
of management plans through community-based co-management structures; (vi) training and
technical assistance to park staff and local stakeholders (government, NGO, community) especially
to develop better community-based management structures; and (vii) strengthening o f indigenous
communities on critical issues o f indigenous land rights inand around protected areas. One o f the
outcomes from this support will be to allow AFE - COHDEFOR, SERNA, the Municipalities o f
Olanchito and Arenal, and the Honduran Tourism Institute to implement a protection regime to
ensure the protection o f critical habitat o f the Honduran Emerald hummingbird,the only endemic
birdspecies inHonduras whose existence is threatened by loss o f its habitat. AFE-COHDEFOR will
assist with the management plan, protected area declaration and development o f the co-management
agreement for the implementation o f the management plan by a localNGO.

Proposed ProtectedAreas Fund.          Honduras i s proposing to establish an independent Protected
Areas Fund(PAF) to finance protection and management expenditures inpriority SINAPH Protected
Areas. It has been requested project assistance to do so. The project will finance technical
assistance, studies, workshops and training on key aspects for Fundestablishment and
implementation.

LocalGovernmentand DisasterPreparedness is a US$1.8 millioncomponent that supports all
thirty-sixproject municipalities andthe five municipal associations (mancomunidades) to which they
belong. Assistance is providedto strengthenthe local organization and capacity to carry out
participatory strategic planning at the municipal and regional (mancomunal) levels to reduce
environmental risks and vulnerability to natural phenomena (hurricanes, flooding, landslides, etc), to
generate and apply information for land use, zoning and vulnerability planning, to integrate outputs
into the local development agenda, and to develop and channel proposals to implement priority
actions to the relevant funding source or program. The component activities also link to the Forest
Management, Tenure and Conservation component in order to ensure its relevance to the local
development agenda. Further, the Community Forestry component investments will be guided by the
geographic and thematic priorities developed through this component. The component will finance
consultant services, goods, training and workshops, works, and operating costs. There are two
subcomponents:

Strenahenina o f Local Institutions.        The capacity o f local actors will be strengthened to manage
and administer natural resources and to prevent and/or mitigate risks to local populations. The target
groups are municipal associations, municipal government, formal community organizations and
owners o f forest lands. Support will be provided to strengthen: (i)   municipal organization and
management for strategic and land use planning/zoning; (ii)local and municipal organization and
management o f environmental and natural riskprevention and vulnerability reduction; and (iii)
national and local capacity to generate and apply information developedthrough municipal land use
planning and zoning exercises. Inaddition, (iv) assistance will be providedto create local spaces for
civil society participation and to increase the coverage o f the land use/zoning planning through
formation o f community leaders (men and women) and (v) technical assistance and in-service
trainingto municipal-level institutions to design and implement local plans (see below), including
assistance to develop and channel fundingproposals to the appropriate GOH institutions and
programs;

Disaster Preparedness.        This subcomponentwill finance a series o f activities which include: (i)
development o fjoint watershed managementplans, primarily for potable water and disaster
mitigation purposes, among the five municipal associations; (ii)development o f municipal land use
and zoning plans; (iii)formulation o f risk and vulnerability management plans; and (iv) seed capital
for works to demarcate vulnerable zones and reduce vulnerability. It i s expected that inthirty-two o f
the project municipalities that delimitationo f critical watersheds, protected areas and areas o f
restricted use, areas o f current and future human settlement and urban development will have been
delimited utilizing criteria o f disaster prevention and environmental protection inorder to
appropriately locate public investments and stimulate private investment where suitable. Inat least
half of project municipalities the appropriate administrative entities (community, local, government
or non-government) will have been defined for each o fthe territorial units delimited and those
entities will have appropriatedthe correspondingplan and restrictions to guide its actions.

Project Coordination and Management will cost US$ 5.2 millionand covers the administration
costs of the Project Coordination Unit and activities related to monitoringand evaluation, technical
studies and training as required for project implementation, includingpreparation o f new investment
proposals. The PCU will be a critical instrument to ensure efficient administration o f the project and
effective coordination and cooperation with other forestry, protected areas, and land-related projects
inthe country.

Institutional and implementation arrangements are similar to those successfully utilized by the
ongoing PAAR project. The project's support for forestry, extension, municipal governments, and
rural development require SAG to be the overall implementingagency for this project. SAG is
responsible for: (i) sector policy with AFE-COHEDFOR as the deconcentrated institution
                      forest
responsible for implementation o f sector policy; the Minister o f SAG presides on AFE-
COHDEFOR's Boardo f Directors; (ii)         forestry and agricultural technology transfer and research
policy with DICTA, and the Minister o f SAG presidesover DICTA'SBoard o f Directors; and (iii)
rural development policy, with PRONADERSas the deconcentrated entity responsible for
implementation o fpolicy; the Minister o f SAGpresides on PRONADERS's Board o f Directors.
SAG also presides over the GabineteAgo-Productivo, a body created for interministerial
coordination comprising the Ministers o f other relevant sectoral agencies. For purposes o f the
proposed project, other members of the Gabinete include SGJ, SERNA, INA, AFE-COHDEFOR,
FHIS, Municipal representatives, and the National Water and Sewage System. This arrangement
aims to provide high-level coordination for the implementation o f the agricultural sector policies
adopted by the Honduras Agricultural Forum (MesaAgicola HondureAa) and the public rural
investment program; the Gabinete is the vehicle for presentation o f policies and initiatives to the
Executive and the members of the Presidents Cabinet.

The already establishedProject Coordination Unit (PCU)' will also coordinate implementation o f
other IDA-financedprojects, including the ongoing Natural Disasters Mitigation Project (PMDN, Cr.
3361-HO), Access to Land Pilot (PACTA, Cr. 3435-HO), and the upcoming LandAdministration
Program (PATH, PO55991). The PCU is responsible for administrative and coordination functions
and will be attachedto the GabineteAgo-Productivo and will be co-financed by the four projects.
This arrangementwill create synergies, ensure coordination, and take advantage o f
complementarities among the projects. Within the PCU there will be a small Technical Unit (TU)
responsible for overseeing the day-to-day implementation o f project activities. Private firms will be
subcontractedto evaluate, supervise and certify results o f the subprojects financed under the
Community Forestry component as well as some community-related activities under the Forest
Management, Tenure and Conservation component (Private CertificationUnit).

Within the PCUthe technical staff o fthe four IDA-financed projects will coordinate inthe design

will be usedby the others. For example, the modernization and strengthening activities for the Forest
Information and Statistics Center (CIEF) will be executedby the project with parallel inputs from the
PATH in order to ensure connectivity and compatibility with the governments territorial information
systems and the integration o f the risk-prone areas identifiedby the Permanent Commission o f
Contingencies (COPECO) with support from the PMDN. This will ensure that AFE-COHDEFOR's
forest managementplans are available on-line to potential users and incorporate appropriate
vulnerability and riskmitigationmeasures. The forest management plans will also be available for
use by the project municipalities intheir land use planning and zoning exercises. With PACTA, the


 An agroforestry Sector-Wide Approach(SWAP) is currentlybeingdevelopedby the Borrower. As aresult, the

opportunities for coordination and complementarity include the potential to pilot forest-based
enterprises for the ruralpoor, financed by credit from private banks.

The project will have a high-level Council o f Governors, chaired by SAG, with representativeso f
each o f the executing agencies and civil society representatives. Itwill meet periodically and be
responsible for providing policy direction; identifying legal, institutional, and regulatory reforms; and
supervising compliance o f the project's key agreements (Participation Agreements, Municipality
Agreement, UNDP Agreement); and other formal arrangements.

The executing entities are: the State Forestry Agency (AFE-COHDEFOR); SAG'SDirectorate for
Agricultural Science and Technology (DICTA); and the Ministry o f Governance and Justice (SGJ).
The National Directorate for Sustainable Rural Development (DINADERS), the Ministryo f National
Resources and Environment (SERNA), andthe Honduran Association o f Municipalities (AMHON)
are collaborating entities inthe implementation. Participation Agreements will be signed between
SAG andthe executing agencies to formalize the roles o f each. Similarly SAG will enter into
"Municipality Agreements" with the respective municipalities where project activities will take
place. Memorandum o f Understanding will be signed duringimplementation with the collaborating
agencies inorder to detail the areas o f cooperation and to facilitate planning. For the Community
Forestry subprojects, tripartite "subproject agreements" will be signed with the eligible beneficiaries
and the Private Service Providers.

The table, below specifies the roles and implementation responsibilities o f the participating and
cooperating entities for the implementation o fthe project.

Alternative conflict resolution mechanisms to expedite land regularization will be established by the
PATH project at the local level. These "Regularization Tables" will provide free technical and legal
advice to beneficiaries to resolve disputes, and will rely on the existing Inter-ethnic Tables in
indigenous areas. At higher levels, it will take advantage o f the National Conflict Resolution Table,
the National Indigenous Table, andthe recently created (by the TerritorialPlanningLaw)
Department Council.

Credit funds will be disbursed to one Special Account (US dollar account for IDA funds), and this
account will be utilized for the purposes o fthe implementation arrangements agreed. As i s the
current practice inHonduras, the Special Account will be opened by the Ministry o f Finance
(SEFIN) and maintained inthe Central Bank o fHonduras.

The GOHwill allocate its counterpart funding into an operational project account, also at the Central
Bank, based on budget estimates submitted by the PCUBAG. Given the level o f financing under the
project, 30-day's o f estimated expenditures will be transferred from the Special Account to the
project account, from which checks or transfers (in local currency) will be issued to the providers o f
goods and services. The project will reconcile (monthly) both the project account as well as the
Special Account, and submitthe documentation regarding both accounts, to IDA under each
withdrawal application (Statement o f Expenditure) and will include such reconciliationinthe
quarterly Financial Monitoring Report (FMR).

UNDP had managedthe Special Account for the PCU under the PAAR project. The PCU maintains
all records, and it has establisheda 30-day cycle for disbursements and cash flow programming. At
the time o f the assessment, it was clear that due to the experience and management quality o f the
PCU, it is no longer necessary that UNDP function as an agent for financial management operations.

Procedures for flow of funds from the credit and the required counterpart contributionwill be
implemented with due regard to safeguarding project's resources and ensuringtimely execution o f
payments. Annual project financial statements will be audited in accordance with International
Auditing Standards by an independentfirm and inaccordance with terms o freference, both
acceptable to IDA.

Procurement will be carried out inaccordance with IDA guidelines and the provisions stipulated in
the Development Credit Agreement. The proposedthresholds for prior review are based on the

procurement capacity assessmentof the PCU and summarized inTable B, Annex 8. As the intended
Procurement Agent, UNDP will be incharge o f preparing all biddingdocuments, carryingout bid
openings and selecting and contracting consultant services for all contracts above prior review
threshold. The PCUwill carry out all shopping procedures, all NCBs, all selection of individual
consultants and o f consulting firms under US$lOO,OOO.   The technical staff o f the PCU will be
responsible for the quality of technical documents and products delivered by consultants, or physical
inputsfinanced under the project, as a result of any contracting done by UNDPon its behalf.

The Operational Manual for the project will specify the duties and responsibilities o f all the
institutions involved inthe implementationof the project. Itwill also include the procurement
procedures, the Standard BiddingDocuments to be used for each procurement method, and model
contracts for goods and works procured on the basis o f three quotations or shopping, respectively.

ImplementingEntities

The Ministryo f Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) will be the overall implementingentity and a
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been establishedwithin the Ministryto coordinate all activities
under this program. This PCU will also manage the IDA-financed project being implemented by the
Ministry o f Governance and Justice (Land Administrationproject), as well as two other ongoing
projects, Access to Land Pilot and Natural Disaster Mitigation Project, due to the experience this
PCUhas gained as well as under an effort to consolidate and harmonize various project unitswithin
the Government o f Honduras.

Regarding the financial management arrangements, the PCU has appointed a qualified accountant
and budget officer (who are currently working inthe IDA financed projects implemented by the same
PCU), to oversee all aspects o f financial management for the project. The PCUhas successfully
managedthe IDA financed Rural Land Management Project (PAAR), and it is expected that the
project management arrangement assessedfor the proposedproject will continue.

FundsFlow

Procedures for flow o f funds from the credit and the required counterpart contributionwill be
implemented with due regardto safeguarding project's resources and ensuring timely execution of
payments.

Credit funds will be disbursedto one Special Account (US dollar account for IDA funds), and this
account will be utilizedfor the purposes o f the implementation arrangements agreed. As is the
current practice in Honduras, the Special Account will be opened by the Ministry o f Finance
(SEFIN) and maintained inthe Central Bank o f Honduras.

The GOHwill allocate its counterpart funding into an operational project account, also at the Central
Bank, based on budget estimates submitted by the PCU/SAG. Giventhe level o f financing under the
project, 30-day's o f estimated expenditures will be transferred from the Special Account to the
project account, from which checks or transfers (in local currency) will be issued to the providers o f
goods and services. The project will reconcile (monthly) both the project account as well as the
Special Account, and submit the documentation regarding both accounts, to IDA under each
withdrawal application (Statement of Expenditure) and will include such reconciliation inthe
quarterly FinancialMonitoring Report (FMR).

UNDP hadmanagedthe Special Account for the PCU under the PAAR project. The PCUmaintains
all records, and it has established a 30-day cycle for disbursements and cash flow programming. At
the time o f the assessment, it was clear that due to the experience and management quality o f the
PCU, it is no longer necessary that UNDP function as an agent for financial management operations.

Paymentsand operationof bankaccounts. Beforepayments for acquisition o f goods and services
can be processed, a purchase order or contract mustexist. On the basis o f these documents,
appropriation warrants are issued, providedthat there's available budget. The Bank account



                                                    51

reconciliation will be prepared on a monthly basis by the Accountant and will be available within 8
days after the end o f the month. This i s the current practice o f the PCU and these arrangements have
been found to be acceptable to IDA.

UNDP had managed an account for the PCU under the PAAR project. However, at negotiations, the
agreement reached with the GOH i s that the PCU will open a Special Account and administer IDA
funds, maintainingall records and establishinga 30-day cycle for disbursementsand cash flow
programming, and the Special Account will be managed by the PCU. No additional advance will be
made by IDA to the Procurement Agent under this project. Any contracts that may be
managed/administered by the Agent, the PCUwill advance funds from the Special Account to the
Agent for payment execution, so that all funds are reconciled to a single account.

The GOHwill allocate its counterpart funding into an operational project account at the Central
Bank, based on budgetestimates submitted by the PCU/SAG. The operational project account will
be under the management and responsibility o fthe PCU. Bank account reconciliation will be
preparedon a monthly basis by the Accountant and will be available within 8 days after the end o f
the month. This is the current practice o f the PCU and these arrangements have been found to tie
acceptable to IDA.

Under this project, there will be several other co-implementing agencies, however there will be no
transfer o f funds to these agencies. All payments will be executed directly by the PCU. These
agencies will be required to enter into a participation agreement with the PCU.

Disbursements will be transaction-based and will be made on the basis o f Statements o f Expenditures
(SOEs), and the preparation o f SOEs will be the responsibility o fthe PCUwith clearance o f SEFIN.

Accounting Policiesand Procedures

Administrative procedures will be inplace to ensure that financial transactions are made with
consideration to safeguarding project assets and ensuringproper entry inthe accounting/monitoring
systems. The project already has a working draft o fthe operations manual, which is inthe process o f
beingfinalized. The project accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and
financial transactions o f the project, and produce financial statements useful to project management
and meeting IDA'Sfiduciary requirements. The accounting system is designed to be able to capture
all financial informationand allocate among both categories (the IDA'Slegal/disbursement
categories and GOH Budget categories/expenditure object) and project activity.

The project will also submit detailed monthly statements of expenditures to the office o f Finance and
Accounts and to SEFIN's Directorate o f Public Credit inorder that the project's expenditures are
recorded on the Ministry's accounts.

Segregation of duties. The PCUhas a clear organizational structure and procedures established
under the PAAR project. Said procedures support an adequate segregation o fprocurement,
budgeting, payment and recording activities, and this was observed within the PCU duringthe
appraisal mission. All detailed procedures are contained inthe operational manual for the project.

Budgeting. The Credit agreement and project cost tables will be the main inputsfor the project
budgets and counterpart (GOH) fundingestimates. The PCU will follow prescribed IDA
disbursement category and governmental budgetary heads, and the PCU/SAG will prepare at least:


                                                    52

            financial programs;

            budgetary commitment authorization;
         0  the monthly report on budgetary execution to be issued within 15 days after the end o f
            each month; and
         0  the quarterly report on evaluation of budgetary executionto be issuedwithin 15 days
            after the end o fthe quarter.

Bank account reconciliation will be prepared on a monthly basis by the Accountant and will be
available within 8 days after the end o fthe month.

Accounting.Accounting and budgetary records will be maintained in accordance with the GOHs
procedures, which i s satisfactory to IDA. However, for IDA monitoringpurposes the PCU will
report on detailed informationut theproject level, specifically the deposits to the special account and
the expenditures classified by activity/ subcomponent and disbursement category.

The PCU maintains and manages an integrated management information system that was developed
under the PAAR project. This system i s predicated on the project and procurement plans and these
are linked (and updated) to the budget of the project. There are elaborate levels o f controls to
approve budget transfers/allocations for execution under the procurement plan. These controls
include a 3-person Committee to review all transfer/allocation proposals.

The accounting records are maintained electronically, and are reconciled with budget and
procurement reports on a monthly basis. Expenditure reports are further analyzed by project
component and cash flow analyses are conducted both on an ex-post basis (analyzing weekly
spending for the prior month) as well as on a forecast basis for the upcoming month.

Safeguardover assets.Assets acquiredby the project will be inthe custody o f the respective
institutional departments o f the SAG. For the proposedproject, the PCU will keep detailed
subsidiary records o fplant and equipment acquired. The amounts inthis register will be reconciled
monthly against the respective accounting balances. At least one annual physical inspection will be
undertaken by PCU staff, preferably with the participation o f staff from the external auditors.

Audit arrangements.

Annual project financial statements will be audited inaccordance with the International Standards on
Auditing, by an independent firm and inaccordance with terms o freference (TORS)both acceptable
to IDA. In addition to the audit opinions on project financial statements, Special Accounts and
FMRs, special purpose reports will deal specifically with the observance o fthe procurement and
consultants services provisions of the Credit Agreement. The memorandum on internal controls
("management letter") will be issued annually.

The PCU agreed to appoint the auditors (for both the annual and special audits) under a multi-year
contract. The audit would then follow the provisions o f Section 4.01 (b) (ii)o f the Credit Agreement




                                                   53

(January 1st through December 31st of each year), with the audit report due no later than 4 months
after the end o f the fiscal year.

The PCU will prepare, ifneeded, an action plan to address any issues and recommendations
contained inthe audit reports. The action plan and follow-up activities would be communicated to
IDA.

Under the new IDA Audit Policy, it i s recommendedthat the audit TOR be drafted in such manner
that it would include all the IDA projects (the proposedproject and the ongoing PATH, NDNMand
PACTA) that are expected to be managed by the same PCU, o f which control structure and base o f
information would be used to produce financial reports, and would be subjected to the same
independent review. The new Audit policy explicitly allows for a consolidation o f reports, and with
specific annexes (financial statement and special account schedule) for each project, a single
management letter and audit report would meet IDA'Saudit requirements.

Reporting and Monitoring

On a monthly basis (at least), the PCUwill preparethe project's Statement of Expenditure, a matrix
classifying receipts by financing source and expenditures by financing source and disbursement
category. The expenditures would be compared to the projected figures per the quarterly budgets
prepared as indicated inthe Budgeting section above. This report is submitted to the SAG and the
SEFNs Directorate o f Public Credit.

Inaddition to the FMRs, the monthly financial reports will include the Special Account
Reconciliation Statements. Any difference inthe amount o f expenditures reported under the two
financial statements must be clearly explained. The project financial statements, along with the
physical progress and procurement sections o f the FMRs, will be submitted to IDA on a quarterly
basis, and will be submitted no later than forty-five (45) days after the end o f each quarter. The
contents o f the FMRs have been discussed, and the formats o f the reports will be finalized by Credit
negotiations.

  Strengths andWeaknesses

  The PCU inthe SAGhas an adequate financial management system. However, its contributions to
  the project's implementation and monitoring will be in effect when the updated procedures, controls
  and systems are under the organizational arrangements described previously are finalized, and
  arrangements for producing certain informationrelevant to IDA are inplace. The Action Plan
  (below) aims at addressing these issues.

                           HONDURAS: ForestsandRuralProductivity

A) Procurement Arrangements

Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out inaccordance with IDA "Guidelines:
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits",published inJanuary 1995 (revised
January/August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999); and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers" published inJanuary 1997 (revised in
September 1999, January 1999 and May 2002), and the provisions stipulated inthe Development
Credit Agreement.

1) Procurement methods: The methods to be used for the procurement are described below, and the
estimated amounts for each method, are summarized in Table A. The threshold contract values for
the use o f each method are fixed inTable B.

Procurement o f Works

Works procured under this project would include rehabilitation o f rural trails, paths and roads,
remodeling o f research centers and offices, aerial photographs, and some small infrastructure,
totaling US$1.7 millionequivalent. Eventhough no single contract will be o f big enough amount to
call for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, some o f these contracts will be
procured following ICB because the services may not be available nationally. IDA-issued Standard
BiddingDocumentswill be used. Other contracts estimatedto cost less than US$1.5 million
equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount o f US$682,000, may be procured usingNational
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, using standard biddingdocuments agreed.inadvance with
IDA. Small works, estimatedto cost less than US$150,000 equivalent per contract, upto an
aggregate amount o f US$871,000 may be procured on the basis o f at least three quotations received
by qualified domestic contractors inresponseto a written invitation, which will include a detailed
description o fthe works, including basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form o f
agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings, where applicable.

Procurement o f Goods

Goods procured under this project would include vehicles, satellite images, computer and office
equipment, software, office furniture and publications totaling US$1.O million equivalent. To the
extent possible, contracts for these goods will be grouped into biddingpackages o f more than
$150,000 equivalent and procured following ICB procedures, usingIDA-issued standard bidding
documents. Contracts with estimated values below this threshold per contract and up to an aggregate
amount of US$108,200 may be procured usingNCB procedures and standard bidding documents
agreed with IDA. Contracts for goods which cannot be grouped into larger biddingpackages and
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount o f US$186,700 may
be procured usingshopping (National /International) procedures based on a model request for
quotations satisfactory to IDA.




                                                    57

Direct Contracting

Goods and works which should be procured as an extension of an existing contract, must be purchased
from the original supplier to be compatible with existing equipment, or are of a proprietary nature and
costing $253,000 equivalent or less in the aggregate, may, with the Association's prior agreement, be
procuredinaccordancewith the provisionso f paragraph 3.7 of the Guidelines.

Community Forestry Subprojects

Under the PAAR project IDA has financed agricultural, forestry and microwatersheds management,
training and research demand-driven subprojects through the UplandProducers Fund. Under the
proposedproject these subprojects will continue to be financed. Subprojects could consist o f
consultant services, non-consultant training expenses, goods, very small works, and seed capital for
revolving funds. The average size o f a subproject i s expectedto be on the order o f $40,000. The
beneficiaries will follow to the extent possible local shopping procedures. The Operational Manual
would include evaluation criteria for selection o f subprojects, and will contain contract forms and
procurement procedures to be followed by the beneficiaries.

Procurement of Technical Services

Technical services procured under this project would include cadastral surveys, land demarcation and
land regularization totaling US$1.47 millionequivalent. Contracts with estimated values below this
threshold per contract and up to an aggregate amount o f US$l,183,000 may be procured usingNCB
procedures and standard biddingdocuments agreed with IDA. Contracts for technical services which
cannot be grouped into larger biddingpackages and estimated to cost less than US$150,000 per
contract, up to an aggregate amount o f US$286,750 may be procured usingshopping (National
/International) procedures based on a model request for quotations satisfactory to IDA.

Selection o f Consultants

Consulting services will be contractedunder this project for technical assistance, studies and capacity
buildingto develop the capacity o fproject actors (personnel o f government executing agencies,
municipal government, communities, private service providers, PCU staff). These services are
estimated to cost US$14.7 million equivalent and would be procured usingIDA Standard Request for
Proposals.

Firms

All contracts for firms would be procuredusingQCBS except for small and simple assignments that
can be precisely defined and are o f a standard or routine nature (such as auditing) and contracts
estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or less which would be procured usingLeast Cost selection
upto an aggregate amount o f US$200,000 or whenthe assignment is very small for which the need
for preparing and evaluating competitive proposals is notjustified and contracts are estimated to cost
US$lOO,OOO or less they would be procured based on Consultants' Qualifications.

Individuals

Specializedadvisory services would be providedby individual consultants selected by comparison o f
qualifications o f three candidates and hired inaccordance with the provisions o f paragraphs 5.1


                                                    58

through 5.3 o f the Consultant Guidelines, up to an aggregate amount o f US$8.2 million. The project
will renew existing contracts with technical and administrative staffcurrently working in
coordination o f the components and administration for the PAARproject. The majority o f this staff
was hired following competitive selection procedures based on short-lists and evaluation o f
qualifications. See Part 3 o f Section I1o f 3 to Development Credit Agreement. Schedule Contracts
will be renewedfor one year and further renewals would be subject to submission o fperformance
reviews reports that will require IDA'Sno-objection.

Operational Costs: N o operational costs would be financed with credit proceeds, except for those
that are financed under PPF-Q-3750.

Training would consist o f workshops, seminars, and consultation meetings, study tours for staff o f
participating agencies working inproject activities. IDA would finance travel, subsistence and per
diem to trainer andtrainees, registration fees, logistic expenses for organization o f training events,
and training materials.

2) Prior review thresholds: The proposedthresholds for prior review are based on the procurement
capacity assessment o f the project implementing unit and are summarized in Table B. Inadditionto
this prior review of individualprocurement actions, the planand budget for the PCUOperating Costs
will be reviewedand approved by IDA annually.

B) Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

An assessment o fthe capacity o fPCUto implement the procurement actions under the post review
threshold for the project has been carried out and was approved by the Regional Procurement
Advisor on December 8,2003.

The project will be coordinatedby a small PCU within the Ministryo f Agriculture. This PCU was
previously established to coordinate project activities under the first, ongoing Rural Land
Management project and it counted with the support o f UNDP for procurement and financial
management. A reducedarrangement will be continued under the new project with UNDP providing
assistance only inthe area o f procurement. More specifically, UNDP will provide services as a
procurement agent for larger, more complex procurement (see below). The PCU will also coordinate
implementation o f other IDA-financed projects includingthe upcomingLand Administration project,
the Natural Disasters Management project, and Access to Land Pilot Project.

UNDP will be contractedas a Procurement Agent to prepare all biddingdocuments, carryingout bid
openings and selecting and contracting consultant services for all contracts above prior review
threshold. The PCU will carry out all shopping procedures, all NCBs (except the first two), all
selection o f individual consultants under US$50,000 and selection o f consulting firms under
US$lOO,OOO. Since the PCU has had extensive experience on carrying out shopping procedures, the
threshold for shopping has been raisedto US$50,000. The PCU has one procurement officer and one
assistant. Due to the bigger workload with administration o f one other project, the PCU will hire
another experienced, senior procurement officer with a strong technical background. The technical
staff o f the PCU will be responsible for the quality o f technical documents and products delivered by
consultants, or physical inputs financed under the project, as a result o f any contracting done by
UNDP on its behalf. The existing structure, considering the additional procurement officer to be
hired for the project, is considered satisfactory.

The Operations Manual for the project will clearly specify all duties and responsibilities o f all
institutions involved inthe implementation of the project and will include, in additionto the
procurement procedures, the Standard BiddingDocuments to be used for each procurement method,
model contracts for goods procured on the basis o f three quotations or shopping, as well as the
biddingdocuments for technical services prepared by IDA.

The risk identified inthe assessment i s that UNDP's performance has not been entirely satisfactory
duringimplementation o fthe PAARproject. Biddingdocuments hadto be sent back often for
corrections which represents delays inthe implementation o fthe project. To mitigate this risk, the
Borrower will prepare a "Procurement Agent Agreement that will include a mechanism to assure
quality control o f all procurement activities carried out by UNDP. IDA will reevaluate UNDP's
performance after the first six months of project implementation and if it i s found not satisfactory
new arrangements for procurement administration will be sought, inwhich either the Ministry finds
another procurement agent or concentrates efforts to strengthen the capacity at the PCU. The
Association will carry out a full assessmento f any new proposed administrative agent before such
hiringis concluded.

The overall project risk for procurement i s considered AVERAGE.

C) ProcurementPlan

The Borrower has developed a procurement plan for project implementationthat providedthe basis
for the aggregate amounts for the procurement methods (per Table A). This plan was approved by
the RPA and i s inthe project files. At the beginning o f each calendar year, the Borrower will update
the Procurement Planwith a detailed procurement schedule for the coming year.

D) FrequencyofProcurementSupervision

Inadditionto the prior review supervision to be carried out from IDA offices, the capacity
assessment o f the PCU has recommended one full supervision missionto visit the field to carry out
post review o f procurement actions. Based on the overall risk assessment (AVERAGE)the post-
review field analysis should cover a sample o f not less than 1 in 10 contracts signed.

                            HONDURAS: ForestsandRuralProductivity

The project is expectedto generate a variety ofbenefits, includingbuildingor strengthening social
capital, increasing productivity innatural resource use (agricultural, forestry, livestock) in a
sustainable manner, promoting biodiversity conservation, strengthening institutions at the central and
local level inthe agriculture and natural resource sectors, and contributing to the implementation of
the Poverty Reduction Strategy. The economic and financial analyses.focus on the productive and
natural resource management activities, which amount to about 70% o f total project costs, or about
65% o f IDA financing. The other components and activities (regularization o f forest land tenure,
protected areas management, capacity building, local government and disaster preparedness) are
regarded as necessary pre-conditions for avoiding undesirable social, economic and environmental
costs. The expected benefits o f regularizing the traditional rightsnational forest occupants, for
example, would derive from: (a) resolving long-standing tenure conflicts which have denied
government and private landholders the ability to manage forests for their own benefits; (b) greater
equity inaccess to land and resources; and (c) providing a mechanism to preserve the value o f future
investments in forest and land as an incentive to private investment, eventually leading to creation o f
transparent and efficient markets for these. Also, project interventions such as those to enhance the
management and protection of priority protected areas, as shown by the Costa Rican example, can
generate substantial payoffs for the country through tourism. Tourism inHonduras generated some
$400 million inthe past year and is now the third most important source o f income for the country.
As inthe Costa Rican example, this will continue to grow insignificant correlation to the eco-
tourism reputation o f the country.
As required under GEF financing guidelines, an Incremental Costs Analysis will be completed under
the further preparation o f the Corazon Transfrontier Reserveproject.
The economic and financial benefits indicate that the project is a good investment for Honduras.
Benefit cost analysis o f the PAARproject, upon which the productive and natural resource
management activities o f this project are based, was estimated by the Borrower to be 1.7 (see
Informe Final De Implementacidn Proyecto DeAdministracidn De Areas Rurales inproject files).
This figure was calculated based on the actual project costs and the estimated project impacts on
forest and agricultural production.

ForestManagement

A benefit-cost analysis of PAAR's forest managementactivities inthe national forests o f Yoro was
carried out and used, among others, to estimate the benefit-cost outcomes for extension to the
national forests o f Olancho and Francisco Morazan. The sensitivity o f the model results based on the
Yoro analysis was examined. Inaddition, a qualitative evaluation o f the social and environmental
costs and benefits o fthe proposed forest management activities was carried out.

The study investigatedthe economic efficiency observed inPAAR's use o f its forest management
tools. More specifically it: 1) did a benefit-cost analysis o f PAAR's forest management activities in
the national forests o f Yoro, 2) prognosticatedthe benefit-cost outcome for further involvement in
the national forests o f Olancho and Francisco Morazhnbasedonwhat was observed inYoro, 3)
examined the sensitivity o f the model results based on the Yoro analysis in anticipation o f work in
 Olancho and Francisco Morazan, and 4) evaluated qualitatively the social and environmental costs
 and benefits o f PAAR's activities inforest management.

A soil expectation value (SEV) modelwas developed andusedto estimatethe optimal rotationage
based on local conditions and purely financial considerations. SEV models are widely applied in
forestry and provide an estimate o f the financial return to bare ground that will be dedicated to timber
and timber resource relatedproducts inperpetuity(Davis and Johnson 1987). The maximization o f
SEV is a well-known concept offundamental importance to the economic evaluation o fforest
resource development projects. Similar techniques have been employed in Honduranforestry (Flores
and Ruiz 1997). The results o f this model provide guidance inthe selection o f a rotationage for the
forest regulation model.

Inorder to evaluate the costs and benefits associatedwith these changes a forest regulationmodel
(FRM) was developed. Patternedafter the model employed inthe creation o fthe 1997 forest
management plan for Yoro the F R M takes into account the existing timber stands within the
management unit. Management policies such as non-declining yield and prioritized harvesting
schedules are also enforced and their impact on costs and benefits thereby incorporated inthe
analysis. It is inthis model where we incorporate a reduced rotationage based on the SEV model,
the accelerated transition period, the increased timber sale prices, reduced input costs and increased
timber yields per hectare.

The following quantitative changes due to PAAR's participation were examined usingthe FRM.


0   the rotation age was dropped from 40 to 35 years
0   the transition periodto full regulation harvesting levels was reduced from 8 to 4 years
0   the gross revenue from timber sales was increased by 10 percent
0   the cost o f regeneration was reducedby 20 percent
0   the cost o f site preparation for harvesting was reduced by 25 percent
0   the net yield from timber harvesting is increased by 5 percent

The results o f the with/without scenarios are compared inthe following table that illustrates the
present net worth o f land and timber under a range o f cost assumptions. The baseline case uses the
most likely input/output price levels and a guidingrate o f interest o f 7% (the real rate, where future
costs and returns are measured incurrent lempiras). Inthe worst-case situation the expected input
costs for forest management activities are increased by 20 percent, the gross revenue from stumpage
is reduced by 20 percent and the interest rate i s 9%. Inthe best-case situation the previous
input/output price changes are reversed and the interest rate i s set at 5%. The participation o f PAAR
results instrong positive returns under the full range o f conditions illustrated inthe table. In all cases
there is at least a doubling inthe presentnet worth o f land and timber within the Yoro management
unit due to PAAR'sparticipation. The value ofthe timber and land under the most likely case
scenario with full PAAR participation i s 16,440 lempiras per hectare. This value i s twice that
observed inthe worst case and halfthat observed inthe best. It should be rememberedwhen looking
at these land with timber prices that they represent the average value for national forest land in Yoro
under the conditions inwhich it i s currently found and within the constraints that it i s managed.

A more detailed examination of the FRMoutput for the baseline case gives the following changes in
benefits and costs. For the total cost incurred by PAAR, which has a present value o f 24,6 19,7 13
 lempiras, the present net worth o f AFE-COHDEFORs Yoro operation goes from 233,447,772
 lempiras to 527,O 17395 lempiras. These results yield a benefit-cost ratio o f 11.9 for the full
participation o f PAAR inthe management activities o f COHDEFOR in Yoro.

Economic Contribution by Category o f Management Activity

The results o f PAARs activities, evaluated intheir aggregate impact above, are now evaluated
individually. Individualtasks that significantly contributed to the achievement o f the observed
results ineach case were identifiedand their costs summed and compared to the benefits derived.
These benefit-cost ratios should provide a very tentative guidelineto the establishment o f future
priorities inactivity funding.

Tenure and Usufruct.         There are four tasks within the tenancy activity. These tasks are directed at
determining the location and legal situation o f the national forests with particular emphasis on rural
communities and their involvement innational forest occupancy and usufruct.

PAAR has made resolution o f forest land occupancy and use conflicts a very highpriority activity.
There are strong indications that substantial progress is beingmade inthis area through their
cadastral survey and rural population census tasks. Another essential element in achieving a
satisfactory resolution o f this issue i s PAAR'srural community activity inpromotion and
consultation. Inperformingthis benefit-cost analysis we allocate their full tenure and usufruct
budget and one-third o f their promotion and consultation budget to this objective and expect that as a
result o f these efforts COHDEFOR will recapture a substantial portion o f the funds now lost due to
illegal "taxes" and reduced competition inthe timber biddingprocess. We conservatively estimate an
additional 10%increase in stumpage value due to PAARs efforts inthis area. A benefit-cost ratio o f
4.66 is observed for the involved tasks o f these two activities.

Forest Planning.         There are three task categories identifiedwithin PAARs planning activity. The
collectiono f data and preparation o f the maps essential to land management decisions i s included
here. Five-year plans are to be developed as well as plans relating to watershed and protection
forests. All planning activity is to be integrated from the level o f the long-range master forest planto
annual operating plans.

Through the efforts o f PAAR the Yoro forest management unit has been able to maintain a level o f
planning effort that would not have been otherwise possible. Because o f this support they are well
prepared to aggressively pursue full implementationo f the forest management plan. We anticipate
that by the start o f 2004 they will be well on their way to targeted harvest levels as envisioned inthis
plan. We think that PAAR's assistance has placed them about four years in advance o f where they
would be without it. We would assign all o f the costs associated with this activity to this effort and
estimate the benefit cost ratio to be 6.45.

Forest Inventory.      Within inventory activity are two task categories coveringall forest
measurements. Timber stand informationneeded for any level o f planning from the long-range
forest master plan to operational plans i s found within this activity. Also included i s the marking o f
standing timber prior to sale.

The use o f consulting foresters to do inventory and sale preparation work in lieu o f COHDEFOR
personnel can result in lower associated costs. We estimate that the sale preparation cost originally
budgeted for this task can be reducedby approximately one-quarter. Inorder to achieve this
transition to the use and administration o f consulting foresters inthis task, PAAR will have expended
funds from the inventory activity budget. We have applied an estimated expenditure o f one-quarter
the monies budgetedfor this activity. A benefit-cost ratio o f 1.75 is estimated for this task.

Promotionand Consultation.        The promulgation and consultation activity has five task categories
directed at communication with local communities. Active two-way communication with the rural
populationi s sought through consultation on and explanation o f forestry related activities. One-third
o f the funds budgetedto these tasks were chargedto PAAR's work at resolvingopen or latent
community opposition to normalized timber sales. The benefit associated with this cost has already
been discussed inconnection with Tenure and Usufruct activity.

Forest Management.        There are six task categories within management activity. This activity is
quite comprehensive and covers most aspects o f forest management including protection,
maintenance o f forest access, silvicultural operations and sale administration.

Very significant reductions inthe costs associated with accomplishing stand regeneration can be
achieved through the use o f municipal contracts. We estimate that regeneration costs can easily be
cut by one-fifth or more usingwhat has been learned inboth Yoro and the El Cajon project. We
estimate the cost o f developing and institutionalizing this community based contractual approachto
regeneration at one-quarter of PAAR's expenditures inthis activity. A benefit-cost ratio o f 5.36 is
calculated for this undertaking.

Firepresuppression and suppression tasks done with PAARfunding have been impressive. Potential
 annual losses due to wildfire have been substantially reduced. These reductions in areas burned will
 result in increased annual yields at time o f harvest, which i s estimated to be inthe order o f five
 percent of current yields. One-quarter o f PAAR's expenditures inthis activity were assigned to
 presuppressionand suppression related tasks. A benefit-cost ratio o f 8.92 i s estimated for these
 tasks.

 Forest Research.      Four task categories comprise research activity. These applied research tasks are
 directed at improving conditions contributory to sustainable forest management. Legal, technical and
 economic issues are addressed within this activity.

PAARhas taken a major role inthe development ofthe new forest law. Under the proposed law
COHDEFOR will be given more discretion inestablishing rotation ages for the national forests.
Economic considerations should enter into the determination o f the appropriate rotationage. We feel
that some movementtoward a shorter rotation will be achieved because o f the very substantial
economic returnsthat can be realized. It i s conservatively estimated that the rotation age will be
changed from 40 to about 35 years in Yoro. Certainly for mature timber stands experiencing low
marginal value growth, such as those found in Yoro, an early conversion to an appropriate SEV
rotation i s economically justifiable. We estimate that PAARhas and will expend about one-fifth o f
its activity budget inwork relatedto this effort. The benefit-cost ratio o f 119.28 for this task
indicates that it is money well spent indeed.

Social Impact

A separate analysis will analyze the social impacts o fthe forest management component. We
enumerate here the ones that are important to an economist.

InYoro, the recordshowsthat the involvement of communities and individuals inall aspects of
forest management instigatedthrough the PAAR project, has ledto a lowered fire incidence.
Obviously local people feel that they have now a personal stake inthe health o f the forest. It is too
early to tell whether this will also lead to a reduction infire damage, once a fire gets started. We
have provided a quantitative estimate o f this social impact and incorporated that estimate inthe FRM
model.

Another social impact i s the resolution on the "timber tax" issue, where local and/or outside groups
exact a fee upon harvesting. This impact has also been quantified and accounted for inthe FRM
model.

Employment i s another important social economic impact. Based on some PAAR project data

PAAR project - we estimated the following numbers:
(2000b) and data gleaned from the project ElCajon (1999) - which has a longer history than the



0    Site preparation for reforestationprovides 2 man daydha. At a steady state annual allowable cost
    o f 873 ha this means 1746 man daydyear.
0   Planting shows 200 plant/man day. At a 2x2 m spacing this means 2500 plantdha, which inturn
    means 12.5 man days/ha. Assumingthat with the seed free method only 20% o f the annual
     allowable harvest o f 873 ha would have to be planted, this generates 0.2*873*12.5 man daydyear
     or 2182 man days. The other 80% o f the 873 ha will be handledthrough spot planting
     (complementation). Assumingthis will take only 20% o f the 12.5 man days calculated for
    planting, this will generate 0.80*873*0.20 man days or 2182 m or 1746 man daydyear.
     Regeneration through planting and complementation will generate 2182+1746=3928 man
     days/year.
0    Annual management activities are placed at 2 man days per ha per year, for a total for the 30555
     ha in Yoro o f 61110 man days.
0    Not counting sale preparation and harvesting (which may not involve the local people to any
     large extent), about 1746+3928+61110= 66784 man days o f employment are generated for
     replanting/regeneration/all forest management activities. At 200 man days per full time
     employee per year, this means an employment o f 334 full time persons. For 30555 ha this i s




                                                     67

    about 1full time personper 100 ha. InEurope this number usedto be 2 persons, so this i s a
    conservative estimate.

We have no estimates for employment multipliersfor Honduras. Inthe U S inrural areas, these tend
to be about 1.8-2.7. Ifthe multiplier could be assumed to be 2, total employment generated could be
as much as 133568 man days inYoro.

These 3 social impacts capture the most important social economic effects. There are, o f course,
others, butwe will leave a more detailed social impact analysis to the specific social analysis.

Environmental Benefits and Other Externalities

The PAARproject can be credited with a number o f environmental impacts. Economically, these are
inthe nature of externalities, largely nonmarketable benefits.

As important environmental benefit provides through the PAARproject is the sustainability o f the
forest management. Sound forest management coupled with the demonstration and construction o f
simple erosion control systems (rondos), will largely eliminate erosion and leads to a healthy pine
forest. This, inturn, provides benefits such as carbon sequestration, a healthy wildlife and a
maintenance o f biodiversity (as stimulated through the seed tree method).

Another very important benefit i s the area o f water production. While trees are not the optimal
vegetation ifwater yields are to be maximized (shrubs are), a healthy forest stand does regulate water
intake and reduces water runoffinextreme precipitation cases (as happens inthe recurring
hurricanes). Inmeetings with the 3 mayors o f communities such as those from the city o f Yoro, this
benefit was obviously driven home after the impacts o f hurricane Mitch. Clean water was obviously
a product the communities were willing to pay for, includingpayment for forest management
activities.

Finally, the seed tree method as employed inthe management o f the pine forests by PAAR, is
conducive to the maintenance o f biodiversity and the gene pool. The one negative environmental
impact i s inthe harvesting phase as envisioned by the management plans. While these can, and are,
mitigated, roading tends to produce negative impacts even when done carefully.

Expansion Prognosis - Olancho and Francisco Morazan

The Olancho and Francisco Morazanmanagement areas have a biosocial environment similar to that
found in Yoro. A highproportion o f their pine forest i s inthe more mature age classes and the
 average site class is not likely to be much different from that of Yoro. These two areas also have
 rural populations that live inor near the national forests and are very attentive to COHDEFOR
 activities inthese forests.                  I


 The economic analysis o f PAARs influence on COHDEFOR operations inYoro has shown a very
 highbenefit-cost ratio. PAARs very positive impact on national forest land and timber value in
 Yoro was found to extend over a wide range o f price levels and interest rates. Give the similarities
 betweenthese three areas we would not anticipate any major departures from the previous results
 obtained inYoro. Infact, we anticipate even higher returns from PAAR's efforts inthe future.




                                                     68

By buildingon their experience inYoro the proposed project can now initiate and execute selected
tasks with greater speed and efficiency. There not only exists a cadre o f well-trained PAAR and
COHDEFOR personnel but a much improved level o f communication and coordination between
their respective offices inTegucigalpa. All o f these factors bode well for a successful expansion o f
the program into Olancho and Francisco Morazan. Some caveats are warranted however.

It is important that essential tasks be targeted, relegating or eliminating lesser tasks from the agenda.
We feel that inboth Olancho and Francisco Morazan major emphasis mustbe placed on the activities
o f tenancy and usufruct, and, promotion and consultation. Success here, as in Yoro, i s dependent
upon having an identifiable rural population that i s in agreement with what i s beingdone by
COHDEFOR.

Given a benefit-cost ratio o f 11.9 for PAARs work inYoro, the similarities between these three
forest management areas, and the wealth o f experience gained to date by PAAR and COHDEFOR, it
should be fully expected to successfully export activities to Olancho and Francisco Morazan.

CommunityForestry

The Community Forestry component is an extension o f the FundFor HillsideProducers (FPL)
established under the PAAR project to fund agriculture, forestry and livestock subprojects for
households o f rural poor on marginal lands. To estimate the economic and financial benefits o f the
proposed component an evaluation o f FPL was conducted. This was subsequently supplemented by
analysis o f an improved menu o f typical subprojects that are expected to be carried out under the new
project. The improvedmenu reflects the lessons learned from the FPL.

The evaluation o f the FPL was carried out across a random selection o f subprojects having completed
an entire three year cycle. A total o f fifty-one projects serving 387 communities and 8,500 families
had been financed. Inthe final analysis, data was used from 44 communities or 18% o f all
communities that have completed 3 years inthe program. Activities analyzed included: improved
agricultural practices for maize, beans, rice, coffee, vegetables, and fruits; crop diversification; forest
tree nurseries; reforestation; forest management; planting shade for coffee; establishing improved
pastures, forage pastures for hay, and drinkingtroughs; animal health and nutrition; soil and moisture
conservation - grass barriers, hillside ditches, stone walls, and individual terraces; cover crops and
minimal tillage; crop residue management, and contour planting; improved cook stoves; home
gardens; livestock management (pigs, chickens, and fish); metallic silos for grain storage; and
 latrines. Qualitative analysis was also carried out to estimate "client satisfaction" and perception o f
value o f the subprojects and services received. The analysis o f the improved menufocused on
 forestry activities in national forests (productive pine forest management, community usufruct
 contracts for timber and firewood, and resin tapping) and on crop productionand agroforestry
 systems on-farm (sustainable basic grain production, shade coffee with timber species for shade,
 improved smallholder crop production of basic grains and coffee, and household agroforestry models
 -(i) grains, coffee,posts,firewood, raftersandbeams,Cordiaaliodorapolesandtimber; and
       basic
 (ii)basicgrainsandcoffee;andbasicgrains, coffee, resin, timber).

 Benefit-cost ratios were computed using discount rates o f 5% and lo%, respectively. Internalrates
 of return were also calculated.

Evaluationo f the FundFor Hillside Producers

Traditional public agricultural extension has long been considered to be inefficient. Most recently,
Collion* noted the pressures that are forcing public extension to reform: a) reduction in state budgets
causing a downsizing inpublic services, b) increasing information about extension's ineffectiveness,
c) lack of relevance and accountability, d) poor performance inreaching poor and women farmers, e)
trends indecentralization that contradict the traditional top-down extension format, and f) the
emergence of actors such as NGOs that can educate farmers. Reform measures for improving
extension can best be seen as falling into one o f four categories. These four categories are derived
from whether extension is publicly or privately funded and whether extension programming i s
publicly delivered or private delivered. These four categories are: (i)     Publicly funded, publicly
delivered; (ii) Publicly funded, privately delivered; (iii)Privately funded, publicly delivered; (iv)
Privately funded, privately delivered.

One o f the more popular reforms i s to move to publicly funded, privately delivered extension
programs. The Fundfor Hillside Producers (FPL) is an example o f this type o f program. It i s
designed to work with small farmers inforestry and hillside agricultural systems. Other countries in
which this type o f reform has beenenacted include Chile, Uganda, Ecuador, Venezuela, Uruguay,
and Bangladesh.

The six countries listed above have described their experiences with publicly funded, privately
delivered extension programs in a recent World Bank-sponsored workshop entitled, "Extension and
Rural Development - Converging Viewsfor Institutional Approaches?". A proceedings' for that
workshop with 40 case studies o f extension reform was published. Ingeneral, their experiences were
similar. Contracting out to private extension service providers afforded effective educational
programs for farmers. Farm incomes increased, farm output was increased, more farmers (including
the poor and women) were involved, and there were better opportunities for project monitoring. On
the other hand, all struggledwith personnel turnover, loss o f institutional memory due to the decline
of public extension, and discontinuities inservice to farmers as projects ended. And, perhaps most
importantly, they struggled with how to measure the economic outcomes of their projects -they
could measure outputs (number o f educational meetings, number o f involved farmershillages) but
not changed behavior (outcomes) that could be translated into economic improvement.

Rivera and Zijpl'edited a book on contracting out for agricultural extension. Intheir introduction
chapter, they describe good practices incontracting for extension. It i s a long list and is broken down
as policy issues, preconditions, and operational requirements. For this analysis o f the Honduran FPL
that list was condensed as follows and used as a basis for the evaluation:

TransDarent contracts. cost-efficiency, and monitoring.        The administration o f FPL i s sub-

seminars to interestedparties on how to write an acceptable proposal. Cost guidelines were

provided, areas o f emphases were listed, preferred beneficiaries were identified, and ratios of
extension personnelto beneficiarieswere specified. An independent, unbiasedpanel o f stakeholders
reviewed and approved the subprojects to be financed. The private technical service extension
companies (PSTs) were only paid upon completion o f stated goals. The technicians o f the UAP
conducted certifications quarterly. An analysis o f the certification process showed it to be cost-
efficient. The physical outputs certified provide an accurate assessment o f the outputs o f the
subprojects. These output measures providedthe information about the productivity o f the individual
extension providers and for FPL as a whole. The economic benefits were inferredfrom these.

Social and equity considerations.      One o f the advances of publicly funded, privately delivered
extension programs i s that contracts can be specified so as to accomplish certain social goals. In
FPL, companies mustwork with poor farmers on the hillsides; large farmers inthe valleys do not
qualify. Both gender and ethnic/cultural criteria were included. Indigenous communities inthe
project area were targeted. In addition, among the requirements for a company to receive a contract
was having capacity to work with women. Training on integration o f gender concerns were provided
to PSTs and the UAP.

Farmer involvement and decentralization.         For a company to receive a FPL contract it hadto work
ina participatory fashion witheach village to develop a proposal inwhich they identify goals that
they want to accomplish inthe upcomingyear. A general menuo f subject matter areas was used as a
basis for communities' prioritization o f activities to be carried out with the PSTs (Crop Production,
Forestry Production, Livestock Production, Soil Conservation, and Home Improvements). Inthe
Community Forestry component, communities will be enjoined at the municipal-levelto identify
priority subjects; these will expand on those listed above (e.g., marketing and commercialization,
value-added production, market crop diversification, non-timber forest products, etc.). Farmers will
also be playinga greater role in evaluating the PSTs, giving these companies feedback as to which
extension workers are effective and how they can best work with their communities.

Evaluating contracted extension services.        This is discussed inthe following analysis.

Outcomes and Indicator Analysis

The outcomes and indicators analysis looked at the impacts over project life. To complete the
outcomes and indicator analyses, interviews with PSTs and farm communities were conducted in
June 2003. Fifty percent o f the communities inthe 16 identified subprojects were randomly selected
for interview (or 25% o f all communities that have completed 3 years inthe program). Communities
were asked about the net benefits associated with the improvedpractices taught by the PST inthe
extension program (crops, livestock, forestry, soil conservation, and home improvement). The
farmers from a given community were gathered together for a group interview (typically 10 to 15
farmers). To obtain cost data, separate interviewswere conducted with the PSTs. PSTs were asked
about their allocation o f effort among the five extension activities (crop production, forestry,
livestock, soil conservation, and family gardens and homes). The sum o f these efforts must add to
100%. Since the amount o f the total contract was known, it was possible to allocate fundsto
extension activities. Communities were also asked qualitative questions regarding their use o f fallow
land, length o f rotations, their use o f natural pasture versus improvedpasture, and other related
questions to complete an indicator analysis. While the outcomes analysis was focused on economic
returns, the indicator analysis allowed for inferences to be made about the environment.




                                                      71

Overall, the FPL had a positive internal rate o f return (IRR). The most successful extension activity
was crop productionfollowed by family gardens and homes. Poor peasant farmers value improved
income making opportunities. Also, educational programs for the women (through the family
gardens and homes initiative) provide positive economic returns as well as social ones. IRRs for
crop productionranged from 25% in Olancho to 35% inYoro. The net benefits for forestry and
livestock activities did not apparently generate positive economic returns over the life o f the project.
For forestry, it would seem that the marginal results were due to an ineffective approach such that the
returns for the types o f activities promoted (primarily forest tree nurseries and reforestation) were too
far inthe future to have importance to these poor farmers. For livestock, few farmers had livestock
and those that did viewed them as an `asset inthe bank' rather than as an income producer. The
evaluation o f soil conservation was mixed with low, butpositive I R R s in Yoro (5%) and negative
ones inOlancho. It i s important to note that the environmental benefits accruing from these
activities were not included inthis estimate, thus the IRR is lower than actual should environmental
benefits have beentaken into account.

As a pilot, therefore, the FPLhas providedimportant lessons as to changes infocus and
improvements required under the new project inorder to increase the overall rate o f return. The
improvements being introduced include more focus on micro-irrigation, agroforestry (forestry
combined with crop production through inter-planting and other technologies), natural forest
management for (pine) timber and non-timber products, marketingand commercialization linkages,
and, where possible, value-added production. Special emphasis will be placed on marketing,
especially o f forest products where market linkages for communities are currently quite weak. In
addition, activities such as tree planting, soil conservation and livestock will not be pursued separate
from the improvement of the overall farming/agroforestry systems as in isolation they make little
economic sense; i.e., improved conservation practices and livestock will be integrated into a more
holistic household farming/livelihoodsystem approach. Based on the experience o f the FPL and the
introduction o f the improvements into the project model, the analysis shows that for an improved
menuo f subprojects (agroforestry, improvedmarketing, etc.) the returns can be quite high. For
individual agro-forestry models, returns ranged from 34% to 41%. Given these changes (and based
on assumptions o f differingmixes o f activities) the IRRfor the component is expected to be inthe
range o f 20% to 25%.

Household-level impacts o f the FPL were also evaluated. InFPL, the primary extension focus giving
the best results was on improvingcropping systems to increase income and reduce environmental
damage (e.g., soil erosion). Improvedcropping systems in FPL includedbetter management o f the
traditional corn and beans and corn (two levels o f improvement) and the introduction o f corn with a
mucuna (leguminous) cover crop. A similar process was followed with coffee. Inanalyzing these,
variable adoption rates o f these improvedtechnologies were considered. Based on observations,
assumptions were made regarding "good" adoption rates and "modest" adoption rates for different
levels o f management o f the cropping systems (modest adoption, good adoption) versus "traditional"
(without project) management. A further variable was added concerning price outlook, Le., changing
market prices resultingin income beingreduced by 10%. Costs and returnsfor the cropping systems
were calculated for these different alternatives at the village level and assumed to last for 20 years.
The costs o f the FPL extension program were based on 3 year subprojects. Net present values were
calculated and compared. The benefit-cost ratio i s significantly greater than one for all scenarios
except for the modest incomes (from 10% reduction inmarket process) and modest adoption
scenario. This highlightsthe importance o f achieving good adoption rates (Le., effective farm
educational programs), marketing and commercialization support and value-added production where
feasible to overcome possible turn downs inprices.

From a household perspective, significant improvements to family income were achieved by
changing to improved practices from traditional production practices. A previous analysis o f the
FPL, reported inthe Borrower's draft Implementation CompletionReport]', estimated that on
average households participating inthe FPL increased their incomes by 57%, from $670 per year to
$1,050 per year. This analysis found:
   That with reasonable market price expectations (good incomes) and a good adoption rate, the
   benefitkost ratio was 1.4 (NPV = $l,435/family) and with modest adoption rates the benefit/cost
   ratio was 1.3 (NPV=$1,098).
   That for farmers moving from a traditional corn and beans production system to the improved
   production system, returns to labor almost tripled(from L35 per day to L99 per day).
   The vulnerability o f households to market price reductions i s demonstrated by the worst case
   scenario where adoption rates are modest and income is reducedby 10% (modest income).
   Under this scenario, the benefithostratio drops below one.
   With the introduction o fthe improvements into the project design, the returns from the typical
   agroforestry models were estimated to range from 34% to 41% with benefithost ratios from 1.8
   to 2.0 and NPVs averaging inore than $2,650. Forestry activities such as community usufruct
   contracts in national forests for small-scale logging, firewood, and resintapping also showed
   potential. These activities profitability however are strongly influenced by transport costs and
   any usufruct fees or administration charges that might be levied by the State Forest Agency.
   Duringimplementationassistance will be required to AFE-COHDEFOR to assist them in
   analyzing and developing terms o f community usufruct contracts that do not undermine financial
   viability o f the promotedactivities. Also, analysis o f community forestry potential will be
   required to avoid promoting these activities where haul distances are prohibitive. Under
   appropriate conditions, returns can be over 100% with benefithost ratios exceeding 1.25 and
   NPVs averaging $3,700 per participating household. When compared with the estimated returns
   to the state from public pine forest management, it suggests that small-scale and community
   activities may be competitive (compared to current value o f stumpage fees generated inpublic
    lands). This latter inturn suggests the potential economic return to the regularization o f
   traditional rights innational forest lands.

Results from Indicator Analysis.       Based on interviews with communities, other positive outcomes
associated with the FPL (particularly interms o f providing insightsinto environmental benefits)
were:
0   Farmers are making better use o f their land.  Inthe average community the amount o fland
    under crop productionina community declined by 21% duringthe life o f the project. Farmers
    are either being more productive on existing land or changing their croppingpatterns to a more
    intensive use o f the land with highvalue crops such as vegetables and fruits. Consistent with this
    observation, the amount o f fallow land increasedby 52% and the lengtho f time it was rested-
    increasedfrom 1.5 years to 2.6 years.
0   Practice o f soil conservation practices was successfully introduced by 2003 compared 2000 when
    soil conservationpractices were essentially unknowdnot applied by the project communities.
0   Slash and burnagricultural practices substantially decreased with the number o f farmers inthe
    average community practicing slash and burnagriculture decreasing by over 60% in project
    communities.
0   The use o f natural pastures inthe average community decreased by 41%and the use of improved

Conclusions

FPL is part o f a growing reform movement inagricultural extensionwhere public funds are usedto
contract with private companies, NGOs, universities, and/or individual farmers to deliver the
extension program. As a pilot program, it was successful:
0  Itwas well-run andcost-efficient.
0  Itreacheda broadgroup of beneficiaries includingpoor farm families -- bothmen andwomen.
0  Farmers were incorporated in designingthe extension program, Le., it was demand-driven.
0  The highest impact activities on household income were the work with improvedcrops and help
   with home economic issues such as nutrition, gardens, and better cook stoves.
0  Economic returns from the pilot FPL program as a whole were positive although the promotion
   o f a number activities as stand alone interventions (soil conservation, livestock, reforestation)
   reduced economic returns. This should not be repeated inthe new project. The lesson learned is
   that the household's overall farming systemmust be the focus and conservation improvements
   must be integral results from improving overall income andproductivity rather than ad hoc
   promotion o f stand alone conservation.
0  FPL interventions that resulted inpositive financial incentives to the farming household have a
   good potential to be sustained as farmers were not directly subsidized except for extension and
   training assistance and thus the farmer's choice to adopt and maintain new technologies is not
   overly influenced by distorted perceptions o f costs and benefits.
0  Applyingthe lessons learned from the FPLto the new project will increase impacts, raisingthe
   IRRo fthe Community Forestry component to between20% and 25%.

                           HONDURAS: Forestsand RuralProductivity


The safeguard screening category of the project is S2. The project is classified as Category B,
requiring some type o f Environmental Analysis but not a full-scale Environmental Assessment study.

EnvironmentalAssessment (OP 4.01).           Inaccordance with OP 4.01, an Environmental Analysis
(EA) was conducted by a Honduran consultants, and datedNovember 19,2003. The EA included
field visits to review and carry out a screening of the types and potential impacts o f the proposed
project investments. As the proposed project will be buildingon the experience o f an existing
project, it was thus possible to evaluate actual practices and impacts. While not required, an
environmental management plan was developed for the project. This is an example o f good practice
and promotes the institutionalization of this practice inGOHprograms. This EA identifies potential
direct and indirect environmental impacts associated with the project, develops mechanisms and
measures to avoid, minimize and/or mitigate negative impacts, and presents an Environmental
Management Plan with specific activities, responsibilities and budgets to ensure the implementation
o f these mitigatingmeasures. Importantfindings and useful recommendations from the EA are
integrated into project design (see Annex IO).

Natural Habitat (OP 4.04).       The project triggers OP 4.04, Natural Habitatas it working in forests
and protected areas. To comply with OP4.04 no harvesting o f forest products will be permitted or
supported inside declared protected areas, including microwatersheds under protection as potable
water sources nor will any investments with the potential for inducingmigration into such areas be
supported. Protectedareas' management planningwill be extended to the park buffer zones to
develop specific strategies to ensure conservation o f existing habitat. These latter will be approved
by AFE-COHDEFOR basedon norms approved by the Ministry o f Environment. Regular
monitoringwill be established: bi-annual monitoring of biodiversity, annual monitoring via satellite
imagery o f physical conditions for the control o f migrations and detection o f illegal logging, the
technology for which i s installed inthe CIEF. EA will be carried out in FMUs on the forest
management plans and technical and environmental audits o f management plan implementation will
be carried out annually. Inaddition, in close cooperation with Land Administration Program,
appropriate deed and usufruct restrictions will be developed for the regularization o f the traditional
rightso fpopulations living innational forest lands to ensure the maintenance o f the forests andthe
environmental services they provide.

PestManagement (OP 4.09).           The projecttriggers OP 4.09, Pest Management as the project will
support technology transfer services (extension services) and training to small producers that could
result inthe increased use o f purchased inputs, including pesticides. As part o f a norm to not finance
recurrent costs o f production systems or to promote practices that are unsustainable, the project will
not finance any pesticides. Rather, it will focus on the transfer o f cultural practices and biological
controls to reduce incidence o f pests and diseases. Applied research will be supported in use o f
natural species such as Neem and Moringa to control insects and disease. Incases where project
households are already usingor purchasing pesticides, the extension programs to these groups will
require training in IntegratedPest Management (for crops and pests where proven alternatives exist)
as well as insafe use, handling and disposal of agrochemicals. Inaddition, they will receive
information on the pesticides registered for use and those that are prohibited in Honduras.

Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12).         IDA and GOHhave agreed that no involuntaryphysical
displacement would take place under this project. Incases such as people living within the
boundaries o f a protected area or consumptively use its natural resources, or where non-indigenous
people live within the boundaries o f an indigenous reserve or enter to use its natural resources, a
Process Framework for mitigatingpotential livelihood impacts has been preparedby the Borrower
and is available at the PAAR office in Tegucigalpa (Edif. Educredito, 2a planta, Colonia Florencia
Norte); a copy was also forwarded to the Bank's InfoShop on 15 January 2004. The Process
Framework describes how these cases would be addressed under the Project, all in a manner
consistent with the letter and spirit o f OD 4.30. The Process Framework will be part o f the Legal
Agreement.

Indigenous Peoples (OP4.20).         The project triggers the Indigenous Peoples OD 4.20 as it will be
working with communities o f Tolupan and Pech. To comply with OD 4.20, an Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan (IPDP) has beenprepared by GOH. Drawing upon informed participation, the
IPDP aims to ensure that indigenous peoples are not adversely effected by the project, and that they
receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits. See Annex 1Oa.

Forestry (OP4.36).        The project triggers the Forestry OP 4.36 as it provides support to forest
management planningand the implementation o f those plans in Honduras pine production forests as
well as promotes the productive use o f timber and non-timber forest resources. The policies and
forest strategies that GOHwishes to support through the project are consistent with OP 4.36. To
comply with the OP, the project will: (i)strengthen forest sector reform processes, inconjunction
with the Poverty Reduction Sector Credit (PO74758, under preparation) through which GOH
proposes to support the modernization o f the forest sector and removal structural obstacles to the
sustainable use and conservation o f the country's forest ecosystem; (ii)contribute to the management
and conservation o fpriority forest and protected areas through execution o f environmentally
appropriate management plans with clear definitionof roles and responsibilities o f public, private
and community actors; (iii)   strengthen private and local community actors inmanagement and
conservation o f forests; (iv) promote forest products certification development (Green Seal) and the
application o f the criteria and indicators for sustainable management o f pine forest developed under
the PAAR project; (v) apply the environmental assessment system for pine forest management and
harvesting previously developed, tested and validated with IDA assistance; and (vi) strengthen
GOH's capacity for environmental monitoring, a process ongoing with IDA support since 1999. The
PBPRwill not finance commercial logging operations or purchase o f logging equipment. The
project will provide technical assistance and training to forest owners, organized forestry groups, and
communities so that they may comply with the relevant forest management norms and regulations.

Inaccordance with IDA'SInformationDisclosure Policy (BP 17.50), copies ofthe Environmental
Analysis report in Spanish, the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, and the Process Framework
are available for public view at the PAARPCU office inTegucigalpa (Edif. Educredito, 2a planta,
Colonia FlorenciaNorte); a copy was also forwarded to the World Bank's InfoShop on January 13,
2004.

                            HONDURAS: Forestsand Rural Productivity

As part o fthe preparation o fthe ruralProject Productivity, a social evaluation inthe area of proposed
influence o f the project was carried. The evaluation: (i)identifiedpotential project beneficiaries in
the priority forest regions o f the departments o f Yoro, Olancho and Francisco Morazhn; (ii)
characterized the potential beneficiaries and proposed an appropriate typology o f these based in
degree o f organization, organizational capacities, and management capacity (financial, technical
aspects, etc.) relative to natural resource management objectives; (iii)identifiedgeneral needs of
technical assistance, training and strengthening o f community institutions for self-management of
natural resources, assuming the use o f a municipal-based approach to participatory planning under
the project,; (iv) identifiedand evaluated local use and management o f forest resources and the
problems associated with these, recognizingthe different social groups, traditional community
structures, systems o f leadership, productive organizations, forms o f community and municipal
mobilization of labor and existing agrarian conflicts (intercommunity, intracommunity,
intramunicipal, and/or with protected areas; (v) evaluated the current and potential legal status o f the
common types o f local organizations; (vi) identifiedthe potential for negative impacts that might
result form the proposed activities, focusing on the most vulnerable groups, and designed mitigating
and preventive measures - includingfor any possibility o f triggering OP4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement); (vii) identifiedconditions, opportunities and obstacles for communities, forest users,
of local authorities to plan and carry out project activities as proposed inthe project design; (viii)
developed the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan and Process Framework (participation plan) for
its updating duringproject implementation inorder to ensure that socio-cultural norms and
preferences o f the indigenous populations are respected during implementation; and (ix) developed
the participation plan for project beneficiaries' involvement in design, execution and evaluation o f
the project, with special emphasis onthe conditions and needs o fthe most marginalized groups.

Methodology

The evaluation consisted of: (i)review o f existing information, including documents from the PAAR
project; the proposed implementation activities, outcomes and strategies for each o f the proposed
project components; and other relevant secondary information; (ii)fieldwork inthe proposed project
areas consisting o f workshops at the regional levels and subsequent participatory diagnostics and data
collectionat the community-levels with a representative sample o f potential beneficiary groups and
organizations inthe zone o f influence o f the project; and (iii)weekly working sessions with all
project preparation team members and institutional representativeson integration o f social aspects
into project design.

For the preparation o f the IPDP, additional work was carried out involving participatory diagnostics
and interviews with qualified informants from the Tolupan and Pech communities. These included:
 Presidents o f the Tribal Councils, Executives o f the Tribal Councils, Tribal Chiefs, and Presidents o f
 Community, Patvonatos.

PrincipalResults

Rural poverty and Vulnerability. Among the 32 project municipalities, the evaluation calculated that
poverty is more prevalent than what i s implied by the Poverty Reduction Strategy's poverty map.
The map estimates for all project municipalities that >50% o f the population are poor. Estimates
form the social evaluation are that 22 municipalities have on average 65% o f their populationbelow
the poverty line, o f which 72% are living in conditions o f extreme poverty. Of all the poor inthe
project area, in 25 municipalities an average of 80% o f the population is in conditions o f extreme
poverty, while inthe remaining 7 municipalities the percentage o f extreme poor i s between 63% and
67%.

Project Beneficiaries. The target population for the project comprises: rural households with 1-3 ha
o f land and who migrate to sell their labor during some seasons o f the year (55%); rural households
with 5 1 ha o f land, highly dependant on selling their labor (28%); and the remainder, representing
rural households with plots o f 3 to 5 has (17%). The majority o f these lack any formal tenure
security (through freehold or usufruct titles). According to the data from the PAAR, landless
households represented about 13% o f those benefiting from extension, technical assistance and
training activities. The majority o f households develops their activities individually and do not rely
on organized structures to handle their productive activities in a collective form. Inthe communities
a wide variety o f groups exist representing diverse interests, these groups or community
organizations do not individually represent the interests o f their communities.

Of the 32 project municipalities, 11have indigenous populations living within them:

     a   The Tolupanes, better known as Jicaques or Xicaques, are an indigenous group numbering
         about 25,000 (2001 estimate, Source: Honduras Indigenous Profiles) and are located within
         the municipalities o fYorito, ElNegrito, Morazany Olanchito inthe Department o f Yoro and
         inOrica andMarale inFco. Morazan. All ofthese municipalities are inthe project area.
         The principal livelihood activities o fthe Tolupanes are agricultural. Corn and beans are the
         main subsistence crop. Tobacco i s cultivated on a small scale and nowadays other
         cultivations such as the coffee, banana, sugar caner, ayote, iiame, orange, avocado, papaya,
         rice, sorghum, pataste, chiberro, yuca, camote, malanga, chili, onion, cabbage and cucumber
         are found. Raising o f domestic livestock, including cattle and hogs, i s increasingly common.
         The entire family practices agricultural activities; women and the children participate inthe
         clearing and preparation o f the land, cultivation and harvest. Commercialization o f the
         products is through intermediaries (coyotes) that come to the communities to buy their crops
         of beans, corn and coffee. It is estimated that more than the 80% of the Tolupanes work as
         laborers on estates located inside and out o ftheir tribal areas.
     a   The Pechare located inthe northeastern and eastern part o fHonduras, specifically inthe
         departments o f Olancho, Colon and Gracias a Dios. Their traditional organization is tribal.
         They number some 3,200 persons, the majority o f them located in near the municipality o f
         Dulce Nombre de Culmi and the lower basin o f the river Plhtano, inthe department o f
         Olancho. The remainder are indispersed settlements inthe Department o f Colon. The Pech
         primary livelihood activities are based on agriculture, huntingand fishing. Their agricultural
         system is slash-and-burn. Supplemental activities include: raising domestic livestock,
         extracting the resin o f liquidambar tree, panning for gold and production o f crafts. The
         women participate inthis latter and also are healers, counselors and priestesses. The women
         contribute to the agricultural activities and fish.

Organizational Aspects. As regards forest managementand use, there tends to be no vision at the
community-level o f the potential benefits that forests might provide them. Financialbenefits from
forestry activities accrue to groups that represent small segments o f the communities. Access to
become a part o f these groups i s restricted generally to the extended family. Community
management is lacking, primarily due to absence o f financing and by limited ability o f local
authorities and communities to articulate priorities for forestry activities at the community and
municipal-levels. Organizational levels are extremely weak and require support that will permit
them to evolve and consolidate their organizational structure over time. At the community-level, the
common interests around which representative groups tend to organize are drinkingwater and the
protection o f the microwatershed that is its source; electrification, and construction and maintenance
o f roads and schools. The majority o f the existingorganizations are informal and have no legal
identity.

The Tolupanes have the following organizational structures.
      0  Tribal Council: Ineach community there is a functioning tribal council comprising 8
         members chosen in general assembly. They meet every three months inordinary session. In
         most cases it i s the president o f the tribal council who takes decisions on forest harvesting
         and the negotiation forest management plans.
      0  Patronatos: Inmost of the communities the figure o f the patronatos does not exist, with the
         exception o f the Ojo de Agua tribe where there exists an association of 20 patronatos that
         gather monthly.
      0  The tribal chief (cacique) i s chosen each two years, the cacique is an advisor to the Tribal
         Council's Executive Council and to the Community Assembly. The figure o f the cacique
         has lost power to the Tribal Councils.
      0  The communities are members o f a larger organization, the Federation o f the Xicaque Tribes
         o f Yoro (FETRIXY). The Federation has legal identity and a has developed a general norm
         for its members to regulate the use o f land and forest. Internalconflicts over the use o f land
         and forest are referredto the Tribal Councils and FETRIXY. FETRIXYreceives 15% o f the
         profits from forest exploitation.

The Pechprimary political organization i s the Confederacy o f Pech Tribes o f Honduras (FETRIPH),
established in 1985 for the purpose o f defending their land rights and the conservation o f their
customs and culture. Representatives are chosen in assembly every 2 years. FETRIPHi s the point
o f coordination for institutions that desire to work with the communities. They maintain offices in
the city o f Juticalpa and another in Tegucigalpa. The Presidents o f the Pech Tribal Councils have
indicated that they are satisfied with the work o f FETRIPH, and with the present leaders. FETRIPH
takes charge o f the representation and political work o f the Pech communities. The Pech social
organization rests on the extended family. Inaddition, the Pech organizational structure includes:
     0  Tribal Councils ineach community comprising 9 members chosen in general assembly in
        which all the community participates. They have established statutes and regulations that are
        enforced. The Councils take the decisions on forest harvesting, negotiate the execution o f the
        forest management plans and the execution o f projects. Each settlement (caserio) has a
        representative namedto speak inthe Council.
     0  Patronatos: these function in all the communities and their members are chosen for 2 years.
        Their function is to work with GOHprojects and programs and with the municipal
        governments. Inthe majority o f the cases, their relationship with the municipality is not
        favorable. They tend to see themselves as marginalized by the municipal governments.




                                                        79

         The caciques' functions are primarily inthe assignment o f land for cultivation and as an
         advisor to the Tribal Council.

Institutionalpresence.     There exists a wide range o f institutions working inthe project area, taking
equally diverse approaches to working with local authorities and communities. This greatly
complicates the localprocesses o f organization, planningand implementation. Inaddition, principal
institutional weaknesses comprise: (i)    limited capacity to promote a scaling up o f multiple use o f
forests by communities and municipalities; and (ii)a general ignorance o f the laws and programs that
govern and promote the use and management of natural resources, impedingthe different actors from
taking proactive roles inthis area.

Among the Tolupanes there i s little institutional presence o f government. Project/program technical
staff consider it very difficult to work with them given the lack o f access and facilities inthe
communities and the history o f distrust from previous unsatisfactory experiences with external
projects and programs. At present the FHIS has beenthe main institution, promoting establishment
o f informal savings and credit mechanisms. AFE-COHDEFOR's reputation i s not good as they are
seen as being present only when timber i s sold. Through the PAAR's Fundfor Hillside Producers, in
recent years 12 groups of Tolupanes consisting of 234 families (1,358 persons) have received
assistance.

Among the Pech the FHIShas beenpromoting the same agenda o f informal savings and credit
mechanisms as well as group purchase o f inputsand consumables and production o f beans. AFE-
COHDEFOR supervises the Pech' forest management plans of management and one community i s
collaborating on an ecotourism project with PRONADERS and the Ministry o f Culture. Through the
PAAR's Fundfor Hillside Producers, in recent years 16 groups o f Pech consisting o f 350 families
(1,815 persons or 53% o f the Pech population) have received assistance.

Indigenous Rights.        The constitution o f the Republic o f Honduras decreed January 11, 1982,
(Article 346): I t is the duty of the State to dictate measures toprotect the rights and interests of the
nation's indigenous communities, especially in the lands andforests where they have been living.
On February 8, 1941 the National Congress ratified the VI11International Conference o f Lima, Peru
(1938), and the Indigenous Congress o f Patzcuaro, Mexico (1940), which createdthe Pan-American
Indigenous Institute and its national counterparts. On March 20, 1995 the Government o f Honduras
ratified Convention No.169 on Indigenous Communities and Tribe in Independent Countries,
adopted by the General Conference o f the International Labor Organization inJune o f 1989.
Convention 169 establishes the rightso f indigenous communities to participate inthe utilization,
administration and conservation o ftheir natural resources.

Main ConclusionsandProjectDesign Considerations

Organizational Structures and Social Inclusion.        The priority project beneficiaries constitute the
landless rural poor who sell their labor to subsist, households with very small land holdings that rely
greatly on sellingtheir labor to subsist, households with small land holdings that seasonally sell their
labor as a compliment to their subsistence, and the Tolupan and Pech indigenous communities (see
the IPDP, below). Each o fthese has differing organizational and management capacity.

Organizational structures at the community-level that will be supported are those that represent
broadly felt needs, e.g., informal savings and credit groups, product marketinggroups, supply of



                                                       80

materials and inputs; development o f agriculture/forestry micro-businesses, etc. Inmost cases the
project will need to support the initial phases o f promotion and organization within a structured
approachto capacity building and provisiono ftechnical assistance.

Governance mechanisms at the community-level that will be strengthened and supported are the
patronatos and municipal corporations. At the municipal-level, support will be directed at achieving
an efficient internal management so that they will be capable o f delegating and distributing
responsibilities among committees as per the .specific needs presented, e.g., health, potable water,
education, and natural resources committees. At thepatronato-level, support will also be directed at
achieving capacity to delegate, distribute and rotate responsibilities. Regarding the management of
technical aspects, support should be providedto register forest exploitation activities, inventories o f
lands and forests, and inventories o f priority microwatershed includingtheir respective boundaries,
zones and register o f occupants and their land uses.

FinancialAspects.       Delegatingresponsibility for management o f small amounts o f financial
resources should be attempted wherever conditions allow in order to build capacity. Inthese cases,
very simply structured, basic systems for administration must be applied. These must include first
the establishment of internal controls and social audits of the use o fthe resources. Appropriate cases
for such delegation include: through the appropriatepatronatos inthe delimitation and protection o f
potable water sources (microwatersheds) shared between a group o f communities or the
administration o f water resources ingeneral; for municipal technical assistance and training for the
management o f technical aspects (e.g., to register forest exploitation, land and forests and
microwatershed inventories, etc.) and for the subsequent development and implementation o f
investment proposals. Inthe latter case, supports to the municipality to establishment simple
accounting and administration systems will be required. At minimum,this will include building
capacity to know the results and general balances duringthe budgetary periods, development o f
procedures manuals, and above all the application o f social audits with disclosure o f the results.

Community Promotion and Organizational Strengthening. Promotion, dissemination and
communication are indispensable in order to make potential beneficiaries and their communities
aware o f the project and the legal framework regulatingthe management, use and protectiono f
natural resources. To do so, it i s important to assist local organizations to obtain legal identities and
the security that would legitimizetheir activities inthe perception o f government and other sources
o f assistance. Patronatos and municipal governments, as the direct counterparts for community
management o f natural resources, will be the focus o f promotion and organizational strengthening.
An essential topic for communication to the communities at large will be to promote development o f
a vision o f the multiple uses and benefits o f the forest. Subsequently, the technical assistance
offering will need to be oriented in order to support the development and implementation o fthat
vision.

The best practice approaches developed under the PAAR for incorporation o f gender will continue to
be implemented boththrough training and monitoring of the private technical service providers
(PSTs) and o f the processes and outcomes at the community-level.

Itis important to mentionthat inthe proposedarea ofthe project some communities that have
received support from the PAAR, with the assistance o f the PSTs, are initiatingactions to participate
inthe IDA-financedAccess to Land Project (PACTA, P073035) inorder to acquire land. Under the
proposedproject, promotion and facilitation o f access to this program will be continued.
