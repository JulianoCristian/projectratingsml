It reviews their\n            socioeconomic conditions, social structure, and\n            socio-political aspects, in addition to land tenure, and\n            income generation. Within the institutional framework, it is\n            recommended to provide capacity building and technical\n            assistance, particularly in river basin management, and to\n            support small scale irrigation infrastructure works, so that\n            local communities may profit from the project's\n            economic benefits. Evaluation and follow-up procedures are\n            recommended to ensure compliance with this IPP, including\n            fostering populations to participate in their own funds\n            management, but most importantly, tribal consensus\n            highlights the need for institutional programs that fosters\n            indigenous culture as a communal support process.
