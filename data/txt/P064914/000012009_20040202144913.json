This environmental assessment sets the framework\n            to ensure environmental standards, and compliance with the\n            Bank's social and environmental safeguards, despite the\n            positive environmental nature of the project, which has been\n            classified as Category B. Mitigation measures are as\n            follows. To minimize social conflicts, due to cadastre\n            regularization in rural and forestry areas, loss of access\n            to sustainable natural resources, of income and/or living\n            standards, based on a participatory approach, and diagnosis,\n            technical assistance will be provided to ensure appropriate\n            mechanisms in land tenure, and communal planning.\n            Communities should participate in forestry management\n            programs within an institutional framework, to further\n            ensure their economic benefits. To avoid soil erosion, and\n            sedimentation, no new access roads will be constructed,\n            instead, existing roads will be rehabilitated as needed,\n            which should include appropriate drainage, based on a\n            sediment control design. In addition, vegetative propagation\n            should further stabilize soils, and drainage systems. No\n            heavy equipment will be allowed in humid tropical forests,\n            which should be protected, and only \"Pinnus spp\"\n            may be logged. An analysis of the forestry sector will\n            determine the regional forestry management, and\n            implementation norms to be followed, in accordance with\n            environmental standards, and strict monitoring. Only native\n            species will be replanted. Capacity building and technical\n            assistance in protected area management, and biodiversity\n            conservation shall be provided. Infrastructure development\n            will follow environmental guidelines in a case by case\n            basis, based on engineering designs that comply with\n            specified mitigation. While an intensified agricultural\n            production will be fostered, an integrated approach will be\n            followed, that includes capacity building and agricultural\n            extension, particularly in soil and water conservation.\n            Agrochemical products will only be available following an\n            adequate training in chemical management, storage, and disposal."}, "docdt": "2003-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
