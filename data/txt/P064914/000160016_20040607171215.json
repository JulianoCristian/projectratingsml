ecosystems in\n            selected low income municipalities with high agro- forestry\n            potential within the project area The project has four\n            components: Component 1 promotes Community Forestry.\n            Activities will include: (1) subprojects comprising\n            extension, technical assistance, training, and investment to\n            improve the standard of living of the rural poor occupying\n            forest lands; (2) applied research subprojects to\n            demonstrate the benefits of improved technologies and\n            strengthen the National System for Research and Technology\n            Transfer (SNITTA); and (3) a training program to strengthen\n            the capacity of key local actors in the implementation\n            process of subprojects, including municipalities, Technical\n            Service Providers (Pests), and farmer leaders (men and\n            women). The component will finance community demand-driven\n            subprojects (including seed capital for productive\n            investment/revolving funds), applied research, consultant\n            services, training and operational expenses.  Component 2\n            supports Forest Management, Tenure and Conservation. Support\n            will be provided to: (1) forest management planning and\n            forest protection in national, municipal, communal, and\n            private lands and forest management in national lands; (2)\n            strengthen and expand the process of regularization of\n            rights of populations living in national lands; (3)\n            strengthen the management of priority protected areas and of\n            the Honduras National Protected Areas System (SINAPH),\n            including assistance to establish and implement a Protected\n            Areas Fund tofinance protection and management expenditures\n            in priority SINAPH Protected Areas; and (iv) develop and\n            implement the policy and institutional reforms required to\n            sustain these interventions. Component 3 finances Local\n            Government & Disaster Preparedness. There are two\n            subcomponents: (1) Strengthening of Local Institutions,\n            providing capacity building assistance and (2) Disaster\n            Preparedness, supporting the development and application of\n            land use, zoning and vulnerability plans.
