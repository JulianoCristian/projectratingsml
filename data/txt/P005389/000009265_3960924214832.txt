PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 1724-MOR)
Preface
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation, appraisal,
and implementation of the Second Water Supply Project in Morocco, for which
Loan 1724-MOR in the amount of US$49 million was signed on July 2, 1979. The
project became effective on February 4, 1980 and was to have closed on
June 30, 1984. The original closing date was extended four times: to
June 30, 1985, June 30, 1986, June 30, l9d7, and December 31, 1987. The loan
was fully disbursed.
This report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Country Department II, Infrastructure Operations Division. It was based on
information derived from the files of the EMENA Information Center, as well as
supervision and completion missions.                            s

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 1724-MOR)
Evaluation SummarY
Objectives
The primary objective was to improve access to safe water supplies
for the rapidly growing population of the mid-Atlantic coastal region and
Greater Agadir by: (a) meeting increased water demand; (b) helping finance
the installation of house connections for low-income customers; and
(c) improving the operational efficiency of the Office National de l'Eau
Potable (ONEP).
Implementation Experience
The project was completed three and one-half years behind
schedule. Much of the delay was due to the modification of water production
and transmission facilities to increase their capacity in response to
greater demand than estimated at appraisal. Cumbersome bidding and payment
procedures, late subsidiary agreements concerning house connections, and the
deteriorating fiscal situation in Morocco also contributed to implementation
delays. Because of an inter-ministerial disagreement, an important water
supply sector study was not carried out.
Results
The least-cost investments enabled ONEP to meet increased demand in
the project areas, as no water shortages have occurred since the project
began. Under the Project Agreement, ONEP was required to initiate a study
for improving its operations, implement a new accounting system, and
inventory its fixed assets. In 1981, ONEP created a task force for the
study, which led ultimately to substantial gains in productivity. In
1982-83, ONEP implemented a new accounting system, which included a revised
cost accounting system. Although external audits of ONEP's accounts showed
marked improvement, auditors continued to point out serious deficiencies in
areas such as the inventory of fixed assets. Completion of the inventory is
expected in 1989.
ONEP and the local utility authorities have the capacity to
maintain and expand the facilities installed under the project. As long as
there continue to be adequate financial resources available, there should be
no difficulty in maintaining an acceptable level of benefits throughout the
economic life of those facilities.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 1724-MOR)
PART I
1.       Project Identity
Project Name: Second Water Supply Project
Loan No.: 1724-MOR
RVP Unit: EMENA
Country: Morocco
Sector: Water Supply and Sewerage
Sub-sector: Water Supply
2. Ba~g
2.01     Faced with severe budgetary constraints and high capital costs of
development of the water supply subsector, the Government of Morocco (GOPI)
decided in its sector development plan (1978-1980) to give first priority to
the improvement of water supply in urban areas, where limited investments
could benefit a large proportion of population. In the sector development
plans high priority had also been assigned to improve piped water service to
rural agglomerated villages. The Bank lending policy in the water supply
sector was to assist GOM in developing the sector by supporting its investment
program for water supply and to provide technical assistance and training for
institution building. In accordance with the socio-economic objectives of
GOM, the project was designed to: (i) develop productive water supply
facilities and water resources; and (ii) reduce the effects of urban poverty
by providing water to the urban poor.
3. Proiect Objectives and DescriDtion
3.01     The primary objective of the project was to improve access to safe
water supplies of the rapidly growing population of the Mid-Atlantic Coast
(Casablanca, Rabat-Sale, Kenitra) and the Greater Agadir area by:
(a) meeting increased water demand in these regions;
(b) establishing a revolving fund within each of the Regies of
Casablanca, Rabat-Sale and Kenitra to help finance the
installation of house connections for low-income customers; and
(c) assisting the Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP) to become
a more efficient institution.
The project consisted of four main components:
(a) expansion of bulk water production and transmission facilities
along the Mid-Atlantic Coast;



- 2 -
(b) expansion of bulk water production and transmission facilities
for the Greater Agadir area;
(c) funds for credit facilities to finance house connections of the
low-income population in the Mid-Atlantic Coast; and
(d) studies.
4. Projeet Design and Organisation
4.01     Since the first appearance in project files, project definition took
about six years and during that period the project composition was modified
several times. Project preparation started in 1976, upon request of GOM when
a first identification Bank mission took place. It took another two years
before a project brief was formulated in April 1978 proposing essentially the
same components of Loan 1724-MOR and two additional components in Agadir on
water distribution and sewerage. Appraisal took place in October 1978, when
the additional components in Agadir were deleted by absence of institutional
capacity for maintenance and operation. The project was in line with GOM main
objectives for the water supply sector of mobilizing water resources to
fulfill increasing water demand in urban centers and increasing service levels
for the urban poor. The beneficiaries, the Office National de l'Fau Potable
(ONEP), responsible for the implementation of the bulk water supply
components, and the Regies of Casablanca, Rabat-Sale and Kenitra responsible
for the house connection components participated fully in project preparation
and implementation. The timing of the project was appropriate because
increasing water demand was expected to exceed the capacity of existing
production facilities in the early eighties.
4.02     In spite of its long preparation time, the project was appraised on
the basis of fearibility studies; detailed engineering studies were executed
during project implementation resulting in minor revisions of the project.
The project was innovative in the promotion of house connections to the water
distribution systems by the creation of credit facilities to low-income
families. Although attention was paid to the parallel need to improve access
to water supply of the urban poor by the construction of additional public
taps, this proved unfeasible as municipalities could not afford to pay the
water bills on public tap consumption, which was already taxing the financial
situation cf the regies.
4.03     One important aspect of project design and organization resulted in a
complete failure: contrary to appraisal expectations, no action was taken by
the secretariat of economic affairs in the Prime Minister's office to execute
a water supply sector study to: (i) review the sector's organization,
(ii) improve the sector's investment decision process; and (iii) update the
country-wide tariff study. This lack of action was caused by disagreement
between the several sector Ministries involved. Nonetheless, the Bank has
been following up these issues. As a result, the GOM decided to create the
Conseil Superieur de l'Eau, which effectiveness in coordinating sector
activities is being actively monitored under Loan 2825-MOR. Regarding the
sector investment decision process, there has been only minor progress.
However, it is expected that our second structural adjustment operation in
Morocco will give priority to this aspect as one of its essential components
is the review of public expenditures including the most important PEs. Of the
other studies carried out by consultants under ONEP's and the Hydraulic



Department's responsibilities, only the water resources masterplan studies in
the Agadir area encountered considerable delays caused by the: (i) time needed
for data collection; (ii) complexity of the studies; (iii) participation of a
multitude of government services in the review of study reports; and,
(iv) absence of a permanent team leader in the consultants team.
5. Project Implementation
5.01     According to the project implementation schedule at appraisal the
project was expected to be completed by June 1983. Although the delays on
individual components varied, the overall project was finally completed by
December 31, 1987, with a delay of three and half years. Reflecting a too
optimistic view on the increase of water demand in the early implementation
years, which exceeded the forecast, much of the delay was due to the
modification of the proposed project facilities to increase capacity of the
Mid Atlantic Coast bulk water supply, other delays were caused by lengthy and
difficult bidding and payment procedures.
5.02     Bidding procedures and contract approval took often more than nine
months because of delays in approval of contracts by the financial controllers
of the MOF. Cumbersome administrative procedures in MOF also contributed to
excessive delays in payments of consultants, contractors and reimbursement of
the Regies for their house connection program expenses.
5.03     The subsidiary agreements between GOM and the Regies for the house
connection components were concluded in March 1980, or about nine months after
loan signing. This delay and unexpected technical, administrative and
financial constraints hampered project implementation as foreseen at
appraisal. The appraisal report identified difficulties in achievement of the
house connection program based on uncertainty regarding willingness to pay of
future customers and cooperation of the water distribution Regies. However,
no attention was paid to the above-mentioned constraints comprising:
xi) absence of roads in residential areas to be served with water supply;
(ii) unforeseen modification of urban renewal projects; and (iii) excessive
delays in disbursement procedures by the Ministry of Finance. The
inflexibility of eligibility criteria for house connection credits, which were
covenanted in the loan agreement and which were changed only once during
project execution was justified as a means of preventing abuse by customers
who could afford the cost of connections. Of the above constraints only the
first could have been identified ann calibrated during project preparation
through prior assessment of the existing physical conditions. The
deteriorating fiscal situation of GOM during project execution contributed to
excessive delays in disbursements. To speed up payment procedures and to
relieve the GOM's fiscal situation the Bank insisted on the adoption of direct
payment procedures, which were applied for ONEP and the Regies since 1983, and
in 1984 the Bank agreed to increase disbursements through a Special Action
Program (SAP).
6. Project Results
6.01     During project implementation no changes were made in the project
objectives. The least-cost investments in the Mid Atlantic Coast and the
Greater Agadir bulk water supply facilities did timely meet the increased
water demand and no water shortages occurred before and after completion.
Actual project costs amounted to DH 1,063.77 million as compared with



-4-
appraisal estimates of DH 697.22 million, adjusted to reflect the project
modifications mentioned in para 5.01. ' The cost overruns were met by
Government contributions to ONEP and ONEP's own funds. It is estimated that
of the total net increase of DH 366.55 million about 20 percent is the result
of higher prices due to the fact that part of the project was completed after
the original completion date. T.te repeated devaluations of the DH contributed
to about 50 percent of total net increase. The remainder of the cost overrun
or about 30 percent is due to project modifications.
6.02     Under the Project Agreement, ONEP was to inventory its fixed assets,
implement a new accounting system, initiate a study for improving its
operational procedures and send to the Bank audited accounts. By June 30,
1980, the deadline for starting its fixed assets inveutory, ONEP had already
completed 20% of the work; by end 1987 it had completed 80Z and the work is
expected to be completed in 1989. The 10-year period taken to complete the
inventory is long and it may ;.ave been shortened with the assistance of
consultants which the loan should have financed. ONEP successfully
implemented a new accounting system in 1982-83, including a revised cost
accounting system. Although audited reports were not always received in time
by the Bank, there has been a clear improvement in the timely preparation of
annual accounts. However, external auditors have continued to refuse to give
an opinion on ONEP's accounts. This refusal is predicated on the lack of:
(i) a completed inventory of fixed assets; (ii) clarity in the presentation of
the results that may eventually be achieved by the cancellation of arrears
which is taking place at the country level; (iii) confirmation from the
Government on its loa-s to ONEP; and (iv) compliance with internationally
accepted procedures for recording losses on the valuation of foreign loans.
Although some of the teasons given by the auditors for withholding their
opinion are beyond the control of ONEP and are but a reflection of the
generally unsatisfactory state of affairs in the Moroccan finances and its
administration, there are some improvements that ONEP should implement. Bank
supervision missions have requested ONEP to carry out these improvements
during 1989, particularly the clarification of receivables and payables and
the establishment of reserves for uncollectables, where needed.
6.03     ONEP financial statements for the period 1975-87 are given in
Annex 4. They compare actual with forecast data over the project
implementation period 1979-1987. The comparison shows that average sale of
water was 162 lower than forecast. Even though water charges were lower than
expected until 1985, they were higher thereafter, so that, for the period they
resulted in revenues from sales about 112 lower than forecast at appraisal.
The higher water charges were implemented since 1986 as a reaction to ONEP'3
deteriorating financial situation, and also as a result of pressure exerted
over Government by ONEP's management and the Bank, who used as a leverage tool
the appraisal of a then upcoming loan (2825-MOR). ONEP's total working
expenses were in line with (1% higher than) appraisal estimates; although
salaries were 10% higher and energy 571 higher than appraisal estimates,
chemicals and materials were 502 lower despite steep increases in the unit
price of chemicals.
t' Use of US$ equivalent cost figures is not meaningful given the successive
devaluations of the Dirham and changes in the exchange rate of the US$
with respect to other strong currencies.



6.04     Already by March 1981, ONEP had created a task force to study and
improve its operations. The task force was successful and its efforts
rewarded by substantial gains in ONEP's operational performance. While wages
and energy prices were outside ONEP's control, ONEP was able to improve its
performance significantly by constraining staffing so as to achieve a low
growth rate of 42 over the period 1979-87; sales by employee grew from 68
thousand m3 per employee in 1979 to 114 thousand m3 per employee by 1987; by
1987, ONEP staff was about 102 below appraisal estimates. Lower use of
chemicals and materials was impressive. Lower energy costs were also achieved
by changing pumping hours and modifying delivery contracts with the National
Electricity Company.
6.05     A financial covenant required ONEP to earn an annual rate of return
on its average net fixed assets of r.ot less than 21 in 1980, 5% in 1981, and
71 in 1982 and thereafter. ONEP did not comply in 1980-81 when rates were
negative. The Bank, realizing that the target was excessively high changed
the covenant under the follow-up Loan 2006-MOR to the maintenance of a working
ratio not to exceed 0.66 starting in 1982, which demanded lower revenues than
the preceding covenant. ONEP was still unable to comply in 1982-83 but it
complied in 1984 after steep tariff increases of 431 for bulk and 58% for
retail supplies; annual tariff increases averaging 132 implemented in 1985-87
allowed ONEP to continue to comply with the covenant. The same pattern is
observed for the compliance with the debt service coverage ratio covenant,
where the Bank reduced the original 1.5 times target to 1.3 times; ONEP was
unable to compiy with the covenant in 1980-83 but has complied thereafter.
6.06     The following is a summary of ONEP's flow of funds over the period
1979-87:

6.07     The above table shows that ONEP's investments over the period were in
line with those estimated at appraisal. However, while investments over
1979-85 were substantially higher (351) than appraisal estimates, they were
much lower (561) in 1986-87. The 1986-87 reduction of investments was due to
a GOM imposed ceiling on investments as GOM attempted to rein on its budget
deficit. Faced with a substantially (75%) lower amount of funds internally
generated, ONEP had to resort to increased (451) transfers from GOM.



- 6 -
Borrowings were about 151 lower than estimated and financed a lower than
expected proportion of investments. In the face of large increases in the
nominal value of debt, brought about by substantial devaluations of the
dirham, the reduced borrowings and increased GOM funds had the salutary effect
of producing debt/equity ratios practically equal to those expected at
appraisal (1987: 26/74 actual versus 24/76 estimated). The DO 10 million
increase in working capital hides the enormous amounts of both current assets
and current liabilities, which further increased from 204% and 1001,
respectively, of total revenues in 1979 to 213% and 151% in 1987. These large
amounts of current assets and liabilities are the result of the long-standing
problem of arrears in Morocco. Under the Loan Agreement (Section 4.05), GOM
committed itself to paying its water bills within 120 days. The
Interministerial Commission appointed by GOM to solve the arrears problem was
initially able to reduce arrears but after a while they reoccurred. The PERL
(Loan 2820-MOR) aimed, among others, to solve the existing arrears problem at
the national level and, although it has been reported that these efforts have
momentarily alleviated the situation, the creation of new arrears continues to
be a problem in the water sector even today. This is a problem that cannot be
solved until the r6gies (collectivites locales) pay their bills; payment of
these bills should improve as more financial resources are being obtained
through transfer of 30% of VAT and the new legislation for local taxes, which
favors the collectivites locales, is approved by the parliament.
6.08     Although there were considerable delays in the implementation of the
house connection program, a total of 52,000 house connections were made
compared to the appraisal estimate of 48,000, and about 420,000 low-income
habitants are now served by these connections. On the basis of these figures
the Regies together achieved the target for house connections. However, while
the R6gies of Rabat-Sale and Kenitra exceeded their targets considerably (52
and 153 percent respectively), the Regie of Casablanca completed only 52
percent of its program due to unsolved administrative difficulties concerning
the connection of rented houses and apartments to the distribution system.
The latter Regie is now executing a more important house connection program
financed under the Third Water Supply Project (Loan 2006-MOR). All three
R6gies benefitted from the house connection program by an increase in their
distribution networks, improved billing operations, procurement and service
levels which on the average grew from 60 to about 701 of the population.
6.09     Even though the program of social connections was successful in its
physical aspects, it was not in the financial sense, because of the following
reasons:
(a) connection costs charged to consumers were kept constant during
implementation whereas they increased (by an average of 52%)
because of inflation (37%), and because the "taxe de premier
etablissement" was higher (15) than expected; connection
charges should have been increased to match cost increases, and
(b) the fact that more than half of the cost of connections, which
was being financed with proceeds of the Bank loan, onlent to the
R6gies in US Dollar equivalents, was not considered in costing
the connections. Therefore, the Regies are absorbing part of
the foreign exchange risk implicit in the Bank loan. The Regies
have estimated this additional cost at about 921 of the original
estimates. However, at the time of appraisal, it was GOM's



-7 -
policy to absorb the foreign exchange risk of onlent amounts.
Later, GOM changed this policy and reflected this change in the
onlending to the regies.
7. Project Sustainablity
7.01     The sustainability of the institutional improvements should present
no problem as they are continuously updated and developed by ONEP and the
R6gies. ONEP and the Regies have the ability to maintain the installed
facilities satisfactorily and, where possible, expand them to meet increased
demand; therefore, provided that there continues to be adequate financial
resources available, there should be no difficulty in maintaining an
acceptable level of benefits throughout their economic life.
8. Bank Performance
8.01     During project preparation, preappraisal, appraisal and
implementation, the Bank continued the close assistance to ONEP developed
under the first water supply project. The Bank also developed close
relationships with the Hydraulic Administration and the Regies resulting in:
(i)    improving coordination amongst relevant water supply sector
institutions; and
(ii)    contributing to developing the water supply sector through
follow up loans 2006-MOR, 2820-MOR and 2825-MOR, including
assistance to all relevant sector institutions. The Bank played
a major role in the identification and preparation of ONEP's and
the Regies' investment programs during appraisal, although in
the case of the house connection program more attention should
have been paid to existing constraints.
8.02     The Bank's assistance during project implementation was instrumental
in:
(i)    achieving improved disbursement procedures;
(ii)    providing adequate financial support for constructing additional
production facilities needed for meeting increasing water
demand; and
(iii)    assisting ONEP to improve cost recovery by obtaining adequate
tariff increases.
8.03     The principal lessons from this project are:
(i)    water supply projects which Involve several institutions are
usually complex and require particularly careful preparation.
The Bank should insist on full preparation of project components
including detailed technical design, administrative,
organizational and financial aspects (para. 9.03);
(ii)    local payment and disbursement procedures are lengthy and
cumbersome in Morocco causing project delays at an increased
cost to the economy. The Bank should continue its actions at
central government level to further improve these procedures;



-8-
(iii)    the Bank should exercise more care in designing social
connection programs financed by the Bank and make their cost
more explicit to borrowers;
(iv)    improvements in operational efficiency can lead to substantial
savings in operating costs and charges to consumers;
(v)    the Bank should continue to be flexible, when needed, by
adapting financial covenants to changed circumstances, but then
be ready to take the difficult decisions needed to enforce them;
(vi)    in future projects, the Bank should examine the possibility of
financing the cost of consultants needed to carry out fixed
assets inventories, as was later done under Loan 2825-MOR; and
(vii)    in countries where the institutional set-up involves a national
company (ONEP) and regional companies (regies) the cost recovery
issue should be studied at the sectoral level since the
interdependence of national and regional companies make it
difficult to dissociate bulk from retail water costs; in light
of this lesson, under Loan 2825-MOR tariffs are being reviewed
at the national level.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     Project preparation studies and works' supervision were efficiently
carried out by ONEP's staff with the assistance of external consultants.
During the implementation of the project, ONEP developed efficient and well
managed divisions responsible for implementation, operation and maintenance of
the bulk water supply components in Agadir and the Mid-Atlantic Coast Region.
Project preparation carried out by the Regies was less satisfactory, because
certain aspects related to the implementation of the house connection program
were not studied in detail during project preparation.
9.02     However, the performance of the Regie of Rabat-Sal6 during
implementation was excellent. While the Regies of Casablanca and Kenitra only
achieved about 35% of the house connection program before the original loan
cloa4ng date, the R4gie of Rabat-Sale achieved about 95X.  The latter R6gie,
whi-h created a specialized unit for social house connections, continued its
exce_lent performance during the following years.
9.03     The Hydraulic Administration performed well in the execution of its
investigations for water resources but has not been able to avoid the
considerable delays in the implementation of its water resource masterplan
studies caused by lengthy approval procedures of study reports by a multitude
of relevant sector institutions. The second phase of these studies, which was
not completed under Loan 1724-MOR, is now being financed under Loan 2825-MOR.
All beneficiaries prepared progress reports timely and provided timely
appropriate information to the Bank on outstanding issues.
9.04     The principal lessons of experience are that:
(i)    creation in ONEP of efficient permanent divisions responsible
for construction and operation of simple and complex project
components has contributed to smooth project implementation;



- 9 -
(ii)    proper reporting and timely provision of adequate information to
interested parties improves the process of decision making;
(iii)    water resource studies are by nature complex and require the
input of many institutions in water supply, irrigation and
power. They can only be completed in a satisfactory way by
identifying relevant institutions at an early stage and by
creating a permanent coordination panel at a national level;
(iv)    the likelihood of obtaining adequate tariff revisions decreases
after Board approval of a loan as covenant enforcement calls for
difficult decisions and then increases with the added leverage
of upcoming loans and a strong stance of both the enterprise and
the Bank; and
(v)    the Bank staff should increase awareness of the existence of
vices, such as arrears, which extend beyond the confines of an
investment loan, and the Bank should address them at the
macro-level through sectoral or adjustment operations. The same
conclusion is valid for undertaking sector-wide studies which
imply the participation of several ministries, e.g. agriculture.
10. Project ReLatioDship
10.01    Over the full period of the loan until its closing on
December 31, 1987, the five loan beneficiaries and the Bank improved their
working relationship and their understanding of the constraints in project
implementation. This open working relationship was beneficial to the
achievement of the physical and institutional objectives of the project. The
Bank also provided assistance in the project preparation to the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), which financed the water main between Rabat and
Casablanca. However, after appraisal of this main by the KfW only incidental
contacts were maintained. The Bank's relations with other GOM authorities
were excellent at a personnel level; though the Bank did neither succeed to
convince the GOM to execute the sector organization study nor to improve local
payment procedures in the framework of the Loan. Apparently both issues,
which are related to national policies, could be better addressed by the Bank
at a national level through sectoral loans. The growing relationship between
ONEP and the Hydraulics Administration contributed greatly to the efficient
development and operation of available ground water resources which are more
economical for drink water supply than surface water resources. The relations
between ONEP and the Regies could be improved by eliminating disagreements on
the appropriate use of water resources managed by ONEP and by the Regies
themselves.
11. Consldtants, Contractors and Suppliers
11.01    Contractors, consultants and suppliers, both local and foreign,
generally performed well. Only two contractors did not complete the civil
works contracts; the uncompleted works were later executed by other
contractors. The design consultants were competent and carried out their
duties satisfactorily. Exercise of flexibility improved performance as:
(i)    during project implementation consultants for supervision
replaced staff upon the request of ONEP; and



- 10 -
(ii)    consultants 'in charge of the water resource masterplan studies,
appointed a resident assistant teamleader to assist in improving
internal coordination.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.01    On the basis of the appraisal report, the Bank concluded a loan
agreement with GOM and a project agreement with ONEP. The SAR included a
detailed technical description of each project component which was reflected
in the loan agreement. The documents did serve adequately during project
implementation. Loan amendments increasing the income levels for families
eligible for house connections, increasing disbursements under SAP and
modifying the project description were made. Some of these amendments could
have been avoided with a less detailed technical description of project
components. The staff appraisal report and loan documents provided a useful
framework for all relevant parties during project implementation.
12.02    The required data for preparation of the PCR were not always readily
available because of:
(i)    incomplete project correspondence files; and
(ii)    missing reports, progress reports and project data.
12.03    Completing files required unnecessary input (bank staff). Two water
supply loans (Loan 2006-MOR and 2825-MOR) which were concluded with the same
borrowers seem, besides the lack of filing discipline of Bank staff, to have
contributed to incorrect filing.

Borrower's comments
We confirm the adequacy and accuracy of the data presented in the
attached annexes to the PCR report. The analysis made by Bank staff in part
I of the PCR is based on factual information provided by the Moroccan
beneficiaries of the Loan 1724-MOR and gives no reason for special
comments. In addition to the Bank's participation in the financing of the
project components we would like to express our appreciation for: (i) the
Bank's flexibility in approving additional project components needed to
increase water-production in the Mid-Atlantic Area, (ii) insistance from the
Bank's side to prepare progress reports enabling our technical services to
improve project implementation and monitoring, (iii) assistance from the
Bank in preparing terms of reference and in evaluating study results; and
(iv) assistance from the Bank in achieving adequate financial results. We
appreciate also the effective dialogue with Bank missions in Morocco started
during implementation of Loan 1724-MOR on the development of the water
supply sector and would like to continue this dialogue during the
implementation of Loans 2006-MOR and 2825-MOR. We learned the following
relevant lessons for the future: (i) water resource studies are complex and
need intensive monitoring from all relevant parties, (ii) important
investments in water supply projects need to be implemented by qualified
personnel in special units, (iii) implementation planning of large water
supply projects should provide for unforeseen delays and project revisions,
(iv) adequate tariff revisions should be based on clear mid-term financial
projections, and (v) although the number of house connections and,
therefore, of the population served increased considerably thanks to the
project, an unforeseen financial cost to the regies resulted from this
program.

Comments:
Issues raised at different processing stages:
1.       (a)  Lack of preparation of some possible components; possibility
that KfW might finance one component.
(b)  Sector organization; payment arrears; deficient operation of
distribution systems; lack of Government sector policy;
unclear definition of components.



- 14 -
2.       (a) Deteriorated ONEP's financial situation; recommends Government
action before appraisal; unavailability of feasibility study for
Rabat-Casablanca extension.
(b) First Project Brief: uncertain timing of bome project
components; budgetary allocations of counterpart funds for the
fund for house connections, institutional framework and
onlending criteria to be agreed upon; creation of a regie in
Agadir to take over water supply distribution from ONEP.
(c) Unavailability of feasibility study for Rabat-Casablanca
extension; retroactive financing of Agadir water production
component; inappropriate area for stabilization ponds for
Agadir's sewage treatment; inclusion of responsibility for
sewerage in Agadir's regie being created; replacement of rate of
return by cash generation covenant; funIl for house connections:
areas to benefit, Bank local cost financing, lending terms,
financing of works.
3.       Amount of Bank financing; project scope; retroactive financing for
Agadir water production component; location of sewage treatment plant for
Agadir; sewerage tariffs; creation of Agadir regie; fund for house connection;
ONEP's arrears.
4.       Project scope; loan amount and cofinancing; advance contracting and
retroactive financing; organization; accounting; tariffs; arrears; fund for
financing house connections; use of local labor on force account.
Importantly, the Bank decided not to change the existing (loan 850-MOR) rate
of return covenant by a cash generation covenant formulated as a specific
percentage of gross fixed assets and work in progress "as it would not-
necessarily assure cost recovery".
