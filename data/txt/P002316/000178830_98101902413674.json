efforts for exploiting\n            its phosphate resources in the most promising direction. The\n            project would consist of three components: (i) processing\n            component to help establish the commercial scale viability\n            of upgrading the phosphate slimes currently rejected by CSPT\n            into feed material for ICS's phosphoric acid plant.\n            This component would be executed in two phases, with the\n            major second phase works to be carried out after the first\n            phase has confirmed their techno-economic justification;\n            (ii) mining/beneficiation component to help optimize the\n            long-term phosphate recovery of CSPT mining and\n            beneficiation operations, taking into account ICS's\n            future phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizer production\n            capacity; and (iii) planning component to help define an\n            overall integrated long-term development plan for exploiting\n            Senegal's phosphate resources."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
