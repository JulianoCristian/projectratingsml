{"cdata!": "The Arab Potash project is the largest\n            industrial project ever undertaken in Jordan and upon its\n            completion would help diversify the Jordanian economy as\n            well as develop one of the country's few natural\n            resources. The project is aimed at producing 1.2 million\n            tons per year of potash drawn from the Dead Sea via solar\n            evaporation. The project might also produce potash\n            derivatives such as compacted potash and potassium sulphate\n            if the marketing study to be completed by March, 1979\n            confirms their financial viability. The major components of\n            the project include: (i) a solar evaporation and brine\n            transfer system to concentrate the Dead Sea brine and\n            transfer it between carnallite pans; (ii) a harvesting\n            system for dredging and transporting the solids precipitated\n            in the pans; (iii) a refinery to produce fertilizer grade\n            potash; (iv) utility facilities consisting of power,\n            telecommunications, and water supply and sewerage system;\n            and (v) an associated township."}, "docdt": "1978-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
