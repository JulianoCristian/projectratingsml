I   Ilroject Sturvey
1. General features of Project Area
I Iuaigqiao reservoir area lies in the valley sectioni of Liangsluiljing ,which is in
the mliddle part of Caochang River, a first class branch in thie west slope at tile lower
reacli ofAnninig River. The area situates at tlie juLnctioin of Illuangqiao Village and Jie
Village of I-lengshiani Townsiip, includinig Group- One, Group Two and Group Three
of lluanigqiao Village and Group One of Jie Village. It is 16kimi from Miyi County and
the 1ransportation condition is convenlienit. Thie area is a warm  and moist medium
miounitainious ecological economy zone of agricUlIture, forestry and livestock with
average altitude 1 ,500 to 2,000.  Tlhere are maniy mountains in tihe area and thie
topography is various. The farmiilanid relatively concentrate among basins, tablelands
and valleys of the mountains. The miaini sort of soil is red eartih and yellow red earthi.
Thl e climate of the area is warm and moist, somiietimes has ice and frost. The annlual
average temperature is 17.6-14 Centigrade. The accumulated tempcrature greater than
10 Centigra(le is 5,580-4,290 Cenitigrade.  The aninual average sunshiine is 2,217-
1,955 hours. The percent of sunshiine is 50%. Thlie annual total suln radiationi is 140.5-
137 Kilo-calorie / cni'. The period withiout fiost is 282-237 days. Thie anniual average
precipitationl is 1,123-1,353.9 rmin anid the Drynless is 0.74. The vegetative cover of the
area is secondary forest vegetation, mainly is thieropenicedrymion. The forest-cover-ed
rate is 48.1%. In 1996, there are 2 villages, 4 groups, 171 hiouseholds, 632 people,
605.47mii farmland and 0.96mu per capita in the area. The main product is rice, wlheat,
corn and sugar cane. The area is a 'planting and economic" structure and product
ripens twice a year or thiree times every two years. It is a typical transitioni from
traditional agriculture to modern agriculture and tile scientific level of planting and
raisinig is not high. The average foodstuff per capita is 455 kg and net incolmle per
capita is Y 885.13. The area is a poor area depenidinig solely on planting agriculture
because of higih mountains, shiarp slopes, low water temperature, large amoulit of
barren lands and scanty of agricultural resouices.
Iluiangqiao reservoir irrigation area lies in the west slope of Anning Rivers "U'-
shiaped wide valley, wiiich is at thle mididle part of thie Miyi county, including five
towns (townslhips): Caochang, Slhaba, Guabang, Panilian, Salian, 14 villages and 86
grouips. It is 0-14 km away from Miyi County and tihe traffic conditioln is very good
witlh a developing road network. The area is a lIot and dry ecological economy zone of
agriculture, forest and grazing witli !ow mounitains and valleys and average altitilude
1 ,100 to 1,500m. It is flat in the area. Thl-ere are paternoster lake basins along thie river.
Thlie valley step land and low-mountain land successively are the main arable part of
the Anniiing River Valley. The miaini sor t of soil is alluvial eartl, crimiisorn eartht and red
earth. [The area hias a 'island-like' Sotihli Asiza tropical based lhot and dry cubic climiate
of river valley aind lias little snow and fog, It is very lhot and dry froin March to May,
tile temnperature difference between spriing and winiter is great. The aininal temilperature
is 20.5-17.6 Centigrade. Thle accumlulated temiperature greater tihan 10 Centigrade is
7200-5580 Centigrade. The annual sunisiniile is 2,412-2,217 hours. The pericent of



sunisline is 55-50%. The anntial stiu radiation is 140.5 Kilo-calorie/!cn2 . 'I'lTe period
witliout f[ost is 3 16-282 days. The anniual average precipitationi is 947.9-1,123 1mmt1.
Thle dryness is 1.02. The vegetative cover of the area is sparse buslh wood slope,
muainly is South Asia tropical grass anid wood. The forest-covered rate is 28.5%. In
1996, there are 5 towns, 14 villages, 86 groups, 4306 houselholds, 16,791 people,
18,483nu farliand and I. IOmu per capita in the area. The main product is rice, corn,
vegetable and sugar cane Etc. The area is a 'planting, economilic andc raising" structure,
product ripens five times every two years or three times a year. It is a typical tr-ansition
from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture and the scientific level of planting
and raising is ratlher lhigh. The average foodsttiff per capita is 479 kg and net income
per capita is Y  1,236.61. There are a lot of agricultural resources in the area,
including 1,22011a (18,300n.u) waste lanids Nvaitinig for exploiting. Thie area is far
from forest and water and lias a big conitraictioni betweeni lheat and water. It is a "good
land" wlhichi will be turned into an oasis if water comes.
2. Main chiaracteristics of Project
lIluangqiao reservoir project is a project exploiting Aimninlg River agricultural
resources using Thle World Bank's loan in Siclhuan. ;It is a reputable project whiichi
"lhelps the poor, imiproves the environlilienit, props tihe valley, leads thie mounitain area,
roots in the soil, guides withi water, exploits resources and creates wealthi". T1he key
project is the clay heart-wall slhaped earthi and stone damn. The cdami is 68.3m hiilgII,
3 19mi long. The top dami is 1,563.3in Ihighi. Thle collecting-water area is 462 Kill2 anid
thie effective reservoir volume is 17,000,000 ol], wlicih is 90% of tile current retain
water project. There are some additional canal system  projects: The notLlh arterial
caninel is 18.82kmii, ten branchi canals are 22.21kml long, Tail ditchi is 8.3kmii; T'lie southi
arterial canal is 17.58km, ten branichi canals are 22.7kimi long, Tail ditchi is 7.2kml. T'he
arterial canal is 0.6-0.9mn wide in the bottom and 1.8-3m wide on [lhe top, tlle flow of
the canal systetin is 1.4-0.2 in' Is. Along the canial systemil is hot and dry grass slope
xvithi river valleys and low niountainis. In the construction of the canal systemll, we will
niot damage forests and occupy farniland. IL will onily occuLpy 6mu farmland and 22111U
waste lanid durinig dam conistruction temiiporarily, wlhich is included in the budget of
the IIuangqiao  reservoir project; It wilt occupy 36mnu waste land duL-ilng tile
constructioni of the canal system  temiporarily, wlhichi is not counted  in tihe
compensation because it is state owned. When the project has donie, we can irrigate
2680 .Ila  (40,200mii) Land, including curieint farmialand  1,460 IIa (21,900111u),
exploit waste land  1220.4 Ila (I 8,30611u) , wlhichl is 29%  of tihe county's total
farmilanid, and occupy 95%  of the ctirrent irrigating area . At the same time, we can
prrovicde the couLnty 3,500,000 in' water ancl 3,550,000 Kvhi electiicity. In tile project,
we will subnieige farniland 605.47111LI andc migrate 171 lhouselholds and 632 people. It
is a mlidcdle type water conservancy and wli(c fulel constrUctive andl exploitilng migrate
project withi the main purpose to irrigate agricultural land and the subsidiary ptirpose
to provide water andi electiicity to thie COUIlty.

are many valleys, hligih mountainis anid sharp slopes in it. The plantinig resources in it
are very scant. The people influeniced by the prioject are all agricultural people and can
only do agricultural jobs. The migratory project will make 632 peasants, whio depend
on land, lost their traditional solidl living basis and migrate involulitarily.. The
exploiting migratory program, whicih settles people in othier areas, can improve
enivironment, exchanige laiid withi land, recover lives, develop manufacture and
reconstruct lhome tlhroughi coordinatinig land, exploiting land and combininig lanid withi
water.

2. Consultationi of the plan
The implementLilng plall of I lIUangqiao reservoir sub-project RAP is essentially the
dialectical unity of breaking and establishiing. The project will necessarily bring new
pr-oblems caused by the sudden changes of social economy and environimiient. The
forimer productive system is destroyed and valuable property and souice of incomiie is
lost. tlhe. resettlers lose their former bases of living and are settled down a unfamiliar
environimient. the must rebuild the houses, and the chaniges in using of resources,
relationishiips  between  neighbors,  living  hiabits,  productive  skills,  cultul-al
characteristics and social service will inevitably cause puzzlemelit, ilicolherence,
unifititess and dissatisfaction. In order to imiplemilent thle resettlement smiootlily and
make tihe farmers move out fromii tilC project area willingly, we will (lo OuI best to
condtict propaganida and motivationi. We will let the fariliers know clearly the whiole
pr-ocedlule and the preferentiall policies, incluclilg preparation, choice of RAP, check
of submibesioin, resettlement area, benefits of the p'roject, raise of funcs, compensation
of submersion, simultaneous farming in the two areas, resettleiient , rebuildilig of
hiouses, restoration of productioni and steady developimienit. Withi the cooperation of the
resettlers andl the farners in the resettlemiielit area an(d the support of the cadres from
the county, towils, villages an(l villager groulps and the farmers' associates, we will
achiieve the goal of Ilmovinig otit willingly andc settled dowIl satisfactorily.
3. Preparationi of thie plan
The  RAP  is a  foundilig  blueplrillt of constructillg  reservoir, imiprovinig
enviroiment, stireigthieninig instia stILuctuie and bringinig benefit to [lie peopile. hle
project is thle basis, benefit is focal point, resettlellemiet is tlhe center and thie key point.
Under thie principle of considlerationi for the couLitry, collectives and individuals, we
will combine the resettlement and thle constr-uction of local economiiy organically. We
will ftilly develop the constr-uctionl of grain, sugarcane and vegetable bases and
cultivate various kinds of resouirces to support the productionl of the resettlers,
guarantee thieir living standardc and ability to obtain weathli. According to the practical
conditions in Miyi county andl the experience obtained in the resettlemenit of Ertan
llydrauilic Power station, based on the priniciples of 'tliose whio benefit fromil thle
project should shoulder the resettlemilenit' and 'moving out smoothily, settling dowIl
steadily ancd gettinig ricih quickly', we will adopt the scatterinlg miethiod to settle the
resettlers. Thle 632 resettlers will settle down in Caochang town ( 3000 persons ), Saba'
towIn ( 150 ), Guabang townI ( 50 ), Ianliani towni ( 82 ) and Salian towIl ( 50 ). See

l. Invesligationi ofsocial economiiy
lluanigqiao reservoir area is a warin and mioist mounitaini ecological economny zone
of agriculture, forest and grazing, incinic]ilig Group Two and GrouLp Four of Ilengslhan
T'ownshiip. Now tLhere are 632 people ( See the annex-7 ), 321 labor people, 605.47mu
farmifland, 0.96111u average farmllanld pcI capita, 1.89iniu average farmland per labor
personi. From  the current managcmcilt situation of the farmland, non-farmiland and
courityard ecological economy systeml, we can analyze thlat it adopt a tranisicilt
Ilmaniagemiet Illode fromIi tr-aditionial agriCUltLue to iimoderii agriculture and has olnly
traditional management technology. In 1996, the average foodsturf per peasant is 455
kg, inicomc per capita is Y  1788. In tlie income, thie farliiand "planting, economy,
raisinig" structlue is aboult 79:1 7:4. I'lie replant inedex is 143.44%. The incomiie is Y
870.76, occupying 48.70%. Thie non-farim1lanMd "forest, f-uit, grazing" Strluctul-e is about
21:23:56. T'lie income is Y 268.02, occupyin1g 14.99%. Thle Courtyarcl "planlilig,

counity, townshiip, village, grouip and  rural popularization  science network  has
developed into some extent. Togethier withi silkworiii association, fruit association and
vegetable associationi's model fuinictioni, it is come into being a social serve system
which is comnbined of plantinig, raising and manufacturing, producinlg, providing and
selling, agriculture, industry ancd comiiicr-ce  Tlle system  widenis the resettlers'
employmilenit range and increases the employment opportutnities. Wlhen resettlers miove
froml reservoir area into irrigatinig area, they can develop manufacture, improve
economily, increase incomile and better living coniditioni thioughi social serves. All these
are due to imprt-ovemilenit of social serve conditioni, particular the expansioni and
popularization of irrigatinig area people's advanced planting, raising, malnufacturilIg
and serving techiniques and treatment ofscientific techiniques as the First prodLuctivity.

4. Organiizing
In the period ofresettlemenit, we must concentrate on the term responsibilities anid
object management of the leaders of the conlty, townshiips, villages and groups on
one hand, anid concentrate on the rur al leciihnique expaliding system  and rural
popularizaLioni science  network  on  the othier. Tlhroughi consultiig, executing,
moniitorinig and bringing the functionis of demliocratic decision and scientific decision
into play, we can make the exploitinig resettlement project run scientifically anid
orderly by combiniation of administrative funictioni and tecliiical power.
5. PuLblic participation
The first is participation in investigation of submerged objects. In the Jan. and
Feb. of 1996, uL(ler the preside of Miyi Coutnty Ilydra-Power Generation Bureau and
Sichuan  Water Conservancy andl Hlydra-Power Generation Institute, leaders of
subilmerged Ilengslian Townslipn's Townships, villages andc groups, delegates of
peasants and  leaders of Caochiang  Towinslhip  investigated  and  registered  the
subimieiged objects of Iluangqiao Reservoir on spotrnmeticulously. The result was
accepted b) peasants, villages and townsliips officially. People said:' We believe the
result is accuLate".
Thie second is participationi in chioosing resettleimenit area. F-roml May 1996 to Oct.
1997, Miyi Counity's People Governmiient conveened II meetinigs witli leaders of
reservoir area an(d irrigatinig  area, resettlers of stiuiberged  area, residents of
resettilemient area, governmenit's functional departments and non-governmenit people's
organizations respectively. We adopted milichi advice on tlhe chioice of resettlemenit
area and forined some good resettlemiienit noriims. We successfully scattered 632
resettlers inlo 5 townshiips, 14 villages and 86 grotips. All resettlers said:" The
Iluanigqiao Project makes our life better and better."
IThle tlhirdl is participationi in reguilatinig resettlement lands. In the July anid Aug. of
1997, 171 lhouselhold owners of subiber-ged area regulated landis with leadlers andl
miasses oni spot in the correspilondent resettlemiienit area. hliey all gained the saime
llantity and quality lands as those of otller people in the area. Thle niew comers and
oldc onies enilanced their unity andc confidence thiroughi discussinig. All the leaders ancd
masses are satisfied.
'1Te last is participation in setting key projects. From Apr. to Oct. 1997, tlirouig
identifiFcation, preparationi and pre-evalaItionll of the project of makinig uise of Worldl
B1ank's funids to exploit Aiming River's agricultural resources, Miyi CouLnty's World
Bank Agent made a decision. Thfe decisioni was tliaL the agent signed a land(
exploitation contract with the resettlers' resettleinenit townisilips ini orcder to exert
I tianglqiao Reservoir's irrigatinig piofit fully, settle migratory considerately andc
inicrease resettlers' incomiie effectively. It guiaraniteed that we coulld finislh the

VI. Resettleiieiit
I. Choice of sulbmersion plan
tirst, backward arrangement plan: There is a populationi of 739, land of 709m1u,
i.e. 0.96mu per capita in the requisition area. After the requisitioni of land, 605.47mu,
there will be only 103.53mu left, wlhich can onily be used by 107 persons wlho need not
iiiigrate. Thiere is a population of 4,100 in leiengslhan town in wllich tihe IIuanlgqiao
reservoir is located. And there is land of 3,861 mu, i.e. 0.94mu per capita. After tlhe
recluisition of land, there is only 0.74nmu ;per capita. The land is lheavily loaded.
Besides the area is surrounded by hills and thlere are valleys andc gap. farminig is
limited. So there is no possibility of backward arrangement plan.
12



Second, concentrating arrangement plan: Althiouglh tlhere are valley steps whichi
can be used, the altitude is high and tlhe water level is too low to reach anid thie land is
dry and soil erosion is serious. There is no forests above to reserve water and
irrigatinig system beneatlh to provide wvater, so it can not be cultivated in a large scale
and cannot be used as a concentratinig resettlemenit area.
Th1ird, spreading arrangenment plan: Thle irrigated area of Iluallgqiao reservoir is in
the center of the county. It lhas climate resources ard is riclh in landl resources, Whlen
the project is comnpleted, muchi land will be cullivate-l witlh the water supplied by thle
reservoir. This area lhas favorable conditionis for spreading resettlement. Learninig
experienices and lessons from the resettlemiienit of Ertan Ilydrogen Power Station, we
will adopt thle spreadinig arrangement plan. It is favorable for the adminiistration of thle
resettlers and the slhare of thie benefts of thie project. It will solve thie problemii of
resettlemeneit and will save the cost.
After turns of consultation, we make out thle two main principles: First, those wlho
benefit from  the project will shar-e the resettlemenit. Second, we slhould make tlle
people migrate snmootlhly and settle downv  steadily and become riclh quickly. The
resettlers will be settled in Caoclang, Sliaba, Salian, Panliani andc Guabang, tile five
lownls whlo benefit from  the project.
2. Capacity of resettlement area
Thlere are unique climate resouLces and riclh land resources in the five towIIs.
Thiere is 1 ,22011a, wasteland wlhiclh can be used, incluiding a roughlly cultivated are of
73311a. and non-cultivated area of 487ha.. It is located in the belly belt of thie counlty
and is part of the farming area of Aiming valley. The output of the landi is higl,
1, I 00kg/mu [or grains, 7,500kg/mu for sugar canes, and 2,000kg/mu for vegetables in
the off seasons. The economic efficicelcy is also hiigh, witlh the inpult-outpult ratio of
1:1.86 for grains, 1:2.24 for sugar canes, 1: 3.04 for vegetables and 1: 3.27 for fruits.
Its agricultule is very competitive: vegetables go on thie market two or tlhree mionitlhs in
advance in spring; fiuits ripe over a monitli in advance; it is fiee from the affect of
typlhoon and plum rains and is suiperior to Guanlgdollg, Guangxi andc lainani provinces;
it is the state export base of silkwormi cocoolls; transportationi is very convenient and
thle market is wide. The railway fiom Chengdui to Kunming runs tlhough thlis alea ancd
it also has complex hiiglhways, withi a dlenisity of 75.5km/I 00 kml2 . Its vegetables, fruits,
suigar and silkworm  cocoons sell good in the doomesfic market as well as in Pauxi
regiou and also sell abroad. Before thie resettlemnent there is an agricultural population
of 16, 791. There is land of 18,483mlt, i.e. L.lniu per capita. Thlere is land of 662.2mu
to be used for thie resettlemenit and 632 resettlers can settle down hiere, including:
271iiu, 300 resettlers and 0.9mu per capita in Caochang; 192.6mu, 150 resettlers and
1.28mu per capita in Shaba; 68.5mnu, 50 resettlers and 1.37mu per capita in Guabang;
87mu, 82 resettlers and 1.06mu per capita in Panilian; and 43.liu, 50 resettlers andl
0.86mu per capita in Salian. Thle 632 resettlers from 171 families will be settled down
in 86 villager groups. Thiere will be two famiilies, seven to eiglht persons, to be settlecd
down for each villager group in average. DUring the resettlenmenit, there is an
13



agiicultmral  population  of 17,123  in  [lie  iesettliciicit anea  and  there  is land  of

4. Preferential policies
hI order to make the resettlers reacih or exceed their previous living standlard in
thiree years, we specially made thie following preferential policies: a. The farmers are
free from  the agricultural tax and thle Fix quota of purchiasing of grains; b. The
enterprises of the resettlers is free fiotn sonie of thie taxes; c. The resettlers have
priority of qualified seeds, clhemistry fertilizer, farm chemicals anid agrictiltural film,
etc.; d. The county, towns, villages and villager groups sliould solve tile problems in
prodILction and living of the resettlers fir-st; e. The reservoir will be responisible for the
aid for the resettlers for tenl years; f. Thle COunty, towns, villages and villager groups
shiould focus on development of resources, techinology, commodity, anid imarket anid
guarantee the steady development of tlieir economily.
5. Clianniels of loans
TIlie resettlement area and its small encierlrises get Tiheir Financial support from: a.
Fiiianicial support from  thle governimeit, includinig grant-in-aid  for small water
coniservancy projects, relief for Alood and calamiities, andl loanis for agricultural
development and construction of comimillodity bases; b. We will use the profit fiom
in(lustr-y to support. Miyi Joint Stock Limiited Sugar Compally will provide a
discouinted loan to tihe farmers to develop sugar cane base. Thley will also Llte sugar
canes at decent price. They will provide the imoniey used in mulchinig and producing
imiproved varies. The resettlement area will raise funds on the principle of self-
reliance withi the aid from the country. They will take full advantages of loans, grant-
in-aid and self-raised fuLids.
6. Developmenit of wasteland
Excluiding the hlousinig land, all tihc wastelanid resources in thie resettleilemit area
slhould be developed on the bases of reasoniable developmeit, balance of the ecology
and imnprovement of environmenit and comiprelhensive benefits. The projects of
wastelanid developmenit shiould be set tip, denionstratedrratified and put into contracts
legally and fairly. Thie farmers can develop the wasteland in units of famiilies, family
groups, collectives and unionis. The farm1lanid they cultivated  is of collective
ownerslhip. It slhould be registered in differenit categories and operated by every
h1ouseliold. It shiould be recorded in cadaster antd is protected by the law. It can also be
traisferred and inlierited. Our policy is that those wlho develop it will operate it and
benefit from it in thie fixed fifty years. 1,220.41ha. step wastelanid will be developed
witlh a total investment of Y  19,893,000 antd it hias been listed in thie stigar cane
project. Among the investment, Y  9,893,000 is thie loan from  thle World Bank,
anIlounting to 62%  of thie total; domestic set Y  9,132,000, 48%  ( includinig a self-
15



raised fuiind of Y 4,510,000, 23.74%).
7. Construction of commodity bases
Wheln Iluangqiao reservoir is completed, water conditions of tihe area will be
greatly improved. It will provide irrigating water for the existing farmiland of 1,4601ia.
and wastelanid of I,220hia. whiicih will be developed soon. Ancd the total irrigated area
is 2,680lha.. Lands wlicil have suffered froml [hle drouglits will become oases and the
virgin land will be cultivated. The projcct will greatly improve tile ecological
environment and change the southi Asian tropical dry heat ecosystem  from  vicious
circle of asynchronious water and lheat into beniigin circle of synclhronous water and
lheat. The potentials of light, heat, climate ancd soil in the whiole area will be exerted
more efficiently. The planting area will reachi 4,826ha.: Rice, 96611a.; wlheat, 358ha.;
489.4hla.; corn, 489.4ha.; side crops, 105.2ha.; sugarcanes, 1,322.3ha.; vegetables,
1,47111a.; green fertilizer, 61.lha.; ancd otlher crops, 53.5ha.. multiple cropping index is
180.07%. The planting area of sugarcanes is 33.06%  of the total of the county;
vegetables, 33.95%; grains, 16.1%. Witlh the ir-ritatinlg benlefit of the reservoir, the
outlpult of grains will be increased by 6, 663,000kg.. The output of sugarcanies will be
increased  by  103,855,000kg. TIhe output of vegetables will be increased  by
39,443,300kg and tile output of mulberry leaves for silkworms will be increasedl by
788,800kg. The total benefit fiom1 the reservoir is Y   9,030,100 ( grains, Y
12,102,800; sugarcanes, Y 25,963,800; vegetables, 43,391,000; silkworm  cocoonIs,
Y  7,572,500 ). The developmenit of all these aspects will not only create coliditiolis
for the resettlemenit, but also set a solid base for tihe productionl and the development
of economiiy of the wlhole counlty.
8. Teclhniical training
Learning from the successful pattein of compr-elhenisive agriculture developmienlt,
the teclhilical traiiniiog of the farmers in the project area should be strengtlhened. First,
we slhould popularize the intensive farming to double the benefit and set up a
ecological economic system. We should coicentiate on the constructioni of tile base of
grainis, sugarcanies, vegetables and forage, and improve the plantinig patterns of corn-
rice, wheal-r ice, vegetable-corn-rice, vegetalble-rice and sugarcaizes-rice to formi a
variety of planting structure. T'his will deepen thie agrictilture development. Second,
we shoUld set up and popularize the developmlent of the land which is not suitable to
be culliivated and put our emphasis oni thie construction of silkworm  breedinig base,
frUit base and animal breeding base. We will constantly complete and improve the
breeding patternis offrui:-forage, fiulli-vegetable, reservoir-ponld andfishlponcl to form
various uses of resources. This will wicden the development of the agriculture. Third,
we will set up and popularize multiple couLtyar-d economy to recycle the resources.
We will complete and improve planting, breedinig, processing and service industries to
foriml thie courtyard productioni structure of one major industrial ancd various othier
industries. By thlis, it is requested that eveiy farmer master at least two or tilree
16



practical  skills.  Women  should  especially  master  tile  skills  of courtyard
comprehensive development, sucIh as plaiintig, breeding, processing and service and
Make full use of tihe ha f sky. Thie traininlg program is arranged before thie resettlemenlt.
We will gathier the 321 resettlers at the reservoir area and do the systematic trainiing
for five to seven days. 1Thie expeits fi-omil fihe c'ounty will teachi tlhem  free of charge.
After thle resetilemetit, we will practically implemient the planiled developmental
projects and let the farmers learn fromi the local exaniples. They will also teacil one
anotlher and learn from  one anothier. The fanrers' ciltural quality will also be
imiiproved.
9. Public service
In order to guarantee that the farniers miigr-ale smootlly, settle down steadily and
becomiie ricih quickly, the county governimlenit decided to serve tlhe resettlers specially
for teni years. T'lhe work for the resettlemilenit of the resettlers will be listed in the
clhecking on the cadres atnld is listedl in thc comipetition in all social service trades.
Thley will provide good service [or (lte resettlels before production, during productioln
anid after productioni. Before prodluctioni tlhe resettlers shiould be miotivated and trained
in timie. The preparation of funds and materials shiould be in time and the task should
be implemented in time. During th[e productioll, we will manage in detail. The
teciihnology and product must be qualified. We must try to produce highly efficiently
witlh low input. After tlhree production, the comimizodities shiould be clhecked carefully
anid wrapped and boxed well. We will try to develop a good market and smoothi
transmission channels and benefit well. Thlere are onily two poor famlilies ( ten people ).
The cadres fiom the towIn, village and villager group will help tliem specially and the
techinological example family will give thlcimi special help also. Thiey will be supported
in productioni and living as well.
10. Forecast of the resettlers' income
In 1995, (le farmers in the reservoir area have a grain ration of 459kg per capita and
have a net income of Y 770.4 per capita. The farmers in tlie irrigated area liave a
grain ration of 466kg, and have a net incomue of Y  1, 107 per capita. Thle forecast of
the annual income will be: by 1998, T'le resettlers will liave a grain ration of 470kg
and have a net income of Y  1, 100 per capita; and for tlieTfarmers in thie irrigated area,
480kg atid Y  1,400; by 2002, tle reservoir project is cotimpleted, and the farmers in
the project area will have a grailm rationi of 480kg and hiave a niet income of Y  1,800;
by 2010, the enviroinienit of tihe project area will be greatly improve and thie
productioll will be promoted. Thie farmers will liave a grain ration of 500kg anid a net
inicomie of Y 2,500.
VII. Estimatc of t}ie cost
1 7



1. Subimiersion cosL
The basic principle of the estimating of the submersion management is the fuill
price evaluation of the loss. Accordinig to the forecast, the total cost is Y 12,037,500
(See the aniex-3 )
2. AninLual investment plan
Accordinig to the advance of I luanigqiao reservoir project, the total investment of
Y  12,037,500 will be invested in three years: in 1998, Y  4,888,600, 40.6 1% of lihe
total; in 1999, Y 6,539,800, 54.32% of the total; in 2000, Y 609,100, 5.07% of the
total (See the annex- 4).
3. Authiorization of expenses
Thle expenses of the resettlemelit shouldl be based oln the principle of well
planiinig, reporting and ratifying, and slharing of responsibility in different levels and
domiiiating. The Financial righit of the rescttlemiienit should be transferred to the basic
level and Thie total compensation of Y  9,735,000 sihodild be put in the chiarge of the
towins of the submerged area and the resettlemilenit area separately. It includes cost of
rebuildiing of the special facilities of Y  96,000, cost of cleaninig the reservoir bottom
of Y  59,500, cost of compensationi of productive and living facilities in thle reservoir
of Y  378,000, cost of techniological training of Y  50,000, cost of acquisitioln
management of Y  50,000, cost of external supervision of Y  98,400, cost of
planning and designing of Y  295,000, cost of implementinig and managemenlt of
295,000 and cost of basic preparationi of Y 984, 100 ( See thie aniex-9)
4. Finanicial counting and auditing
The funds of the resettlement is conitolled tinder strict COUnltilng and auditing
systeils. Any expense shiould be reported in detail to the tipper level according to the
related finianicial rules. Any reimbursemiient should be proved to be necessar-y for the
project. Any expense shiould be reimbuised on the condition that it hias been examilled
by both the administralive department and the auditing department.

X. Extcrmial sui)CIevision
I. Supervision of resettleiient
Tlle first is tile internal examination of thie processing of thie project, and thle
seco(icl is tihe sulpervisioni of civil unlionis and associations. The initerinal examiination:
Ielic accuratenless of tihe iniformationi slhouldl be guaranteed by the internal examiniation
organs and the managers of the project sIhould be provided withi an early alarm
informiiationi system  tlhoughg  materials of thie project's imlplemenitinig an(d advancing
reports. Thlie supervision of civil unionis and associations: It is to set up a chiannel for
the resettler-s to express their wills ancd reflect tiheir desires anid demanlds. It will
provide a dynarnic civil inforimiationi systeml. Thle two inforiimation systemils will serve
the imiplemilentinig of the plan jointily.
2. FIorIm1 of supervision report
Siupervisioni reports are a part of the roLItinie reports of the impleimentilig reports
of the resettlemenit and they are the latesl reeports of tile advancing of tile project. Thlie
reports shiould be sent up to thle coun-ty, city and province project offices regularly.
DuL-ilng the construction of the reservoir and the source of resettlement, tiley sIould be
sent up every lialf year. WYhen the reservoir is com1pleted, thiey shiould be sent up one
timiie a year. Forms and words shiould be organically combined in the repoits.
3. Righits of thie supervision organizationis
Ihle initernal stipervision is condticted tlirougil tile mianiagemiienit offices of the
coiinty, city and the province and thie towns, villages and villager groLlps. 'Thus a
goveriinmenit supervisioni system  is forimieed. Thle people in tihe project area and some
non-governmiilenit organizations will take part il thle supervisioni and form a wide civil
stupervisioni system. Tihe two supervision systeims will fully exert the super-visioil
rights of thie governmenis and the people.
4. Rules of the supervision organizationis
22



The supervision organizations are a part of the management system of tlIe project.
Anid thie double supervision of internal supervision and civil supervision will be used.
The first is the internal supervision: setting up project management offices at province,
city and county levels and reporting the internal supervision conditions to tlleni. These
offices have the riglht to ask the junior supervision organs to give thie latest report or
report more frequently. The internial superyis;    will examinie the submersion
verification, material qui, submersion I andhin; .esettlement; restoration of living
and continuous development. Thie second is external supervision. It is based on the
noni-government civil organizations and  will report the implementinig  of thle
resettlemenlt genuinely. It will especially help to guarantee the protection of property,
the legal riglts, the resettlers' expression of demands and just solution of the
problems.
XI. Exter-nal suypervision
Outline of the Supervision and Evaluation
of IIuaitgqino Reservoir Resettlement
T he main task of Miyi county Iluang(qiao reservoir project is to solve the problem
of irrigation and water supply in the lower steam area and to generate electricity.
It will only submerge 1, 11 imu of lanid, incltudinig: 605mu of farmlanld, 463nmu
wasteland and 43mu of lhousing land. 171 families, 632 persons slhould move out.
Accordinig to the resettlement plan, the 632 persons will be scattered and settled
down in other places. they will move to the villages and villager groups whlich) benefit
from the project. The compensationi anid the regulated land will guarantee and improve
the resettlers' productive and living standardl steadily.
This is a sub-project of the Anninig valley agriculture developmnent project
supported by World Banik loans. According to the World Bank's demands fiom policy
consideration, we must bring thle involun1tary resettlement under a certain supervision
system  to check and evaluate the whole process of resettlement, rebuilding and
chaniges in incomne and welfare facilities.
The State Power Ministry Chiengdu Exploration and Design Researchi Institute
will undertake the task of supervisioni ancd evaluation. It is one of the country's large
institute and is of first class. Ertan hydraulic power station is designied by this institute
and the project is of world level both in scale and degrees of difficulty.

The supervisioin and evaluationi is aimiied at informing World Banik anid the
resettlemnent department the situations of productioni and living durilng and after the
resettlemiient in time, so that thie problems will be properly solved. So the maill work
contents are:
4.2.1. Setting up files for tlle resettlenmenit families
Thle resettlemenit evaluation slhould first clhooses some typical families as its
samples and set up resettlers cards for tlhemll to get information about their conditions
before and after the resettlemelt. Meaimwvile, it sliould set up original files for the
resettlers and after the resettlement, makes analyses, evaluation and sample survey.
And thie number of the samples slhould not be less thlan 20% of the total resettlers and
the average diffusion of highi income famiilies, iiddle income families and low
incomiie families slhould be considere(l. An(i the weak families slhould have a decent
proportioni in the samples. All the samiple information will be input into the computers
to set up a data lhandling system.
4.2.2. Setting up an investigationi networ-k
In order to obtain the information about the resettlement during the whole process,
thie owner unit, evaluation uniit and implementing unit should seek unity of tlhinking
and cooperate to set up county level, town level, village level and villager group level
suipervision teams. And thiey should invite investigators to carry out survey of general
trenid.
4.2.3. Traininig investigators
In order to promote the business quality, the investigators slhould be tLained
according to the contents and targets of the investigation. We plan to carry out the first

4.3. Evaluation contents
The evaluation is to hanidle the supelrvision data of the former stage and analyze
and summarize it. The evaluation shiould be centered on the clhosen welfare targets
and the evaluation work is mainly performed quantitatively and qualitatively. And the
nmaini targets are:
1) Social economic conditions: development of family economy before and after
thie resettlement, including household productive materials, living materials, property
and inicome.
2) Public health: the liealtlhy facilities in the resettlement area, lhealthy worlkers,
the incidence of epidemic diseases, infant iior-tality and the chiidreni's healthy
conditions, etc..
3) Education resources: the resettlemenit of schools, the enrollment ratio and
education quality, etc..
4) Women's social status: womleni's employment rate, women's participation in
pulblic and community affairs, basic level adminiistration.
5) Employment and developmenit: to evaluate the conditionis of hielping the
various families, especially the poverty-strike families. Thirouglh the analysis and
evaluation of the above-mentioned targets, we will know the existing problems in the
resettlement and development of the resettlers at the stage. And thle supervision and
25



evaluation report should be composed and raised to the leading groups.
4.4. Frequency and tinme arrangemlent of supervision and evaluation
The resettlement period of tiuatigqiao reservoir project is two years. We plan to
set up the investigation network and inivite investigators and perform tlle training
programii before the project is started. The external supervision and evaluation unit,
Sichuan Province HIydraulic power and Water Conservancy Research Institute will
appoint senior and semi-senior specialists to do the job on the spot in the first year of
thie project. The second supervision and evaluation will be conducted in the second
year of thie project period. Afterwards, the supervision and evaluation will contillue,
for the resettlers need a period of transition to adjust and settle down. And the new
land will not be ripe enough until after thiree years. Thus thie supervisioli and
evaluation will be conducted once a year. The whole process will last for four years,
five timiies. Every time, the supervision ancd evaluation report should be raised to the
related departments of World Bank.
XII. Implenienting plan
1. Arrangement
The resetllement of Huangqiao reservoir project is related to 171 families and 632
personis in Villager Group One, Villager Group Two and Villager Group Thlree of
lluangqiao village and Villager Group One of Jie village in Hengslhan town.
According to the planned advancing of the project, the construction team will enter
the acquisition in February., 1999. The startinig date of resettlement should be decicled
in advance to guarantee the demand of construction. Thus, the task of resettlenment
will be carried out at two stages: First stage, in 1998, Thle 59 families and 219 persons
( Villager Group One of HIuangqiao village ) slhould move out and be settled. The
