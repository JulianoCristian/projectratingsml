A comprehensive strategy for implementing land\n            acquisition and resettlement requirements under the\n            Manshuiwan sub-component is based on the principle of\n            \"land for land,\" encouraging introducing\n            diversified economic activities in affected rural areas. The\n            preferential resettlement policy consists of: tax exemption\n            on agricultural products for three years; free irrigation\n            water and electricity for domestic use for three years, free\n            timber cultivation and sand handling if used to construct\n            new houses; equal treatment in distributing farmland, house\n            lots, some land for personal use, and job opportunities; no\n            charge for children changing schools; free training in\n            agricultural production; and a reduction, suspension, or\n            exemption from taxes for 3-5 years for those embarking on\n            breeding and processing programs. Compensation for land\n            acquisition will be based on the average production value of\n            lands. Compensation for houses, trees, structures,\n            production, and village infrastructure facilities will be\n            paid; and replacement costs for some of the infrastructure\n            will be contracted for reconstruction. The primary aim of\n            the Huangqiao sub-component is to increase income levels.\n            PAPs ousted from the reservoir area will be relocated in\n            townships downstream; and submerged access roads and power\n            supply lines will be restored."}, "docdt": "1997-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
