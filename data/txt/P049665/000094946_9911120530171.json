The project is not expected to produce\n            detrimental environmental impacts in the surrounding areas,\n            nor does any component pose an environmental risk.\n            Processing plants have limited potential for local water,\n            air, and noise pollution, however, procurement\n            specifications would include full environmental protection\n            measures to contain pollution within national standards.\n            Nonetheless, the study reviews environmental aspects in\n            compliance with Chinese standards. Combined waste-water\n            effluents of processing plants and public buildings, will be\n            either discharged to municipal sewers, or, into septic\n            tanks, and solid waste disposed on agricultural land.\n            Adequate design of boilers, and processing systems, would\n            contain air emissions, while procured equipment is in line\n            with required noise emission standards. Similarly, all\n            chemicals and fertilizers, would be approved by the Bank, in\n            accordance with national standards.

Economic, political, and social benefits\n            are analyzed, in particular, women's constructive force\n            in the project area."}, "docdt": "1998-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
