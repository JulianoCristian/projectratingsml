   economy. The loan will support a set of sector specific\n            reforms to achieve the following objectives: (1) the removal\n            of non-tariff barriers to imports; (2) the reduction and\n            rationalization of tariff protection; (3) the limitation of\n            safeguard measures and anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties\n            to the very short term; (4) the deregulation of industrial\n            exports; and (5) the tightening of the existing industrial\n            promotion regime. The loan will be used to finance 100 per\n            cent of the cost of eligible imports. Also funded will be a\n            technical assistance component designed to strengthen the\n            Government's control of the industrial promotion regime."}, "docdt": "1988-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
