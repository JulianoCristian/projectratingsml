The additional credit will\n            help finance the costs associated with scaling up the Urban\n            Micro-credit component of the project to reach a hitherto\n            underserved segment of the urban poor, which are the poor\n            rickshaw-pullers affected by a ban on Non-Motorized\n            Transport (NMT) in certain Dhaka roads. The additional loan\n            will be passed-on by the Government as a grant to the apex\n            microfinance institution called the Palli Karma-Sahayak\n            Foundation (PKSF) for implementation of the expanded\n            activities that will scale up the project's impact and\n            development effectiveness. There will be no change to the\n            Project Development Objectives (PDO), project components,\n            implementation arrangements, and safeguard requirements. The\n            additional funds will be added to two existing components:\n            Mainstream Urban Micro-credit and Institutional\n            Strengthening of PKSF, Partner Organizations POs and the\n            borrowers. Funds added to the Urban Micro-credit component\n            will be used by PKSF to create a revolving fund for\n            financing the micro-credit loans of the POs to the target\n            borrowers. Apart from direct micro-credit loans, the\n            borrowers will also be provided with training in technical\n            skills to facilitate career change. The funds for\n            institutional strengthening will finance the cost of\n            technical skill training of the borrowers, logistical\n            support to the implementing POs and PKSF and monitoring,\n            evaluation, learning and feedback."}, "docdt": "2007-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
