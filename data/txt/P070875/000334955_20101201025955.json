These communities are situated in the\n            Boeung Kak Lake (BKL) area, within the Sras Chok commune,\n            Daun Penh district in the Municipality of Phnom Penh. The\n            requesters asked the panel to keep the names of the affected\n            people and the villages where they live confidential. The\n            panel registered the request for inspection on September 24,\n            2009. Management submitted its response to the request on\n            November 2, 2009. The requesters claimed that the project\n            'failed to formalize their tenure' and did not\n            'transfer their customary rights under formalized land\n            titles,' therefore weakening pre-existing tenure rights\n            of people. Finally, the requesters claim that other\n            communities in project provinces have been unable to access\n            the land titling in LMAP adjudication areas, and experienced\n            forced evictions. The issues raised involve fundamental\n            questions of land rights and tenure security of the affected\n            community. On the claim that the events in the BKL area are\n            linked to the project, the panel found that the area is\n            within a project province and was declared for adjudication\n            under LMAP, hence activities relating to verification of\n            land tenure and ownership subsequent to the notice of\n            adjudication are directly linked to the project. This is\n            consistent with management's position."}, "docdt": "2010-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
