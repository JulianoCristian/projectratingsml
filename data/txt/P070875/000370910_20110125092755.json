Both the 2009 Response and the\n            Panel\u0092s Report concluded that the Requesters suffered\n            serious harm or the threat of harm. The Panel and Management\n            also agree that the benefits and protections provided to BKL\n            residents by LMAP fell short of expectations and that\n            Management was unable to prevent or mitigate the harm that\n            occurred.  However, while concurring with the Panel\n            regarding a number of significant Project shortcomings,\n            Management considers it essential to characterize these\n            shortcomings properly in terms of their relationship to the\n            harm suffered by the residents of BKL. Management agrees\n            with the Panel that engagement on land issues in Cambodia is\n            highly relevant to the country\u0092s development, and is\n            consistent with the Government\u0092s long-term development\n            vision and the Bank\u0092s overall mandate of poverty reduction.\n            The current state of the dialogue with the Government on\n            these issues has diminished the Bank\u0092s ability to facilitate\n            solutions. Management proposes to report back to the Board\n            on the implementation of the revised Action Plan within 60\n            days of the Board Discussion of this Management Report."}, "docdt": "2011-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
