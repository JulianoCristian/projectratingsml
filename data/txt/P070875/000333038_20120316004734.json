Some lessons learned\n            included: multiple sources of information are required to\n            inform project management. Because of the late establishment\n            of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system and its\n            focus on land titling, the Bank and the Government had very\n            little 'real-time' information on what was\n            happening on the ground. The project needed an on-line\n            management information system (including regularly updated\n            maps), an accompanying socio-economic research agenda to\n            examine impact (given the complex Key Performance Indicator\n            (KPIs)), and a continuing process of communication with\n            Civil Society Organizations. The objectives should be kept\n            as simple as possible and should avoid including\n            vaguely-specified impacts and outcomes whose achievement\n            requires the satisfaction of conditions outside the\n            project's control. Broadly-defined outcome indicators\n            are difficult (if not impossible) to measure and show that\n            the operational aspects of Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) had not been sufficiently thought through at the\n            design stage. For a results framework to be credible, it is\n            essential to have the core elements of an M&E system\n            established before project implementation commences,\n            including having all base-line data prepared. The LMAP\n            design relied on a separate, donor-funded Informal\n            Settlements Program to be implemented in parallel to ensure\n            that the poorest and most tenure-insecure communities would\n            benefit from titling. This parallel program covered Phnom\n            Penh alone and no comparable arrangements were included\n            under LMAP to address similar issues elsewhere. This\n            introduced an unidentified risk and should have been\n            accompanied by a detailed plan for coordination between the\n            two programs in Phnom Penh and plans to develop a similar\n            arrangement for State lands elsewhere. The project's\n            design called for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to\n            play an advocacy role (in raising public awareness, bringing\n            disputes to the fore and providing legal assistance to the\n            poor), but it was unrealistic to expect that the Government\n            and NGOs will be able to engage in formal contracts. This\n            requirement, with hindsight, could have been handled via a\n            Bank-executed Trust Fund, as has been done in more recent\n            land and natural resource sector projects in Cambodia."}, "docdt": "2011-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
