The project would finance eleven long-term advisors\n            for SONADER and MDR; short-term consultant services,\n            including the preparation of final designs and bidding\n            documents for a new SONADER headquarters building;\n            scholarships and on-the-job training; and vehicles, office\n            and laboratory equipment, including operating costs of\n            vehicles acquired under the project. In the spirit of the\n            Bank's Special Action Program (SAP), a revolving fund\n            would be established under the project to expedite disbursements."}, "docdt": "1983-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
