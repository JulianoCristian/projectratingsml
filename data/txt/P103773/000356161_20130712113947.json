were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower

Currently, in the\n            absence of the Bank's support, these processes are\n            often not improved, delaying other aspects in the\n            development process.

It is important to incorporate the new information\n            in a timely manner. Once information affecting project\n            design is available, it is important not to delay the\n            restructuring process.
