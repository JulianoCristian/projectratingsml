                               Restructuring Paper


 1. The closing date for Trust Fund TF091620 will be extended from December 31,
    2011 until June 30, 2012 and the Completion Date of the Administration
    Agreement for this Trust Fund will be extended from June 30, 2012 to December
    31, 2012. This Trust co-financed the Malawi, Business environment Strengthening
    Technical Assistance Project (P103773).

 2. The Project, a US$ 18.7 million Sector Investment Loan of which US$ 3.7 million
    (i.e., EURO 2.8 million based on current Bank exchange rate) is financed by the
    EU Trust Fund, TF 091620, was approved on May 24, 2007 and has a closing
    date of December 31, 2012. The Trust Fund was approved on April 28, 2011.
    Please note the Data Sheet shows US$ 3.7 million while the ISR shows an amount
    of US$ 3.94 million as the amount of the Trust Fund. This is due to the exchange
    rate fluctuation of the original EURO 2.8 million. The Project Development
    Objective is to improve the ease of doing business processes in Malawi in order to
    increase foreign and domestic private sector investment in the economy. The
    project has the following components: a) Strengthening private property rights
    institutions and business facilitation; b) Strengthening PSD support institutions
    and services; c) Promoting access to finance and productivity enhancement; and
    d) Capacity building & implementation support.

 3. Results achieved to date - Reduction in: (a) Costs to formally start a business
    from 134.7% to 108.4% ; b) Legislative backlog of laws impacting costs of doing
    business, from 40 to 11 Bills; c) Time to settle disputes, from 337 to 96 days; d)
    Time to register property title, from 118 to 49 days. Growth of turnover of firms
    accessing Business Growth Scheme is currently being assessed through a survey.

 4. Project performance is currently rated Satisfactory for IP and Satisfactory for DO.
    The project is fully disbursed with cumulative disbursements now stand at US$
    15.44 million (of the Loan of US$ 15.0 million) and at US$ 2.3 million (of the
    Trust Fund of US$ 3.7).



                                         2
5. The Administration Agreement with the EU commenced in 2008, one year after
   the approval of the project and a completion date (the date by which all grant
   funds would be fully disbursed) of June 30,2012 was established.

6. Under the auspices of this AA, a Trust Fund was established, with a Closing Date
   of December 31, 2011. This Closing date was established according to the World
   Bank's internal rules and procedures for Recipient Executed Trust Funds, which
   required a 4-month grace period to be provided for submission of withdrawal
   applications (in effect, by end-April, 2012), allowing another 2 months for CTR
   to complete all financial closure procedures, prior to the Completion date (i.e.
   June 30, 2012) of the Administration Agreement.

7. Although all EU funds under the grant were committed and contracts signed prior
   to December 31, 2011, differences in interpretation between the EU and the
   Association as regards Completion date of the AA (and relevant procedures
   thereof), gave rise to some confusion. As per EU procedures the Bank can
   continue to disburse for six months after the Completion date of the AA; i.e. until
   December 31, 2012, whereas according to World Bank procedures, disbursements
   must be completed within the 4-month grace period after the Closing date of the
   TF. Clarity on the necessity of meeting the grace period requirement did not
   emerge soon enough to prevent a default on the end-April disbursement deadline
   leading to outstanding payments due on three major ICT contracts (to a value of
   $2.7 million) as well as a consultancy on the review of the Companies Act, all of
   which were properly signed prior to the end-December 2011 closing date. All of
   these contracts are integral to the satisfactory completion of the project and its
   Development Objectives.

8. To remedy this, it is necessary to amend the Administration Agreement to extend
   its completion date to December 31, 2012, and to retroactively extend the TF
   Closing Date to June 30, 2012. The extension of the AA Completion Date will be
   aligned with the closing date of the project itself. This would allow sufficient
   time for the outstanding disbursements to be completed, and for the project's
   Development Objectives to be fully achieved by closure. This will be the 2nd
   extension of the trust fund.
