All the development objectives\n            were achieved. Overall Bank performance is rated as highly\n            satisfactory. The sustainability of project outputs will\n            depend significantly on the availability of funds. Borrower\n            performance in preparation of the project is rated as highly\n            satisfactory, while in project implementation it is rated as\n            satisfactory. The key factors affecting the performance\n            were: rapid project processing; strong borrower ownership;\n            flexible procurement procedures; effective civil works\n            maintenance; stringent environmental guidelines; and\n            positive social impact. The key lessons learned are as\n            follows. Quick, effective, and coordinated response from the\n            Bank and other lending agencies is fundamental to achieving\n            satisfactory results in emergency situations. The\n            Bank's acceptance of maximum flexibility of procurement\n            procedures for civil works and goods was of critical\n            importance to ensuring fast implementation. However,\n            environmental guidelines need to be infringed upon because\n            of necessary speed in design or execution of civil works. An\n            adequate balance should be sought between swiftness in\n            action, accuracy in design, compliance with environmental\n            guidelines, and proper use of local knowledge. The active\n            participation of affected communities is important in\n            achieving effective and sustainable management of watershed\n            areas. The infusion of local knowledge from national staff\n            can be important in the design of emergency operations,\n            especially given the short time window and complicated\n            nature of the interventions. Finally, the experience of this\n            project illustrates how strong Borrower ownership and\n            commitment contributes to smooth, effective, and timely implementation."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
