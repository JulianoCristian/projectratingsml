Report (ICR) ratings in\n            that it downgrades the project outcome to moderately\n            satisfactory, sustainability to unlikely, and the Bank\n            performance to satisfactory from a highly satisfactory\n            rating; yet, concurs on substantial institutional\n            development impacts, and a satisfactory Borrower\n            performance. As per the Emergency Recovery and Disaster\n            Management Program (ERDMP) Project, the audit largely\n            concurs with the ICR ratings of a satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, substantial institutional\n            development impacts, and satisfactory performances by both\n            the Bank and Borrower. Lessons of experience are suggested\n            as follows. The Bank needs to be more involved in the\n            immediate post-emergency period, and it needs to be able to\n            quickly fund activities that do not require detailed\n            preparation, but it needs to take the necessary time to\n            prepare infrastructure rehabilitation components that\n            require careful attention to design. The experience of these\n            two projects illustrates the perils of inadequate attention\n            to design, including taking into account the motivation and\n            perceptions of key stakeholders. In the absence of borrower\n            staff experienced in Bank procurement practices, early\n            training and support needs to be provided, especially under\n            the time pressures that are normal for emergency operations.\n            Specifically, when intervening in the natural behavior of a\n            river, it should be realized that there is a danger of\n            triggering unexpected and negative effects. For this reason\n            it is sometimes preferable to keep land adjoining rivers\n            free of construction, and to allow the river to have some\n            freedom of movement. Moreover, in order to work out a\n            feasible action plan for watershed and environmental\n            management it is imperative to identify the main constraints\n            hampering sound management. In St. Lucia, constraints have\n            included turf issues between relevant public institutions,\n            the movement of farming to the hillsides, the nature of\n            local crops, and local perceptions of hazards (causes and\n            remedies). Therefore, with adequate preparation,\n            infrastructure can be rebuilt in three years, but creating\n            viable institutions at the national, district, and community\n            level takes much longer. Grappling with well entrenched\n            environmental bad practice is even more challenging and time-consuming."}, "docdt": "2005-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
