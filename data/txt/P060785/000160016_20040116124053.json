Although the\n            original development objective would remain valid, the\n            proposed Amendment as outlined in Section IV of the\n            amendment document, would restructure the ongoing operation\n            to better align it to the public sector reform priorities\n            introduced by the Administration that assumed office in\n            January 2002. Namely, a new component, Administrative Reform\n            and Public Sector Reengineering (Component E) would be added\n            to support a series of comprehensive studies and\n            administrative reform strategies which would provide the\n            basis for future reengineering of the public sector.\n            Additionally, since a comprehensive Inter-American\n            Development Bank-sponsored project will support the\n            development and implementation of the new Public Procurement\n            Law, the limited support that was originally envisioned\n            under the Public Procurement Component (original Component\n            E) would no longer be necessary.
