Lessons learned included: 1) Improvements\n            toward greater transparency, efficiency and modernization of\n            the public sector are gradual processes that require\n            important preparatory investments and long-term\n            implementation periods, in order to achieve significant\n            changes within the context of such an ambitious program; 2)\n            The implementation period originally assigned to this\n            operation proved unrealistic; 3) An assessment of the\n            project's achievements can only be determined once the\n            Public Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Credit\n            (PRSTAC) has been completed, since implementation of most of\n            the reforms are expected to take place under the new\n            operation; 4) In the design of future operations it is\n            recommended to separate initiatives regarding public sector\n            management and civil service reform from those directed at\n            the reform of public services and private sector\n            participation processes; and 5) An important factor to be\n            considered in operations such as the Economic and Financial\n            Management Technical Assistance Credit (EFMTAC), that not\n            only contemplate the strengthening of key government\n            institutions, but also include approval and implementation\n            of reforms, is to take into account the political calendar cycles."}, "docdt": "2007-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
