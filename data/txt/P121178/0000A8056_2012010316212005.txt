                         the budget to the FERA. In the Health sector, satisfactory progress is being made in the implementation of the government's hospital policy. Overall, the financial situation of the
                         hospitals is improving. The overall debt, which was high for almost all the hospitals in 2008, is now concentrated mostly in two hospitals. In the education sector, satisfactory
                         progress is being made in the strengthening of the human resource management, with the adoption by the HR department of the Ministry of Education of an identification system
                         using an ID number for all contractual teachers and the effective integration of the Volunteers Project unit into the HR directorate. On the governance side, fiscal budget reporting to
                         the public is improving with the continuation of the publication on a monthly basis of a budget execution situation. A new organic law has made mandatory the preparation and
                         submission to the Parliament of a quarterly budget report. Also, access to primary data has become more open with the adoption by the Parliament of the amendments to the
                         Statistics Law.
