                       FIFTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                             CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY


Borrower:               Government of Senegal.

Implementing Agency:    Ministry of Economy and Finance.

Financing data:         Credit on standard IDA terms (40-year maturity and 10-year grace period).

Operation type:         Second in a series of two programmatic Development Policy Operations,
                        single tranche. The first operation was approved by the Board on June 1st,
                        2010 (Report No. 52748-SN).

Main policy areas:      Public financial management, (40%), education (10%), health, (20%),
                        infrastructure (20%), environment (10%), and statistics (10%).

Key Outcome             Detailed outcomes indicators are reported in the Policy Matrix (Annex 4).
Indicators:
Program Development     The development objectives are to contribute to strengthening the
Objective(s) and        Government of Senegal‘s policy making and institutional capabilities
Contribution to CAS:    towards: (i) improving the environment for private investment; (ii)
                        improving access to basic services and ensuring greater efficiency of
                        public expenditure on human capital formation; (iii) mitigating social and
                        environmental vulnerabilities; and (iv) promoting better governance
                        through public financial management, procurement, debt management and
                        statistical systems reforms.

                        The proposed operation is consistent with the objectives of the Bank‘s
                        FY07-10 Country Assistance Strategy. The proposed credit would be the
                        second and last of a new, second series of two Poverty Reduction Support
                        Credits (PRSCs). It follows a first series of three PRSCs successfully
                        completed over 2004-07, two stand-alone Development Policy Operations,
                        one in 2008 (focusing on the energy sector) and another in 2009 (under the
                        IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast-track Facility), and the first operation
                        (PRSC-IV) of the new series approved by the Board on June 1st 2010.
                        Policies and reforms supported by this operation are well aligned with the
                        four pillars of Senegal‘s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II),
                        which the CAS supports.

                        Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of this
Risks:
                        operation. All of these risks could lead to a smaller-than-expected impact
                        of the policies supported by the proposed PRSC. Yet, key risk mitigating
                        factors are integrated in the design of the operation, including a focused
                        agenda. Risks include:




                                                 vi
                       Developments in the global economy. A protracted or deepening
                       macroeconomic downturn in partner country economies, mainly in Europe,
                       still represents a significant risk. Economic recovery may be longer than
                       expected as prospects in high-income economies continue to be weighed
                       down by uncertainties related to banking sector restructuring and high
                       government and consumer debts. Other external risks include new increase
                       in food and fuel prices and the unresolved crisis in Côte d‘Ivoire, risks that
                       are non-negligible, in particular through financial sector linkages and
                       regional confidence spillovers. One key strategy for mitigating the
                       vulnerability associated with this risk is for the authorities to continue to
                       steer a stable macroeconomic course and adopt resolute reforms, especially
                       in the PFM area supported by PRSC-V, reforms that may in turn mobilize
                       donors to provide additional resources to buffer the budget from the
                       consequences of a protracted global recession. For the long term, pursuing
                       efforts to diversify the economy remains the best strategy to mitigate risks
                       related to external shocks.

                       Political opposition, including from vested interests. The risk of an
                       uneven commitment to reforms is heightened as the country moves toward
                       the next presidential elections currently scheduled for early 2012.
                       Nonetheless, the balance of risks to the policy objectives of the proposed
                       series, including the proposed PRSC-V, is still viewed as favorable to
                       moving forward with it. Vested interests can also represent important
                       obstacles to reform, especially reforms that foster transparency in the use
                       of public resources. Under the proposed operation, risks arising from
                       opposition and vested interests are mitigated by the fact that all policy
                       measures are implemented before credit approval. While risks of reversals
                       of already implemented measures should not be neglected, continued close
                       Bank engagement by a core team almost entirely field-based also enhances
                       the Bank‘s monitoring of reforms and its ability to take steps to ensure that
                       reform objectives are being followed through. The design of this PRSC
                       series also aims to mitigate risks by ensuring a built-in process of
                       collaborative analytical, dialogue and stakeholder consultations process.

                       Weak administrative capacity. The risks related to weak capacity are
                       relatively minor in Senegal, in part given the large number of highly
                       trained technocrats, especially at the Ministry of Economy and Finance. In
                       this area, the implementation of PFM and procurement reforms is
                       supported by several donors (IMF, France, EU, Canada, and The
                       Netherlands) and the Bank with technical and financial assistance. In other
                       areas, the proposed PRSC series builds on, complements or leverages
                       existing or planned Bank and donor development policy, capacity
                       building, and investment operations and a broad program of analytical
                       work that should considerably mitigate risks of limited implementation
                       capacity.

                                            1. INTRODUCTION

1.1      This program document proposes a single tranche Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC-V) for the Republic of Senegal in the amount of SDR 26.5 million (US$42 million equivalent).
This operation is the second of a programmatic series of two PRSCs. The PRSC-IV-V series supports the
implementation of the country‘s second Poverty Reduction Strategy in a context characterized by a continued
challenging global environment. The overarching objective of this second series of PRSCs is to contribute to
strengthening the Government of Senegal‘s policy making and institutional capabilities towards: (i)
improving the environment for private investment; (ii) improving access to basic services and ensuring
greater efficiency of public expenditure on human capital formation; (iii) mitigating social and environmental
vulnerabilities; and (iv) promoting better governance through public financial management, procurement,
debt management and statistical systems reforms.
1.2      The implementation of the program supported by this series of PRSC-IV-V is broadly
satisfactory, as has been progress in completing all triggers for the proposed PRSC-V. On the macro-
fiscal front, the authorities continue to demonstrate their resolve to implement sound policies. On the
structural front, progress in reforms is encouraging in several areas (e.g. education, health, and fisheries). As
reported in sections 4.D and 5.B below, overall progress since PRSC-IV was approved warrants proceeding
with PRSC-V.
1.3      The policies supported by PRSC-IV-V are aligned with Senegal’s PRSP-II covering the period
2006-2010.1 The series also aims to assist in the development and early implementation of PRPS-III. While
2010 was the last year of PRSP-II implementation, the authorities are still finalizing the preparation of a
successor PRSP-III, which they expect to approve in mid-year 2011 (Section 3 B). PRSP-III is expected to
exhibit broad policy continuity, with many of its components reflecting a range of sector strategies already
adopted or being updated by the authorities (Annex 3). The design of the PRSC-V is also complementary to
critical actions being taken by the authorities under the new IMF-supported Policy Support Instrument
program (PSI-II) approved by the IMF Board in December 2010.
1.4      The proposed PRSC series is an integral part of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for Senegal discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on June 20, 2007, and it leverages other Bank
operations that directly support Senegal‘s agenda in all reforms areas supported under this operation.2 The
reform program supported by this operation continues and deepens the agenda supported by previous
operations, including the first PRSC series (PRSC I-IV, FY04-10), the cancelled FY08 Energy Sector
Reform Credit and the FY09 Public Finance Support Credit. As the agenda of energy sector reforms
supported by the Energy Sector Reform Credit had lost its original relevance because of significant changes
in the country and sector contexts, the Government agreed to cancel its second tranche. The appointment of a
new policy leadership team for the energy sector in October 2010 has brought new impetus and direction for
energy sector recovery and reforms, and a new restructuring plan has been developed.
1.5     The next FY12-FY15 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), slated for Board presentation by
end fiscal year, will spell out the way forward on the use of development policy operations (DPOs)
instruments in the Bank program in Senegal. Only broad directions for a possible follow-up DPO have

including as part of a possible new series of PRSCs, will be developed in a manner that allows it to
incorporate lessons from the first and second PRSCs series, and reflect policy priorities from the new PRSP,
as well as the strategic thrust of the upcoming CAS. Nonetheless, indicative prior policy actions are
identified in Section 5.B and C with a view to support continuity of policy actions in the areas of focus of
PRSC-IV-V and foster the PRSCs‘ development objectives.

                                         2. COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                  A. RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

2.1      Senegal’s broadly stable political climate has become more complex as the country moves
towards the 2012 presidential elections. The political debate has swelled in recent months, and is now
entirely focused on the upcoming presidential election, still one year ahead. Elections are slated for February
2012, and President Wade has announced his intention to run for a third term in 2012,3 moving to consolidate
the political base around his party, the Parti Démocratique Sénégalais (PDS). Several Cabinet changes have
taken place over the last year, though with little impact on the broad direction of economic policy so far. The
very candidacy of President Wade has sharpened the political debate, including on the track record of his
administration. Overall, the political economy of economic management and reforms is likely to continue to
be challenging. The commitment to reforms on which a broad consensus has yet to be developed could be
more difficult to advance. Moreover, pressures on the public finances are likely to build up. At the same
time, the demand for results has also resulted in additional momentum in the implementation of the
Government‘s growth, human development, social protection, environmental and governance agendas.

                                  B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.2      The country is emerging from a 5-year period marked by a succession of domestic and external
shocks, many of which exogenous. In the decade since 1995, Senegal had enjoyed robust per capita GDP
growth, but, starting in 2006, Senegal‘s largely open economy was buffeted by a series of domestic and
external shocks. Unfavorable rains prompted a sharp decline in agriculture output during 2006-07. The
international food and oil price shocks over 2007-08 slowed the economy down, boosted the price level, and
resulted in a significant deterioration of Senegal‘s external and fiscal positions. Weaknesses in fiscal policy
and public financial management compounded the fiscal costs of highly ineffective and untargeted subsidies
for electricity and food. As a result, by the end of 2008 the government had accumulated domestic arrears to
the private sector equivalent to more than 3 percent of GDP, forcing a strong corrective response that
tightened fiscal policy. The onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 and its deepening in 2009, together
with new domestic shocks, including floods in Dakar region and continued electricity shortages, further
contributed to the general slowdown of country‘s economic activity. Real GDP growth averaged 2.7 percent
in 2008 and 2009, implying zero growth in per capita income.
2.3      Senegal’s economy has started to recover from the economic slowdown of the past few years,
with real GDP growth estimated to have accelerated to 4¼ percent in 2010. All the main sectors
contributed positively to the GDP growth. Good rains—for the third year in a row—supported growth in the
primary sector. A gradual recovery in the construction sector is emerging, fueled in part by the clean-up of
arrears and the settlement of extra-budgetary spending. The momentum in the telecommunication and
transport sector supported the growth in tertiary sectors. However, the protracted crisis in the electricity
sector, and its deepening in the second semester of 2010, hindered the economic recovery. On the demand

  President Wade won his first term, for a seven year mandate, in 2000. A subsequent amendment to the Constitution
allows two five-year terms for the Presidency, effective from the 2007 elections, in which President Wade won his
second term.


                                                       2
side, public investment and the traditional export sector were the main drivers of the economic growth in
2010. Inflation was low in 2010—at 1.2 percent—but prices have been picking up on a year-on-year basis
with increasing imported fuel and food prices. On the external front, the impact of the global financial crisis
continued to be felt somewhat, though less than initially expected. Tourist arrivals and remittances continued
to decline during the first semester of 2010, reaching a trough at mid-year and showing a recovery by year-
end.
2.4      Despite the increase in fiscal deficit, the 2010 fiscal stance broadly supported macroeconomic
stability. The 2010 budget provided a modest fiscal stimulus, appropriately so given Senegal‘s financing
constraints. Performance in revenue collection was strong in 2010—domestic revenues to GDP returned to
its pre-2009 level of about 18¾ percent. Current expenditure decreased both in nominal and real terms during
this period, reflecting continued moderation and a decrease in budget payments of energy subsidies. Capital
expenditure increased by 21¾ percent, mainly a recovery from the previous two years‘ decline. A
supplementary budget adopted in late 2010 reallocated spending within the original budget ceiling, mainly to
under-budgeted wages for contract teachers and scholarships, but these higher expenses were partially offset
by higher tax revenues and expenditure cuts in non-priority areas. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit was
estimated to have come out at 5.2 percent of GDP in 2010, half a point above the budget targets.
2.5      The external position continued to improve 2010. The current account deficit including official
grants will likely narrow to near 6 percent of GDP (down from 6.7 percent in 2009), driven by a reduction in
the trade deficit from 20¾ to 18½ percent. Export growth was strong, averaging 13¾ over 2010 (with
particularly strong growth in traditional exports of groundnut, fish, phosphoric acid, and cement), while
imports remained subdued, increasing by only 2¾, despite rising import prices. As the cereal harvest
improved, imports of rice, wheat, and other cereals declined in volume. The current account was also helped
by higher than expected tourism earnings and remittances inflows (each close 10 percent of GDP), though
the latter stagnated in nominal term, thus decreasing in percentage of GDP to 9.4 percent in 2010from 9.8
percent in 2009. Foreign direct investment (about 2 percent of GDP) increased by 6.7 percent in 2010,
largely reflecting a single South-South FDI-funded project in the cement sector. The overall balance of
payments position came out slightly positive, with Senegal‘s notional reserves at the regional central bank
remaining broadly stable at 4 months of imports.
2.6     The IMF completed the sixth and final review of the first PSI program in December 2010 and
on that occasion, the IMF Board approved a new three-year PSI. Performance under the completed
2008-10 PSI program has been broadly satisfactory, with all quantitative assessment criteria met, and most
structural benchmarks—mainly in public financial management—met or partially met. Senegal‘s new PSI-
supported program builds on progress made under the previous PSI with a focus on maintaining
macroeconomic discipline and fostering economic growth.

                      C. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

2.7      Over the medium term, Senegal is expected to regain economic momentum and return to its
historical growth trajectory. Assuming that the global economy continues to recover, growth is projected
to reach 4½ percent in 2011, or about 2 percent in per capita GDP. As the effects of the economic and
financial crisis dissipate and the authorities deepen structural reforms, growth is projected to accelerate to
5.0 percent by 2015. Output growth is expected to be driven by continued momentum in the services sector,
the recovery in chemical production at ICS and a boost to construction and public works related to the large
investment projects aimed at extending and modernizing the country‘s transport infrastructure. The
authorities have also given renewed impetus to addressing the poor performance in the electricity sector,
though the scale of the challenges implies that a significant improvement will take time. Inflation is expected
to return to its historical trend of about 2 percent per year in the medium term, provided global fuel and food
prices do not fare well above current levels.

2.8      To further support the economic recovery, the authorities are committed to maintaining a
prudent fiscal stance over the medium term, while providing some fiscal stimulus in 2011. Reflecting
the government‘s priority on infrastructure spending—mainly in the energy sector and the extension of the
Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Highway to the site of the planned new airport—the overall fiscal deficit including
grants is projected to widen to 6½ percent of GDP in 2011 (of which 1½ percentage points are accounted for
by the highway extension). Thereafter, the overall deficit would gradually decline to reach about 3¾ percent
in 2015, reflecting the return to more normal levels of infrastructure spending, expenditure restraint in non-
priority areas together with improvements in the quality of spending, and, to a lesser extent, further
efficiency gains in tax administration and tax reform. The planned fiscal stimulus is broadly consistent with


                                                                        4
macroeconomic, external and debt sustainability. However, the medium-term soundness of the budgetary
framework and the ability to stay on the planned growth path will be contingent upon a strict adherence to
sound public financial management practices, as well as an improvement in the administration‘s investment
planning and implementation capacity.
2.9      Given the relative scarcity of concessional financing, the authorities are considering other
financing options for their infrastructure plans, including the issuance of a second international bond
in 2011 to raise financing for new infrastructure spending.4 The estimated cost of the extension of the
Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Highway is expected to amount to 1½ percent of GDP in the first two years, and
¼ percent in the third and last year. Under the financing plan for this project, the Government intends to seek
non-concessional sources of financing in the international capital markets in an amount of US$500 million,
part of which would go to the early redemption of the 2009 bond issue of US$200 million. A joint IDA/IMF
DSA conducted in October 2010 suggests that growth-enhancing spending financed through external non-
concessional borrowing by Senegal at the envisaged level of US$500 million would be consistent with the
maintenance of debt sustainability, and could thus be supported under the IMF‘s ECF program guidelines.
With emerging needs in the energy sector, the authorities are also examining ways to reprioritize expenditure
to cover additional financing requirements in energy over the 2011-14 period. The new energy restructuring
plan—the TAKKAL plan—includes an estimated public spending close to 10 percent of GDP to close the
tariff gap5, recapitalize SENELEC, and increase generating capacity through the leasing additional of energy
capacity and investment in new power plants. Public financial contributions are expected to come from
various sources that include a telecommunications user fee, a levy on domestic sales of petroleum products
and direct budget contributions, funded by donors and possibly from a part of a planned US$500 million
bond issue.

2.10    In the financial sector, the authorities’ intend to safeguard soundness and improve the sector’s
contribution to investment and long-run growth. Bank regulatory policy and supervision are under the
purview of regional monetary and banking authorities, the BCEAO and West African Banking Commission.
Reforms will be guided by the consolidated financial sector action plan and the second national forum on
credit held in March 2010. As in other countries in the WAEMU region, bank loan quality has deteriorated
somewhat as a result of shocks and lower growth. The regional and national authorities are coordinating to
closely supervise bank compliance with prudential requirements and higher minimum capital standards
taking effect at end-2010. To improve the contribution of the financial sector to growth, priorities include the
promotion of non-currency means of payment, the establishment of a legal framework for credit information
bureaus, and improved regulation of leasing. The government is considering plans to transform an existing
development fund into a bank, with the government as majority owner, to facilitate access to credit for small
and medium businesses.6
2.11    The external current account deficit will remain high in the medium term, reflecting mainly
higher imports associated with infrastructure projects and the resumption of growth. In 2011, the
current account deficit including grants is projected to widen further to about 8⅓ percent of GDP, with
remittances expected to stabilize, imports picking up as growth resumes and public infrastructure spending
increase temporarily, and FDI edging upward. For the medium term, the external current account deficit is
projected to remain slightly above 9 percent of GDP until 2015. As a result, the overall balance of payments
is expected to show a modest deficit—Senegal‘s contribution to the regional West African Monetary Union‘s

  Senegal has raised about US$200 million in its maiden bond issue in international markets in late 2009. The bond
issue was part of Senegal financing plan for the government share of the cost of the Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Highway
Project. The bond has a maturity of 5 years, carry a coupon of 8.75 percent but was priced to yield 9.25 percent.
5
  The authorities are working on a new tariff formula but have indicated that a tariff increase would politically not be
feasible. With the gradual build-up of more efficient electricity production, the tariff gap is expected to be closed over
time.
6
  Details remain to be worked out between the government and the regional central bank BCEAO.

should remain at about 4 months of imports in the medium term.
2.12     Overall, Senegal’s macroeconomic framework for 2011 and the medium term provides an
adequate basis for the proposed operation. Economic policy makers are fully aware of the need to remain
cautious and monitor ongoing developments domestically and abroad. Short-term adjustments to the
authorities‘ policy stance, if needed, would focus mainly on fiscal policy—the sole macroeconomic policy
instrument clearly under their direct control. Developments in 2008 and 2009 underscored the need to ensure
a credible, fully funded and sustainable fiscal stance—and indeed, when confronted with rapidly changing
revenue prospects early in 2009, the authorities promptly adjusted it. Beyond policy commitments, recent
measures to strengthen the budget process should help ensure that the authorities are in a better position to
carry through possible revised spending plans.
2.13    For the longer term, a sharp acceleration of structural reforms and a strong private investor
response would be needed to ensure faster growth at a level consistent with the authorities’ ambitious
targets of above 7 percent a year. The higher growth rate targeted by the authorities under the Accelerated
Growth Strategy (AGS) could be reached if the Government accelerates implementation of market-oriented
structural reforms and execute efficiently infrastructure projects, including energy and road infrastructure, on
which depends the success of the strategy. Medium- and long-term growth—albeit not before 2012—should
receive a significant boost from the joint impact of various large-scale projects, several of which involve
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) or FDI-financed projects—including the port of Dakar, a Special Economic
Zone, a new airport east of the Dakar peninsula, and the Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Highway project connecting
them. These public projects, by tackling complementary infrastructure bottlenecks, are expected to play an
important role in boosting the attractiveness of the greater Dakar area to foreign investors in other sectors,
while their design as PPPs would allow them not to compete significantly with other private projects for
domestic financing.
2.14     Risks, external and domestic, remain important. The global economy is recovering but risks
remain, particularly for the Euro zone—Senegal‘s main economic partner—where the public debt situation in
some countries remains a source of uncertainty. A slower than expected recovery, particularly in Europe, is
likely to adversely impact external demand for Senegal goods and services exports, and growth prospects.
The recovery in the tourism sector and in the inflow of remittances may lag if uncertainties in the recovery of
the European economy persist. In addition to subdued external demand, risks to medium-term growth include
food and fuel price shocks and, in a shorter term, the current political crisis in Côte d‘Ivoire, with non-
negligible risks through financial sector linkages. Moreover, continued problems in electricity supply will
adversely impact growth outcomes, as evidenced by the recurring blackouts since the summer 2010, though
the impact is more likely to entail a loss of foreign or domestic investor interest than a significant current
output shock. Finally, additional risks include mounting spending pressures as the 2012 presidential elections
approach and related backtracking on past reform accomplishments.

2.15     The most recent joint Bank and Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis7 shows that the risk of debt
distress in Senegal will remain low over the next twenty years given the low current level of debt and a
commitment to prudent external borrowing. Under the baseline scenario, which includes the planned
US$500 million of non-concessional borrowing in 20118 to finance new infrastructure projects, all debt
burden indicators remain well below their indicative policy-dependent thresholds. However, large spikes in
medium-term debt service ratios would reflect the amortization of 2009 bond and the repayment of the new
non-concessional financing, highlighting the need for the authorities to calibrate their medium-term fiscal
stance back to the 3-3½ percent deficit range, manage spending priorities, and improve debt management in
order to minimize roll-over risks. Stress tests do not reveal serious vulnerabilities for external public debt,
but the fact that the largest breach occurs under the exports shock underscores the need for the authorities to
continue pursuing their goal of raising potential output growth, diversifying the export base, as well as
seeking financing consistent with debt sustainability. Indicators of overall public debt—external plus
domestic debt—follow a broadly similar pattern to those of external public debt alone. Adding domestic
debt, while raising the debt burden indicators, does not change the overall risk assessment, but confirms the
need for fiscal consolidation once the impact of the crisis subsides and the infrastructure projects are
implemented. If fiscal deficits would not decline from its 2010 level, as projected, debt burden indicators
would evolve on a steadily upward trend.
2.16    The authorities have confirmed their policy to borrow externally on concessional terms, with
exceptions only in the case of specific projects of a return and risk profile fully justifying higher
funding costs. They might also need to continue reinforcing the monitoring capacity of the Debt Unit within
the Ministry of Finance and continue to conduct twice a year a debt sustainability analysis as part of this
monitoring, in order to keep borrowing policy in line with the macroeconomic outlook.

                                  D. POVERTY OUTCOMES AND THE MDGS

2.17     The last poverty estimates, based on a household survey conducted in 2005/06, showed the
incidence of poverty at 50½ of the population—more than 6 million Senegalese people, most of them in
rural areas, live on a household income below the national poverty line. Two thirds of the poor live in
rural areas. Inequality rose only moderately between 2001-02 and 2005-06 (the periods of the last two
poverty survey), but while it may have even decreased in urban areas, where the richer have seen relatively
lower gains in income than the rest, it appears to have increased in rural areas, where the poorest have not
benefited from the country‘s positive growth experience. However, since 2005-06, repeated shocks have
contributed to bringing per capita income growth to a virtual standstill, with a likely negative impact on
poverty incidence. Simulating the impact of just two of Senegal‘s recent large shocks, the oil and food price
surges, the last Poverty Assessment prepared by the World Bank team9 estimated that the declining trend in
poverty incidence may have reversed, with a possible increase in poverty incidence by 2½ points from 2005
to 2007. A new household survey to be completed by the fall of 2011 should shed light on aggregate and
regional trends in poverty over the second half of the decade.
2.18    Moreover, despite clear progress over the past decade, many MDGs will be difficult to achieve.
Regional disparities in access and overall low quality of basic social services remain a serious concern. In the
education sector, for example, the primary GER of 90 percent at the national level masks important regional

  In addition, the Government is also considering contracting in 2011 a maximum of CFA F 30 billion in non-
concessional loans with a grant element of between 15 to 35 percent. This financing would not increase the deficit, and
would be used for example in the event of an unexpected shortfall in concessional financing or to substitute for
domestic financing. Given the relatively small amount, this is not expected to change the outcome of the DSA. For
example, a loan of CFA F 30 billion with a grant element of 25 percent would increase the PV of debt-to-GDP by only
0.3 percent of GDP in 2011.

disparities. Rates vary widely, from less than 57 percent in regions with the lowest access to more than
100 percent in Dakar. With appropriate interventions targeted at the areas where performance is lower—
Senegal could meet the MDG relative to the primary school enrollment, while it will be more difficult to
reach the MDG relative to the primary school completion rate, given the high level of repetition and dropout
rates.

2.19     More generally, there remains significant scope for improving the efficiency and equity of
public spending and the quality of services. Public finance management reforms, stronger sector policies,
and a new focus on social protection and safety nets will all be crucial to further underpin human capital
development and poverty reduction. The authorities‘ effort to develop medium-term budgeting tools for
several key sectors is a step in the right direction to achieve greater predictability in budgetary allocations to
priority sectors but the sectoral medium-term expenditure frameworks have had little traction on annual
budget formulation and execution. A comprehensive program of analytical work on public financial
management and sector policy and public expenditure issues is being developed, collaboratively between the
government, the World Bank and other donors, under the Senegal Programmatic Public Finance Review
(PPFR)— a multi-year programmatic series of public revenue and expenditure reviews extending over FY10-
FY12, and covering, inter alia, PFM, education, health and transport (Volume I); and agriculture, social
protection, statistics and the environment (Volume II). Donors are supporting the PPFR, including Canada
(education), UNICEF (health), and the Netherlands (environment).

                                  A. THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

3.1      The second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II), covering the period 2006-10, was
adopted by the Government in July 2006.10 The PRSP-II built on lessons learned during the
implementation of the first Senegal Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP-I). The core growth objective was to
raise economic growth to about 7-8 percent per year, the level estimated to be needed to bring poverty
incidence to 30 percent by 2015, in line with the targets set out in the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). PRSP-II had a broad scope, encompassing 505 priority actions aiming at 144 strategic objectives in
46 sector or domains, structured under 4 strategic pillars, namely (i) wealth creation, reflecting the
authorities‘ continued commitment to private-sector led growth, and now subsuming their Accelerated
Growth Strategy (AGS); (ii) capacity building and the provision of basic social services—with national
strategies in the education and health sectors, as well as new commitments to enhance nutrition and access to
sanitation and water, being the key components of this pillar; (iii) the protection of vulnerable groups—
numerous and diverse groups in Senegal, including children, handicapped, elderly, and refugees.; and (iv) the
promotion of good governance and participation, justified by the need to strengthen the effectiveness of
public spending as well as to promote private sector development.
3.2      As the authorities candidly acknowledged in their recent PRSP II implementation completion
and diagnosis report (ICDR), the results achieved were broadly below the authorities’ expectations.
As a first step in the preparation of the third Poverty Reduction Strategy—now renamed Economic and
Social Policy Document (ESPD)—the government conducted an Implementation Completion and Diagnosis
Report11 of the second PRSP and concluded candidly that performance was uneven. While performance in
the second and fourth pillars was deemed to be broadly positive, achievements under the first and third
pillars were considered weak, owing in part to an unfavorable external environment.
3.3      The ICDR acknowledges that performance on the first pillar, wealth creation, has fallen short
of the strategy’s ambitious goals. On the one hand, economic growth, estimated at an average annual
3½ percent in 2006-2010, or about 1 percent per year on a per capita basis, fell well below the average of
previous years, and far short of the objective of an average annual GDP growth of 7-8 percent. The report
noted the unfavorable international environment with the successive shocks and recommended better
response and more flexibility for the coming strategy. On the other hand, performance in the agricultural
sector has been encouraging, thanks in part to better rains and, in the government‘s assessment, to its 2007
agriculture and food self-sufficiency initiative (GOANA). The report indicated that reforms to improve the
business environment, supported by bi-quarterly meetings of the Presidential Investment Council, have been
commendable. However, the report conceded that the reform momentum and gains in measured outcomes in
improving the business environment achieved in 2007 have not been sustained in the last two years. The
report also emphasized the continued weak performance in the electricity sector, underscoring the need for a
resolution as a matter of urgency.
3.4      Concerning the second pillar, the ICDR pointed to progress in health and education. The
allocation of budget resources to social sectors has grown over the last five years—though not steadily
relative to GDP—and key indicators of school enrollment and of access to water and sanitation have
improved. Senegal has increased access to primary education, moving from a gross enrollment rate (GER) of
79 percent in 2004 to 92 percent in 2009, and a grade one intake rate improving from 92 percent in 2004 to
117 percent in 2009. Moreover, the gender gap in enrollment is effectively closed at the national level, with
girls' GER at 96 percent against 89 for boys in 2009. Progress was also achieved in access to water and

   Senegal‘s first poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP-I) covered 2003–2005. It was discussed by the Bank and Fund
Boards in December 2002. The PRSP-II and related JSAN were distributed to the two Boards in December 2006.

   The document was discussed by all the stakeholders during the PRSP annual review meeting on October 8 th, 2010.

sanitation, an area in which Senegal is likely to meet the MDG by 2015: in 2008, access to clean water
reached an encouraging 87 percent rate. In the health sector, results fell below the PRSP II targets and
Senegal is unlikely to meet the MDGs in health, such as child and maternal mortality. The under 5 years
mortality rate decreased modestly from 121 deaths per 1000 live births in 2005 to 114 deaths per 1000 live
births in 2008 compared to a 2015 target of 44 deaths per 1000 live births. The DTP immunization coverage
remained stable around 87 percent between 2006 and 2009. The maternal mortality ratio decreased by some
20 percent, from 510 per 100,000 live births to 401 from 2001 to 2005, but the target of 127 for 2015 appears
unreachable. Encouraging outcomes were achieved in the nutrition program and prevalence of malnutrition is
expected to decline. The ICDR also notes the persistence of significant regional disparities both in education
and health sector.
3.5      Regarding the third pillar, protection of vulnerable groups, the ICDR acknowledges that the
policy performance has been weak. The ICDR recommends that efforts be stepped up to develop safety
nets in Senegal, now almost inexistent. In the face of shocks, the government has stepped in with
interventions such as broad-based subsidies and tax exemptions, but they have proven ineffective, inefficient
and financially unsustainable. There is a need for more appropriate targeting mechanisms in the face of
limited resources, and a need to improve the identification of vulnerable groups—the current definition of
vulnerability in government policy documents reflects multiple criteria, including age (children, youth and
elderly), gender (women), regions, and other categories (handicapped and refugees), that sum to a very large
fraction of the total population.
3.6      Performance was mixed on the fourth pillar, governance. The ICDR acknowledges that the 2008
fiscal slippages represent a significant setback but notes the authorities‘ renewed efforts since then to
strengthen public financial management and restore the integrity and transparency of the budget framework.
Medium-term sector expenditure frameworks, now available in 21 ministerial departments, represent a step
in the right direction to enhance the predictability of budgetary allocations, but the report notes that the
consistency between the macroeconomic framework, the annual budgets and sector MTEFs needs to be
reinforced. As regards judicial reform, the report notes progress in the area of judicial governance with
greater efforts in modernizing the judicial sector but it acknowledges that access remains relatively complex
and costly for a large part of the population.

                                B. TOWARDS THE NEW PRSP-III (2011-15)

3.7      As Senegal is recovering from the successive shocks that characterized the context in which its
2006-10 PRSP-II was implemented, the country still faces considerable challenges. First, poverty
incidence and disparities between the capital Dakar and the rest of the country remain very high—half of the
population are poor and 70 percent of the poor live in rural areas—and the cumulative impact of repeated
shocks is potentially undermining the foundations for future growth and poverty and. Second, despite a 15-
year long period of positive growth of per capita GDP, the economy has shown little structural change, with
limited diversification, a continued dependence of the growth momentum on domestic demand, no export
drive and virtually no net job creation in the formal private sector. Third and finally, despite notable macro-
fiscal success and continuous expansion of the public finances, critical challenges remain on the efficiency,
equity and governance fronts, confronting the authorities with the urgency to strengthen further their public
financial management institutions and their spending policies.

3.8      The Senegalese Government is well aware that it needs to step up economic management
performance to accelerate economic growth to recue poverty and move towards the emerging market
economy status that it covets. This commitment is reflected in the initial guidelines of the draft PRSP-III
through which the authorities offer their vision for the next five years. At the outset, it is worth underscoring
that this vision is well aligned with the MDGs agenda and its formulation is benefiting from multiple
stakeholders inputs such as donors, local governments, and representatives of the civil society as well as of
the private sector. Senegal‘s new medium-term poverty reduction strategy is likely to be articulated around


                                                      11
four pillars similar to those of the PRSP II: (i) wealth creation; (ii) access to basic social services; (iii)
protection of vulnerable groups; and (iv) greater transparency and participatory processes. The continued
focus on transparency is justified by the need to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of public
spending (through efficient budgetary procedures and controls) as well as to promote private sector
development (by reducing distortions and better access to justice). Senegal‘s third Poverty Reduction
Strategy, named Economic and Social Policy Document (ESPD), is expected to be approved early in 2011.

3.9   The Government will continue to base its strategy on key guiding principles that can be
summarized as follows:

       Preserve macroeconomic stability. The authorities recognize that maintaining macroeconomic
        stability, and thus fiscal and debt sustainability, is crucial to the success of their medium-term vision.
        They intend to pursue broadly prudent fiscal policies consistent with Senegal‘s participation in
        WAEMU and in line with undertaking under their new IMF-supported program. At the same time,
        they will give special attention to the management of external shocks including through boosting
        export diversification.
       Foster the private sector as the engine of growth. This role was already preeminent in the past, but
        relatively mixed results have led the Government to focus on accelerated growth. This new approach
        should help address cross-cutting issues related to the investment climate, including tax policy and
        administration, access to finance, justice, labor, and red tape, and promote five specific clusters that
        are perceived to be the ones with the highest comparative advantage for Senegal (the AGS‘s five
        clusters are agribusiness, tourism, telecommunication and new technologies, textile and fisheries).
        Such an approach is expected to lead to concrete results in terms of exports, job creation, and
        innovation.
       Promote equity and protect vulnerable groups. The authorities will aim not only at increasing the
        delivery of basic social services (education and health), but also at reducing existing inequalities in
        access as it varies significantly with income levels, gender and location. The protection of vulnerable
        groups will remain at the center of the agenda, reflecting the need to broaden the coverage of
        existing social safety nets, well beyond the current coverage of the active population in the formal
        sector (about five percent), and to secure better living conditions for vulnerable groups, most notably
        in rural areas.
       Balanced growth between rural and urban regions. As of today, most economic activities (about
        80 percent of GDP) and a large fraction of the population are concentrated in the Dakar area, which
        represents less than 1 percent of the national territory. Such a disproportionate outcome has put
        pressure on urban infrastructure in the Dakar region, and raised issues of food security and
        environmental impact, while rural areas have continued to languish in poverty. The Government is
        considering a two-pronged strategy that aims simultaneously at improving conditions in the greater
        Dakar area and at promoting economic opportunities in secondary cities and rural areas. The
        development of infrastructure that would support the promotion of economic activities in the
        outskirts of Dakar is under implementation, through the construction of the toll highway, a new
        airport and the development of a new economic special zone in the vicinity of the site of the new
        airport. Also important is the promotion of new investment opportunities in the agricultural sector,
        especially in the Senegal River valley and Casamance region.

3.10    In parallel with the preparation of the Government’s third PRSP, and given its potential
impact on expected growth and poverty outcomes, the Authorities have prepared a new energy sector
emergency plan which will be part of the PRSP III. In October 2010, with support from international and
national expertise, the Government mandated the preparation of a major restructuring and recovery plan for
the energy sector to limit the significant economic, financial and social risks related to that sector. As, the



                                                      12
dual effect of the energy supply-demand imbalance and SENELEC‘s financial difficulties have resulted in
major power cuts and load shedding, the Government‘s most immediate effort has been to prepare a 2011-
2014 emergency plan aimed at (a) ensuring additional power capacity prior to the commissioning of new
capacity scheduled for 2014/15 and implementing an ambitious demand side management program; and (b)
lifting SENELEC‘s cash-flow and financing constraints.
3.11     The 2011-2014 emergency plan is structured in two parts. The first part addresses the supply-
demand constraints by (a) renting emergency generators in the short term; (b) acquiring additional supply
capacity; (c) reestablishing lost capacity through major rehabilitating efforts on current plants; (d) improving
the energy mix by making the most of gas reserves and renewable energy; (e) reinforcing and modernizing
the transport and distribution network; and (f) providing the right incentives for energy efficiency and
appropriate demand-side management. The second part focuses more on the main financial constraints of the
electricity sector by (a) suggesting ways to cover SENELEC‘s operational gap (including tariff adjustment
and government subsidies); (b) ensuring that selected investments are financed; and (c) undertaking a
profound operational and financial restructuring of SENELEC.
3.12    The authorities’ intend to implement these aspects of the emergency plan through the
establishment of a special support mechanism - the Special Fund for Energy- which will get its revenues
from budgetary transfers, taxes on oil, energy and telecommunications, drawings from the COSEC,12 and any
other resources allocated to the energy sector. These resources would be used to purchase fuel for
SENELEC, compensate for tariff, and finance investments as well as studies in relation with the restructuring
and recovery plan. The Special Fund for Energy is under the responsibility of the Minister of Finance, but is
governed by a trustee and a board with representatives from the Government, private sector and consumers.
Its accounts will be audited on a yearly basis.
3.13    The implementation of the plan prepared by the Government could mark a long-awaited
turning point for the electricity sector. However, a number of risks may weaken the Government‘s
capacity to implement the plan. An adequate risk mitigation strategy will therefore determine how robust and
effective the Government‘s response would be. Such risks and mitigation measures include: (a) integrating
the emergency response into a medium to long term strategic vision; (b) ensuring that the electricity and the
downstream hydrocarbon sub-sectors operate in an efficient and transparent way; (c) taking into
consideration oil price volatility; (d) ensuring that major projects are implemented according the
predetermined timetable; (e) increasing accountability amongst the various players—in particular the
accountability and ownership of SENELEC given its central position in the electricity sub-sector.

                          4. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT AGENDA

                             A. LINK TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

4.1      The FY07-10 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Senegal was discussed by the Bank’s
Board on June 20, 2007 (Report No. 36608-SN). The CAS describes how the Bank Group, including IFC,
plans to contribute to Senegal‘s development and is structured around a ―governance‖ filter and three main
pillars: (a) accelerated growth/wealth creation; (b) human development /shared growth; and (c) rural and
urban synergy.
4.2     The Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) that assessed progress in
implementing the FY07-10 CAS for Senegal was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on
June 18, 2009 (Report No. 48600). The Progress Report confirmed that, while progress against CPS goals
has been mixed, the strategic objectives set out in the CPS remained consistent with national priorities. It
also presented adjustments made to assist the Government in mitigating the impacts of the fuel and food

                                                      13
price crisis, and the recent global economic downturn. The Bank‘s team has been working closely with the
authorities to take proactive measures in addressing policy and implementation challenges so as to raise the
likelihood of an overall positive outcome for the CPS. Portfolio performance was assessed as generally
satisfactory. A new CPS is slated to be presented to the Board of IDA in FY11, covering the period FY11-
14. The June 2009 Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report outlined the analytical work that will
underpin the preparation of the next partnership program with Senegal.
4.3      In the Bank’s program, policy-based lending is seen as a critical instrument in support of the
country’s PRSP agenda. The focus of policy-based lending operations was expected to cover budgetary
reforms, economic reforms for wealth creation, and support for policies that improve the delivery of basic
social services to the poorest segments of the population over the medium term. The CAS envisaged the
preparation and implementation of a new series of PRSCs focused on these areas and PRSC-V is the second
and last operation in that regard.

                       B. COMPLEMENTARITIES WITH OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES
                                    AND ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

4.4      The PRSC-IV-V series builds on, complements and/or leverages existing or planned Bank
development policy, capacity building, and investment operations and a broad program of analytical
work (Annex 5). In several reform areas covered under this PRSC series—road maintenance, education,
health, nutrition, fisheries, PFM, procurement, and debt management—the Bank has a range of active
instruments or partnerships with other donors to support the implementation of the Government‘s strategies,
through capacity building, technical assistance and knowledge generation, or investment financing. As noted
above (Section 2.D), the core analytical work on public expenditure issues underpinning the proposed PRSC
series is being developed under the Senegal Programmatic Public Finance Review (PPFR). In other reform
areas, the collaborative development by the Government, the Bank and donor partners of the analytical basis
for policy development and implementation was built into the design of the PRSC series.
4.5      This series of PRSCs is designed, developed and monitored by a core team that is almost
entirely field-based. The core team involved in the design of the proposed operations, as well as in dialogue,
analytical work and project preparation and supervision in the areas of focus of the proposed series is almost
entirely based in the Dakar country office. The team maintains frequent contacts with technical counterparts,
is called upon by Government and development partners in multiple discussions and workshops, and
engages, as a matter of routine, in outreach activities to the media and stakeholders in policy-relevant areas.

                       C. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

4.6      The IMF and the World Bank staffs maintain a close working relationship, especially with
respect to reforms in public financial management and structural measures in specific sectors, such as the
electricity and hydrocarbon sub-sectors which have a systemic impact on public finances and on
macroeconomic stability. Regarding the division of responsibilities between the two institutions, the IMF
takes the lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies, while the Bank takes the lead in long-term
growth, social and poverty analysis, sector policy issues, and public expenditure analysis. In a number of
areas where the mandates of the two institutions overlap, especially in public financial management, there is
close coordination and collaboration to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. This
productive collaboration is expected to continue under the new three-year program under the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) approved by the IMF Board in December 2010.
4.7     Because of Senegal’s strategic regional role, a stable policy environment and broadly favorable
development outcomes, its PRSP-II continues to benefit from foreign assistance. Many bilateral and
multilateral development agencies have an active presence in Senegal, with the World Bank, the European
Union, France and the United States being the largest contributors. Most donors in Senegal subscribe to the



                                                     14
principles articulated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and in the Africa Action Plan (AAP).
With difficulties in implementing the original far-reaching vision of the Framework Agreement on Budget
Support (Accord Cadre pour les Appuis Budgétaires, ACAB), donors providing budget support are currently
developing more limited but enhanced collaboration mechanisms to improve harmonization and exchange of
information, better align donor support on the government-led reform agenda, and enhance the predictability
of budget support.
4.8      Sectoral collaboration will continue, notably around the thematic working groups created in
the Government’s priority reform areas, including in public financial management with the Comité de
Coordination d’Harmonisation et de Suivi (CCHS), and in education, health, social protection, and
statistics. These groups generally comprise government officials, civil society and private sector
representatives, and other donors. Not only have they been increasingly active, but they also have played a
catalytic role in the areas of budgetary reforms, education, and statistics. In the area of social protection,
various development partners have approached the Government to assist in strengthening both the coverage
and effectiveness of social assistance programs. UNICEF, the World Food Program (WFP) and the World
Bank have been forestalling these efforts by supporting pilot direct transfers operations (food-, cash- or
voucher-based), with UNICEF taking an early lead in the necessary advocacy around investing in social
protection. UNDP, ILO, as well as some bilateral donors (France, USAID) are also highly engaged with the
Government on the broader social protection policy platform (pension, health and unemployment insurance).
More coordination will be essential as the Government further invests in social safety nets as a poverty
alleviation strategy. Along the lines of the Paris declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action, a consolidated
action plan, framework of activities and associated assistance needs identification will be needed to ensure
that each partner leverages its comparative advantages in assisting the Government harmoniously.

                        D. PRSC-IV—ACHIEVEMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNED

4.9      In line with the government’s PRSP II, this series of two PRSCs supports reforms in four
policy areas, namely: (i) private sector development; (ii) human development; (iii) mitigating
vulnerabilities; and (iv) improving public sector governance. The first guiding principle in the coverage
of this series has been to ensure alignment with the relevant objectives of a subset of the PRSP-II and with
early intentions to strengthen the design of PRSP-III, drawing on lessons from implementation of its
predecessor. Despite the broad scope of the series, however, its sector or thematic coverage has been
selective, and only a subset of specific areas in the PRSP has been supported. This selection has relied on
three additional core principles: (i) fostering complementarities between reform efforts in different areas,
with a special attention to policy and public expenditure management complementarities, for example in
education, health, and road infrastructure—three sector which jointly account for the lion‘s share of total
government spending; (ii) paying particular attention to areas where the costs of inaction outweigh the risks,
such as environmental vulnerabilities and state land property management; and (iii) most importantly,
leveraging other Bank‘s instruments and support reforms in CAS-defined policy areas in a coherent,
Government-led program. As noted in para. 4.4 above, this approach also helped ensure that implementation
constraints to reforms supported by the PRSC are carefully addressed, or that implementation of reforms
embedded in other instruments could benefit from the mobilization of the entire government on cross-cutting
issues that PRSC instruments foster.
4.10    Overall, PRSC-IV contributed to assisting the Government’s efforts to achieve results in the
main four areas supported by the program. Senegal was able to make encouraging progress in wealth
creation, access to basic social services, mitigating vulnerabilities and governance.

Wealth creation

4.11     During PRSC-IV, the authorities implemented actions that are critical to improving the
investment climate and foster private sector development. Important steps were taken toward the
reduction of the time and cost involved in securing a building permit, and new procedures were formally
adopted by the Government. The creation of a one-stop shop (guichet unique) for the issuance of building
permits in the key municipal office of Dakar (Mairie) was adopted by the Investment Presidential Council,
and the one-stop shop was created in Dakar in November 2010. Furthermore, the Government launched the
computerization of the procedures to obtain a building permit in order to simplify the procedures, increase
transparency and monitor the time passed in obtaining building permit. Given the critical role of transport
infrastructure in the broader economic strategy of the country, progress in ensuring adequate maintenance of
Senegal‘s road capital has been an important area of focus. The new road maintenance funding scheme,
FERA (Fonds d’Entretien Routier Autonome), has become operational in 2009. Financial resources for road
maintenance have increased, and procurement plans for three-year road maintenance contracts elaborated and
approved by procurement authorities, albeit with delay, which translated into a slowing down in the
execution of the 2010 road maintenance program13. Progress has also been made in the justice sector with a
broad consensus reached by the expert group in charge of the preparation of the judicial map. Concerning the
small and medium business tax policy and administration, the government continued to review the policy and
administration of the taxation of the SME with focus on facilitating the formalization of small businesses. In
this context, the authorities have benefited from technical assistance from the IMF FAD and AFRITAC. A
key recommendation is to establish a Medium Enterprise Center (Centre des Moyennes Enterprises) to better

   At end August 2010, only CFAF5 billion has been executed on a cash basis) from the Government investment budget,
although the budgeted amount (CFAF 22.5 billion) has been committed and warranted (ordonnancé). Also, CFAF8.2
billion has been collected on the user charge. At the current pace, it is estimated that CFAF12 billion will be collected
from the road user charge. FERA, in coordination with MEF, has developed a treasury plan to fully disburse the all
budgetary resources.

service medium-size enterprises that are still subject to the CGU (Contribution Globale Unique) and
concomitantly reduce the fiscal costs of formalization of informal enterprises.
Access to basic social services

4.12     Under PRSC-IV, the government implemented reforms aimed at strengthening human
resource management in the education sector, rolling out the new hospital policy, as well as the
strategy for expanding health risk coverage and adopting a plan for sustainable financing of the
nutrition program. Concerning education, the Government eliminated earlier than expected the quota
sécuritaire, opting for its virtual outright elimination rather than a slower phasing out. The recruitment of all
contractual teachers in 2010 was conducted on a competitive basis at the national level. This method of
recruitment led to the recruitment of 2045 teachers in 2010, against roughly 4000 teachers in 2009 and
before. In elementary education, every recruited teacher will receive training before starting to teach.
Furthermore, the HR department of the Ministry of Education has adopted an identification system using an
ID number for all contractual teachers. Also, the Volunteers Project unit has been suppressed and integrated
into the HR directorate. Moreover, to address demand issues, exclusion of primary school students for
insufficient results prior to grade 6 has been eliminated.

4.13     In the health sector, the government started the implementation of the Public Hospital
financial recovery plans and the inter-ministerial committee put in place under the PFSC continues to
hold regular meetings to monitor the situation of the public hospitals. Signs of financial recovery are
beginning to appear in some establishments, where a significant number of non-skilled workers contracts
have not been renewed, thus allowing a decrease in the wage bill of hospitals. However, while emergency
―cost-cutting‖ measures (such as the non-renewal of contract-based staff) are being implemented, key actions
for preventing this situation to happen again are still not taken. In particular, the two decrees for creating an
entity with enhanced control powers over hospitals and for revising the existing regulation on financial
management of hospitals have not been adopted yet. Similarly, performance contracts with hospitals have not
been implemented. Progress has been quicker as regards the extension of health risk coverage. The National
Strategy for Extending Health Risk Coverage has been adopted by an Arrêté interministériel co-signed by the
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry in charge of workers. This step was critical to open
the door for an accelerated implementation of the government health mutual expansion plan. A
communication campaign has been launched to promote the expansion of the health mutual in the local
communities with support from the local authorities (mayors and president of rural community) and the
Regional Development Agencies (ARG). The key instrument for implementing the Strategy is the National
Health Solidarity Fund (NHSF). A detailed feasibility study for this NHSF is underway. In the nutrition
sector, a medium term plan for a sustainable financing of the nutrition reinforcement program has been
drafted for the period 2012-2017 and is being discussed.

Mitigating vulnerabilities

4.14     Under the PRSC-IV, the government continued to implement its strategy for the transparent
restriction of access to fisheries resources and piloting direct cash transfers to household. The Ministry
of Fisheries has disclosed the existing fishing agreements on a government web site and is committed to
continue this practice for all new fishing agreements or similar contracts. A dedicated website is under
construction with support from the GIRMAC. The government started the registration of the industrial
fishing vessels and prepared a database for the identification (immatriculation) of the artisanal fishing
vessel—by end August, an estimated 44 percent of artisanal fishing vessels were registered. A database has
been set up and online access granted on a request basis. Regarding social safety nets, the Government is
continuing the implementation of the two pilots of direct cash transfers to households. The recent supervision
missions of those pilots confirmed the acceptance by the recipient population of this kind of support and the
targeting of the most vulnerable groups. A safety net assessment which will include an evaluation of the two

pilots and also aim to identify approaches for a better targeting of the most vulnerable groups is being
launched with support from the Bank.

Public Finance and Governance

4.15     Under the PRSC-IV actions have been implemented in the PFM area. With regard to budget
preparation, the authorities are preparing to lay the legal foundation for a shift toward multi-year
performance-based budgeting. A working group is in charge of the preparation of the organic law of finance
consistent with June 2009 WAEMU Directives about the adoption of program budgeting. The group has
drafted an organic law that is currently going through the Government internal approval process before its
submission to the Parliament. Workshops and discussion are being conducted about the methodology and the
guidelines on program budgeting. While waiting for the new budget preparation framework, the Government
continued to prepare a global Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and expanded the coverage of
the sectoral MTEF from 14 to 21 ministries during preparation of the 2011 law of finance. On the budget
execution side, the PRSC-IV supported the issuance by the Prime Minister of an implementing regulation
allowing the examination of the approved budgets and the financial reports of public agencies. This issuance
along with the law on the autonomous agencies triggered several initiatives by the Ministry of Finance to
improve the financial oversight and transparency of the agencies. The Direction du Secteur Parapublic has
been created within the Treasury and Public Accounting Direction (DGCPT) in order to collect and analyze
financial information from agencies. A public accountant has been nominated and placed in all large
agencies to effect the separation of the administration (budgetary) and accounting of the public resources
within the agencies. Those public accountants are mapped to the Treasury within the Ministry of Finance.
Furthermore, the Decree mandating a performance contract for the autonomous public agencies and the
Decree establishing the organization and operating rules of the Agency Evaluation Commission have been
adopted by the Council of Ministers. The Agency Evaluation Commission will be in charge of the evaluation
of the agencies and will provide about their relevancy or not.

4.16     In addition, efforts to improve budget transparency and controls have continued. Under the
PRSC-IV, the Ministry of Finance has issued an arrêté mandating the publication on its website of budget
execution tables on a monthly basis and a budget execution report on a quarterly basis. On the external
control side, the budget execution laws (lois de règlement) for the years up to 2002 have been approved by
the Parliament. The examination of the budget execution laws for 2003 to 2006 has been completed and draft
budget execution laws for those years are being submitted to the Parliament, shortly. Finally, the Ministry of
Finance has submitted to the Audit Court the draft budget execution law up to 2009. Reforms in the area of
state land management included the adoption by the government of a new organizational structure for the
Tax Directorate which includes the Cadastre and Domaines. Consultations were also launched for the
preparation of new legal texts on land management and the law has been drafted and submitted to Parliament
for approval.

4.17    In the area of public procurement, recent developments have raised the need for additional
technical work to ensure the sustainability of reforms. Following several years of procurement system
development that placed Senegal at the forefront of reforms in the region, PRSC-IV supported the adoption
of a revised regulatory framework—Procurement Code, NSBDs and GCCs, texts on Procurement Units—to
address the remaining issues identified in the Use of Country Systems (UCS) report Stage 1. The revised
texts were adopted by the board of ARMP14 following a participatory process involving central government
agencies, local authorities, private sector, civil society and donors, and submitted to the government for
approval. The government decided to revisit several provisions of the original texts, in particular with respect
to operations that impinge on national security or that are of an urgent nature and for which standard review

procedures are onerously lengthy. Discussions led to the adoption of a new decree that provided a balance
between the goals of transparency and efficiency while ensuring that the new provisions restrict the scope
for sole sourcing and preserve the transparency and accountability of the system.

4.18     The PRSC-IV also supported reforms in the area debt management and statistical system.
Concerning debt management, the Ministry of Finance has decided to consolidate the entities in charge of the
now distinct internal and external debt management into a single entity. In addition, the government has
decided to expand the coverage of the Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) to three years, instead of one,
and has also benefitted from technical support from the World Bank and the IMF in the preparation of the
MTDS. As for the statistical system, the government has initiated the preparation of a revised statistical law
to allow more access to primary data by the users, and fostered dialogue between providers and users within
the national statistical commission.

Lessons Learned

4.19   The implementation of the PRSC-IV as well as the implementation of the previous series and
other Development Lending Operation has led to five key lessons, which are emphasized below:
       First lesson: budget support has continued to be an effective tool to mobilize the entire Government
        on cross-cutting issues. The case of the road maintenance fund FERA, the sustainable management
        of fisheries, public hospitals, and the control of autonomous agencies demonstrated increased
        mobilization and greater involvement of the line ministries and smoother relation between the
        ministry of finances and line ministries.
       Second lesson: ministries and agencies participating in budget support operations have a tendency
        to focus on the realization of prior actions, at the expense of other actions/outcomes. This emphasis
        has to be expected in view of the nature of the Bank‘s instrument. Yet, it might be detrimental to
        progress over time. The Bank and the Government will give a closer attention to the monitoring of
        all actions/outcomes included in the policy matrix.
       Third lesson: already implemented reforms are not immune to the risk of reversal, particularly in the
        context of the upcoming presidential election. The case of changes to the regulatory framework for
        public procurement is the most recent example, and suggests that dialogue with the government
        should go beyond the line Ministries or Ministry of Finance to ensure their full ownership and
        support.
       Fourth lesson: policy-based lending under a harmonized approach among donors can be an effective
        tool in Senegal to strengthen the country-based development model. PRSCs can help reformers to
        mobilize the entire Government on cross-cutting issues and provide leadership and accountability.
        The implementation of an enhanced harmonization framework for budgetary support, with the Bank
        having a particular focus on the design of policy reforms, should be strongly pursued to provide a
        mechanism for effectively coordinating expanded donor budgetary support, unifying donor
        assistance around a coherent set of policy actions, lowering government transaction costs from
        dealing with multiple donors, and generating reform momentum.
       Fifth lesson: attention should be paid to the quality of outcome indicators at the outset, making sure
        that these indicators are relevant to the objectives, and that they can be measured at every step of
        implementation. It is crucial to align closely performance indicators for the PRSCs with those for the
        PRSP-II and the CAS. It is also important that the various donors involved in budget support use the
        same set of indicators. However, dialogue under the proposed PRSC series will also aim to help the
        Government design its next PRSP. To meet the ensuing need for flexible design in relevant areas,
        the identification of measureable outcomes indicators, the measurement of benchmark values and the
        selection of targets will themselves be part of reform implementation as the series proceeds.

                                    A. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION

5.1     The proposed operation is the second and last in a second programmatic series of two annual
PRSCs (PRSC-IV and V). The development objectives are to contribute to strengthening the Government
of Senegal‘s policy making and institutional capabilities towards: (i) improving the environment for private
investment; (ii) improving access to basic services and ensuring greater efficiency of public expenditure on
human capital formation; (iii) mitigating social and environmental vulnerabilities; and (iv) promoting better
governance through public financial management, procurement, debt management and statistical systems
reforms. The focus of the PRSC-V is on a set of critical policy actions aimed at strengthening the
Government‘s policy making and institutional capabilities with a special focus on the management of core
public resources and institutions.

                                    B. POLICY AREAS AND PRIOR ACTIONS

5.2      The overarching objectives of this second programmatic series of PRSCs are to support the
authorities in the development and early implementation of PRSP-III. The focus of the series is on a set
of critical policy actions aimed at strengthening the Government‘s policy making and institutional
capabilities with a special focus on strengthening the management of public resources and institutions. At the
same time, in aiming to assist the development and early implementation of PRSP-III, the proposed series
also supports the government in addressing a range of issues on which progress under PRSP-II has been
weakest, and in particular in social protection and environmental sustainability. The design of the series has
built on lessons from the implementation of the first series of PRSCs (PRSC-I, II and III)—an experience
that showed a clear positive impact of Bank dialogue under PRSC instruments on government ownership of
the structural reform program, helping reformers to mobilize the entire government on cross-cutting issues,
and providing leadership and accountability.

Wealth Creation
5.3    The proposed PRSC-V aims at consolidating the reform process initiated under PRSC-IV by
continuing to focus on the authorities’ wealth creation PRSP-II pillar. This component of the proposed
PRSC-V continues to focus on road maintenance. PRSC-V will keep a focus on road maintenance to help




                                                     20
bringing the road investment policy framework to a level where risks of losses of the road capital are
drastically reduced and future investment can be made sustainable. 15

Road maintenance
5.4      This component aims at supporting the authorities’ ambition to improve their expanding road
capital. The transport sector is an essential part of the Senegalese economy and improving transport
infrastructure is a fundamental pillar to any strategy for accelerated growth. Its direct contribution to value
added—transport represents an average of about 10 percent of the tertiary sector and up to 4 percent of
GDP—belies its strategic importance, given the sector‘s considerable potential indirect contributions to
productivity, the scope for a significant expansion of Dakar in the global transport sector, the functioning of
national and internal markets and the integration of Senegal in the regional and global economy. Yet, despite
some improvement over the last decade, Senegal's transport infrastructure still shows considerable gaps,
falling far short of the level expected of an adequate transportation system.
5.5      A lot remains to be done, as the road network is still overall in poor shape. The percentage of the
road network deemed in good to medium condition, officially estimated at 45 percent,16 is still much lower
than the African average (70 percent according to the AICD study), despite recent investment. A major issue
is that the road network has suffered from insufficient maintenance in the past, and in particular periodic
maintenance. Several institutional reforms have been introduced—Senegal has a competent road works
implementation agency, procurement methods are aligned on the national practices, road maintenance
planning capabilities have been strengthened, recent multi-year maintenance contracts have been introduced
and should foster better public-private collaboration, and road projects are executed by robust private road
works companies at prices generally aligned with competitive benchmarks in Africa.
5.6      A core reform, but one that remains to be consolidated, has been the creation of a second
generation road fund aimed at ensuring adequate and secure public funding for road maintenance.
Adequate funding remains the most critical challenge for making road maintenance work as needed. The
road fund, FERA (―Fond d’Entretien Routier Automome‖), is funded through a road user charge raised on
fuel prices—the long term goal being to cover road maintenance costs in full through this fee—, as well as,
temporarily, a budget line-item allocation, currently classified in the investment budget. While FERA is
called to play an essential role in programming and funding of road maintenance, the system has not been
fully implemented, and actual fund mobilization still trailed normative targets. FERA‘s 2010 budget for
example, at CFAF 45 billion, still falls sharply short of the estimated level of CFAF 85 billion needed to
fund an effective maintenance strategy, despite it being more than twice the flat budget for road maintenance
(of about CFAF 15 billion) that had prevailed every year over 2000-08. Furthermore, actual outturns for
FERA resources came out well below the CFAF 45 billion target, for two reasons—first, the rate of the road
user charge was set at too low a level to achieve the target annual collection levels—it is too low by half—,
and second, the budgetary allocation has not been mobilized in full. Overall, a significant increase in the road
user charge will be needed, and, if the authorities want to continue to fund FERA temporarily through budget
allocations, this allocation will need to be increased and executed in full. The Government is well aware of
this issue and is considering doubling the road user charge, although the overall indirect taxes on petroleum
products would be unchanged and the doubling of the road user charge would be neutral on fuel prices.

15
   Policy measures were envisaged at the time of PRSC-IV in the area of small and medium business taxation, with a
planned study on options for simplifying tax policy and administration for these largely informal enterprises. Building
on IMF FAD and AFRITAC TA on policy and administration of taxation of SME, however, the authorities decided to
postpone the reform study and prioritize implementation of a key recommendation from the IMF, the establishment of
Medium Enterprise Centers.
16
   The figures on the condition of the road network quoted in this section are not based on a comprehensive survey of
the network. Independent simulations, using data from the road works agency‘s actual physical program, suggest that
the network might in fact be in a poorer condition than that reported officially, with an average for the share of the
network in medium to good condition closer to 30 percent.


                                                         21
Focus of PRSC-V under Component 1—Wealth Creation
5.7      The proposed PRSC-V aims at consolidating the reform process initiated under PRSC-IV by
continuing to focus on the authorities’ wealth creation PRSP-II pillar. The medium-term objectives of
the selected reforms are to reduce costs of doing business and increase the returns on investment in transport
infrastructure by supporting the transition to a FERA-based funding to maintain the country‘s road capital.
The prior action under PRSC-V consists in the issuance of a decree doubling the road user charge transferred
to the FERA.

Human Development

5.8     The human development component (component 2) aims at supporting the second pillar of the
Government PRSP II which focuses on promoting access to basic social services by a growing share of
the population. The implementation of the national strategies in the education and health sectors, as well as
new commitments to enhance nutrition and access to sanitation and water, are the key elements of the
Government‘s strategy. This component of the proposed PRSC-V focus on three sub-components:
(i) education; (ii) health; and (iii) nutrition.
5.9     The first sub-component (education) supports the authorities’ goal to accelerate progress
towards achievement of the MDG in the Education sector. Enrollments have increased significantly
during the period 2005-2009. As a result, gross enrollment ratios (GER) have increased at all levels. In
primary school, the GER, which was 81 percent in 2005 reached 90.5 percent in 2008 and 92.5 percent in
2009. The increase in supply was the main cause of increased access to school—from 2000 to 2009, the
number of primary schools increased from 5405 to 7939, an increase of nearly 47 percent during the period,
requiring the construction of a large number of schools and a massive recruitment of teachers. Despite its
high rates of access and because of low retention, Senegal is characterized by low primary completion. The
primary completion rate has increased from 54 percent in 2005 to a still low 59 percent in 2009. Dropouts
over the primary cycle remain a major obstacle to achieving universal education. Without a change in this
rate, Senegal will be unable to achieve the goal of universal primary education by 2015. However, Senegal
has made significant strides in reducing gender disparities in schooling, but regional disparities remain.
5.10     Despite the mixed performance painted above, education in Senegal has been a high priority
for the government since 2000. Education has been managed under a comprehensive, systematic approach
covering all the domains of education and training policy, from early childhood to higher education. The
high priority given by the government to the education sector has been reflected in a significant budgetary
effort. With about 33 percent of current spending, and close to 25 percent of total public spending, devoted to
education and training, Senegal is ahead of, not only Sub-Saharan Africa, but even North Africa. This
commitment of budget resources has been clearly a national one, with direct donor contributions accounting
for not more than 5 percent of total spending on education. Access to schools for rural populations remains
an issue. To correct for these issues, ―deconcentrated‖ management mechanisms should be reviewed, for
example by integrating regional development agencies (ARD) in the management of resources going to
schools.
5.11     A sharp improvement in education personnel management is in order. A critical goal is to
establish more credible estimates and improved forecasts of wages and remuneration, including contractors
and higher education personnel, while the regional assignment of teaching staff to positions, as well as
recruitment and training programs will need to be strengthened. An improved education HR management
system—with at a minimum an individual identification system for both staff and positions—has only
become more necessary. The Government has introduced a series of measures to strengthen HR management
in the education sector, including the phase-out of the ―quotas sécuritiaires‖ in 2009, the launch of an update
of the education personnel file based on the 2009 audit of the education staff; and the full rollout of SIGFIP
linking the central administration and all remaining regions for the education sector. Reforms adopted in
2010 allowed for progress by the HR department of the Ministry of Education in the adoption of an


                                                     22
identification system using an ID number for all contractual teachers consistent with civil service IDs and the
effective integration of the Volunteers Project unit into the HR directorate.
5.12     The second sub-component (health) supports the government’s policy agenda in the health
sector, developed into the new National Health Development Program (NHDP) for the ten-year period
of 2009-2018. The 2009-2018 NHDP builds on progress achieved during the 1998-2007 NHDP which
contributed to improve MDG-related indicators but not at a pace that ensures the achievement of the
Government‘s ambitious targets. Child mortality has declined, but at a slowing pace since 2005.17 Over the
decade, under-5 mortality has decreased, reaching a low of 92 per 1000 live births in 2009, well above the
Millennium Development Goal of 49 by year 2015 (a two-third decline from the level in 1990, of 149 per
1000 live births). Maternal mortality has declined only slightly over the period.18 An analysis of coverage
rates for high impact interventions on maternal mortality—modern contraception, deliveries assisted by
qualified staff, prenatal consultation—shows that very little progress has been made. The rate of assisted
births in the public health system fails to exceed 50 percent, and the rate of prenatal care has also stagnated
around 75 percent. These changes are largely attributable to various difficulties in the public health care
system, including low supply and funding at the primary level, an uneven distribution of personnel, and
limited productivity performance. However, Senegal has achieved good results in the fight against infectious
diseases, except for tuberculosis.19 The HIV epidemic has been largely contained, and its prevalence has
fallen below 1 percent.
5.13     Spending on the public health system in Senegal has hovered around a relatively low level of 3-
3½ percent of GDP in recent years. Efficiency, quality and distributional incidence of public health
spending also raise significant issues for the attention of policy makers. The public health system remains
preeminently funded by the central budget, along with donor contributions and user fees. The budget of the
central government covers more than half the cost of the public health system, with donors and user
payments each accounting for about 20 percent. Though the share of total spending in favor of the hospital
sector has decreased—with a fall from 58 to 43 percent of total health spending—it remains the largest item
in total spending. In other respects, the commitment of public resources has enabled Senegal to significantly
improve the average density of its medical personnel. For the three categories of qualified personnel—
doctors, nurses and midwives—, WHO coverage recommendations have been, or are close to being, reached
at national level.
5.14    A critical immediate issue remains to consolidate progress in bringing public hospitals back to
financial health and more generally improve their efficiency. A 2008 study showed that the efficiency of
public hospitals had clearly deteriorated in recent years, with the rapid recruitment of non-technical,
unskilled personnel bearing on their cost structure with little gains in ―output‖—indeed, it was estimated that,
in 2007, a quarter of hospital resources (mainly staff) made no contribution to hospital outputs. Hospitals still
know very little about their costs. A basic step to improve their management would be to develop cost
accounting. The methodology has been adopted and tested by the Ministry of Public Health, and is ready to
be used at low cost. In the short term, however, public hospitals need mostly to accelerate the
implementation of their financial restructuring plans, including the difficult but highly needed downsizing of
unskilled workers. Practical solutions that will improve hospital management have already been identified
and are even subject to a general consensus. In addition, it is necessary to radically strengthen government
oversight over hospitals, especially with regard to their recruitment and compensation policies and budgets.
While the government will likely need to step in to cover their accumulated debts, financial assistance will be
made contingent on hospitals taking appropriate measures to return to financial soundness and subject
themselves to oversight. For this purpose, the immediate critical step is to develop, reach agreement on, and
start implementing hospitals‘ performance contracts that would define basic targets for improving efficiency

and make oversight rule-based. Beyond this first step of course, performance contracts will need to be
implemented, monitored, acted upon and updated as needed.
5.15     The third sub-component (nutrition) supports the Government’s Nutrition Reinforcement
Program. The fight against malnutrition in Senegal remains a major national priority and investing in
nutrition of young children has already proven to be a highly cost-effective means to promote long-lasting
skills and cognitive developments. The nutritional situation of the population is characterized by a high
prevalence of stunting, low weight, iron deficiency (anemia), vitamin A and iodine deficiency, mainly among
children, adolescents, and women. Micronutrient deficiency is another feature of the nutritional situation in
Senegal, with anemia and vitamin A deficiency highly prevalent. Nonetheless, survey data show that the
nutritional status of children under five years of age has actually improved in recent years. These results were
achieved thanks to the successive nutrition programs implemented with support from development partners,
particularly the Community Nutrition Project (PNC, 1995-2000) and the Nutrition Reinforcement Program
(PRN, 2002-2006), implemented by the Government. The Government intends to scale up the PRN towards
full national coverage by adequately budgeting resources for the program to accelerate and entrench recent
gains.

Focus of PRSC-V under Component 2—Human Development
5.16     The PRSC-V builds on PRSC-IV achievements and continues to support reforms judged
critical to improving education, health and nutrition policies and management outcomes. The medium-
term objectives of the selected reforms are to improve human resource management in education, to respond
more effectively to the diverse demand for schooling in selected regions, to improve public hospital
efficiency, and to improve coverage and financial sustainability of the government‘s community-based
nutrition program through adequate budget allocations.
5.17    PRSC-V supports three policy actions, as follows: (i) satisfactory progress made in strengthening
human resource management in the education sector, as evidenced by the adoption by the HR department of
the Ministry of Education of an identification system using an ID number for all contractual teachers
consistent with civil service IDs and the effective integration of the Volunteers Project unit into the HR
directorate; (ii) signing by the Ministry of Health of performance contracts with at least 5 Public Hospitals
(Etablissements Publics Hospitaliers, EPH) under the new regulatory framework of two decrees governing
the financial regime and financing arrangements and oversight of EPH; and (iii) the adoption and initiation of
implementation of a medium-term plan for sustainable financing of the Nutrition Reinforcement Program.
Mitigating Vulnerabilities
5.18    The PRSC-V third component aims at supporting the third pillar of the PRSP-II that
emphasizes the need to improve the lives of vulnerable groups through specifically targeted
interventions and sustainably manage natural resources and mitigate environmental risks. This
component of the proposed PRSC-V focuses on sustainable management of fisheries resources, as the
development of a more effective framework for mitigating social vulnerabilities and developing a new set of
safety net is still at the concept and piloting stage.
5.19    The sub-component (fisheries) supports a transparent access restriction policy to fisheries
resources. Fishing and related activities represent an important economic activity at risk in Senegal. The
key issues affecting the fisheries sector in Senegal are the dwindling size of fish stocks due to
overexploitation resulting from the government‘s limited capacity to govern and manage the use of the
resources to sustainable levels. The Government has committed itself to developing the institutions, policies
and programs to mitigate the tragedy of the commons already evident in Senegalese fisheries. The
Government of Senegal has recognized the social and economic importance of the fisheries sector, by giving
it a more central place in the country‘s policies and strategies. The AGS, however, recognizes the key
challenges to the sector, noting that ―the development model used in the fisheries sector for the past many
years has certainly led to dissipation of fishing income (value of the natural resources). Good management of


                                                      24
fish resources would help to meet the challenge of growth posed by the Accelerated Growth Strategy.‖ To
achieve these objectives, the Government completed a Letter of Sector Policy for the fisheries in 2008,
prioritizing the sustainable management and restoration of fish resources and their habitats as the sector‘s top
objective. In order to meet this objective, the Letter of Sector Policy concentrates on the ―control and
management of maritime fishing capacities to meet allowable catch potentials‖ and the ―control of access to
fishery resources‖ as the first two of six key areas of policy intervention. In particular, to control access to
the resources the Letter of Policy focuses on dissemination and coverage of fishing permits to all small-scale
fishers, and the establishment of an access rights concession system for the resources.

Focus of the PRSC under Component 3—Social and Environmental Vulnerabilities
5.20     The proposed PRSC-V builds on progress achieved during PRSC-IV. The medium-term
objectives of the selected reforms are to mitigate social and environmental vulnerabilities. PRSC-V supports
one policy action, namely: establishment by the Ministry of Fisheries of an industrial fishing vessel registry
and artisanal vessel immatriculation database accessible to the public on-line.

Public Sector Governance

5.21     The public sector governance component (component 4) aims at supporting the fourth pillar of
the Government’s PRSP II which focuses on promoting efficiency and effectiveness of public
expenditure, greater transparency and participatory processes. This component of the proposed PRSC-
V focus on three sub-components: (i) Public Finance Management; (ii) State Land Management; and (iii) the
Statistical System.
5.22     The first sub-component (Public Finance Management) supports the authorities’ action plan.
The action plan was build from recent diagnoses performed by or at the request of the authorities. Those
diagnoses have identified a range of weaknesses in Senegal‘s Public Financial Management (PFM) system.
The weaknesses have been further highlighted by the budgetary slippages in 2008. An audit of budgetary
slippages by the Finance Inspectorate in July 2008 as well as more recent diagnoses, in particular the 2007
PEFA, a 2008 IMF technical assistance report and recent analytical work under the Bank‘s PPFR, have
identified mixed results in the preparation, execution and control of the budget.
5.23    The government PFM action plan, adopted in October 2009, is a comprehensive attempt by the
authorities to address the weaknesses of their PFM system. Its reforms, actions and capacity upgrading
span the full array of PFM issues mentioned above, under an exhaustive, time-bound and sequenced
program, drawing on self-assessment and recommendations from development partners, including the
European Union, the IMF and the Bank. Most reforms supported under the PRSC series draw on this PFM
action plan.
5.24    Several donors, including the IMF, the European Union and the Bank, are providing direct
technical assistance to the implementation of the government action plan. Government reforms and
technical support cover several crucial areas:
       On the preparation of the budget, the implementation of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
        (MTEF) has only yielded limited gains so far. MTEFs of sector ministries are mere annexes to the
        budget law, having limited force in budget debates, approval by Parliament and reporting on
        execution. A central reform of budget preparation, in line with new WAEMU directives, is to move
        toward a program budget approach with a legal basis is an ambitious project that will require, among
        other things, a new organic law on budget laws (expected to be ready by end-year 2011), a
        strengthening of the units responsible for preparing program budgets to ensure that they fully master
        this budgeting technique, and significant time, well beyond the horizon of the proposed PRSC series,
        to mainstream a performance-based budgeting approach.




                                                      25
        The budgetary slippages in 2008 exposed several weaknesses in budget execution procedures.
         Immediate remedial measures were taken in late 2008 and 2009 but making further progress will
         require, in addition to improving budget preparation, (i) to move to a more forceful delegation of the
         responsibility for budget execution to sector ministries; and (ii) to undertake a full roll-out of the two
         public financial management systems, SIGFIP and ASTER, both horizontally, across Ministries and
         regional departments, and vertically, by interfacing the budget and treasury systems. In recent years,
         the government has vested the execution of a significant part of its public investment program to a
         number of autonomous public sector agencies and specialized funds to which it transfers an
         increasing fraction of its investment budget. As a result, the principle of budget comprehensiveness
         has been weakened. A law on autonomous public agencies was adopted in 2009, among other things
         to strengthen oversight of their budget execution by the central government. The next step in the
         reform agenda is to ensure enforcement of this law.
        On the external control side, the Constitution of 1999 provides for an Audit Office that has been
         functional since 2001. Until recently, the Audit Office‘s effectiveness has been hampered by long
         delays in examining public accounts, opacity in financial information and weak capacity. The
         authorities have committed to speed up the transmission of budget execution laws and public
         accounts to the Audit Office and improve their quality. They also intend to create a permanent
         position of General Prosecutor at the Audit Office, replacing the currently temporary position, to
         strengthen the Audit Office‘s prosecutorial capabilities, while the Audit Office will adopt and
         implement a medium-term program of audits of the largest accounts (―comptes de gestion‖) of public
         accountants. The incentive and sanction regime that ultimately underpins compliance with the laws
         must be developed.
5.25     Efforts to improve budget transparency and controls have continued but, beyond technical
solutions, there is a crucial role for accountability to the population to be reinforced. Poverty incidence
in Senegal is marked by significant inequality among regions and departments. Poverty incidence in only 10,
all of them urban, out of 34 departments stood below the national poverty level—about 51 percent in 2005-
06—, and poverty incidence in 10 departments exceeded 60 percent. Although endogenous economic
forces—the urban concentration of population (25 percent), firms, foreign investment, and workers in the
capital Dakar—play an important role in explaining the trend in disparities, the policy forces—mainly public
policies and investment in infrastructure and the social sectors—appear to have been going in the same
direction. While the sectoral allocations of public spending are broadly in line with the Government PRSP, a
stylized fact of overall public spending in Senegal is its spatial concentration. A preliminary analysis under
the PPFR20 that has attempted to evaluate public spending across eleven regions of Senegal, points to three
major stylized facts. The first is just a confirmation of the concentration of public spending in the Dakar
region as expected—more than 55 percent of identified spending goes to the capital. The second finding is
that this urban concentration applies in all the sectors. The third and final finding is that the imbalance
between Dakar and other regions tends to worsen during budget execution: the share of the initial budget
allocated to the Dakar region was estimated at 40 percent against 55 percent after implementation, an
increase of the concentration of 15 percentage points. Although transparency has increased with the regular
publication of monthly budget execution tables and monthly Government fiscal tables, the potential demand
for spatial budget information, particularly from Parliamentarians, media and the public at large, is still
largely unmet. Recent debate in the National Assembly for the adoption of the 2011 budget emphasized this
need, as Parliamentarians, particularly those that are also local authorities (Mayor, President of Rural
Council) are feeling increasing pressures from voters in their localities. To response to this demand, the
Government is envisaging the exploration of the spatial code of the budget classification (nomenclature) for

20
   The analysis was preliminary because, although the results seem significant in terms of budget lines—15,800 lines of
a total of 28,200 lines, or more than 56 percent of budget lines—they concern only 25 percent of budget expenditures,
the remaining 75 percent being unallocated to regions. It is interesting to note, however, that the results for spatial
allocation covered 70 percent of infrastructure spending, and 50 percent each for health and education


                                                         26
at least four ministries (Education, Health, Justice, and Decentralization) to publish the repartition of the
approved spending by Department. In the medium term, the government will include in Budget Law a spatial
allocation by Department of the spending to foster transparency, encourage greater accountability, and
sharpen the public debate.
5.26     The second component supports the government’s State land property reforms. Currently, the
tools for strategic management of public assets, particularly State land property, are only partially developed.
The real estate assets of the State have gained considerably in value, particularly so in the greater Dakar area,
where real estate prices have increased significantly in the last two decades and the State remains the owner
of significant property. However, until recently, the legal framework remained critically outdated—some of
the basic texts having not been updated in more than five decades. A first critical step has therefore been to
modernize and clarify the legal framework for land property. Going forward, two areas for reforms will need
to be developed: first, the recourse to transparent competitive procedures for sales of State property will
allow the State to reap significant returns if and when it decides to sell some of its property to investors;
second, modern information systems on land assets and transactions, maintenance, sales and purchase
operations will need to be developed, and third, the collection of real estate revenues (from sales or property
taxes) should gain in depth.
5.27    A sub-component originally envisaged supports the Government’s intention to strengthen its
Debt Management framework. Debt management in Senegal shows strengths relating to the legal
framework, macro-policy coordination and cash management. A recent evaluation of debt management
performance - using the Debt Management Performance Assessment tool (DeMPA) reveals the following: (i)
the legal framework establish clearly the responsibilities for public debt management, vesting the President
and Parliament with ultimate decision making powers. In addition, a recently established National
Committee for Public Debt Management (Comité National de la Dette Publique, CNDP) ensures the
coordination between all institutions involved in public debt management; (ii) the policy coordination
between debt management and fiscal and monetary policies is fairly strong, through the formulation of the
medium-term macroeconomic framework that is the foundation for the annual budget laws; and (iii) there is
a strong coordination between the BCEAO and the Treasury in the management of domestic debt markets,
including through frequent reconciliation of accounts balances, and cash flow management for the Treasury.
This coordination is also accompanied by a clear distinction of functions and roles of monetary, budgetary,
and debt management authorities in public debt management decisions.
5.28    Senegal can further improve its debt management framework, by strengthening its debt
management strategy and other ancillary debt management functions. A strong debt management
strategy (DMS) is still to be placed at the center of debt management policies in Senegal with a medium- to
long-term framework (currently it covers only one year), and including alternative scenarios for
macroeconomic projections and a deeper analysis of cost-risk tradeoffs of different debt management
options, medium- to long-term debt contracting plans, debt structure profiles (maturity and currency
denomination options), and an enhanced data coverage to include debt by public enterprises and regional
governments. At the request of the authorities, a joint Bank-Fund technical assistance took place in February
2011 and assisted the authorities in the preparation of a multi-year plan for the development of a medium-
term debt strategy (MTDS), as well as strengthening the institutional and organizational underpinnings for
debt management.
5.29   The fourth sub component (statistical system) supports the authorities’ medium term statistical
plan. Senegal has been at the forefront of a longstanding program of strengthening national statistical
systems in francophone Africa. Its national experts are widely considered to be among the best professionals
in Sub-Saharan Africa, and recent institutional reforms, including the creation of an autonomous National
Agency for Statistics and Demography (Agence Nationale pour les Statistiques et la Démographie, ANSD),
have gone a long way towards creating a favorable context for the development of a modern public statistical
system—a critical component of the institutional foundations for improved governance, in which the State
has a central role to play. Despite recent progress in improving the policy, institutional and capacity


                                                      27
framework for statistics in Senegal, the remaining weaknesses undermine the authorities‘ core objectives in
this area. The operations of the National Statistical Council, a forum where statistical supply and demand
meet, have not been mainstreamed into a regular consultations program, decisions on actions, and follow-up.
Macroeconomic and sector statistics still show weaknesses in methodology, frequency, and data collection,
compilation and treatment. The national statistical program (Schéma Directeur de la Statistique) is still not
playing its role as a coordinating framework for the planning of, and donor support to, national statistical
development. A more open dissemination of primary data (e.g. from surveys and censuses) would play a
critical role not only in boosting the availability and use of data, but in encouraging the demand for statistics
to be more boldly expressed, including by research institutions, the private sector and the media.

Focus of the PRSC under Component 4 — Public Sector Governance
5.30    The PRSC-V builds on PRSC-IV progress and continues to support critical reforms to
improve economic governance in Senegal. The medium-term objectives of the selected reforms in public
financial management are to improve the transparency of budget execution, foster demand for reporting and
transparency, and improve management of State land property. In statistics, the PRSC series would support
continued progress in statistical development, and foster demand for statistics, including through a policy of
national dissemination of poverty measurements, the core instrument to monitor and evaluate the broad
outcomes under the authorities‘ PRSP-II and essential benchmarking for PRSP-III.
5.31     PRSC-V supports the following policy actions: (i) improving budget reporting to the public by the
presentation and publication of the budgets of the Ministries in charge of Education, Health, Justice and
Decentralization using the spatial code at, at least, the departmental level in the government‘s budget
classification system (nomenclature) as evidenced by detailed SIGFIP reports; (ii) the adoption of a new Law
on Land Ownership (Loi sur le Régime Foncier) that modernizes and clarifies the overall legal framework
for land ownership; (iii) the submission to Parliament of amendments to the Statistics Law that mandate a
more open access by users to primary data.

Prior Actions

5.32      The proposed PRSC-V would support eight policy actions deemed critical to achieving its
development objectives. Table 5.1 below details these prior actions, their consistency with the triggers
identified under PRSC-IV, and their implementation status. The rationale for their selection has been their
criticality to the government‘s short-term program, strong government commitment, and technical readiness.
They are drawn from the larger Government‘s matrix of policy measures in priority sectors. Compliance with
these prior actions forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the proposed operation.

                          Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
This operation is fully aligned with the Government‘s PRSP-II. The entity responsible for the program supported by this
operation within the Government is the Ministry of Economy and Finance, in close associations with the Ministries of
Education, Health, Environment, Justice, Family, Fisheries, and Mining.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The coordinated accountability framework has been developed under the PRSP monitoring system. The program has
been closely coordinated with and supported by other development partners such as the IMF, EC and bilateral donors.
The expected results of the program supported by the proposed credit are detailed in the Policy Matrix in Annex 4.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The timing, modality and scope of this operation are fully customized to Senegal‘s current country circumstances.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The policy matrix uses a limited set of [ten] prior actions for Board presentation and disbursement of the proposed
operation, actions that are critical to move the Government‘s agenda forward, and are fully complementary to the
Government‘s reform program supported by the IMF PSI. The chosen policy measures were identified jointly with the
Government and in close consultation with other development partners.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
The Bank has worked in close coordination with the IMF, EC and bilateral donors in supporting the Government‘s
reform program. Going forward, the Bank will continue to coordinate closely with these institutions, within the ACAB
framework, to support and monitor program implementation to contribute to more predictable and performance based
financial support in the future.


                                           C. RESULTS FRAMEWORK

indicators that will be used to assess progress are presented in detail in Annex 4. The table 5.3 below
shows the outcome indicators linked to the prior actions selected for the first operation of this second series
and the triggers and other reforms supported by the second operation.

                                             A. PARTICIPATION PROCESS
6.1      The design of the proposed PRSC-V has drawn on the PRSP-II which has benefited from
broad stakeholders consultations. Additional consultative inputs were drawn from stakeholders‘
participation in the Government‘s PRSP-II and ACAB policy matrix reviews and the recent PRSP II
implementation completion and diagnosis assessment. The proposed operation has also benefited from
stakeholder consultations undertaken through the preparation of the ICR on the first series of PRSCs and
lessons learned from PRSC-IV implementation. The World Bank Country Office also conducts outreach
activities and consultations with stakeholders on a routine basis.


                                                          35
                                    B. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
6.2     The proposed operation is expected to have a positive direct impact on the medium-term
poverty reduction trend. This impact will be through an expected strengthening of the government‘s policy
making and institutional capabilities to ensure an enabling environment for the private sector (component 1),
improve the State‘s ability to provide basic services efficiently and equitably (component 2), mitigate
environmental vulnerabilities (component 3), and improve governance in the management of public
resources (component 4).

6.3     Policy reforms in areas supported by the proposed operation may affect selected groups, but
the specific measures supported by the operation itself will not have negative impacts. PRSC-V
supports actions that may be viewed as ultimately impacting selected groups, notably payers of the road user
charge and fishermen. In the first case, the doubling of the road user charge supported by the operation does
not affect consumer prices as the specific tax – which is CFAF 200 per liter of refined oil (premium gasoline,
regular gasoline and diesel) – will remain unchanged, and only its structure in terms of share allocated to the
FERA is changed. In the case of fisheries, the PRSC-V supports policy reforms associated with Bank
projects that have been subject to Bank safeguards policies. While policies to restrict access to fish resources
may impact negatively on the livelihood of some resource users, the PRSC-V operation itself supports only
the immatriculation of the artisanal fishing vessels and transparency in the allocation of licenses. Moreover,
social and environmental impacts of the Bank‘s fisheries projects have been addressed through the adoption
by the Government of a Process Framework that defines a participatory process based on consensus seeking,
as well as through the establishment of a social fund in component three of the GIRMaC project that would
compensate fishers and communities for any losses as a result of reduced fishing effort.

                                          C. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
6.4     The Government has been pursuing a program of public financial management (PFM) reforms
since the early 2000s. The mobilization of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) around the
modernization of the PFM system has made it possible to make substantial progress with the support of the
technical and financial partners, including the World Bank. To move more forcefully on PFM reforms, the
MEF has developed an overall action plan that was adopted in October 2009. The PFM action plan is a
comprehensive attempt by the authorities to address the weaknesses of their PFM system. Its reforms,
actions and capacity upgrading span the full array of PFM issues mentioned above, under an exhaustive,
time-bound and sequenced program, drawing on self-assessment and recommendations from development
partners, including the European Union, the IMF and the Bank. Most reforms supported under this PRSC
series draw on this PFM action plan. The Government is committed to carry out the PFM reform agenda,
and has established a PFM Reform Secretariat under the Ministry of Economy and Finance with
representation by all departments responsible for specific reforms, and whose role is to (i) coordinate the
reforms to be undertaken; (ii) harmonize government actions; (iii) monitor the implementation of the action
plan; and (iv) hold different actors accountable for progress.
6.5      Strengthening fiduciary systems is at the core of the proposed operation. As noted above, the
design of this PRSC series draws on various analytical inputs, including a 2002 CFAA and a 2003 CPAR
with an action plan for PFM reforms supported by donors through a Multi-Donors Trust Fund administered
by the Bank, a EU-financed PEFA exercise undertaken in 2007, and a technical assistance diagnostic by the
IMF‘s Fiscal Affairs Department, which the Government shared with donors. The PRSC-V supports various
measures that, complementarily with other reforms supported by the IMF and other donors, should go a long
way to mitigate fiduciary risks. Overall, the Bank has judged implementation performance of the public
financial management reform program to date and Government‘s commitment to its improvement as
satisfactory.
6.6    The BCEAO is the common central bank of the West African States, which includes Senegal.
In 2005, the IMF staff carried out an on-site safeguards assessment of the BCEAO and found that progress


                                                      36
has been made in strengthening the BCEAO‘s safeguard framework since 2002, when the last safeguard
assessment was conducted. The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements, and
improvements have been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO had improved the explanatory notes to the financial
statements and further changes are scheduled for next fiscal year, with a view to gradual alignment with
International Accounting Standards (IAS), as adopted internationally by other central banks. Furthermore,
an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms have been established to improve risk
management and risk prevention, and follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations has been
strengthened. The assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made in recent years. The main recommendations relate to: (i) improving the external audit process
by adopting a formal rotation policy and further enhancing the transparency of the financial statements by
adopting IFRS in full; and (ii) enhancing the effectiveness of the internal audit function by further
strengthening reporting to management of the BCEAO. The status report of the implementation of
recommendations, received from the Central Bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress was achieved
in corporate governance and strength and transparency of internal financial reports.

                      D. CREDIT ADMINISTRATION, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

6.7     Credit amount and tranching. The borrower is the Republic of Senegal, represented by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. The credit will be released in one tranche of SDR 26.5 million
(US$[42] million equivalent) upon credit effectiveness. The closing date of the operation will be March 31,
2012.
6.8     The credit will follow IDA’s disbursement procedures for development policy credits. Upon
approval of the credit and effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, the proceeds of the credit would be
disbursed by IDA into a dedicated account of the Government for budget support held by the Central Bank
(BCEAO). The proceeds of the credit would not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the
Agreement. The borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the credit into said account, an equivalent
amount is credited in the borrower‘s budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. Based
on previous experience, the execution of such transaction from the Central Bank (BCEAO) to the Treasury
(Ministry of Economy and Finance) does not require more than four days. The borrower will report to the
Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the budget
management system. Assuming that the withdrawal request is in foreign exchange, the equivalent amount in
CFAF reported in the budgetary system will be based on the market rate at the date of the transfer. The
borrower will promptly notify the Bank by fax or email that such transfer has taken place, and that proceeds
have been credited in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
6.9      Auditing. The administration of this credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance. Through this Ministry, the borrower will (a) report the exact sum received into the Dedicated
Account; (b) ensure that all withdrawals from the Dedicated Account are for budgeted public expenditures,
except for purposes such as military expenditures or for other items on IDA‘s negative list; (c) provide to
IDA evidence that the CFAF equivalent of the credit proceeds were credited to the Dedicated Account and
disbursements from that account were for budgeted public expenditures. The Dedicated Account could be
audited on terms of reference acceptable to IDA. If, after being deposited in this account, the proceeds of the
credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the recipient
to either: (a) apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly to IDA.
The General Audit Office is required by law to produce its annual report on the public accounts to Parliament
with the Budget execution laws (Loi de Règlements) by the end of the year following the execution of the

                                       E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
6.10    Under Operational Policy 8.60 on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is required to
determine whether specific country policies supported under the operation are likely to cause
significant effects on the country’s environment, and, in the event of such likely effects, assess country
systems for reducing any such adverse effects and enhancing such positive effects. In the event of significant
gaps in the analysis, or shortcomings in the country systems, the Bank is required to identify how such gaps
or shortcomings would be addressed before or during program implementation, as appropriate.

6.11     The specific reforms supported by the proposed development policy credit are not likely to
have significant negative impacts on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources.
None of the policy measures supported by PRSC-V outside the ―Managing Vulnerabilities‖ component
(Component 3) are likely to have direct negative effects on Senegal‘s environment and natural resources.
The structural reforms supported by PRSC-V aim generally at strengthening policy making and institutional
capabilities of the State through legal, institutional, operational and systems reforms that by themselves entail
no specific impact on the environment. The significant increase is road maintenance activity is not expected
to cause environmental degradation. Road maintenance comprises routine maintenance and periodic
maintenance. Usually, these two activities do not involve any reconstruction or road widening. In exceptional
circumstances, particularly when there is a significant backlog on periodic maintenance, one can face heavy
periodic maintenance that involves quasi- rehabilitation work and can include in some cases restoration of
shoulders in rural areas or widening of shoulders in towns or rural district capitals.
As a result, there are generally no major environmental concerns, except the necessary preventive measures
such as: (i) the management of contractors‘ work camp and workshop areas; (ii) the general management and
reinstatement of borrow pits; (iii) the disposal of waste material; (iv) health and safety measures; (v) traffic
signals; (vi) traffic diversion, etc. The agency in charge of road maintenance (AATR) is subject to strict
environmental standards, and has a good track record of compliance. Reforms supported under the PRSC
series‘ Component 3—fisheries, and those under this component for the PRSC series (coastal erosion, forest
resource management and environment budgeting) are intended to reinforce the Senegalese Government
ability to mitigate critical vulnerabilities to its environment and natural resources and thus have a positive
impact on the country‘s environment, forests and coastal areas. The context, rationale, Government agenda
and focus of the PRSC series in this reform area are discussed at length in Section 3 above.

                                     F. RISKS AND RISKS MITIGATION

6.12     Several risks could jeopardize this PRSC series expected outcomes and benefits. These include:
(i) a deeper and/or longer macroeconomic downturn in the current global context than anticipated; (ii)
political opposition, including from vested interests and heightened in the context of the 2012 presidential
elections; and (iii) weak capacity to implement reforms. Yet, the design of this operation, with a relatively
focused agenda and high donor involvement, should help mitigate these risks.
6.13      Senegal’s short-term prospects continue to depend on developments in the global economy. A
slower normalization and/or longer macroeconomic downturn in the current global context than anticipated
still represent a significant risk, contingent on developments in partner country economies, mainly in Europe.
One clear mitigation strategy is for the authorities to continue to steer a stable fiscal course for the year and
adopt resolute reforms, especially in the PFM area, that may in turn mobilize donors to provide additional
resources to buffer the budget from the consequences of a more abrupt slow down.
6.14    Political opposition, including from vested interests, represents a major potential obstacle to
reforms and the achievement of the operation’s objectives, especially in the context of the next
presidential elections currently scheduled for early 2012. Nonetheless, the balance of risks to the policy
objectives of the proposed series, including the proposed PRSC-V, is still viewed as favorable to moving
forward with it. Vested interests can also represent important obstacles to reform, especially reforms that



                                                      38
foster transparency in the use of public resources. Under the proposed operation, risks arising from
opposition and vested interests are mitigated by the fact that all policy measures are implemented before
credit approval. In addition, since risks of reversals should not be neglected, continued Bank engagement
with a core team almost entirely field-based also enhances the likelihood that reforms are being followed
through and policies sustained. The design of the series also aims to mitigate risks by ensuring a built-in
process of collaborative analytical, dialogue and stakeholder consultations process.
6.15    Achieving the credit objectives could become more difficult as a result of weak administrative
capacity and slow program implementation. This risk is relatively minor in Senegal, in part given the
large number of highly trained technocrats. In addition, the implementation of PFM and procurement
reforms is supported by several donors (IMF, France, EU, Canada, and The Netherlands) and the Bank with
technical and financial assistance. The proposed PRSC series builds on, complements or leverages existing
or planned Bank and donor development policy, capacity building, and investment operations and a broad
program of analytical work under the PPFR that should considerably mitigate risks of limited
implementation capacity.

                                LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
                                                 (April 2011)


                                               I. Introduction

1.      Over the last five years, the Senegal’s development strategy continued to focus on reducing
poverty and improving living conditions of people in accordance with the PRSP II. The strategy
continues to establish gradually the conditions conducive to strong, sustainable and inclusive growth. To this
end, the government has continued to enhance the quality of governance and the functioning of markets by
reducing distortions and the elimination of barriers to private sector development, including by preserving
macroeconomic stability and by making progress in implementing structural reforms.
2.       This Letter of Development Policy summarizes the recent economic and social performances of
Senegal, particularly in the areas supported by the second series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSC-IV and V), and indicates the direction of the new economic and social policy document being
finalized.

                               II. Recent economic developments and social

3.       The Senegalese economy started its recovery in 2010, following a slowdown in 2006-2009
marked by a difficult international environment and a succession of external shocks (energy, food,
financial). Real GDP growth is estimated at 4.2 percent in 2010 against 2.2 percent in 2009, thanks to a
rebound in exports, an acceleration of public investment (particularly in infrastructure), and payment of
extra-budgetary spending, to improve the financial situation of private sector companies. The primary and
tertiary sectors rose by 4.5 percent and 4.9 percent in 2010, while the secondary slowed to 2.9 percent against
4.8 percent in 2009, because of difficulties in electricity supply which was exacerbated in the second half of
the year. Indeed, the increase in unmet energy demand resulted in a loss estimated at about 1.4 point of GDP
growth. However, the negative impact of power cuts on production has been mitigated by the acquisition of
power generators by 76.6 percent of the formal enterprises. Similarly, in the informal sector, only 30 percent
of businesses were without alternative power generators.
4.      Following a decline by 1.7 percent in 2009, inflation picked up and stood at 1.2 percent in 2010,
mainly due to increase in food prices by 4 percent and fuel prices by 2.1 percent reflecting partially the
removal of subsidy on GPL gas. However, in December 2010, prices increased overall by 4.3 percent on a y-
o-y basis. The favorable level of domestic prices combined with the depreciation of the CFA franc against
the currencies of major trading partners led to gains in price competitiveness estimated at 5.1 percent in 2010
compared to 2009. Regarding the GDP deflator, it grew 1.3% in 2010.




                                                     41
5.      In 2011, the economic recovery started in 2010 is expected to strengthen, benefiting from the
continued recovery of the global economy. Real GDP growth is projected at 4.5% in 2011 against 4.2% in
2010, thanks to momentum in primary (3.8%) and tertiary (4.6%) sectors, and recovery in the secondary
sector (5.1%). The implementation of the third generation of Economic and Social Document Policy and
execution of selected projects in the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) should contribute to the
consolidation of the recovery of the domestic economic activity. The economy should also benefit from
improved delivery of electricity through the implementation of the plan Takkal.
6.      Regarding fiscal management in 2010, the government deficit widened to 5.2 percent of GDP
against 4.9 percent in 2009, reflecting a significant fiscal stimulus to support economic activity through
an acceleration of public investment. Budgetary revenues increased to 18.8% of GDP in 2010 against 18
percent in 2009, reflecting improved efficiency in tax collection and continued broadening the tax base. Total
expenditure and net lending is estimated at about 27.2 percent of GDP in 2010 against 26.7 percent in 2009
due to significant increase in capital expenditure, wages and salaries, and interest payment on public debt.
The total investment spending amounted to 11.6 percent of GDP in 2010 against 10.1 percent in 2009. Public
investment has been oriented mainly to the priority sectors, including infrastructure, education, agriculture
and water that concentrated 53% of total public investment financed by internal resources. In 2011,
managing the budget would be characterized by a deficit of 6.9 percent of GDP against 5.2 percent in 2010,
mainly due to the inclusion of capital expenditure under the extension of the Dakar-Diamniadio Toll
Highway Project and Takkal plan.
7.       Senegal external position in 2010 was characterized by lower current account deficit including
grants to 6.5 percent of GDP in 2010 against 7.5 percent in 2009. Overall, the balance of the balance of
payments showed a surplus of 120.7 billion, an improvement of 30 billion compared to 2009. In 2011, trade
with the rest of the world should translate into a balance of payment surplus of 233 billion, thanks to the
good performance in capital account and financial transactions. The current account deficit (excluding
grants) is expected to 9.2 percent of GDP. Regarding the monetary situation in 2010, it highlights a rise by
CFAF120 billion in net foreign assets in 2010, an increase by 15.2 percent of domestic credit and an
expansion of the supply of broad money by 14.1 percent. This trend will continue in 2011 with an increase in
net foreign assets by 215 billion, an increase in domestic credit by 12.8 percent and an increase in money
supply by 15.1 percent.
8.      On the social front, the Government continued in 2010 to invest in the education and health
sectors. The primary school enrollment rate increased to 94.4 percent in 2010 against 92 in 2009, with
continued emphasis on education of girls. Girls' enrollment rose to 98.7 percent while that for boys was 90.3
percent, resulting to a gender parity ratio of 1.09. The primary completion rate declined from 59.6 percent in
2009 to 59.1 percent in 2010, a small decrease of 0.5 point. Positive results were also recorded in the water
and sanitation. The rate of access to clean water in rural areas stood at the end of December 2010 to 77.5
percent in 2010 against 73.6 percent in 2009, while in urban areas, it is estimated in 2010 to 98.5 percent
against 97 percent in 2009. As regards to sanitation, the access rate in urban areas remained stable at 63 in
2010, while in rural areas it rose from 28.9 percent in 2009 to 29.6 in 2010. However, regional disparities in
access and quality are persisting, even if the least served areas (Kolda, Tambacounda and Ziguinchor)
continued to record improvements.
9.      In contrast, performance in the health sector did not improve, reflecting the difficulties
constraining the sector, including hospitals. The global primary consultation rate (preventive and curative)
increased from 60 percent in 2008 to 61.5 percent in 2009, an improvement of 1.5 points, while the
proportion of births attended by skilled staff rose from 61 percent in 2008 66.6 percent in 2009. However, the
proportion of children aged 0-11 months fully vaccinated (PENTA 3) went from 89 percent in 2008 to 88
percent in 2009, down by 1 point. This weaker performance could have a negative impact on maternal and
infant mortality and seriously compromise the attainment of the MDGs 4 and 5 by 2015.




                                                     42
                                III. Performance in implementing reforms

10.     In 2010, Senegal has continued to implement reforms aiming at: (i) accelerating growth and
promoting private sector development; (ii) strengthening human capital; (iii) reducing vulnerabilities and
protecting the vulnerable; and (iv) improving governance.

                           A. Economic growth and private sector development

11.      The Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS) has remained the anchor of the reform agenda and
priority actions to increase the growth potential of the Senegalese economy. The Presidential Investment
Council (PIC) continued to be the appropriate forum for advancing the reform agenda related to cross-cutting
issues and monitoring the progress. On the reduction of costs related to starting new activities, the
Government has taken in December 2009 a decree regulating new construction permits as anticipated by the
legislative part of the Urbanism Code voted by the Parliament. The decree stipulates the procedures for
examining and issuing permits to subdivide, build, demolish and planning certificate. An issuance by the
Minister in charge urbanism fixed the delays for to grant the urbanism permission to less than 30 days, the
authorization to build or subdivide to less than 28 days for simple cases and 40 days for complex cases, and
issuance of certificate of compliance in less than 18 days. The effective implementation of these procedures
involves several entities both at central and decentralized levels. At central level, the reform continues to be
subject to close monitoring by the Presidential Investment Council (PIC). At the decentralized level, it was
decided to create one-stop shops for the processing of applications for building permit. Furthermore,
procedures related to application for building permits are being automated. Impacts on the indicator of Doing
Business are expected in 2011. In 2010, the duration of the procedure was reduced from 220 days to 210
days, a decrease of 10 days, the goal in 2011 remain to reach 150 days. To consolidate these gains, the
Government intends to further reduce the time of connection to water and sewerage and of the payment of
fees related to these connections.
12.      In the infrastructure sector, the government continues to focus on improving urban, long
distance, and rural mobility, and accelerate the implementation of its program of building new roads,
including the Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Road. To preserve the quality of existing capital and new road
construction, the government has created and implemented the second generation of the Autonomous Road
Maintenance Fund (FERA) funded by an annual allocation from the state budget and the proceeds of a road
user charge. In the long run, the user charge will cover all expenses of the Fund. The FERA was made
operational in 2009 and effective autonomy is expected in the next 5 years. On the mobilization of budgetary
resources, the entire amount due for the years 2009 and 2010 was committed, processed, and placed in the
deposit account of FERA at the Treasury. In 2010, only 50 percent of budgetary resources were actually
consumed, because of the fact that the procurement code did not authorize multiyear contracts. Moreover, the
yield of the tax charged to the users turned out at only 50 percent of the initial estimate. To correct these
deficiencies, the Government amended the procurement code to permit multi-year contracts for road
maintenance and issued a decree doubling the road user charge, while neutralizing the impact on retail prices
at the pump.

                                         B. Building human capital

13.      The development of human capital has remained central to the economic and social
development strategy of Senegal. The resources allocated to the Education and Health sectors have reached
significant proportions in recent years and Senegal is today one of the African countries that allocates more
resources to these sectors in terms of proportion of the overall budget.




                                                      43
                                               B.1 Education

14.      The 10-year Development Program of Education and Training (PDEF) is the anchor of the
Senegal’s policy in the education sector. Its implementation over a decade has enabled the country to
significantly improve indicators on access and equality of opportunity between girls and boys. However, the
rate of primary completion, although increasing steadily in recent years, remains below 60 percent and the
government's objective. To achieve an enrollment rate in primary education of 100 percent and significantly
increase the completion rate, the government is more focused on improving the transparency and
effectiveness of human resource management and reducing dropouts, particularly in regions with lower
enrollment rates, namely Diourbel, Louga, Kaolack and Matam.
15.      Regarding the management of human resources, the government finally eliminated the system
of recruitment of contract teachers on the basis of the “quota sécuritaire” and adopted a
comprehensive system of competitive recruitment for all contract teachers. The recruitment test is now
based on a national competition open to both sexes aged from 18 to 30 years. Starting from the 2011-2012
academic year, the qualifications required to participate in the test is the baccalauréat degree. As a
transitional measure for 2010-2011, the test is permitted for candidates who hold a BFEM, up to 30 percent
of new recruits. Moreover, the duration of the training of candidates in the EFI was extended from 4 to 9
months. The training is sanctioned by a diploma and certificate of completion of internship. In 2009, the
government has conducted an audit of the human resource management that revealed significant
shortcomings in the system. To correct these shortcomings, the government has streamlined its operations by
canceling its education volunteer project and transferring the functions to the Human Resources Department
(HRD) of the Ministry for Education. Moreover, the government has adopted and implemented a system of
registration of contract teachers, which covered 48,214 workers at end-December 2010.

                                                 B.2 Health

16.      The National Health Development Plan (PNDS 2009-2018) remains the anchor of the health
policy in Senegal. It aims at accelerating the implementation of various prevention programs and improving
the supply of health services. Its objective is also to contribute to achieving the Millennium Development
Goals in the health sector. Its implementation has encountered difficulties in 2008 and 2009, related to the
situation of public hospitals (EPH), but progress has been noted during the year 2010. Recovery plans have
been prepared on the basis of a common framework for these establishments and submitted to authorities in
2009. On this basis, five (05) EPH prepared and signed performance contracts with the Minister in charge of
Health. The medium-term objective is to generalize the performance contracts for all the EPH. Furthermore,
the Government will adopt a decree fixing the financial system of public institutions including the EPH. The
Minister in charge of Health has already strengthened the role of the Directorate in charge of Health
Institutions (DES).
17.      The government intends to increase the proportion of people covered by health insurance
schemes. To this end, the government developed a National Strategy for Extending Health Protection in
Senegal (SNECRMS). The government has created in April 2010 a Steering Committee responsible for its
coordination and monitoring, with inter-ministerial decree cosigned by the Ministers in charge for Finance,
Health, and Labor and Social Security. By late 2012, the Government intends to support a significant number
of health insurance covering the rural and informal sectors. Regarding improvement of the management of
existing initiatives, the government will investigate the SESAME plan based on a representative sample of
eligible persons. The government will also conduct a study on options for billing, identification and targeting
of beneficiaries.




                                                     44
                                                 B.3 Nutrition

18.      The five-year Nutrition Enhancement Program (PRN 2007-2011) is the anchor of the political
fight against child malnutrition in Senegal. The strategies developed by the PRN based on two
complementary areas, namely: (i) promoting the integration of nutritional goals in the plans of concerned line
ministries; and (ii) the implementation of interventions targeted on pregnant women, nursing mothers and
children under 5 years. The implementation of this program and its earlier stages has enabled Senegal to
achieve significant results in reducing the prevalence of malnutrition. Senegal remains today on a positive
trend towards achieving the MDGs in the field of nutrition. To sustain the performance achieved and make
the fight against malnutrition financially sustainable in the medium-term, the government has developed a
new strategic plan for the fight against malnutrition over the period 2012-2017, which provides for an
extension of the program coverage to all the country. To stabilize its financing, the Government is committed
to strengthening the budgetary resources allocated to the program by gradually increasing its contribution to
50% of the financing needs by 2017 from 20% in 2010. For 2011, the Government has allocated additional
CFAF 200 million to the PRN under the supplementary budget (LFR 2011).

                                          C. Reducing vulnerability

19.      On reducing vulnerabilities, particularly those related to sustainable management of natural
resources, the government continued implementation of its policy of limiting access to fisheries
resources. In this context, it continues to publish on the website of the Ministry in charge of Fisheries, all
new agreements or similar contracts signed. It has published consistently and on a biannual basis, the
situation of fishing licenses (number, cumulative duration and fees paid) by access regime. Moreover, the
Government proceeded with the registration of all artisanal vessels operating in the country, totaling nearly
13,400 boats. It will also launch a campaign of registrations of less than 3,000 canoes identified as belonging
to the Senegalese fleet but operating in neighboring countries. To enhance transparency in the management
of sustainable building, the government has established a register of industrial fishing vessels and a database
of registered artisanal fishing vessels available online.

                                          D. Improving governance

20.    Improving governance remains a high priority in the Senegal‘s development strategy. Thus, the
government continued implementation a coherent fiscal policy and its Financial and Budgeting Reform Plan
(PRBF).

                                D. 1. PFM reforms and public procurement

21.      The government continues to implement reforms to improve expenditure planning, budget
preparation, budget transparent execution, and budget control by Parliament. Significant progress has
been made in the implementation of the PFM structural reforms plan. The plan continues to modernize its
system of public financial management and to improve functionality, coverage, effectiveness and safety of
the Integrated Financial Management System (SIGFIP). This software has already led to substantial
reduction in time and cost of production of the budget execution tables while increasing the reliability of
budget information. To increase transparency and enhance public access to budget information, the
government has over the years 2009 and 2010 regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Finance
or its services monthly budget execution situations, by department and title in less than 30 days after the end
of the considered month, in accordance with the instruction mandating the publication of budget execution
situations. The government has initiated the use of spatial code of the budget classification in order to
provide a spatial distribution of the budget for the sectors of education, health, justice and decentralization. A
report from SIGFIP presenting the budgets of these departments has been prepared and published on the
website of the Directorate of Forecasting and Economic Research of the Ministry in charge of finance.


                                                       45
22.     Regarding procurement, a new public procurement framework has been implemented since
January 2008 and the Government is determined to pursue its implementation with determination.
The Regulatory Authority for Public Procurement (ARMP) has completed audits of government procurement
in 2008 which have been published in full on the website of the ARMP. To complete the reform of public
procurement, the ARMP has undertaken a review of the texts governing public procurement and the
Government adopted in August 2010 these revised texts which should encourage the use of country systems
by technical and financial partners.
23.      Moreover, strengthening the system of debt management is underway. In particular, the
government continues to prepare a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) per semester. The DSA of the first
half of 2011 includes an analysis of risks posed by contingent liabilities associated with guarantees issued by
the State, the PPP and operations of public enterprises. The government will develop a national strategy for
public debt in the medium term (three years) that will be annexed to the 2013 Law of Finance. To this end, it
benefited from an assessment of its capacity to manage debt (DeMPA) with recommendations that the
Government will implement, particularly through the National Committee of the Public Debt (CNDP). A
joint World Bank and IMF staff team helped to obtain the analytical tools required for the preparation of a
national Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) in line with international standards.

                             D. 2. Strengthening the National Statistical System

24.      The Statistical Master Plan (SDS 2008-2013) is the national framework for the development of
statistics in Senegal. It was developed following a broad participatory process and its implementation is
driven by the higher authorities of the National Statistical System (SSN), including the National Statistics
Council and its Executive Secretariat. To implement this program, the government allocates more and more
resources to the sector, notably through an increase in the budget of the National Agency of Statistics and
Demography (ANSD) and financing of the fourth general population census. In 2011, all instances of the
SSN are operational and the first meeting of the National Council of Statistics was held in March 2011. The
legal framework for statistical development will be completed, including the signing of the decree
establishing the National School of Statistics (ENSAE) and by the recent adoption in April 2011 by the
Council of Ministers of revisions to the 2004 Statistical Law that provide greater access to anonymised
primary data.
25.       To better coordinate the support to the sector and streamline human resources including
expertise in household surveys, the government will undertake consultations to develop a National
Survey Program (NSP) in between-census period. The NSP should have the following characteristics: (i)
it meets the needs of the third-generation Economic and Social Policy Document (DPES), the monitoring of
the MDGs, sector policies, other international commitments, and other users, (ii) it is the result of a national
wide debate between users and producers of the SSN, the technical and financial partners, parliamentarians,
civil society, private sector, (iii) it takes into account the current capacity of the SSN and existing constraints
(iv) it is updated every two years to reflect changing needs and progress in the surveys provided. Finally, the
Government will undertake a review of public expenditure in the field of statistics in order to have greater
visibility on the SSN resources, their effective use, and their effectiveness and efficiency.

                     IV. Guidelines on the Economic and Social Policy for 2011-2015

The strategy proposed in the 2011-2015 Economic and Social Policy Document (DPES) combines a
policy of accelerated growth that takes into account social aspects in order to create a livable, sustainable,
and equitable environment and to strengthen the foundations for sustainable human development.
Thus, the Government of Senegal has articulated its priorities around three strategic axes: (i) the
creation of wealth and economic opportunities for productive employment promotion and structural change,
(ii) acceleration of access to basic social services, social protection and sustainable human development, (iii)
and strengthening of the fundamental principles of good governance.


                                                       46
To this end, the Priority Action Program of the DPES 2011-2015 will be well articulated to the budget,
the PTIP and the emerging challenges that came out from the diagnosis of all sub-sectors and strategic
socio-economic directions. In doing so, the fiscal policy framework will reflect these priorities in order to
improve the allocation and use of resources and make more coherent the budget planning over the period
2011-2015.
In addition, the new vision of development highlights the conditions for the country to become an emerging
economy and for the acceleration of the achievement of the MDGs. Thus, the DPES Action Plan in 2011-
2015 sets the following priorities:

    1. Modernization of agriculture and development of the rural economy;
    2. Recovery and sustained development of the energy sector;
    3. Modernization and upgrading of the infrastructures;
    4. Improving basic social services for sustainable human development (education, health and nutrition,
       water supply and sanitation, social protection, etc.);
    5. Improving economic, judiciary, public administration, and local governance.\

                     Annex 5: Energy Sector Reforms under the 2008 DPO

1.      The objective of the 2008 Energy Sector Recovery Development Policy Credit (DPC) was to
ensure a sustained and sound long-term development of electricity services and supply of petroleum
products for Senegal. To achieve this objective, the operation comprises: (a) financial support to the
Government to allow the power utility of Senegal—SENELEC (National Power Utility of Senegal)—to
restore by end CY09 its financial equilibrium and to meet standard financial ratios and creditworthiness;
and (b) policy measures aimed at ensuring that the electricity sub-sector and the downstream hydrocarbon
sub-sector develop and operate in an efficient and transparent way with adequate governance.

2.       The Credit in the amount of SDR 49.1 million (equivalent to US$ 80 million) was approved
by the Board on June 19, 2008 and declared effective on September 5, 2008. After the Government of
Senegal met all prior actions and first tranche release conditions (see Table 1), an amount of SDR
34.4 million (US$ 56 million) was released as planned on September 25, 2008. Disbursement of the DPC
second tranche required that the Bank be satisfied that: (a) the macroeconomic framework remains
appropriate, (b) the implementation of the energy sector reform overall program is considered
satisfactory; and (c) the critical actions of the overall program (―Second Tranche Conditions‖) be
implemented.

3.       Most conditions under the second tranche aimed at strengthening the financial performance
of the entities in the sector. The second tranche conditions had been selected so as to complete the
recapitalization and refinancing of SENELEC and the electricity tariff adjustment process, adopting
transparent procurement rules for SENELEC and SAR in accordance with the national Procurement
Code, strengthening the internal audit functions of SENELEC and SAR, putting in place a competent
regulatory framework for the downstream hydrocarbon sub-sector and for supporting new and renewable
energies, and deciding on least-cost investment programs. There has been progress on several, but not all,
triggers (See detailed status of implementation in Table 2).

4.       The authorities and SENELEC have taken important actions toward the objectives of the
program, including: (a) developing private participation in the sector with three Independent Power
Producers (IPPs), and majority private participation in the oil refinery (SAR); (b) improving SENELEC‘s
operational performance through some efficiency gains; and (c) implementing legal and regulatory
measures to ensure the long term development of the energy sector, such as the renewable energy law, the
creation of a commission responsible for regulating the import, refining, storage and distribution of
petroleum products, (d) transferring to SAR the importation of petroleum products for SENELEC; (e)
initiating the process to diversify the energy mix and lower generation costs, with a coal power plant now
planned to be commissioned in 2014, additional hydropower and conversion of some generation units to
natural gas; and (b) launching the reform towards unbundling of SENELEC‘s activities.

5.       However, one of the program’s main goals, to fully restore SENELEC’s financial viability
without subsidy from the national budget starting from 2009, has not been reached. A number of
reasons account for this under-performance, including: the dramatic surge in oil prices in 2008;
government budget slippages, that led to long delays in the payment of the government‘s subsidy, and
various disruptions in fuel supply to SENELEC in 2009 and 2010. In addition, despite numerous tariff
adjustments between 2007 and 2009, the authorities had been unable to set a tariff properly benchmarked
to SENELEC‘s revenues and performance. Furthermore, the authorities have maintained a tariff
methodology —namely, a price cap averaged over five years—that has proven inadequate to ensure
SENELEC‘s financial viability on a yearly basis. This negative effect on the company‘s cash flow was
compounded by SENELEC‘s inability to mobilize debt or capital financing to cover its operational
deficit.


                                                   75
6.       Other key conditions for the disbursement for the DPC second tranche had limited
prospects of being achieved in the short term. The unbundling of SENELEC‘s production, transport
and distribution operations that was foreseen under the DPC had lost its urgency compared to the urgent
need to durably restore the quality of electricity supply, while further private participation in the
electricity sector (beyond improving the three existing IPPs) was no longer a reasonable prospect until the
operational and financial position of SENELEC improves. The DPC's specific governance conditions for
the once government-owned refining company (SAR) has been overridden by the return of SAR to
majority private shareholding, though this has not eliminated the need for appropriate regulation in the
downstream hydrocarbon sector. The related objective to establish an independent regulatory agency for
the hydrocarbon sector was also not completed as various options were still under evaluation.

7.       The cancellation was therefore the chosen option because the sector context has changed
radically since 2007, and the program supported under the DPC has lost relevance and potential
impact towards achieving energy sector viability and sustainability. With the DPC having lost some
of role in supporting relevant reforms at the current juncture, the energy sector restructuring and recovery
plan under preparation by the sector authorities opens up new perspectives. It also gives an opportunity to
the Bank and the Government to re-align their vision on revised sector development objectives and
strategy.

                                     of the electricity and hydrocarbon sub-sectors
 1. Partial recapitalization of SENELEC through the transfer by the Government of SENEGAL to SENELEC of an
 amount equal to 65 billion FCFA (―2007 Recapitalization Amount‖).
 2. Cosigned letter by State Minister, Minister of Economy and Finance and by Minister of Energy, confirming decision
 and engagement by the Government of SENEGAL to:
   i. further recapitalize SENELEC through additional transfers to SENELEC of an amount equal to 37 billion FCFA in
      Fiscal Year 2008 (―2008 Recapitalization Amount‖) and of an amount equal to 7 billion FCFA in Fiscal Year 2009
      (―2009 Recapitalization Amount‖) so as to enable SENELEC to: (a) achieve a debt-service coverage ratio of at
      least 1.2 in Fiscal Year 2009, 1.3 in Fiscal Year 2010 and 1.4 in each Fiscal Year thereafter; (b) reduce its accounts
      receivable so that in Fiscal Year 2008 and at all times thereafter, they do not exceed 95 days; (c) reduce its arrears to
      its suppliers so that they do not exceed 100 days in Fiscal Year 2008, 95 days in Fiscal Year 2009 and 90 days at all
      times thereafter;
  ii. make further transfers to SENELEC in Fiscal Year 2008 (in addition to the 2008 Recapitalization Amount) in
      amounts sufficient to enable SENELEC to earn an amount equal to its Maximum Authorized Revenue, as decided
      by CRSE during its Extraordinary Review in 2008 (―2008 Maximum Authorized Revenue Amount‖); and
 iii. adjust SENELEC‘s electricity tariffs so that its average electricity tariff is sufficient to enable it in Fiscal Year 2009
      to produce revenues without budgetary transfers from the Recipient equal to its Maximum Authorized Revenue, as
      decided by CRSE during its Extraordinary Review in 2008 (―2009 Maximum Authorized Revenue Amount‖); and
 iv. reschedule the existing arrears on SENELEC‘s debt to the Government of SENEGAL over 5 years, with no penalty
      interest; and
  v. transfer to SENELEC in Fiscal Year 2009, in addition to the 2009 Recapitalization, an amount equal to 9 billion
      FCFA as a ―subordinated loan from the Government of SENEGAL/Shareholder to SENELEC‖ repayable
      commencing 2011.
 3. Following SAR‘s Board decision to pursue SAR‘s activities, cosigned letter by State Minister, Minister of Economy
 and Finance, and by Minister of Energy, confirming decision and engagement by the Government of SENEGAL to
 recapitalize SAR by the end of Fiscal Year 2009 in accordance with the requirements of the OHADA Legislation.
 Policy Area 2: Improving the governance of the electricity and hydrocarbon sub-sectors
 4. SENELEC‘s Board Agreement to establish two committees to assist its Board of Directors: (i) a Finance and Internal
 Audit Committee comprised, inter alia, of accounting and auditing professionals from the private sector, and (ii) an
 Investment Committee; Presidents of each Committee appointed; mandates of each Committee prepared.
 5. Transmission to the Association of the draft decree for the establishment of an agency to be responsible for regulating
 the import, refinery, storage, and distribution of petroleum products in the SENEGAL Republic‘s territory.

  Annex 6: Complementarities with Other Bank Activities and Analytical Underpinnings

Component 1. Private sector development.

A planned Economic Governance Project will provide focused assistance that fosters an improved
effectiveness of the (commercial) justice system and a better investment climate. The Project will help
improve economic governance through the following actions: (a) strengthening the Cellule d’Exécution
Administrative et Financière (CENTIF); (b) strengthening the Public Procurement Investigation Unit, and
(c) fostering business-led actions against corruption. Project design benefited from lessons learned in the
implementation of two World Bank investment operations in Senegal that supported investment climate
reform and institution building—the Private Investment Promotion Project (Credit 3762 SE) and the
Private Sector Adjustment Credit (Credit SE 3875). Experience from these two projects shows that
investment climate reform is interactive and requires strong champions and consensus building. Project
preparation also benefited from WBI‘s knowledge of emerging good practices and international
experience in economic governance, in line with the World Bank‘s governance and anticorruption (GAC)
strategy. Finally, the Project also builds on the 2006 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) Corporate Governance Country Assessment, Senegal, which was drafted following wide-ranging
consultation. In the areas of small and medium business taxation and fostering trade, the collaborative
development by the Government, the Bank and donor partners of the analytical basis for policy
development and implementation is built into the design of the PRSC series.

Component 2: Human Development

Education. The Bank has several active instruments in support of the Government‘s 10-year National
Education Development Program, including the Quality Education for All APL 2 (P089254), and a
successor Education program to support construction and rehabilitation of elementary classrooms, also
funded under the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund (US$81.5 million, FY09-11), and several trust funds (see
CPSPR). Additional analytical inputs in the preparation of the PRSC were provided under the Education
component of the Bank‘s Programmatic.

Health and Nutrition. Bank support to the Government‘s health sector program has included support
through the first series of PRSC (PRSC-I, II and III), the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control project, and
several technical assistance projects, including a Hospital Reform TA and a TA to support the MoH‘s
medium-term expenditure framework. In Nutrition, the Bank‘s Nutrition Enhancement Project is the
center-piece of the Government‘s PRN.

Component 3: Mitigating Vulnerabilities

Social Protection and Safety Nets

The collaborative development by the Government, the Bank and donor partners of the analytical basis
for policy development and implementation is built into the design of the PRSC series. First, a full-
fledged evaluation of the NETS project will be carried out in FY10-11. This will help gain better
understanding of the development impact as well as the operational bottlenecks of direct cash transfers in
Senegal. Second, a Bank-led technical assistance initiative on strengthening national statistics and poverty
estimates is ongoing and will be essential in getting accurate information about the poor and their
characteristics. Finally, the PRSC-supported analytical program will seek to (i) determine the efficacy of
different targeting mechanisms; and (ii) map out and assess existing social safety nets programs under the
social safety nets component of the PPFR, including beneficiary impact assessments. Additional
analytical underpinnings to this component of the PRSC program include donor-supported analytical
work on social Protection, including UNICEF-funded study by P. Pereznieto and A. Fall (2009) ‗Social

Protection and Children in West and Central Africa: Case Study Senegal‘. Simulations carried out by the
authors suggest that the addition of a child-focused cash transfer could produce a significant reduction in
aggregate poverty in Senegal ranging from 8.3 percent (proxy-means targeted) to 15.2 percent (universal).
However, they estimate that the (benefit) costs of such a program may vary from 3.7 percent to
6.4 percent of GDP, well beyond the fiscal reach of the Authorities, although they suggest that reducing
costs to even an ambitious 2 percent of GDP could be done through either reducing the target population
(age range, quintiles of poverty), or the generosity of the transfer (from 30 percent to 15 percent of the
poverty line), and funded in part through the reallocation of expenditure on food and fuel subsidies and
existing programs. Additional material includes Bank ESW (the 2006 ‗Managing Risks in Rural Senegal:
a multi-sectoral review of efforts to reduce vulnerability‘ study) and analytical work has been prepared in
the areas of Vulnerable Youth, school dropouts, crop insurance, non-farm Employment, migrant street
children in Dakar, as well as the FY09 Poverty Assessment.

Environmental Sustainability

Fisheries. In the fisheries sector, the World Bank is also supporting direct investment in the reform of the
fisheries sector in Senegal. First, the Bank is supporting a $10 million IDA credit for fisheries in the
Integrated Coastal and Marine Resource Management (GIRMaC) project and $9.5 million in IDA credits
and GEF grants through the Sustainable Management of Fish Resources (GDRH) project. These two
projects are being jointly implemented, with the GIRMaC beginning in 2005 and continuing until the end
of 2011, and the GDRH starting in 2010 and continuing until the end of 2012.

The objective of both projects is to empower communities to reduce fishing pressure on the fish stocks
supporting the central coastal fisheries of Senegal, with this area serving as a pilot for broader fishing
reform throughout the country. The two projects are supporting the establishment of government
partnerships with 12 coastal communities in this region to more sustainably manage the central coastal
demersal fisheries including establishment of both private community fishers management groups and
public-private multi-community local artisanal fisheries councils, in conjunction with a pilot fund to help
support alternative livelihoods to fishing by providing micro-finance and technical assistance to fishers.
At the national level, these two projects are supporting the development of two national fisheries
management plans, and the introduction of a national fishing vessel registration program.

Building on the pilot introduced by these two projects in the central coastal fisheries, the Board of IDA
recently approved the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program (WARFP). This regional multi-phase
APL is providing $15 million in IDA credits to Senegal from 2010 to the end of 2014, in order to (i)
expand to the entire country the central coastal pilots of community partnerships (establishing private
community fishing groups and public-private multi-community local artisanal fisheries councils, together
with the alternative livelihoods fund), reduce the size of the industrial fishing fleet targeting the coastal
demersal fisheries by decommissioning a number of vessels, strengthen fisheries surveillance capacity to
reduce illegal fishing in coastal waters, and support the introduction of new fish landing site clusters to
increase local value-added to fish products. Through the GDRH and subsequently the WARPF, the
World Bank will finance investments in a mechanism, the alternative livelihoods fund, to help provide a
social safety net for those fishers negatively impacted by restrictions on access to the fish resources.

Analytical material underpinning the design of these investment projects and the proposed PRSC support
are based on several analytical pieces of work, including (a) a 2005 formal economic and sector work
(ESW) on the fisheries sector in Senegal; (b) a 2007 series of grey literature prepared as part of the
appraisal of the GDRH project; (c) a 2008/2009 series of grey literature prepared as part of the appraisal
of the WARFP in Senegal (including an economic model of the coastal demersal fisheries, and a
summary of current information and data on the sector), and (d) the 2008 Letter of Sector Policy, which
includes a diagnostic assessment of the sector.

Coastal erosion. The collaborative development by the Government, the Bank and donor partners of the
analytical basis for policy development and implementation is built into the design of the PRSC series.
The WB will support the Government efforts in climate change adaptation, and disaster risk reduction,
including coastal erosion, which is a key natural – and economic -- risk faced by Senegal. Given the
economic importance of the country‘s coastal zone, a particular attention will be given in the upcoming
CPS to its sustainable development and management, including protection against coastal erosion and
long-term adaptation to climate change. An economic study will be carried out to characterize the level
of vulnerability of selected assets at risk, using a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) approach to inform
decision-makers and investors and improve planned investments, and make a case for the most effective
use of available as well as additional funding for protection and adaptation measures.

Forest Resource Management. The Bank has a long-standing program to support the development of
community-managed forests. Starting in 1998, the government requested support from the Bank to
launch a project (Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project) whose main objective was to
meet an important part of the rapidly growing urban demand for household fuels without the loss of forest
cover and the ecosystem‘s carbon sequestration potential and biodiversity. The funding of a first
operation which ended in December 2004 was US$20 million, followed by a successor operation in a
transition phase ending December 2008 for US$7.2 million. A successor operation is being contemplated
as part of the preparation of the upcoming CPS.

Component 4: Governance

Public Financial Management. PFM reforms have been supported under the first series of PRSCs, and
the agenda presented in this operation builds on these efforts. The preparation of the proposed PRSC
series relied on extensive core diagnostic assessments by other donors or the World Bank in collaboration
with the government in the PFM area. They include past Public Expenditure Reviews (2005 and 2006),
the 2002 CFAA and the 2003 CPAR which document fiscal policy issues as well as the numerous
weaknesses in PFM, and provide a range of recommendations on the legal framework and operational
approaches, including the integrated PFM system, on which the proposed operation has drawn
extensively. In addition, the design of PFM reforms in the proposed operation also relied heavily on the
EU-funded PEFA diagnostic of 2007, an IMF Fiscal Affairs Department Technical Assistance report on
public financial management that the authorities shared with the Bank and other donors, and additional
expert assistance, particularly in the areas of land property management, integrated financial management
systems, and wage bill management. An extensive review of emerging PFM issues is also planned to be a
component of the PPFR. This material will form the basis of the design of a technical assistance and
capacity building operation developed within the framework of the Economic Governance Project (see
para. 4.12). Donors have expressed interest in collaborating in the design or co-financing Bank
instruments in this area.

Public Procurement. The Bank has a long-standing program of support to procurement reforms in
Senegal, including with capacity building under the Private Investment Promotion Project and the
planned Economic Governance project. Analytical material underpinning the design of the PRSC series in
this area drew the 2003 CPAR that initiated an in-depth reform for improving transparency and efficiency
of the national procurement system (NPS). The CPAR identified several weaknesses, namely (i)
inconsistencies and lack of procurement documentation at the level of the legal and regulatory
framework; (ii) non transparent procurement methods and procedures leading to abusive use of sole
source method for awarding public contracts and unjustified derogatory system for several public
agencies; (iii) weak and inefficient internal and external controls mechanisms (for prior reviews, audits,
complaints) and (iv) inefficient measures to prevent and detect fraud and corruption in public
procurement. More recently, in the context of a Use of Country Systems program, the Bank team carried
out a comprehensive assessment was under the 2008 OECD/DAC methodology. This assessment
concluded that persisting issues remain to be dealt with in order to benefit from the new procurement


                                                   82
legal and regulatory framework. The key issues raised are as follows: (i) lack of procurement
documentation and National Standard Bidding Documents (NSBDs); (ii) delay in making fully
operational the new institutional framework for respectively regulating and controlling procurement
transactions; (iii) non-functional mechanisms and tools for integrating procurement into public finance
management system (PFM), collecting and monitoring statistics, and ensuring effective and sustainable
procurement capacity development; and (iv) persistence of weak internal and external controls of
procurement transactions.

Debt management. The authorities‘ debt management reform agenda benefited from a recent Bank-led
Senegal Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) [as yet unknown if the authorities will
consent to the publication of the DeMPA – if they consent, the summary table of DeMPA indicators will
be annexed to the PD]. The assessment identified strengths and weaknesses in debt management
mentioned in paragraphs above.

Statistics. The Bank is supporting the design of the 2010 Household Survey and has a long-standing
collaboration with the ANSD, especially including in capacity building and survey design. The
collaborative development by the Government, the Bank and donor partners of the analytical basis for
policy development and implementation in statistical development is built into the design of the PRSC
series.

 IMF Executive Board Completes Final Review Under PSI with Senegal and Approves
                             New Three-Year PSI

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the sixth
and final review under Senegal’s Policy Support Instrument (PSI) and approved a new three-
year PSI. To this end, the Executive Board cancelled the current PSI, which was scheduled to
expire on December 22, 2010. The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income
countries that may not need financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring, and
endorsement of their policy frameworks. PSI-supported programs are based on country-
owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society
and development partners (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).

The authorities’ program aims to lay the foundations for strong, sound, and sustainable
growth, with a view to paving the way for Senegal to become an emerging market economy.
Senegal’s program will build on the progress made under the previous PSI-supported
program with maintaining macroeconomic discipline and fostering economic growth.

Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Senegal, Mr. John Lipsky, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:

“The Senegalese authorities are to be commended for the satisfactory implementation of their
economic program under the Policy Support Instrument. Economic growth recovered in 2010
and is expected to strengthen further in 2011. Significant progress on the policy front has
been made, and the authorities are committed to pursue further reforms to address the
important challenges that remain.

“Policies under the successor PSI will focus on increasing economic growth and improving
resilience to shocks to help Senegal meet its development and poverty reduction objectives.
Macroeconomic stability will be maintained through sound fiscal policy. Measures to
increase revenues and improve the quality of spending will help create fiscal space for more
priority spending, including infrastructure investment. To accommodate the additional
infrastructure spending, the fiscal deficit will be temporarily higher, but will need to be
reduced in the medium term to maintain a low risk of debt distress.
                                               2


“Key structural reforms under the program include consolidating gains in public financial
management and strengthening public investment planning and debt management. To reap
the full benefits of additional investment and unlock the economy’s growth potential, the
program also focuses on improving the business climate, supporting better governance, and
promoting efficient energy and financial sectors. These reforms will help address key
bottlenecks to growth and create a business-friendly environment conducive to private sector
development,” Mr Lipsky added.



ANNEX

Recent Economic Developments

Economic growth in Senegal was slowed in recent years by the food and fuel price shocks
and the global financial crisis. Indicators point to an ongoing economic recovery, which
appears to be strengthening. Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 4 percent in 2010
and 4.4 percent in 2011 after averaging 2.7 percent in 2008 and 2009. Inflation turned
positive in June 2010 for the first time in more than a year, and has picked up mainly because
of higher food prices. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to reach 4.8 percent of GDP in
2010, broadly in line with the budget target. The impact of the global financial crisis on
workers’ remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI) has been smaller than originally
expected. The current account deficit is projected to change little in 2010 and remain at about
8 percent of GDP.

Following progress in macroeconomic and social outcomes since the mid-1990s, going
forward the main challenge for Senegal will be to achieve higher growth in order to further
reduce poverty and make progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. During the
past 15 years, real per capita GDP growth in Senegal was more than 2 percent lower a year
than in the best-performing, non-oil exporting countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Senegal lags
these countries in a number of areas including infrastructure, non-price competitiveness, and
strength of fiscal institutions, as well as factors such as governance, the quality of
institutions, and financial market development.

Program Summary

Increasing growth and improving resilience to shocks are priorities for the successor PSI. To
reach these objectives, the authorities’ policies under the PSI-supported economic program
are aimed at

(i) Maintaining macroeconomic stability, supported by a sound fiscal policy and
improvements in debt management;
                                              3


(ii) Increasing government revenues to create more room in the budget for priority spending,
including higher public investment in infrastructure, coupled with better investment planning
and higher expenditure quality;
(iii) Consolidating progress in Public Financial Management by improving budget credibility
and implementation and avoiding accumulation of new payment delays; and
(iv) pursuing structural reforms leading to an improved business climate, better governance,
and more effective energy and financial sectors.

The reforms could result in higher trend growth than currently projected if the synergies of
complementary reforms materialize.
