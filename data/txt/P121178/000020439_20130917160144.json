"Ratings for the Fourth and Fifth Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit Projects for Senegal were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Budget support can be an effective tool to mobilize the\n            ministry of finance on sectoral reform, under the right\n            circumstances. Policy-based lending under a harmonized\n            approach among donors can be an effective tool to strengthen\n            the country-based development model. Ministries and agencies\n            participating in budget support operations have a tendency\n            to focus on the realization of prior actions, so systematic\n            follow-up actions are needed. More attention to political\n            economy considerations may be needed to better understand\n            opposition to reform, particularly in sensitive areas."}, "docdt": "2012-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
