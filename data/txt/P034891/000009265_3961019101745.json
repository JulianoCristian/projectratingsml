It includes a 2-3\n            year pilot program to increase government decentralization,\n            transparency and village participation. Main features are:\n            1) empowering villagers to decide, with some economic\n            criteria, priority uses of the village grant under the\n            project; 2) creation of jobs paid in cash for poor\n            villagers, especially in periods of underemployment; 3)\n            development of skills for constructing small public works -\n            engineering assistance will be provided to villagers to help\n            with subproject design and achieving good quality works; 4)\n            channelling of village grants through subdistrict branches\n            of Bank Rakyat Indonesia; and 5) a monitoring program to\n            review progress while the project is underway and overall\n            results, expost."}, "docdt": "1995-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
