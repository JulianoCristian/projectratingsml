ARTICLE II
Guarantee; Provision of Funds
Section 2.01. Without limitation or restriction upon any of
its other obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, Togo hereby
unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor and not as surety
merely, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the premium, if any,
on the prepayment of the Loan, all as set forth in the Loan Agree-
ment.
Section 2.02. (a) Togo shall exercise its rights and powers
as a signatory of the Treaty and as a shareholder of the Borrower
and every other right, power or remedy available to it to permit
or cause the Borrower to perform all its obligations under the
Loan Agreement, and it shall not take, nor cause or permit any
of its political subdivisions or any of its agencies or any agency
of any such political subdivisions to take, any action which would
prevent or interfere with the performance by the Borrower of its
obligations contained in the Loan Agreement.
(b) Without limitation or restriction upon the provisions

maintain and renew all rights, privileges, franchises, licenses,
consents or other rights required for the carrying out of the
Project or the operation of the facilities included therein, (ii)

﻿ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, specific security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority
over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of
foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such
member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external debt,
which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of the
creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization or
distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank,
equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, the Loan, and Togo, in creating or permitting
the creation of such lien, shall make express provision to that
effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional or
other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect to
any lien created on assets of any of its political or administra-
tive subdivisions, Togo shall promptly and at no cost to the Bank
secure the principal of, and interest and other charges on, the
Lczi by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfactory
to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely


﻿-6-
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking trans-
actions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after
its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of Togo, of any political or administrative subdivision
thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or operating
for the account or benefit of, Togo or any such subdivision, in-
cluding gold and other foreign exchange assets held by any insti-
tution performing the functions of a central bank or exchange
stabilization fund, or similar functions, for Togo.
Section 3.02. Togo undertakes:
(a) to exercise its rights and powers as a signatory of
the Treaty to cause or permit the Borrower to set its prices for
the sale of clinker at such a level as will permit the Borrower
to meet all its obligations, including debt service, and to earn
a reasonable return on capital invested;
(b) to provide the Borrower, or cause the Borrower to be
provided, with all such information as the Borrower shall re-
quire to establish adequate projections for clinker demand in
Togo's territory;
(c) to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable action
necessary or appropriate to cause and enable the Borrower to
fulfill its obligations with respect to the payment of the guar-
antee fee referred to in Section 2.09 of the Loan Agreement; and


﻿(d) (i) to duly perform all its obligations under the Treaty
and under the instrument referred to in Recital (J) to the Loan
Agreement, provided that such obligations are not inconsistent with
a provision hereunder, in which case such provision shall govern,
and (ii) without the Bank's prior approval, (A) not to consent to
any modification or termination of the Treaty, of such instrument
or of the Borrower's Statutes, nor (B) to sell, pledge or other-
vise dispose of any of its shares of the Borrower or permit a
change in the percentage of its holdings of such shares.
Section 3.03. Togo undertakes: (i) to take, or cause to be
taken, all reasonable action necessary or appropriate to cause
and enable each of CEB, CEET, CFT, PAL and Togo's Ministare des
Travaux Publics et des Mines (hereinafter called the Ministry)
to fulfill promptly as required for the purposes of the Project
all its obligations under the respective agreements listed in
Recital (G) to the Loan Agreement and in Section 4.07 (iii) of
the Loan Agreement; (ii) whenever there is reasonable cause to
believe that the funds available to the Ministry will be inade-
quate to meet the expenditures required for the carrying out by
the Ministry of its obligations with respect to the carrying
out of any part of the Infrastructure Project under such respec-
tive agreement, to make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
promptly to provide the Ministry, or cause the Ministry to be
provided, with such funds as are required to meet such expendi-
tures; (iii) to employ an expert acceptable to the Bank to co-
ordinate the carrying out of the Infrastructure Project by the
Ministry; (iv) to cause such additional technical assistance to
be provided to CFT as shall be required to enable CFT to carry


﻿-8-
out its obligations under its agreement with the Borrower refer-
red to in Recital (G) to the Loan Agreement; (v) to continue to
cause such technical assistance to be provided to PAL as shall
be required to ensure an efficient operation of PAL's port
facilities in Lomg; and (vi) to furnish to the Bank all such in-
formation concerning the carrying out of the Infrastructure Proj-
ect as the Bank shall reasonably request and to enable the Bank's
representatives to visit the facilities and construction sites in-
cluded in the Infrastructure Project.
Section 3.04. Togo undertakes to cause to be provided to the
Borrover, upon terms and conditions satisfactory to Togo and the
Borrower, as and when required all such electric power and fuel
oil as shall be needed for the operation of the facilities in-
cluded in the Project as well as of the rail/port terminal in-
cluded in Part D.2 of the Infrastructure Project.
