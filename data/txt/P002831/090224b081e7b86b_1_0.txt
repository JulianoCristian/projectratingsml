ARTICLE II

interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the premium, if any,
on the prepayment of the Loan, all as set forth in the Loan Agree-
ment.
Section 2.02. (a) Ghana shall exercise its rights and powers
as a signatory of the Treaty and as a shareholder of the Borrower
and every other right, power or remedy available to it to permit
or cause the Borrower to perform all its obligations under the

﻿ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, specific security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority
over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of
foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such
member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external debt,
which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of the
creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization or
distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank,
equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, the Loan, and Ghana, in creating or permitting
the creation of such lien, shall make express provision to that
effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional or
other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect to
any lien created on assets of any of its political or administra-
tive subdivisions, Ghana shall promptly and at no cost to the
Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other charges on,
the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfac-
tory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely


﻿-6-
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking trans-
actions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after
its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of Ghana, of any political or administrative subdivision
thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or operating
for the account or benefit of, Ghana or any such subdivision,
including gold and other foreign exchange assets held by any in-
stitution performing the functions of a central bank or exchange
stabilization fund, or similar functions, for Ghana.
Section 3.02. Ghana undertakes:
(a) to exercise its rights and powers as a signatory of
the Treaty to cause or permit the Borrower to set its prices for
the sale of clinker at such a level as will permit the Borrower
to meet all its obligations, including debt service, and to earn
a reasonable return on capital invested;
(b) to provide the Borrower, or cause the Borrower to be
provided, with all such information as the Borrower shall re-
quire to establish adequate projections for clinker demand in
Ghana's territory;
(c) to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable action
necessary as appropriate to cause and enable the Borrower to
fulfill its obligations with respect to the payment of the guar-
antee fee referred to in Section 2.09 of the Loan Agreement; and


﻿(d) (i) to duly perform all its obligations under the
Treaty and under the instrument referred to in Recital (J) to the
Loan Agreement, provided that such obligations are not inconsis-
tent with a provision hereunder, in which case such provision
shall govern, and (ii) without the Bank's prior approval, (A)
not to consent to any modification or termination of the Treaty,
of such instrument or of the Borrower's Statutes, nor (B) to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of any of its shares of the Borrower
