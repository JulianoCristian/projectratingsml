sustainable income generation\n            for its poor urban residents--mostly long-term poor, whose\n            incomes are eroded by high inflation, or who lost sources of\n            income in the economic downturn. The project also seeks to\n            strengthen the capability of local agencies to assist poor\n            communities; mobilize informal and private sector local\n            institutions and expertise; encourage broader participation\n            in decisionmaking about community matters; and provide equal\n            opportunity to men and women. The project funds subprojects,\n            providing revolving capital for income generation and grants\n            for basic infrastructure works; economic activities\n            including activities in urban agriculture, group training in\n            the communities, sewing machine or computer equipment,\n            programs for children and youth, community-based housing,\n            and family planning education; and related employment\n            activities such as training programs. Also provided is\n            technical assistance for implementation and monitoring,\n            specifically for project management, oversight consultants,\n            and facilitators."}, "docdt": "1999-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
