Many of the key lessons learned were not about\n            building infrastructure or running revolving funds, but were\n            about implementing effective, large-scale community-driven\n            development (CDD) programs and developing community-based\n            organizations that people could trust to make decisions and\n            implement poverty alleviation projects on their behalf.\n            Among the lessons were: 1) Accountability and transparency\n            in community-driven development projects depend critically\n            on how the community leadership is chosen.  2) A process\n            that allows community members to develop and articulate the\n            core values they appreciate in the leadership of community\n            organizations is a vital ingredient for a successful\n            election. 3)Building on intrinsic motivation for leadership\n            and human capital must be emphasized.  4) The traditional\n            approach of formal evaluation after completion of each\n            project phase is ineffective for CDD programs; rather, a\n            culture of continual learning, self-evaluation and\n            improvement is more valuable. 5) Positive impacts of\n            successful community participation can only be scaled up if\n            combined with effective local government participation, but\n            this process takes time to evolve. 6) A creative,\n            multi-layered management structure is a prerequisite for\n            successful implementation of large-scale CDD projects. Such\n            a structure should include conventional layers of\n            accountability to effectively decentralize implementation,\n            and a clearly articulated feedback system. 7) The success of\n            the program depends fundamentally on the facilitators; the\n            management structure should be designed to support\n            facilitators rather than supervise them. 8) Appropriate\n            numbers of facilitators in each community are critical to\n            developing community ownership. 9) Micro-credit through BKMs\n            (these are community-based organizations) is not an\n            effective way to reach the poorest of the poor; BKMs have\n            incentives to preserve their capital so they tend to be risk\n            averse, and thus tend to lend money to existing small\n            businesses, which are generally not run by the poorest people."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
