AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SU111ARY AMD CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an Agricultural Credit Project for which
a Bank loan of US$20 million equivalent is proposed.  This would be the
first agricultural project the Bank has helped to finance in Israel. It
would support a three-year lending program, mainly to cooperative farmLng
enterprises and processing and exporting entities, through the three
banks presently engaged in agricultural credit, the Israel Bank of AgricuJ-
ture Ltd, (IBA) (90% Government owned); Yaad Agricultural Development Bank
Ltd. (YAAD) (50% Government owned); and NIR Ltd. (privately owned)o IBA,
the largest of the three, would be the borrower, and primarily responsible
for Project administration. It would onlend to the other two participatirg
banks under subsidiary loan agreements, The Project does not involve the
occupied territories and East Jerusalem.
ii,       The annual rate of growth in gross agricultural product averaged
14% during 1950-1960 and 6% in the 1960ts compared with an overall average
growth rate of gross   national   product of 509%.. The saturation of
certain sectors of the internal market, coupled with pressures on the
balance of payments, has placed the emphasis for agricultural development
on export and import substitution crops. Total agricultural exports are
planned to raise their share in total agricultural output from 23% in 1966/6;'
to about 30% in 1972/73-
iii.      The Project has, therefore, been designed to increase participaris'
production of expor- crops such as flowers (roses, carnations and gladioli"
subtropical fruits (avocados, mangoes, tangerines and grapefruit), and off-
season vegetables (lettuces, celery, carrots, artichokes, etc.) mainly by
investment in greenhouses, packing and handling facilities and irrigation.
The estimated value of production attributable to the Project would amount
to It 118 million (US$34 million) annually at full development. Exports
would mainly be to Western European markets where Israel enjoys an advant,.-
over competitors due to its ecological and climatic conditions coupled wit:.
advanced agricultural and marketing techniques,
iv.       The export crops are highly perishable and require specialized
hand)ling, storage, packing and transport facilities if they are to reach
highly selective overseas markets in a condition which will cammand high
prices. In some cases, existing storage and handling facilities are
inadequate (Lod Airport and Ashdod Port), and increased production would
also necessitate an increase in export handling facilities, Provision has)
therefore, been made in the Project for the improvement and expansion of
such facilities.
Ve,       A major limiting factor to increased agricultural production is
the supply and efficient use of water. Israel has been extremely successf'iL.
in maximizing yields through the use of advanced techniques and a furthar



- ii -
increase in production would be achieved if the irrigated area could be
extended.  The Project, therefore, provides a modest water development
program.
vi.       The Extension Service, which is well organized, has a staff of
over 600 of whom some 450 are specialists. It is capable of supervising
the proposed Project without further assistance.
vii.      Total Project costs would amount to US$49 million equivalent.
Subborrowers, the participating banks and Government would contribute 20%
each. The proposed loan, equivalent to about 40% of total Project costs,
would cover the estimated foreign exchange component. Subborrowers would
be charged the prevailing commercial rate of interest of 9% per annum.
viii.     The range of items to be financed under the Project is very
varied and not suitable for bulk procurement. Nany items are manufactured
in Israel from imported materials. Supplies are adequate, prices competi-
tive and servicing good. No tariffs are levied on agricultural machinery
and irrigation equipment, which may be imported freely, and there are
sufficient importers to ensure adequate competition. "With the exception
noted below, procurement would, therefore, be through normal commercial
channels, prices being subject to the approval of the banks granting the
loans. The handling facilities for the national exporting agency, the
Agricultural Export Co. Ltd. (AGREXC0) are larger self-contained schemes
suitable for international competitive bidding which would be used for
this part of the Project.
ix.       The overall economic rate of return is estimated at about 18%.
The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$20 million equivalent for a
term of 17 years, including a grace period of four years. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk.



ISRAEL
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank of Israel, on behalf of the Government, applied for a
Bank loan of about US$50 million, disbursable over five years, to help
finance an agricultural credit project. This was the first request from
Israel for a loan for agriculture, The five-year proposed lending program
included nine subprojects covering a wide range of investments in such
items as irrigation, livestock, settlements and crop development and
processing.
1.02      A Bank mission visited Israel in June 1969 and reported that
several of the subprojects were in an advanced stage of preparation and
could be completed without Bank assistance. After consultations, the
Government proposed that priority be given to the development of water
resources, export crops, and packing and handling facilities.
1.03      The Project, as now presented, includes a three-year agricultural
credit program with subloans for three types of activities:
a) export crop development;
b) export handling facilities; and
c) water development (including drainage).
1.0A      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Israel in November 1969 consisting of 1vIessrs, W.H. Spall and KeH. Haasjes
(of the Bank) and E. Quicke (of the FAO/IERD Cooperative Program).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
Geographic and Climatic Features
2.01      Israel is situated at the eastern littoral of the Pbditerranean
between latitudes 30° 151 and 290 301.  It covers about 21,000 kmn2, being
some 420 km long and varying in width from 110 km to 15 km, Population at
the end of 1968 was about 2.8 million.
2.02      The climate is characterized by a clear division into a rainy
season (winter) and a dry season (summer). The annual rainfall varies froJi
50 am in the south to 900 rmm in the north. Temperatures generally increase
from north to south and vary according to altitude. Jerusalem (800 m above
sea level) has an absolute maximum of 450C and a minimum of minus 30Co In
the Jordan Valley (Bet Shaan), the mean winter temperature is 10-200C r i-
to 360C in summer.  In the south, temperatures ri3e to well over L,c.



-2-
i..culture in the _c_
2.03      Farming has undergone profound changes during the past 20 years
during which new crops have been introduced (sugar beets, cotton, ground-
nuts, flovers, subtropical fruits and off-season vegetables) and techno-
logical advances have resulted in increased yields. From 1948 until 1959,
agricultural production mas diiacted toward food crops for domestic con-
sumption.  However, the use of advanced techniques led to over-production
and from 1960, the emphasis has been on production for export particularly
of high-value crops for the Western European market, During the 10 years
1950-1960, the annual groith in gross agricultural prodact averaged 14%
and during the 1960ts, averaged 6% compared with an overall growth of 5.91V
At present, agriculture accounts for about 7%  of GI1P and 17  of the country's
exports. Agricultural production (at 1966 prices) increased more than six-
fold between 1948 (IS 275 million or U$ 79 million) and 1968 (IE 1,681 mil-
lion or US$480 million). The number of people presently engaged in agri-
culture is 104,000, roughly 12. of the active labor force.
2.0o      In 1968, the value of agricultural imports, excluding inputs and
nachinery, amounted to US$89 million, mainly consisting of cereals and
ineat. I-leat imports accounted for US$19 million (2P16)O
2.O5      lxport of agricltural produce in 1968 amounted to US$312 mil-
lion (compared uith US&l8 million in 1948), of which citrus accounted for
approximately 80Q%, Export of subtropical fruits, flow-ers and off-season
vegetables is, however, increasing and the value rose from US$7 million
in 1965 to US315 rmillion in 1968, It is planned to raise the share of
agricultural export products in total agricultural output from 23" in
1966/67 to about 30p in 1972/73.
2,o6      Out of a total land area of 2.1 million ha, 480,000 ha are culti-
vated of which some 170,000 ha (compared with 120,000 ha in 1960) are
irrigated (one third cit2us). A further 800,000 ha are suitable only for
grazing and/or afiorestation. The major limiting factor to the expansion
of agricultural production is not land but water.  Increased production
and income will depend upon changing the cropping pattern to high value
products and extending the irrigated area.
Irrigation
2.07      Israeli agriculture is heavily dependent on irrigation,  As very
little land can be irxrigated by gravity, most of the water must be pumped
fror,a streams, wells and Lake Tiberias. In order to maximize the use of
water, the most modern irrigation devices and techniques are being intro-
duced and obsolete installations replaced. This px'ogran will require sub-
stantial investrlment over a number of years.
2,08      In the last 10 years, water use in agriculture has risen from
990 million m3 to 1,300 million m3, About half of the additional water has
been supplied by wells and streams and the other half from Lake Tiberias.
The installed capacity of the pumping station at Lake Tiberias is 320



- 3 -
million m3 per year, of which in 1968/69 265 million m3 were utilized. The
proposed Project is designed to iLprove the efficiency of the water presern.5I'y
utilized on about 60,000 ha (ara 4.08) and the resulting water savings
would permit an increase in crop yields of existing but poorly irrigated
areas and extension of new irrigated areas.
2.09      In Israel, water supply and use are strictly controlled by a water
law, administered by the Water Coni ssioner, which provides for a quota and
licensing system for all sources of supply. Supplies from private sources
are developed by the owners (often with loans from the agricultural banks)
who are responsible for all subsequent maintenance and costs. Public sup-
plies come from MEKOROT IWater Co. Ltd., a public corporation responsible
for major water resource developments in Israel which in 1969/70 will supply
about 921 million m3, of which some 735 million m3 (80%) will be for agri-
culture, the remainder being for domestic and industrial use. TAEKOROT is
responsible for the collection of water rates in accordance with the Wat_zr
Law. In the South, rates are below actual costs but in the North (the area
of cheap water), consumers pay a surcharge to the Water Equalization Fund
of the actual cost which is below IL 0.06 per m3.
Farming System, Farm Size and Tenancy
2.10      The farming system in Israel differs from that of other countrie ..
I,hile there are some private farmers (mostly engaged in citrus production).,
the cooperative types of settlements predominate (kibbutzlm and moshavim)
(see Annex 2).
2.11      In Israel agricultural cooperation covers practically every fie.Lir
It has engaged in the organization of marketing, purchase of supplies and
equipment, financing of settlements, irrigation works, water allocation,
the production of seeds, etc. The cooperative movement is, therefore, ex-
tensive and well organized.
2.12      The economic and social principles to which both the kibbutzim
and moshavim subscribe are: (i) settlement on nationally owned land;
(ii) self-labor; (iii) mutual aid; and (iv) cooperative buying and sellir .
Nevertheless, there are fundamental differences. A kibbutz is based on
communal ownership, production and consumption, whereas in a moshav each
settler farms on his own account and cooperates in specific spheres such
as sale of produce, purchase of supplies and equipment, provision of credii,
etc. (details are at Annex 2).
2.13      The two types of settlement cannot be compared on the basis of
farm units.  In a kiobbutz, every adult couple, including those not engagec:
in agriculture, is taken as representing a farm iuit, whereas a moshav is
based upon a fardly holding and the number of units is identical with the
number of farms. 'Nany of the kibbutzim operate substantial industrial
enterprises, employing a considerable portionof the settlements' inhabi-
tants, whereas the moshavim do not. A kibbutz, from a production and
financial point of view, must be regarded as one large farm (average size
about 500 ha), whereas a moshav will consist of from 50-150 independent
farming families.  The average size of a moshav family farm is 3-4 ha.



- 4 -
2*14      Presentlyj sormie 230 kibbutzim and 500 moshavim cultivate a total
of about 360,000 ha or 75 of the cultivated area of the country.  Cropping
patterns differ according to soil, climatic and water conditions and not
all the land is cropped annually because of 'water constraint and crop
rotation policy. In 1968/69, the cropping pattern for all settlements was:

The Extension Service and Agricultural Research
2.15      Agricultural extension is essential because agriculture is a
new occupation and 'way of life to many of the ne'w settlers.  The Extension
Service, a Department of the iHinistry of Agriculture, comprises the central
specialist departments ald 11 district offices covering the entire countr-y
(Annex 3). It has a high caliber and dedicated staff of over 600 of 'whom
some 450 are specialists.  As at the end of December 1968, 8 PhD1s, 190 rf'cs
or BScts, and 246 technicians 'were in service. The Extension Services are
supported by a well organized Research Department (Annex 3).
B. Agricultural Credit
Background
2.16      Agricultural credit in Israel must be viewed against the back-
ground of agricultural development and particularly the cooperative system
of the Kibbutzim and lIoshavim Hovements (para 2,10 and Anniex 2), 0hich now
use the largest part of the credit directed to agriculture.  The process
of settlement determined the cooperative character ihich still distinguishes
Israeli agriculture from other sectors of the economy, and from faming in
most other countries of the world. Because of this, agriculture in Israel
is more readily subject to planning than other sectors of the economy.



- 5 -
2.17      Until the early 1960ts, there was a shortage of institutional
medium- and long-term credit for the agricultural sector, which led farmers
to borrow short-term for investment purposes from non-institutional sourceb,
often at high rates of interest. A system of supervised credit was then
introduced, opermted through three agricultural banks, Israel Bank of
Agriculture (IBA), Yaad Agricultural Development Bank (YAAD) and NM Ltd.
(NIR), with funds provided from the Development Budget. A system of "con-
solidation" loans was also introduced whereby farmers could convert their
short-term investment borrowing into long-term loans at an interest rate
of 85, per armum, The institutional supply of credit, of which a substan-
tial amount comes from Government funds, is now the most important source
of finance for Israeli agriculture. At the end of 1968, outstanding
medium- and long-term loans for agriculture from all financial institutions
amounted to If 488 million (US$140 million) and the amount of non-institu-
tional credit has steadily declined.
2.18      The Five-Year Plan (1968/69-1972/73) envisages a gross investment
on farms of about II 770 million (US$220 million) plus investments in
national agricultural development projects of IL 606 million (US$173 mil-
lion)0  In addition, the demand for short-tern credit is likely to be aboult
IL 450 million (US$130 million) annually,
2,19      In 1967/68, real gross investrment in agriculture declined by
about 4% as compared with 1966/67, continuing a trend whlch started in the
late 1950 s.  The commercial banking sector, which inclu.dles the three agri-
cultural banks, will assure the supply of short-tera credit, but the agri-
cultural banks have insufficient resources to meet the demand for medium-
and long-term investment funds without continuing Government assistance.
The Banking System
2o20      At the end of 1968, the Department of the Examiner of Banks in
the Bank of Israel (Central Bank) exercised control over 80 banrking and
financial institutions, including the agricultural banks (para 2.17).
The Banking Ordinance invests the Examiner of Banks with wide powers,
enabling him, for instance, to instruct any institution subject to his
control to correct any shortcomings uncovered in an audit. The uovernor
of the Central Bank may talke such action as may be necessary to prevent the
financial collapse of any bank or financial institution or even takel over
effective control himself. He may irmpose legal restrictions on activiti.es
which could impair stability of a banking institution.
General Terms and Conditions of Institutional Credit
2,21      In general, medium- and long-term agricultural loans are granted
for periods of three to fifteen years at interest rates varying fro_ul 6055
to 9, per annun, for from 50-80% of the value of the investment. For
certain categories (e0go water development), tlhe repayment period may
exceed 15 years. Securities consist of mortgages on real estate, fixed or
floating charges on equipment and guarantees from the financial institution
of the settlement movements or cooperatives.  It is very seldom necessa7:
to foreclose.



- 6 -
2,22      Short-te-m credit carries an interest rate of ll2' per
annum. Such loans are generally secured by liens over crop proceeds, the
marketing organizations making payment direct to the bank concerned.
Credit Control
2.23      An important feature of Israelts agricultural credits is its
excellent system of credit control. Borrowers can choose to conduct their
business with any one of the three banks engaged in agricultural credit
but having chosen, they must conduct all their business with that bank
(or the bankts parent organization), which provides their short-term as
well as medium- and long-term credit requirements0 iarketing organizations
pay crop proceeds directly to the bank concerned, which recovers its loan
before making payment to the borrower. This also ensures that the lending
bank has complete information about a borrowerts financial transactions.
2.24      Each year, a detailed technical and financial plan is prepared
for each type of borrover (on a monthly basis) in consultation with the
settlement organization, the iiiinistxy of Agriculture and the bank concermed,
On the basis of this plan, a farmerts needs for working and investment
capital are determined. Cash flows are examined monthly and any marked
deviations from the plan are immediately investigated, A more compre-
hensive check is made half-yearly and instructions for the remainder of
the year are given (Annex 4). As a result of such a tight control system)
which also covers short-term credit, the amount of default does not exceed
0.1% for the three agricultural banks (para 2.17).
III.  INSTITUTIONAL FRA1I0,0RK FCR CREDIT
3,01      The three banks currently engaged in agricultural credit (para
2.17), the Israel Bank of Agriculture Ltd. (IBA) (90% Government owned),
Yaad Agricultural Development Bank Ltd. (YAAD) (50fl Government owrned) and
NM Ltd. (privately owned) are limited companies registered under the
Companies Ordinance and subject to control by the Central Bank. All three
are well organized and managed, have had considerable experience in agri-
cultural credit, and play a very important part in the agricultural credit
structure.
Sources of Funds
3.02      The three banks' resources originate from their own funds (share
capital, deposits and debentures) and from interest bearing deposits from
the Government Development Budget.
3,03      In order to raise additional funds from private sources, the
banks issue from time to time series of debentures (at interest rates
ranging from 5-1/2%' to 6-1/2%), the proceeds of which are deposited with
the Treasury on terms as to linkage and redemption identical to those of
the debentures.  Debenture repayments are linked to the cost of living index



- 7 -
and/or US$ exclh.izgc rat s. The Treajuryj on its part, deposits funds with
the banks, thus enabling them to grant unlinked loans (linkage on loans was
abolished in 1964),  The terims of the Government deposits are currently
18-20 years with interest at approximately 7d per annum. The issue of
debentures has been most successful and more are contemplated. As at the
end of December 1968, the amount of outstanding debentures was IL 180
million (US$51 ndllion)0
Use of Funds
30t4      All three banks provide credit to private farmers, settlements,
and companies and Lnstitutions serving agriculture, principally in the
form of medium- and long-term loans IBA also supplies the short-term
credit needs of its customers. YAAD clients obtain their short-term credit
from Bank Leumi Le-Israel and NIR custoaers from Bank Hapoalim. At the end
of 1968, total agricultural loans outstanding (mostly medium- and long-
term) amounted to some IL 440 million (US$l25 million) representing about
90% of total institutional medium- and long-term agricultural lending.
Details are at Annex 5.
Lending Policies and Procedures
3.o5      The lending policies of the institutions are bound to Government
policy for agriculture since a substantial part of the funds for lending
come from budgetary allocations or exemptions from liquidity regulations.
The three banks cooperate fully with the Government and even when making
loans from their own resources ascertain that the purposes for which the
loans are required are in accord with the Government's overall development
program,
3.06      The procedures adopted by the three banks for the granting of
loans under the Supervised Credit Scheme are those described in paras 2,23
and 2.24, Despite the close interest taken by the Government in loan
applications, the final decision as to wqhether or not a loan should be
granted rests with the bank concerned0
Previous Results and Financial Position
3407      Condensed balance sheets are at Annex; 5. The three banks are
financially sound institutions lixth remarkable repayment records. All are
profitable and pay dividends on their share capital ranging from 5-1/2% to
8%o  The ratios of net profit before taxation (after providing for reserves
for doubtful debts and depreciation) to the banklcs own resources (capital
and reserves) are:  ISA., 13'; YAAD, 21P; and NIP,. 12%,. Although provision
is made for bad debts, the amount actually written-off has been negligible
and due to the ex,cellent system of credit control (para 2.23), the amount
of late repayments is less than 0,l'% of outstanding loans.

IV, THE PitOJE CT
A, General Description
Definition
4.01      The Project, which is not in ally way connected with the occupied
territories and East Jerusale,av would help support export crop development
(flowers, subtropical fruits, and off-season vegetables), improvement of
existing, and establishment of new, export handling facilities and the
development of water resources through medium- and long-tern loans by three
agricultural credit banlks (IBA., YAAD and 11IR) under a supervised credit
program. The program,l is part of Israel's Five-Year Development Plan and
is designed mainly to assist in increasing agricultural exports. Due to
cropping rotation there would be a smanl  element of import substitution
(wheat and cotton)0  Loans wlould be made to kibbutzim, moslavim, coopera-
tives, individual farxmers and the Agricultural Export Company Ltd. (AGI-XC0'
Investment would be in greenhouses; bushes and trees; new on-farm irrigatio;:
equipment and improvemient and replacement of existing equipment; small
reservoirs and drainage works (including piping and equipment); and packing
and handling plants (including buildings, machinery and equipment).
Lending Program
4,02      Total estimated cost of the Project is IL '70 million (US$49
million) of which IL 137 million (US$39 million) would be financed by
loans to subborrowers by the agricultulral banks. The nurmber and size of
loans to subborrowers would vary considerably in accordance with the typeo
of investments within each subproject.  For greenhouses for flowers, the
number of loans would be about 900 and would range from IS 20.,000 (US$5,700)
to IL 70)000 (US$20,000).  Assuming that borrowers developed, on average,
2 ha of subtropical fruits, the number of loans would be about 1,300 ranz-
ing from IL 14,000 (US$4,0oo) to It 70,000 (US$20,000) according to acreage
planted. Investments in export handling facilities would involve about
60 loans vayin.g f rom ISL 8000 (US$2,300) to IS 780,000 (US$220,000).
AGRiEXC0 would have two loans for facilities at Lod Airport and Ashdod Port
for a total o-f IT 9 million (US$2.6 million). Water development loans,
probably numbering about 200, would be in the region of IL 200,000 (US857',CNO)
for a kibbutz or mQoshav.
B. Detailed Features
4.03      Investments financed under the Project are aimed mainly at
increasing agricultural exports. Brief details of the main areas of
investment follow,
14o04     Greenhouses for flowers.  Subloans would be made for the construc-
tion of some 450 hothouses lt for roses (48 ha) and 240 greenhouses l/ for
1/ Hothouses have heating systems whereas greenhouses do not.



- 9 -
carnations (24 ha). It vould also plovide removable plastic covering
against hail -Por some 70 ha of gladioli and would assit in improving some
20 ha of exist ing hothouses, In most- cases, these developments would be
an extension of existing enterprises. The total inczemental production
would amoult to approximately 80 million flowers per year, the number
requixed for the packing capacity of two proposed flower packing plants
(para 4.06). Besides the actual greenhouse structures, investment would
include associated heating, ventilation and irrigation systems,  Details
are given in Annex 6.  Borrowers would be kibbutzim. moshavai and individ-
ual farmers (para 4.02).
4.o5      Fruit Plantations.  The Project would include investment in the
planting of some 750 ha of-avocados; 280 ha of mangoes; 800 ha of tanger-
ines; and 800 ha of grapefruits. The main investment would be planting
materials and irrigation systems (sprinklers) but part of the mai.ntenance
costs during the development period, would also be finranced, As in the
case of flovers, these develonments would be an extension of existing
enterprises and would be undertaken by kibbutzim, moshavin and individual
farmers. Size of loans vould valor according to the acreage planted (para
4.02).
4.06      Export I{anclling Facilities.  Flowiers, subtropical fruits and
off-season   g         1equire specal handling, storage, packing and trans-
port if they are to reach overseas markets in a condition to command high
prices under the Project; financing would be provided for farmerst coop-
erative harvesting, sorting, grading and packing facilities.  Investment
would include the construction and equipping of packing plants (twio for
flowers; nine for fruits; and one for off-season vegetables) and the
purchase of about 25 packing machines and ancillary equipment for various
vegetables,. Since the cooperatives also do mechanized harvesting as part
of their packing activities, provision has been made for the purchase of
about 30 comabine harvesters for carrots, celery and onions plus ancillary
equipment for cutting. topping and sizing onions, Existing storage and
hancling facilities at Lod Airport and Ashdod Port are inadequate.  Invest-
ment would therefore also cover the constructicn and equipment of a moderi..
fully automated handling plant at Lod Airport (for which a feasibility
study was carried out by Seker lanagement, Production and Systems Engineer-
ing Consultants Ltd. in September 1969) and an increase in storage and
handling facilities (particularly cold storage) at Ashdod Port. Both
these facilities would be owned and operated by AGREXCO, which like farmers
cooperatives, operates on a cost plus basis.
IWater Developient
4h07      Financing of high priority water development consisting of numer-
ous small and medium investments in different parts of the country, would
help to improve and extend water distribution systerms and to provide
drainage in some 170 r,ioshavim and 80 kibbutzim.



- 10 -
4.o8      Investment to improve the existing irrigation system lould
involve the replacement of leaking and corroded fixed irrigation pipes
on about one third of the settlements in the country, Automatic valves
would also be installed so that measured irrigation doses could be applied,
and several items such as pressure regulators and metering systems would
be fitted to improve water distribution and reduce wastage along the edges
of irrigation plots. These investments, which are described in Annex 7,
would lead to a 10% to 15,f saving in wlater from about 60,000 ha of land
and would provide enough water to extend the irrigated area by about 91200
ha. The 40 million m3 of irater saved in this way wiould be used to irrigate
1,200 ha of the avocados, tangerines and grapefruits included under Fruit
Plantations (para 4.05), 3,000 ha vegetables and 5,000 ha of cottonj wiheat
and other field crops.
h.o9      Construction of about 34 small reservoirs to impound run-off from
winter storms would make it possible to irrigate and increase the yields
obtained from 5,250 ha of rainfed iheat and 350 ha of rainfed cotton.
Likewise, plastic pipe field drains would lead to improved yields on 2,700
ha of existing irrigated but poorly drained grapefruit plantations, and
1,340 ha of cotton and 2,500 ha of rainfed crops (see IIap).
C. Cost Estimates and Financing

Proposed Financing
!1,12     A Bank loan of US$20 million (40h  of Project costs) is proposed
to cover the estimated foreign exchange element,  Subborrowers would be



- 12 -
recuired to contribute 20%, which is considered reasonable and within their
means. The three participating banks would contribute 20% and the Govern-
ment would also contribute 20% by way of loans to the three participating
banks of IS 35 million (US$ 10 million) in aggregate for a term of 17 years,
including four years' grace period, at an interest rate of 7% per annum under
loan agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, the signing of which would be a
condition of effectiveness. Assurances to the above conditions were obtained.

4.13      The Bank loan of US$20 million, to be disbursed over three years,
would be lent to the IBA (para 5.02), and Project Agreements would be enterec!
into between the Bank and YAAD and NIR. The Government would bear the foretic-
exchange risk.  IBA would onlend to the other two banks engaged in agricric-
tural credit under subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to the Bank. The
subsidiary agreements would specify the types of loans eligible for financin ;
the percentage to be financed; the rate of interest to be paid; maturity datrs
and methods of repayment; and the requirements for the submission to IBA of
annual audited accounts for onward transmission to the Bank. The signing of
these subsidiary loan agreements would be a condition of effectiveness.
4.14      Loans to subborrowers would be repayable over 10 to 15 years
(para 5.11), and with loans commencing in three successive years, the latest
repayments would be made 18 years after the start of the Project. The cash
flow projection at Annex 8 indicates that repayment of the Bank's loan over
17 years, including a grace period of four years, would be appropriate.
Accumulation of temporary surpluses would reach a peak of IS 23 million
(us$ 6.6 million) (22% of the combined Bank and Government loans) in the
eleventh year which should be sufficient to cover unforeseen slippage in
commitments and disbursements.

D. Pro curement and Disbursement
Procurement
4.15      The range of items to be financed is very wide and most of them
would not be suitable for bulk procurement0  For instance; machinery for
packing plants covers 11 different types of packing operations and differ--
ent machines would be required0 The machines required for one pJ.ant would
be unlikely to attract international bidso Similarly with greenhouses and
hothouses, the varying types of construction and equipment preclude bulJking,
I-4any of the items required for the Project are manufactured in Israel from
imported materials. Supplies are adequate, prices competitive and servic-
ing good. iTo tariffs are levied on agricultural machinery and irrigation
equipment which may be freely ir,mported. International suppliers are well
represented and comnpetition is keen,  In some cases, the Government indicate-
a price ceiling above which essential supplies and machlinery may not be
sol.d,,  WJith the exception noted below, procurement would, tl-erefore, be
through nornal commercial channels, prices being subject to the approval
of the bank granting the loan. The handling facilities for AG&2EXCO at
Lod Airport and Ashdod Port (para 4,O6) are larger self-contained schemes
suitable for international competitive bidding, Israeli contractors woul.d
be entitled to participate in the bidding, without preference. Assurances
7Tere obtained tuat interi?ational cozpetitive biddgIn: woulc2 be used for this
part of thea lroject.
Disbursement
4v16      The Bank would reimburse IBA 50% of all loans disbursed by the
three participating banks against appropriate documentation, certified by
IDA, that such loans, for the amounts specified, had been made for approved
purposes.  This percentage represents the average estimated foreign exchange
element of subloans (see para 4.12)o
V. ORGAHIZATIOIN AIID 1IIMAGEyIENT
Project Ad.cTnistration
5cOl      IBA, the largest of the three banks engaged in agricultural credit,
would be the borrover and administer the Project assisted by YAAD
and NI.' (Annex 5) and a Project Coordination Committee (para 5.13).
Israel Bank of Agriculture Ltd, (IBA)
5.02      IDA was incorporated, under the Companies Ordinance, in 1951 and
devotes itself to financing the various branches of agriculture. Since its
foundation, it has granted agricultural loans totaling ISt 765 million
(US$219 million) and its volume of lending during the next three years is
estimated at about IIL 80 million (US$23 million) annually,



- 14 -
5.03      Resources. IBDls resources originate from share capital,
deposits, deb;enures and interest-bearing deposits from the Government
Development Budget. Its authorized share capital is IL 120 million
(US$35 million), of which IL 86 million (US$25 million) is issued and paid.
up, Government owns IL 77 million (US$22 million) or 90% of the issued
share capital. Debentures outstanding at March 31, 1970, amounted to
iS 18 million (US$5.1 million) (see para 3.03 and Annex 5). As at March
31, 1970, Government deposits amounted to I£ 240 million (US$69 million).
Condensed balance sheets are at Annex 5, Table lo
5o04      Use of Resources. The major part of IBA)s resources are used
for granting loans to the agricultural sector. As at MIarch 31, 1970,
loans outstanding amounted to IL 371 million (US$106 million) or 88% of
total assets. Investments in companies to support agricultural lending
activities amounted to IL 4 million (US$1,2 million)0 Interest rates are
in line with ruling comercial rates (para 2.21 and 2.22), 9% for mediur,-
and long-term and 11% for short-term.
So5      Financial Position and Future Earnings.  The credit control
system (para 2.23) has resulted in an excellent repayment record. Default
is less than 0.1% and loans are well secured.  The loan portfolio is, there-
fore, sound but, prudently, annual provision is made for doubtful debts.
Net profit before taxation, for the year ended i'Iarch 31, 1970, was IL 14
million (US$4 million) compared with IL 12 million (US$3.5 million) in
1969 (Annex 5, Table 4). Net profit, before taxation, was 16$ of share-
holder's equity in 1970 compared to 15% in 1969.  A dividend at the rate
of 5-1/2% on Ordinary shares was paid in 1968/69 against 3% in 1967/68e
The reserve position is adequate (Annex 5, Table 1). The debt/equity ratio
is about 3:1. Profits and reserves have shown a steady increase over the
years and forecasts indicate that this trend would continue (Annex 5,
Table 5).
5.06      Organization and Management.  IBA's Headquarters are in Tel Aviv
and adequate agency arrangements have been made with other financial
institutions covering the whole country.  Its Board, which presently
includes representatives of the I-Iinistries of Finance and Agriculture and
the Kibbu-tzim and I-Soshavim IIovements, meets at least once a month (more
frequently if necessary) and approves all loans.  Loan applications are
examined in detail by a Loan Committee prior to Board presentation.
IManagement practices are good and the stafl° of about 100, experienced,
The accounting system, uhich is fully mechanized,  produces adequate data
and statistics for management. Loan appraisal and supervision techniques
are satisfactory and close cooperation is maintained with the ltinistry
of Agriculture and the other two agricultural banks. IBA is a well-managed>
financially sound institution capable of administering the proposed Bank
loan.
.rojectLcund and Project Account
5.07      A project fund,  n'to wihic'h the proceeds of the Bank loan :iould be
paid, wirould. be established within ISA which  iould onlend to hile othsr t%To
banks (YAAD and N7IR) through subsidiary loan agreements on the same terms



- 15 -
and conditions as applicab'le to IBA. IBA would also establish a consolidated
Project account which would reflect the operations and financial condition
of the Project fund and of IBA, YAAD and NIR with respect tQ all sub-lending
transactions within the framework of the Project. In addition, each bank
would maintain a Government Loan account which would reflect the status of
the portion of the Government Loan (para 4.12) received by it.
5.08      The three participating banks would draw from the Project fund
50% of approved loans disbursed. They would pay to the Project fund inter-
est on such drawings at the rate of 7-1/4% per annum and would lend to
subborrowers at 9%5 per annum.
5.09      Each badc would be individually responsible for the approval,
administration and collection of loans and would assume the financial risk.
Individual loans exceeding US$300,000 equivalent would require prior ap-
proval by the Bank. Assurances to the above conditions were obtained.
Lending Policies and Procedures
5.10      Potential borrowers would be required to prepare detailed tech-
nical and financial plans in consultation with the settlement organizations,
the Ministry of Agriculture and the lending bank (para 2.24 and Annex 4)
which would determine the creditworthiness of each applicant and soundness
of the investment. The various departments of the Ministry of Agriculture
(Credit, Extension, Water, Marketing, etc.) would be responsible for pro-
viding the necessary technical advice and services. Assurances were obtained
that security (paras 2.21 and 2.22), lending and supervision procedures
(para 2.24 and Annex 4) would not be altered without prior approval of the
Bank.
Terms and Conditions of Project Loans
5.11      The rate of interest to be charged to all subborrowers would be
9% per annum, which is in line with prevailing commercial rates (para 2.21).
Taking into account the blended funds (Government portion at the rate of
7% per annum - para 4.12 - and the Bank's portion at 7-1/4% per annum -
para 5.08) the participating banks would have a spread of 1-7/8% which would
be sufficient to cover expenses and give a small profit margin. Loans to
subborrmwers should not exceed the following grace and repayment periods:
Grace    Years  of             Types  of
Period   Repayment   Total    Borrowers
i)  Greenhouses for flowers        2         8          10   kibbutzim, moshavim,

minor civil works



- 16 -
Assurances that these terms would not be exceeded wi+thout prior approval
of the Bank were obtained during negotiations.
5.12      Accounts and Auditing.  The three banks' accounting systems are
satisfactory. Their operations are examined by the Examiner of Banks of
the Central Bank (para 2.20) and their accounts are audited by firms of
independent auditors. Assurances were obtained that their accounts would
continue to be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,
that the Government Loan accounts (para 5.07) and the Project account
(maintained by IBA) would be subject to a separate audit, and that IBA
would send to the Bank, within three months of the end of each bank's
fiscal year, audited accounts together with copies of the auditors' reports.
Assurances were also obtained that YAAD and NIR would make available to IBA
all their books and records relating to sub-lending transactions within the
framework of the Project.
5.13      Project Coordination Committee.  In view of the number of organ-
izations concerned with the Project (three banks and various Government
departments), IBA should be assisted by a Project Coordination Committee
(PCC). An ad hoc committee exists at present but needs to be formally
constituted. The composition and duties of the proposed PCC are detailed
at Annex 9.  At negotiations, assurances were obtained that such a committee
would be formally established prior to the effectiveness of the loan.
VI. PRODUCTION, 1vIARKETING, PRICES AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Production
6.01      Under the Project, about 23,000 ha would be cultivated (mainly by
kibbutzim and moshavim), of which some 20,500 ha would be irrigated, 16,300 ha
for the first time. Production of flowers, fruits and off-season vegetables
would account for about 84% of the total value of incremental farm output,
the remainder being accounted for by cotton (9%), wheat, groundnuts, sorghum
and hay. The incremental annual value of production would build up to about
IS 71 million (US$20.3 million) by the end of the fourth year reaching
if 118 million (US$33.7 million) at full production in the ninth year when
tree crops would be matured. The total area, production and sales value of
individual crops would be:

Market Prospects
6.02      High value and highly perishable exports of cut-flowers and fresh
fruits and vegetables to Western European markets would account for a large
proportion of the Project's production. Two factors would, therefore, be critical
to the success of the Project, first, growth and development of demand in the
Western European markets and second, Israel's competitive position in relation
to other exporting countries with similar ecological conditions.
6.03      Increased per capita incomes in Western European countries have led
to rapid increases in the consumption of cut flowers and many vegetables and
fruits.  For example, imports of cut flowers into the Federal Republic of Germany.,
which amounted to about 307 of the countryls total consumption of cut flowers in
19680 rose from US$18.6 million in 1960 to US$70.2 million in 1968.  In addition,
improved transportation has considerably lowered the cost of importing a wide
variety of fresh horticultural produce that wnas previously avallable only during
the Western European summer months or not generally known.  Only a srmall propor-
tion of families in most W1estern European countries have as yet started to consume
produce such as avocados and grapefruits on a regular basis. ioreover, these iteras
have very high income elasticities of demand, so that once consumers become
familiar with them, they are likely to purchase relatively larger quantities as
incomes continue to rise. For flowers, the demand is mainly for roses and carna-
tions.  There is also a strong demand in the off-season for familiar vegetables
such as lettuce, carrots and celery as well as a shift in consumption patterns
toward a wider variety of vegetables, e.g. ogen melons, as,rags and capsicums.
ilar1et prospects for individual crops are given in Annex 10.

6.o4      Over the last two decades, Israel has become a major exporter of
horticultural produce to Western Europe, initially with citrus and more recently
also with cut flowers and fresh vegetables.  Israel'sshare of the Western European
market varies greatly according to the season and the crop. It is as high as
70% of the total market for grapefruit between October and April, but much lower
for many vegetables although both the size and Israel's share of the market are
increasing rapidly under the influence of an aggressive market policy. The high
degree of marketing organization required to build up and maintain this position
is the responsibility of the Citrus Marketing Board for oranges, gapefruits and
tangerines and of the Agricultural Export Company (AGREXCO) for other perishable
horticultural produce. These organizations, which are described in Annex 10,
have offices throughout Western Europe.  AGREXCO, which would handle most of the
Project's production, works on a commission basis and handles produce from port
of shipment through the point of sale in the main wholesale markets of Western
Europe. As a result of integrated marketing and strict quality control,whole-
salers in the importing countries have the assurance of receiving regular supplies
of even the most perishable produce in good condition, e.g., flowers, picked in
the evening in Israel are marketed the next day in Zurich and Frankfurt. The
rapidly increasing volume of horticultural exports will necessitate the con-
struction of additional packing and handling facilities to ensure that the produce
continues to reach the markets in good condition and at the right time. The
facilities included in the Project would reinforce this capability.
6eO5      There are no serious restrictions to prevent the import of horticultural
produce from Israel into IrWestern European countries during the limited period
in winter when domestic supplies in these countries are shortest and prices
highest. However, since several competitors, for instance, other Ilediterranean
countries, have rather similar ecological conditions to Israel, the timing of
sales is particularly important. Advanced agrlcultural technology such as the use
of hormone sprays, early and late ripening varieties, has enabled Israel to pro-
duce at such times. A large on-going research program and a highly organized
extension service (para 2X15) should ensure that this comparative advantage is
maintained0
6.o6      Although only a part of the Project's production of vegetables and
fruits tJould be suitable in quality for export, the rerainder would not give
rise to surpluses on the domestic market. Israel has a high per capita consump-
tion of vegetables and until recently has not exported any of its production.
With the establishment of efficient export marketing channels (para 6,08), part
of the existing vegetable production is now being cliverted to the more profitable
export market, and the Project's lover quality production would contribute to
preventing a fall in domestic supplies.  Piarketing olf grape-fruits and tangerines
are controlled by the Citrus 14arketing Board and production unsuitable for export
as fresh fruit would be sold for industrial processing. Flol%er marketing is also
controlled to prevent surpluses arising (Annex 6, para 5).
6e07      Israel currently exports about 11,000 tons of high quality medium to
mediur-long staple cotton lint, and imports 7,000 tons of lower quality lint
for use in the expanding textile industry. The incremental production froma the
Project (3,900 tons lint) would partly be used for import substitution and the
remainder exported for sale on world markets.  Project production of hard wheat
(18,600 tons) would substitute for somiie of the 3466,o0o tons presently imported.



- 19 -
Mbrketing and Pricing
6.o8      Several systems would be adopted for marketing the Project's production.
Cut-flowers for sale in Europe are traditionally sold f.o.b. and sales are nego-
tiated in advance before dispatch.  Vegetables are sold for producers b1r AGREGCO
on a commission basis. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, wholesalers
usually make the sale for AGREXCO on a commission basis, but in the European
Common Market countries, AGREXCO generally negotiates the sale itself. Producers
receive the sale amount less AGREXCO's commission, import duties, transport costs,
port expenses and costs of packing materials. In the case of grapefruits and
tangerines, similar arrangements apply. The prices projected for the Project are
based on the actual prices received in the last three years. Prices are expected
to remain firm as Project produce has a high income elasticity of demand. However,
prices received are far more dependent on the quality of the produce than on
total quantity on the market. The cooperative system of production and marketing
in Israel is ideally suited to selling a high and uniform quality, which is
essential since prices received for high grade flowers may be more than twice
as much as those for lower grade ones.  Prices also vary greatly throughout the
year but Israeli exports are limited to those winter months when prices are
highest.
6.o0      In order to encourage exports, producers receive a 20% preferential
rate of exchange (IE 4.20:US$1.00). Basic foodstuffs for domestic consump-
tion are price supported but the only Project crop so affected is wheat, the
present price paid to producers being IE 0.31 per kg, equivalent to a 20%o
preferential rate of exchange. Cotton prices have been projected in accordance
with the Bank's commodity forecasts indicating a price decline of 15% by 1975.
Producer Benefits and Revenue Generation
6.10      Most developments under the Project would be additional to existing
enterprises but these would vary; for example, a kibbutz might grow an additional
20 ha of wheat, whereas, a moshav farmer would be more likely to grow an
additional 0.2 ha of vegetables. The agricultural activities of kibbutzim and
moshavim vary so widely because of differences in location, age and size and due
to the variety of crops, that standard farm budgets would not be representative.
The following table, which is illustrative only, indicates how producers would
benefit from some major project crops on a dunum (0.1 ha) basis:

6.11      The financial rates of return of Project schemes would range from
17% in the case of grapefruits plantations to about 33% in the case of
vegetables (Annex 11 Appendix 1). Producers would be able to service their
loans satisfactorily at 9% over the proposed repayment periods (para 5.11).
At full production, after nine years, the net annual incremental income
accruing to producers would be about IL 51 million (US$14.6 million), and
income tax would be payable on this amount. The participants in the Project
would pay an estimated average of 155J; the additional income tax gene:ated
would, therefore, be about IS 7.4 million (US$2.1 million) annually.  This
is in addition to the repayment of the Goverrment loan plus interest at the
rate of 7p per annum.
VII. BEINTEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The Project would contribute materially to the production of
export and, to a lesser extent, import substitution crops.  Improvement of



- 21 -
packing, handling and cold storage facilities would enhance Israel's com-
petitive position in the Western European market for off-season flowers,
vegetables and subtropical fruits. Annual foreign exchange earnings and/or
savings attributable to the Project would reach about US$18 million at full
development of which about US$17 million would be export earnings. Since
most inputs are manufactured locally this would mean net foreign earnings
of about US$9 million after debt service.
7.02      Costs and benefits have been valued at II 4.20:US$l.  This rate
more accurately reflects the shortage of foreign exchange in the economy than
the official rate of exchange of IL3.50 = US$1.  However, because both costs
and earnings derive to a large extent from foreign sources the use of this
shadow rate does not have a very significant effect on the economic rate of
return calculation detailed below. Use of the official rate would lower
these rates by about two percentage points. Project economic benefits are
identical to the financial benefits, but the economic costs are increased
due to the increased costs of imported inputs. Cost of water and fertilizer,
the two inputs being subsidized, and only to a small degree, have also been
raised to reflect their full cost. The overall rate of return to the econ-
omy for the projected mix of activities over the life of the Project of 20
years would be about 18% (Annex 11, Appendix 2). Due to the diverse nature
of the Project activities and the varying agricultural conditions of kibbutzim
and moshavim (para 6.10), there is some spread in the econormic rates of return
of individual parts, ranging from 12p for rainfed crops to 31% for grapefruit
under improved drainage.
7.03      The sensitivity of rates of return of one of the most sensitive
crops, flowers, has been tested against changes in export prices, investment
costs and exchange rates. With a project economic rate of return of 20% a
fall in f.o.b. prices of all flowers (10%) would reduce the rate of return
by 8 percentage points; an increase in investment costs (15%) would decrease
it by 3 percentage points and an increase in the shadow rate of exchange
(10%) would increase it by 4 percentage points (Annex 6, para 8). High
quality production and well organized marketing are of prime importance and
Israel has excellent technological and organizational expertise in this
field. 1iIarket failure would therefore most likely result from an economic
recession in Wlestern Europe (the main cut flower market) where such luxury
items as flowers would be the first to feel the effect of such a recession.
A further sensitivity analysis has therefore been done assuming that at the
end of four years from the start of the Project flower production would
completely cease and the greenhouses would be used for another eight years
to produce vegetables and/or strawberries for export. This would result
in a fall in the financial rate of return from 25% to 15% and a decline in
the economic rate of return from 20% to 11%. This assumption is based on
a complete cessation of flower production which is most unlikely. In general,
annual crops with higher rates of return such as vegetables and gladioli
would be theoretically more sensitive to changes in prices than tree or bush
crops such as avocados and roses, although the scope for substituting differ-
ent annual crops would in practice reduce these effects.

VIII. RECOIMENDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations, the following main assurances were
obtained:
a)  the handling facilities for AGREXCO at Lod Airport and Ashdod
Port would be subject to international competitive bidding
(para 4.15);
b)  each bank would be individually responsible for the approval,
administration and collection of loans and would bear the
financial risk, but individual loans exceeding US$300,000
equivalent would be subject to prior approva' by the Bank
(para 5.09); and
c)  each bank's accounts would continue to be audited by indepen-
dent auditors acceptable to the Bank and audited accounts
together with copies of the auditors' reports would be sent
to the Bank (through IBA) within three months of the end of
each bank's fiscal year (para 5.12).
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be:
a)  loan agreements referred to in para 4.12 shall have been
executed;
b)  subsidiary loan agreements referred to in para 4.13 shall
have been executed; and
c)  a Project Coordination Committee has been formally estab-
lished (para 5.13).
8.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$20 million for a term of 17 years, including a four-year grace period.
The borrower would be IBA.

THE KIBBUTZIl Ai{D IMOSHAVIMT IOVEUENTS
1l        Both the kibbutz and moshav are cooperative societies but of an
unusual character, differing from similar groups in other countries.  Today,
these two forms of settlement are dominant in Israeli agriculture in regard
to population, area cultivated, and value of production. They use the
largest part of the credit directed to the agricultural sector. Settlers
are free to choose the type of organization they wish to join according to
their ideology.

2,        A kibbutz consists of individuals who have united voluntarily to
establish a settlement based on the principles of absolute equality between
all its members., mutual responsibility, the absence of ownership of private
property, and the organization of all production and consumption on a
collective basis. It is an independent entity owned by the members, uhose
standard of living depends upon the successful running of the enterprise.
It is governed by the general meeting of its members which elects the
principal officers and various committees which deal with specific activities.
3.        In the beginning, kibbutzim were largely based on agriculture,
but in recent years they have entered the industrial field and a substantial
part of some kibbutzim income now comes from industry. The industries
include the manufacture of irrigation equipment, plywood, plastics, furni-
ture, kitchen equipment and canning of fruits and vegetables.  Where it has
been found economical to do so, kibbutzim have affiliated to run regional
enterprises such as ginneries, poultry slaughterhouses, packing plants,
feed mills, etc.
4.        There are at present about 230 kibbutzim in Israel with about
90,000 members.
Moshavim
5.        A moshav is a village engaged exclusively in agriculture in which
each settler supports himself by farming his individual holding (with the
help of his family) on his oin account and responsibility. He is free to
engage in wjhatever branch of agriculture he chooses. The cooperative
principles are limited to such spheres as the sale of produce, the purchase
of supplies and equipment, the operation of heavy agricultural machinery,
the provision of credit, accounting services, the allocation of water, etc.
6.        The supreme public body is the annual general meeting which elects
the Village Council, which in turn appoints various committees to assist
in the day-to-day operations of the settlement.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
7.        In the case of water, an overall allocation is made to a moshav
and the appropriate committee allocates the water to individual farmers in
accordance with the type of farming which they are undertaking. In the
case of credit, the loan is made to the moshav which onlends to the indivi-
dual farmers. Only in rare cases do the agricultural credit banks lend
directly to individual members of a moshav.
8.        There are about 500 moshavim in Israel at present, with popula-
tions varying between 50 and 150 family farming units.

"judgment committee" composed of representatives of the Regional Office of
the Ministry of Agriculture, the Central Supervised Credit Unit of the
Ministry, the settlement union and the bank concerned. This committee

AGRICULTURLL CREDIT PROJECT
CREDIT INSTITUTIONS
fsrael Bank of Agriculture, Ltd. (IBA)
1.         The IBA was incorporated in 1951.  Its authorized share capital
is IS 120 million (US$35 million); issued and paid up amounts to IE 86 million
(Us$25 million) of which Government owns IF, 77 million (US$22 million) or 90%,
and the balance is held by the Kibbutzim and Yoshavim Ynvements and private
individuals. The Board of Directors is appointed by the shareholders and
presently includes representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture
and the Kibbutzim amd Moshavim Movements. The Chairman of the Board is
Professor Haim Halperin, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the Hebrew
University and at one time Director-General of the Ministry of Agriculture.
2.         The total staff is 105, of whom five are agronomists and six others
are University graduates in law, economics, statistics and public administration.
The majority of the staff are experienced banking officials having served with
IBA for 10-15 years. lany of them have had previous experience in banks and
f inancial institutions.
3.         Headquarters are in Tel Aviv and adequate agency arrangements have
been made with other financial institutions covering the whole country. Manage-
ment practices are good. The Board of Directors and Loan Committees meet regularly
and loans are processed without delay. The accounting system, which is fully
mechanized, produces adequate data and statistics for management. Loan appraisal
and supervision techniques are satisfactory and close cooperation is maintained
with the Ministry of Agriculture and the other two agricultural banks.
4.         Since its foundation, IBA has granted agricultural loans for a
total of IL 765 million (US$219 million).  As at March 31, 1970, loans outstanding
amounted to IS 371 million (US$106 million). Loans are granted from the bank's
own resources and from funds made available by the Government from budgetary
allocations. These allocations are in the form of deposits which are repayable
at fixed rates and dates and bear interest of approximately 7% per annum. As
at March 31, 1970, such deposits outstanding amounted to IE 240 million (US$69
million). In addition, debentures are issued from time to time, the proceeds
of which are deposited with the Treasury on terms as to linkage and redemption
identical to those of the debentures. Debenture repayments are linked to the
cost of living index and/or US$ exchange rates. The Treasury, on its part,
deposits unlinked funds with the banks thus enabling them to grant unlinked
loans (linkage was abolished in 1964). Half the amount in the balance sheet
(Table 1), "Deposits with the Ministry of Finance", is not, therefore, available
for lending, it is security earmarked for the debenture issues.



AIRIN43X 5

5.       aThe credit control system, whereby borrowers must conduct all
their banking business only with one barn, has resulted in an excellent
repayment record. For several years, default has been negligible (less
than 0.1,) and all loans are well secured.  Nevertheless, adequate provi-
sion is made annually for bad debts. In accordance with usual comnercial
banking practices, this reserve is not shown separately in the balance
sheet but is held as part of inner reserves.
6.        The reserve position is adequate, even without taking into account
the inner reserves.  In addition, the bankts valuable premises have been
completely written domn and are shown in the balance sheet at a nominal value
of IL 1 (Table 1).
7.        The net profit for the year ended 'Ilarch 31, 1970, before taxation,
was IL 14 million ( us$ 4 million).  A dividend on ordinary shares was paid
at the rate of 5-1/2,' in 1968/69 compared with 3% in 1967/68. Condensed
profit and loss accounts are at Table 4.
8.        IBA is a well-managed, financially sound institution capable of
administering the IBRD loan.
Yaad Agricultural Development Dank, Ltd. (YALD)
9.        YAAD was incorporated in 1922 as the Central Bank of Cooperative
Institutions in Palestine, Ltd. and lends to agriculture and allied enter-
prises. The name was changed in 1962 after a merger with two other com-
panies. Its authorized share capital is IE 10 million (US$2.9 million);
issued and paid up aimounts to IS 6.5 million (US$1.9 raillion). Forty-nine
percent of the ordinary shares (which are the only shares carrying voting
rights) are owned by the Government and the remaining 51% by Bank Leumi
Le-Israel (the largest commercial bank). The Government and Bank Leumi
are each entitled to appoint one half of the number of Directors. The
Board presently includes representatives of the Ilinistries of Finance and
Agriculture.
10.       YAAD has a total staff of 40, of whom 2 are agricultural econo-
mists with IiSc in agricalture and 2 are economists trained in business
administration. The senior officials are all experienced bankers.
11.       As in the case of IBQ, management practices, the accounting
system, loan appraisal and supervision techniques, and cooperation with
the Government and other banks, are all satisfactory (para 3).  In addi-
tion, in case of need, YAAD can draw on the selwices and expertise of
Bank Leumi Le-Israel and Bank Leumi managers actively assis-t in loan
appraisals and supervisions, The facilities of 176 Bank Lewui branches
are at the disposal of YAAD customers.
12.       During 1963-1968, YAAD granted loans totaling IL 161 million
(US$46 million).  As at December 31, 1968, loans outstanding amounted to
I 80o million (US$23 million). The source of funds for loans is basically



AHMEX 5
Page 3
the same as IBA's and as at December 31, 1968 budgetary deposits amounted
to Ir 68 million (US$19 million). YAAD issues debentures in the same ways
and on the same conditions as IBA (para 4).  Condensed balance sheets are
at Table 2.
13.       YAAD adheres to the credit control system (para 5) and its default
rate is also negligible. Provision is made for bad debts and this is
reflected in inner reserves (para 5). AI. loans are well secured and
taking into account past performance the reserves are adequate.
1.4.      The net profit for 1968, before taxation, was IL 1.8 riillion
(us$o.5 million). A dividend on ordinary shares of 8%o was paid in 1968
compared with 7%7 in 1967.  Condensed profit and loss accounts are at Table 4.
15.       YAAD is a wjell-managed and financially sound institution.  It is
a subsidiary of Bank Leumi whose assets exceed US$974 million. YAAD is a
suitable institution to participate in an IBRD loan.
NIFP, Ltd. (INIR)
16.       This company was founded in 1934 by the Agricultural Union and
Hevrat Hatovdim, Ltd. to supply credit both to settlements directly and to
companies and institutions serving agriculture. Its authorized share
capital is IL 12 million (US$3.5 million); issued and paid up amounts to
iT 6.6 million (US$1.9 million). The principal shareholders are Bank
Hapoalim, Ltd. (a commercial bank); Hevrat Ha'ovdim, Ltd; and NIR Coopera-
tive of Je-wish Wn.Torkers, Ltd. Government does not participate and, therefore,
is not represented on the Board.
17.       Despite this, budgetary allocations are made to NmIB as to the
other two banks and as at December 31, 1968, the amount outstanding was
IL 42 million (US$12 million). As at that date, the amount outstanding
on loans was IS 51 million (US$t14 million). It also issues debentures on
the same terms as IRA and YAAD.
18.       It is the smallest of the three agricultural banks with a total
staff of 14. The senior officials are experienced bankers and supervision,
research and technical services are provided by Bank Hapoalim whose 142
branches serve NIR. customers. NIR. operates under the credit control system
(para 5) and, like the other two banks, loan defaults are negligible.  All
loans are well secured and adequate provision is made for bad debts within
the inner reserve. Condensed balance sheets are at Table 3.
19.       The net profit for 1968, before taxation, was IL 1 million
(US$0-3 million). A dividend on ordinary shares of 7% has been paid since
1965. Condensed profit and loss accounts are at Table 4.
20.       NIR is a well-managed and sound financial institution.  It is a
subsidiary of Bank Hapoalim whose assets exceed US$400o million and is a
suitable institution to participate in an IBRD loan.

AGRICULTULAL CREDIT PROJECT
FIGLIEtS--GfEI,AHOUSES UMI PACKU'IG FACILITIES
1.        Israelts exports of flowers have increased velry rapidly from
10 million flowlers in 1966/67 to 42 rnULlion flowers in 1968/69.  The main
species are roses, carnations, gladioli, anemones and gerberas, mainly
exported to Tlestern Lurope during the winter (Annex 10, paras 2-6).  Israel
plans to increase its export of flowers from 10 million in 1966/67 to 100
million in 1969/70; to 280 million by 1972/73 and to 332 milJicn by 1974/75.
2.        Roses are groun in hothouses and carnations in unheated green-
houses. Gladioli grow under plastic cover to protect the flowers against
hail. The producers are responsible for a first sorting and packing, and
the transport of all flowers to the central packing station of the Flower
Marketing Board at the airport, which does the grading and final packing.
To speed up handling at the airport, part of the handling activities would,
in future, be concentrated in a number of regional grading and packing
plants. The present regional packing capacity is adequate for 50 million
flowers in the season.  To cope w-jith the 1972/73 target, when all flowers
will pass through regional packing stations, seasonal packing capacity
must be increased by 230 million flowers.
The Project
3.        The portion of the project relating to flower production and
export would consist of the construction of greenhouses and two pacling
stations for the procluction and export of 83 million flowiers as follows:
48 ha of roses at 675,ooo per ha          = 32,4oo,000 flowers
24 ha of carnations at 1,000,000 per ha = 24000,000 flowers
67.5 ha of gladioli at 140,000 per ha   =  9,450,000 flowers
20 ha of improved existing hothouses    = 16,750,C00 flowers
(10 ha roses, 10 ha carnations)          ___
Total   82,600o000 flowers
4.        For roses, the investment would involve hothouses with either
plastic or glass cover and either hot air or hot water heating systems
(details at Annex 6, Appendix 1). Greenhouses for carnations would not
require heatin£g and gladioli would require only removable plastic tunnels
to protect against hail damage and a drip irrigation system to water the
flowers under the plastic tunnels.  Two flower grading and packing plants



AL14;, 6
Page 2
would also be constructed (one in 1970/71 and one in 1971/72), each with
a capacity for packing about 40 million flowers for export (details in
Annex 6, Appendix 2). Roses, carnations, gladioli and other flolwlers would
be packed, over 50% of the total would be roses. Total investrents in
greenhouses would amount to IL 40 million (US$11.5 million) with a foreigi
exchange component of US$4e6 million (Annex 6, Appendix 3), The two pack-
ing stations together would cost an estimated II 1.54 million (US$440,O00)
with a foreign exchange component of US$136,000.
5.        The production of 80 million flowzers has been estimated after
allowing for losses at the various stages of production and marketing.
Cut flowers are sold f.o.b. (Annex 10, para 5) on the basis of orders
negotiated in advance by the European offices of the Agricultural Export
Company (AGRnTicO).  Therefore, all losses after air shipment would be borne
by the importing wholesalers in the countries conce:ned.  The packing
station orly accepts from the farmers as many flowers as are required to
make up the specific daily export orders. On the basis of current experi-
ence, farmers would deliver to the packing station some 75,000 roses from
each dunun (0.1 ha) during the season, although the total number of
flow'ers produced per dunum would be very much greater. Licenses to expand
flower production are issued annually byr the Flower Harketing Board in
accordance with the official export projections. Although the total
seasonal production of roses may exceed 100,000 flowers per dunum, the
areas allocated for planting are based on a yield of 75,000 roses only,
to ensure that there are always enough high quality young blooms for export0
Comparable figures for carmations and gladioli are ll0000 flowers for
carnations and 16,000 flowers for gladioli. During the final grading at
the packing station, normally about 10%l of the flowers are rejected and sent
for sale on the local market. In calculating project output, it has been
assumed that 67,500 roses, 100,000 carnations and 14,000 gladioli would be
exported from each dunum grown,
6.        Project exports of cut flowers would earn an estimated US$6.8
million annually in foreign exchange (If 23.8 million at the If 3.50:US$l
exchange rate).  AGRE.C-, the Flower i,arketing Board, and the packing
stations in Israel work on a commission basis and riost packing plants are
owned by farmers' cooperatives. Accordingly, packing stations do not
purchase from the farmers but charge handling costs to the products.
Farmers participating in the project would receive the value of local and
export sales estimated at IL 28.2 million (US$8.1 million), including the
20,' export preference (para 6009), but after deducting AGilE XCOts commission,
which amounts to about 10%j of the f.o.b. value. Flower Harketing Board
charges, costs of packing, packing materials, transport to the airport,
and on-farm production costs would amount to IS 16.2 million (us$4.6 mil-
lion). The net farm income of IS 12.0 million (US$304 million) would give
a financial rate of return of 25' on the investments in greenhouses and
packing stations over the 20 years' life of the packing stations (Annex 6,
Appendix 4).  After deducting income tax allowances of IL 4.5 million,
and assuming an average rate on tax of 20%, the additional tax revenue
resulting from the project would amount to IL 1.4 million (us$0.4 rillion).



ANNEX 6
Page 3
Financial returns for roses, carnations and gladioli individually would be
23%, 26% and 50%, respectively.
7.        A number of adjustments have been made to the flows of financial
costs and benefits in order to obtain the economic rate of return. First,
the costs of water and fertilizers (both of which are subsidized), have been
raised to reflect their full cost. All other inputs, including labor, have
been charged at their market rate. Second, since water quotas limit the
cultivation of irrigated crops, flower production would necessitate reducing
the area of other irrigated crops. On the basis of the relative consumptive
use of water, the net income lost from ceasing to cultivate 350 ha cotton
has been deducted. Third, the foreign exchange component of benefits
has been shadow priced to reflect most accurately the project's contribution
to the economy. A rate of IE 4.20:US$l, which is supported by the preferential
rate of exchange currently used for agricultural exports, has been adopted.
Economic benefits would therefore be the same as financial benefits. Economic
costs would, however, be increased because of the increased costs of imported
inputs. This largely explains why the economic rate of return is about
5 percentage points lower than the financial.
8.        The sensitivity of the project to changes in (a) exchange rate,
(b) f.o.b. prices, and (c) investment costs has been considered:
a)  Changes in the shadow exchange rate:  The economic rate of
return increases by 4 percentage points if a shadow exchange
rate of IL 4.55:US$1 is adopted. It falls by 4 percentage
points if the shadow exchange rate is considered to be
if 3.85:US$l, assuming costs and prices remain as projected.
b)  Changes in f.o.b. prices:  The economic rate of return falls
by d percentage points if the f.o.b. prices of all flowers fall
by 10% assuming the shadow exchange rate and costs remain as
projected.
c)  Changes in investment costs:  The economic rate of return
falls by 3 percentage points if all the investment costs are
15% higher than estimated, assuming the shadow exchange
rate and prices remain as projected.
These analyses are presented graphically in Graph 1. Assuming an unfavorable
situation with prices falling by 10C  and investment costs increasing by 15%,
and the shadow rate of exchange at IL 4.55:US$l, then the economic rate of
return would be approximately as follows:
Projected rate of return                   20%
Shadow rate of exchange, IE 4.55:US$1   + 14
Fall in f.o.b. prices of 10%              - 8%
Increase of investment costs of l%       - 3,0
= approximately         13%

9.        Economic rates of return have also been calciulated for roses)
carnations and gladioli individually. The returns on roses at 19$ and
carnations (l95o) are lower than for gladioli (28,) but the rate of return
on gladioli is more sensitive to changes in prices.

Improving Existing Irrigation System
1.        Nearly 32% of total project investment vwould be directed tovard
improving the existing irrigation system. About 40 million cubic meters
of water would be saved and used to extend the irrigated area by about
9,200 ha.  The main investments would include replacing leaking and corroded
parts of the fixed irligation pipe netiqorks (Annex 7, Appendix 1) on
settlements which were mostly equipped for irrigation in the period 1950-
1955.  Investments would also include fitting automatic valves, awhich
supply measured doses of irrigation water, and which result in a saving of
about 10g-15' in water use.  Several factories in Israel now manufacture
these valves, which would be installed, together with pressure regulators
and metering systerms to irmprove water distribution, and plastic extensions
and sector sprinklers to prevent water wastage over the boundaries of irri-
gated plots.
2.        The major part of the additional irrigation water saved would be
used to irrigate about 1,200 ha avocados, tangerines and grapefruits and
39900 ha vegetables, Five thousand hectares cotton, wheat and other field
crops would also be cultivated. Investments in the plantations, including
fixed and portable irrigation equipment and establishment and maintenance,
have been included under Export Crop Development--Plantations (para 4.10).
3.        All costs of establishing and rmaintaining fruit plantations
(including fixed and portable irrigation networks) have been included in
calculating the financial and economic justification of improving the
existing irrigation system. The additional production from extending the
irrigated area would give a financial rate of return of 2W4, on the total
investment, Improved distribution would also improve yields on the exist-
ing irrigated area, but they have not been included in the benefits.
4.        Adjustments have been made to the financial flows of costs and
benefits in calculating the economic rate of return of 17o.  The adjust-
ments include:
a) raising the price of fertilizer which is subsidized to its
full cost;
b)  deducting a net income of IS 190 per ha for rainfed produc-
tion that could be obtained from the same land if the
project were not to take place; and
c) increasing the cost of imported inputs to reflect a shadow
exchange rate of IL 4.20:US$1 (Annex 11, para 5).

Regional Storage and Drainage
5.        A number of small-and medium-sized investments involving storage
and drainage in various locations would be included in the project. The
most important of these would be investment of IL 11.0 rillion in about 30
small reservoirs in the South to store storm water run-off. Each reservoir
would deliver about 350,000 m3 of water to provide supplementar-y irrigation
for 174 ha rainfec; winter wheat in the South of the country (see 14ap).
There would be about four smaller reservoirs in the North covering some
350 ha.  The investments (Annex 7, Appendix 1) would include dams, spill-
ways, pumps and some portable irrigation pipes. Mo further investment
would be required since nost of the portable irrigation equipment is avail-
able on the sattleTnents, but is currently needed only for summer production.
6.        Production and operating costs have been considered on an incre-

AGRICULTRiiAL CJEDIT PROJECT
1iAIIKETS LID HLRKETING
A. Perishable Exports
1.        High value and highly perishable exports of cut flowers and
fresh fruits and vegetables would account for about two thirds of project
sales after allowing for all losses. Two factors which would be critical
to the success of the project are, therefore, examined in this Annex:
(i) the growth of demand in Western European markets for off-season horti-
cultural produce and (ii) Israells competitive position in relation to
otUher exporting countr-ies with similar ecological conditions.
Demand Growth in 7.lestern Europe
Flowers
2.        Both consumption and imports of cut floi-ers into Wlestern Europe
are increasing rapidly, associated with increasing per capita income. For
example, imports into Germany increased by 20,, between 1966 and 1968 during
a period when per capita GIP rose by 61,.  Although precise studies are not
available, it is estimated that the income elasticity of demand for cut
flowiers in the more prosperous parts of Western Europe is exceeding 1.0.
Imports of Cut Flowers
(coi.f* prices in US$ million)
Year    Gerrmarn    Switzerland    Sweden    France
1950       2.7          1.7         0.7      0l
1960      18.6          3.8         4-5       0.2
1968      70,2          9.7         7.8       4.5
3.        Imports are higlly seasonal with the vast majority occurring
between November and April, the period when Israel makes over 801 of its
exports. The most important flowiers are roses and carnations, Which
together make up nearly half of all cut flower imports in WIestern Europe.
A large proportion of these imports is grown within Wlestern Europe, parti-
cularly the Netherlands and Italy.  Even so, Israeli flower exports have
grown rapidly from Us$1.05 aillion in 1966/67 to US$3.19 million in 1968/69,
and are projected to reach US$19.4 million in 1975/76, including project



AL2EA'E 10
Page 2
exports which would amount to US$6.8 million. At this time, total Israeli
exports would be no more than 5% of present Western European consumption,
although during the season, the share would be greater and would contribute
tou-ard reducing the fluctuation between winter and summer consumption of
flowers. To obtain these planned increases in Israeli production, increased
numbers of greenhouses and additional packing facilities would be required
as described in Annex 6,
4.        IJholesale prices of cut flowers in IWJestern Europe between November
and April are nearly double those during the other months and during this
off-season period, Israel is able to compete vith European producers in
spite of air-freight costs of about US$300 per ton, Since 1960, off-season
flower prices have remained strong and average prices for Bakara roses,
the variety most in demand, have shown a steatd increase in the Dutch
flowier auctions.
5.        Cut flowJers are traditionally sold f.o.b. at port of shipment.
Sales are negotiated in advance on the basis of color and grade by the
European offices of the Agricultural Export Company (AGREXCO) (para 22)
before packing and dispatch. The quality is critical since in many cases,
the price differential between lower and higher grades of the same variety
on the same day will be greater than 100%. Considerable skill is required
to obtain the high grades currently being achieved in Israel. Prices are
not expected to fall below the current levels, at any rate not before the
1980's.
6.        A first sorting and packing is carried outon the farm, but the
packing station will only accept as many flowers as are required to make
up the daily export orders. Project estimates have been made using the
estimated number of flowers delivered to the packing stations, which is
very much less than the number of flowers groawn (Annex 6, para 5). During
final grading in the packing station, normally about 10% are rejected and
sold on the local market. Since AGREXICO and the packing stations work on
a commission basis, the amount received by the farmer is the value of
exports (f,o*bo prices), converted at the 2021 preferential exchange rate
(para 6.09), plus any local sales less costs of packing, packing materials
and AGREX'CO?s commission.
Off-Season Vegetables
7G        With an increasingly prosperous consumer population in Western
Europe, there is a groving demand for a year-round supply of fresh vege-
tables, such as lettuce, celery, carrots, etc.  Demand for a wider variety
is also increasing, e.g. ogen melons, asparagus, capsicums, etc. Techno-
logical advances such as freeze-packing of lettuces, controlled environment
on board ship and use of containers have greatly reduced transport costs
making Israeli produce highly competitive. liany of these vegetables were
previously only knoin in a limited luxury trade in the major European cities,
and so income and price elasticities have yet to be experienced.



ALNEX 10
Page 3
8.        Eports of vegetables from Israel increased from US$2.25 million
in 1966/67 to US$5.o5 million in 1968/69. Further rapid increases to
US$19.0 rillion are forecast by 1974/75.  The major vegetables exported
are artichokes, onions, carrots, lettuce, aubergines, capsicums, ogen and
honeydew melons, strawberries, celery, tomatoes, watermelon and cherries.
The ilinistry of Agriculture produces individual export forecasts for about
20 vegetables annually so that farmers may adjust cropping patterns accord-
ingly. The demand for individual vegetables varies considerably between
European Economic Community (EEC) countries, United Kingdom (UK) and other
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. In terms of annual
consumption, most European countries produce a large share of their require-
menits during the surnmer, supplemented by imports from within the region,
e.g. the Netherlands. Consumption of most vegetables falls off during the
winter months when fresh supplies become limited. At the same time, the
proportion of canned and frozen produce consumed increases. Quantitative
estimates of Israel's share of the market would have little meaning due
to the enormous scope for substitution between different vegetables and
between fresh, canned and frozen products.  In any case, the market for
off-season vegetables is so new and expanding so rapidly that present
imports give little indication of what future levels might be, The main
effect of the project would be to provide a wider variety of fresh vege-
tables in IWestern Europe during a limited period when supplies are limited.
In total, Israeli exports would amount to a negligible percentage of total
Wlestern European consumption.
9.        AGPMJCO uses a number of arrangements for selling vegetables.
In the EEC, it negotiates its own sales in the main wholesale markets,
whereas in the UK, wholesalers generally sell for AGIiEXCO on a commission
basis. In both cases, AGREXCO pays import duties and all transport charges.
With less perishable produce such as carrots, AGBEX1CO sometimes sells a
consignment on board ship at the port of importation. The f.o.b. price on
whiclh payiments to farmers are made is calculated as the sum of the sales
received on all markets, less all costs between port of slhipment and final
sale, divided by the weight of goods shipped. Any losses from point of
shipment onward are, therefore, accounted for in the calculation of the
feo.b. prices.  Individual f.o.b. price projections have been made for 18
export vegetables and falls in price oP 20-30%' are anticipated 'y 1974/75.
resulting mainly from the relatively larger quantities that will be shipped
by Israel for sale on the off-season market.
10.       It is estimated that rather more than one half of the project's
vegetable production would be sold on the domestic market. On that part
going for e:port, AGRXMCO's commission, -jacking materials,  port expenses
in Israel and packing house charges would be deducted from the f.o.b.
prices. A further 20% of the production has been assumed to be lost or
to remain unsold. Accordingly, average prices received by farmers, and
prices projected in the project, would be cnly about 60% of the f.o.b.
prices.

Avocados and Iangoes
11.       Consumption of fruits, such as avocados and mangoes is expanding
rapidly, as these fruits are introduced more widely into the European
market.  The first export shiprients of Israeli avocades were made about
10 years ago when AGREXCO started to market them in London, using an
aggressive marleting policy which concentrated on the wholesale and retail
vegetable trades.  Subsequently, avocados have been successfully introduced
into provincial cities in the UK and a first introduction has now been
made in Scandinavia. Neither project nor national production of these
fruits is expected to saturate the iWJestern fuiropean market, since demand
is forecast to continue to expand rapidly.
12,       AGiELvXCO handles the export and sale of avocados and other non-
citrus fruits in a similar way to vegetables.  It is esti-ated that about
60% of the crop will be exported and it has been possible to assume a
constant f.o.b. price, since reductions in transport costs, due to shipping
a greater proportion by refrigerated ship rather than by air, would com-
pensate for any fall in prices on the WJestern European rmarkets. The
remaining 405 of production would be sold on the local market at a much
lower price.
Grapefruits
13.        iarket prospects for grapefruits, in contrast to those of oranges,
are very favorable, Consumption of grapefruits varies considerably between
different 1Western European countries. The three largest importers and
conswuers are the UK, Germany amd France w%here consumption has expanded
rapidly since 1960:

1/ FAO projections.
Similar rates of increase were recorded in the Netherlands, Belgium and
Luxer,iburg. For these six countries alone, total imports increased from
134,C00 tons in 1962 to 216,000 tons in 1967 equivalent to an annual rate
of increase of 10%1. Over the same period per capita, consumption has



ALIMEX 10
Page 5
increased greatly but even the highest level of e14 kgs/head in the UK is
low in comparison with the USA, 3.7 kgs/head and Canada 3,4 kgs/head.
Consumption and imports are expected to continue to expand by 4%-5%0 annually
to 1980 as per capita consumption continues to increase.
14.       Israel is the dominant exporter to Western Europe between October
and 1Iay and exports have risen from 77,000 tons in 1963/64 to 127,000 tons
in 1968/69.  In 1967, Israeli exports to the UK, Germany, France, Holland,
Belgium and Luxemburg together amounted to about 93,000 tons or about 45%
of the total annual imports of these six countries. During the season, it
is estimated that Israelts share of the market is as high as 70o. Controlled
harvesting has made it possible to concentrate exports early and late in
the season wihen supplies from competitors such as Cyprus are less and prices
higher.  New planting of 800 ha and improved drainage of 2,700 ha existing
plantations, which would be included in the project, would result in addi-
tional exports of 38,000 tons of fresh fruit by 1978/79. This would be
equivalent to 3,; annual increase in Israeli exports and would assist Israel
to maintain its share of the expanding Wlestern European market.
15.       Prices paid to farmers are based on an equitable division of the
sales obtained from export, local and processing markets.  All producers
are paid a basic price for each exportable kind and size of fruit delivered.
The Citrus ikiarketing Board controls the flowi of exports by controlling -the
time wdhen each orchard may be picked.  An. additional premium is, therefore,
paid for later deliveries as compensation for risk of damage by pests and
weather. Prices projected for the project have been weighted assuming that
at full production, 70%' of the crop would be exported, 4% consumed on the
domestic market and 26% would go for industrial processing.   Average prices
received on the export and domestic markets, respectively, during the last
three years, have been projected to continue,but a lower price has been
assumed for grapefruits sold for industrial processing.
Tangerines
16.       Demand for tangerines is increasing in Europe, and particularly
for crosses such as clemantines, which are easy to peel, have few pits,
and a good flavor. Unlike grapefruit, Israel has previously consumed all
her production of tangerines, but successful shipments in 1968/69 have led
to a shift to exports and have created the need for increased export pack-
ing facilities. Total imports of tangerines in lWestern Europe during the
six months October-I4arch have increased from 277,000 tons in 1964/65 to
371,000 tons in 1968/69, an annual increase of 7.5%. The largest importers
are France and Germany, each importing about 120,000 tons in 1966/67,  Proj-
ect exports would amount to 13,500 tons by 1978/79 when total Israeli
exports would be about 55,00o  tons.  This would be less than 10,%t of total
European imports during the winter season, and would be mainly from January-
iMarch wihen shipments from Spain and North Africa decline.  iTo more than 50%
of project production would be exported, about 40%" consumed on the domestic
market and the remaining 10% sent for industrial processing.  A weighted
average price has been projected for the project.

Israells Competitive Position in Itelation to Other Producers
170       Although several countries in the Mediterranean region have
suitable ecological cmnditions for producing off-season horticultural
produce, Israel has a number of advantages over its competitors.  First,
by concentrating production of vegetables in the Arava and Bet-Shaan
valleys, Which are below sea level and have suitable soils, Israel is able
to exploit some climatic advantage over competitors in similar latitudes.
Second, advanced agricultural technology, such as use of hormone sprays,
early and late varieties has also enabled Israel to exploit the short
periods when prices are highest.  Advanced technology has also resulted in
higher yields and better quality, e.g. uniform size and color, and hence
greater returns per hectare and lower costs per unit of output. A large
on-going horticultural research program coupled with a highly effective
extension service should permit these technological advantages to be
maintained. However, the most important factor affecting Israelts
competitive position for horticultural exports is the integration of
production and export marketing that has been evolved over several years
of successful horticultural exporting.
18.       Within Israel, there is close coordination between agricultural
planning, production and market organization., Which is well adapted to
production of high value perishable crops. There is considerable experi-
ence of producer cooperatives for packing and handling farm produce, and
constr-uction of additional packing facilities for packing expolts would
not present any organizational problems, There is also vertical integra-
tion between producers and Aarketing Boards, and IMarketing Boards and the
two export marketing agencies. Producers and producerst cooperatives are
strongly represented on the 13 Production and iiarketing Boards which cover
all important branches of agriculture.  Government and -wholesale marketing
cooperatives are also represented on these Boards,
19.       Three Boards would be directly concerned with the project's
perishable output, the Citrus, Vegetable, and Flower Ilarketing Boards.
The two former Boards have statutory powers whereas the latter operates
as a limited company. The Citrus and Flowier Boards participate in market-
ing operations themselves or through agents. lWith these Boards, producers
must sell through the Board, and payments to producers are based on the
pooled receipts obtained on all markets. Premiums are paid for grade and
the time during the export season when the produce is supplied. The
Vegetable Marketing Board on the other hand., does not engage in selling,
20.       The Citrus MIarketing Board is responsible also for the export
of oranges, grapefruits and tangerines, Established in 1940, it has a
head office for Europe situated in London with 10 branch offices on the
continent and 5 offices in the UK as well as offices in Israel. The Board
regulates shipments, transportation within I-urope and sales on the main
wholesale markets.  The Board is also responsible for market analysis and
pursues effective advertising and market promotion campaigns. The addi-
tional project production of grapefruits and tangerines would not be a
very significant -roportion of the Board' s turnover.

21.       AGIEX,C0 is responsible for marketing all perishable non-citrus
horticultural exports. It operates for producers and 14arketing Boards on
a commission basis. Membership of its Board is shared equally between
Government and the concerned lIarketing Boards and marketilg cooperatives.
AGREXCO utilizes the services of the Export Crop Division of the Ministry
of Agriculture for much of its market research.  It has a vigorous trade
promotion policy that concentrates on advertising and demonstrations to the
wholesale and retail green-grocer trades, and systematically opens up new
markets throughout W,1estern Europe,
22.       AGREXCO has expanded rapidly since its establishment in 1957,
and nowJ has six branch offices in the EEC, UK and other EFTA countries,
as well as a European flower distribution center in Frankfurt.  Increased
capacity will be required to enable it to handle the growth in exports
projected for 1974/75, when project exports would amount to about one
third of Israelts total of non-citrus exports, as shown in the table below.
The collection and dispatch facilities at Lod Airport and the cold storage
space at Ashdod Port included in the project would provide the additional
capacity required.

B. Import Substitutes and Non-Perishable Exports
Cotton
23e       Exports of cotton lint fron Israel have growm from 2,800 tons in
1964 to 11,000 tons in 1968. Production in 1968 was 33,000 tons of lint
and the proj ect would add an additional 3,900 tons of medium to medium-long
staple lint.  Currently, Israel imports 7,000 tons of lower quality cotton
lint and the textile industry is expanding, Part of the incremental pro-
duction would be used for import substitution and the remainder would be
exported for sale on world markets. Cotton marketing is controlled by the



AUFfT3SX 10
Page 8
Cotton !Iarketing Board which has statutory pow7ers and participates directly
in marketing. The average f.o.b. price of US$600 a ton received in the
three years 1966-1968 has been projected to fall 15' by 197}, remaining
stable thereafter.
Uheat
24.       Project production of hard wheat would substitute for some of
the 346,OOO tons of wheat currently imported.  A constant price has been
used equivalent to the present price of imported hard wheat, which is not
expected to fall.

Financial Justification
1l        The project would be well integrated in spite of the large
number of different elements that it contains, WIater development providing
additional irrigation water and the constructior of additional packing
facilities vould be sufficient for the project's production, The AG&i?XCO
facilities have, however, been designed to provicle for centralized modern
reception and dispatch of the planned national, rather than project, exports
of flowers, fruits and vegetables up to and beyond 1975 (Annex 10, para 22).
2,        The financial returns of the different elements of the
project,     range from 13% to 5010 (A-nnex 11, Apperndix 1).  The rates have
been calculated on the basis of models prepared for each of the mix of
activities in the projecto For example, a model has been prepared for
400 ha avocado which includes the establishment of the plantation, main-
tenance through the imnature period, and construction of a packing station
in the sixth year when the trees come into production. A life of 20 years
has been assumed for the model to allow} for the rapid rate of change in
technology and in consumers' taste,,although the trees would continue to
produce avocados for more than 30 years after establishment.  Since farmers
operate their ovn packing facilities cooperatively and at cost, all profits
are passed back to tle producer.  Farm production, packing and marketing
must in consequence be considered as parts of a single proc uction process
and the samne rate of return applies to the plantation and to the packing
station.  A similar situation applies to AGIIEZrCO's facilities, w0hich are
operated for producers at cost and form part of the overall production and
export narketing cycle.
3.        Calculations are based on the following general assumptions:
a)  Cost estLmates are based on current costs prevailing in
Israel.
b) Costs ofi Lmported cormlponentS have been converted at the
official rate of exchange (IS 3.50:US4l)0
c)  Financial benefits include the 205' preferential rate of
exchange received by producers for agricultural exports,
making an effective rate of exchange of IL 4.20:US$l on
these exports.
d) Financial rates of return have been calculated before pay-
ment of incorae tax.

Economic Justification
4.        Project economic rates of return (Annex 11, Appendixu 2) are
mostly about 5  lower than the financial rates.  The economic rate of
return on the total project investment would be about 18% and has been
calculated as the average rate of return of each of the mix of activities
weighted by the investment in that activity.
5.        Several adjustments have been made to the flows of financial
costs and benefits as detailed below, but no additional costs have been
added    for the Extension Service.  The existing Service is well organized
and would be capable of supervising the project without further assistance:
a)   Costs of water and fertilizers (both of which are subsidized)
have been raised by IL 2.8 million (US$0.8 million) annually in
order to reflect their full cost. All other inputs, including
labor, have been charged at market rates.
b)   The net income fron alternative production without the project
has been deducted from project benefits. In the case of flowers,
existing supplies of irrigation water would be used. Since quotas
limit the total amount of irrigated cultivation, the production
lost would be in proportion to the relative water consumptive
uses of the alternative crops, and an amount of It 0.2 million
(US$0.1 million) has been deducted. i4Jost crops, however, would
be groun on extended irrigated areas and the net alternative
income of If 2.0 million (US$0.6 million), from rainfed wheat,
sorghura and hay, has been deducted frcm project benefits.
c)   The foreign exchange componei;tu of all project benefits has been
shadowj priced in order to reflect more accurately project's
contribution to the eccnomy. A rate of IL 4.20:US$l has been
adopted. The preferential rate of exchange currently used for
agricultural exports, which is also IL 4.20:Us$1, supports the
use of this rate. Economic benefits woulci, thus, be the same as
financial benefits. Economic costs uoald, however, be increased
due to the increased costs of imported inputs. Project invest-
ment costs w-ould be raised 8%l or by IL 15.7 million (US$4.5
million) and operating costs bar WS' or IL 2.7 million (US$0e8
million) at full production. This explains why the project
economic rate of return is about 5 percentage points below the
financial rate of return..
