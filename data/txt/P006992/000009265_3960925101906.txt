PROJE;CT GNMIIZOS R M
HIGHLI~GHTSR
1.       Loan 2104-DO (US$25.4 million equivalent), was made to the
Government of the Dominican Republic, with the objective of financing the
development of the sites of Sabana Perdida and Baina as integrated
communities to accommodate about 8,000 low-income families. A rapid and
effective reconstruction program following a disastrous hurricane in
September 1979, had turned the Government's attention to the needs of ihe
urban poor. The Bank encouraged and supported the first efforts to deal
formally with the needs of the country's urban population, which is growing
twice as fast as the population as a whole. The Bank signed its loan
agreement under the premise that the Government had effected important
changes in priorities.
2.       The Sites and Services project, the Bank's first in the low-cost
housing sector in the Dominican Republic, did not achieve its objectives
because the new administration of President Jorge Blanco, inaugurated two
months before the loan became effective, changed the policies of its
predecessor (President Guzman). The Government did not supply the
counterpart funds stipulated in the loan agreement; instead, it applied its
available financial resources, which were scarce, to developing housing for
high-income groups, who were not the targeted under the loan. The
appointed executing agency did not Implement the project, and spent only
152 of projected construction costs (excluding fi"ncial charges). The
Bank loaned VS$25.4 million and, at the request of a successor government,
headed by President Joaquin Balaguer, cancelled the US$21.4 million
undisbursed balance four years after loan effectiveness. Your years of
Bank effort did not persuade the governments of the current and former
administrations to ratify and support the comitment of President Guzman
(paras. 3.1.2, 3.3.2 and 4.3.1).
3.       In all aspects the project was a failure, because nothing was
built, the studies prepared were not implemented and TNVI's present
financial and organizational situation is worse than the one that existed
at the time of appraisal (paras. 3.1.5 and 3.6.1)



DONNICAN REPU-LIC
SITES AND SERVICES PROJECTS (WAN 2104-DO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.  BSGON
1.1      The Dominican Republic has a territory of 48,400 km2, a population
half rural, half urban with a density of 112 people per square kilometer,
&mong the highest in Latin America. Previously to Loan 2104-DO, which is
the subject of this report, there had been no Bank involvement in the
housing sector, and there was no organized institutional housing program
benefitting the urban poor until a national disaster spurred the Government
into action.
1.2      The times se,emed favorable for a sites and services project in the
Dominican Republic. Two disastrous hurricanes in September 1979 that
destroyed over 100,000 dwellings, principally in the urban areas, focused
government attention on urban dwelling needs and accelerated Bank interest
in addressing the problems of low-cost housing in the Dominican Republic.
The project to build 8,000 low-cost housing solutions, was the first
organized government effort to address the needs of a growing tvrban
population with incomes at or below the absolute poverty line.
1.3      From 1970 to 1980 urban population grew 62 annually, twice the
overall growth rate, and constituted in 1980 approximately 502 of the total
population of 5.4 million. Approximately half of the urban population
constructed houses with sub-standard materials on public lands lacking
essential public services.
1.4      Government priorities, however, favored investments in the rural
areas and did not reflect the demographic trend toward urban gr-wth. The
two government housing agencies, INI and INAVI (Instituto Nacional de
Auxilios y Viviendas), received limited government support and supplied
houses to middle-income families on concessionary terms. NVI, formed in
1962, had built a yearly average of 500 middle-class homes from 1962 to
1979.
1.5      Credit facilities were simply not available to the urban poor.
The savings and loan institutions financed houses starting at tD$ 10,000
(US$10,000 at the then official exchange rate of RD$ 1 - US$1), well above
the amounts affordable by the urban poor.
1.6      Shortly after hurricanes David and Frederick struck the island,
the government channeled unprecedented amounts ol reconstruction funds
through INVI, which effectively rose to the challenge. A new director
appointed in August, 1379, with a mandate for change and supported by
government policies, organized and directed assistance in 1980 to over
40,000 families in repairs and reconstruction of 1,900 dwellings and the
mobilization of over 30,000 people in the reconstruction effort.

11. !J_WJZCT IDENTIPICATION. PRUPARATION AN) APPRAISAL
2.1      Origin  &d tationale for the Pro1ect
2.1.1    The project files began in October 1977 with A letter of the then
IDVI director expressing an interest in the Fundacidn Salvadore)a de
Vivienda Mliima (FUND&SAL), a successful private low-cost housiAg
Institution In 31 Salvador financed by the Bank. A few day. after -.he
September, 1979 hurricanes the Bank vent a brief reconnaissance mission.
followed by an identification missiui In November, 1979.
2.1.2    The reconnaissance mission saw an opportunity to encourage an
impressive change In priorities in the government and the seventeen-year-
old housing authority, IKVT. Supported by Increased government funding,
INVI successfully built an organization cap&ble of executing the emergency
program. The reconnaissance mission, In concord with government officials,
saw an unusual opportunity to help institutionalize this new-found energy
in a formal low-cost housing program with a newly revitalized INVI as the
executing agency. The mission recommended a US$500,000 project preparation
advance approved by the Bank on Pebruary 5, 1980. The advance allowed INVt
to thoroughly prepare the project (final engineerlng and tender documents),
publish an impressive project booklet (Proyectos Urbanos de Lotes y
Servicios, July 1982), and construct 15 pilot units on the Sabana Perdida
site.
2.2      Proiect nre"aration and agnraisal
2.2.1    Two project preparation missions in April and June of 1980
confirmed satisfectory progress of the UPP (Unidad de Preparacidn de
Proyecto), a new division of INVI with 20 professional staff created with
Bank funds to prepare the project for formal appraisal. Thx project was
designated to serve the following objectives (set out in the first project
brief issued in December 1979)s
1) Assist in housing policy formulation;
2) Develop institutional capacity to plan and implement the
project;
3) Improve resource a&location within the housing sector;
4) Increase output of urban units at affordable cost with a
reasonable cost recovery;
5) Mobilize private savings through broadened housing credit and
secure tenure;
6) Ensure replicability of low-cost housing programs;
7) Reduce foreign exchange requirements and adoption of labor-
intensive construction methods; and
8) Gradually improve selected sites for planned commiunitis.



2.2.2    Three updated project briefs, a pre-appraisal mission In December
1980 *nd an appraisal mlision in May 1981, reported satisfactory progress
in project preparation and an ever-increasing resolve in INVI and the
government tn redirect government funds toward the urban poor. The project
preparation facility effectively provided the seed assistance for an
innovative housing program.
2.2.3    2he Project was appraised in May 1981 and the mission recommended
that a loan of US$25.4 millioa be processed. The Project contemplated the
construction and sale of 8,000 serviced lots during a four-year peried on
two undeveloped properties in the Santo Domingo area, Sabana Perdida (85
hectares) and Baina (55 hectares). The appraisal report expected an 85S
recovery of all costs with 80S of sales to beneficiaries below the absolute
poverty level. A novel feature of the program was a planned sale of up to
251 of the land to commercial users at market values estimated to be
considerably above cost. The loan agreement described the Project as
followst
Part As Off-site Infrastructures (1) Construction in Sabana Perdida
sites four wellu. an abduction line, an elevated storage tank, a
stabilixation pond, and power substation.
Part :s On-site Infrastructures (1) provision of the necessary
infrastructure such as water, sewerage and electricity, public lighting
and roads and drainage for about 51.35 ha. of land for dwellings in
Sabana Perdida, about 34.75 ha. of land for dwallings in Haina and
about 4.40 ha. of land for commercial use. (2) construction of shelter
units in Sabana Perdida and Maina and provision of loans for the
acquisition of dwelling plots and shelter units.
Part C: Community Facilitiess (1) construction in each of the project
sites of the following: a school, a health center, seven social
centers (three in Haina), a payment collection office, a fire station,
police station, sports grounds and trash collection services.
Part Ds Extension servicess provision of extension services to
beneficiaries including social assistance and technical advice in self-
help home improvement activities.
Part S: Studies and Monitorings (1) study of INVI's future financial
viability and (2) monitoring of the carrying out of the Project by
INI.
2.2.4    In order to mininize the risks arising from INVI's lack of
experience, the project provided for considerable technical assistance in
institutional building. To complement the skill of national personnel, the
project included the financing of the costs of a UNDP resident expert and
use of consultants in information systems, mortgage portfolio collection
procedures, computers, and savings development.
2.2.5    The appraisal mission est.mated the cost of the project at US$41.7
million (excluding financial charges), with foreign and local costs
estimated at US$14.9 and US$26.8 million respectively. The Bank ould
finance 1002 of the foreign costs and 392 of the local cost. The
Government would finance the remainder of the local costs and the Interest
during construction.

2.3      Negotiations. Board Presentation and Effectiveness
2.3.1    Negotiations took place on January 27-29, 1982 and were
successfully completed In February of that year. The one month delay was
due to the fact that the negotiating team from the Dominican Republic
proposed to have only one legal Instrument --the Loan Agreement-* while the
Bank wanted to to spell out INVI's specific responsibilities in a
complementary Project Agreement. The negotiating team returned to the
Dominican Republic to consult with the Government, which finally accepted
the Bank position. The Board approved the loan on March 23, 1982.
Representatives of the Bank, INVI and the Government signed the Loan and
Project Agreements on April 14, 1982. The loan amount was US$25.4 milliont
the term was 17 years, Including four years of grace. The interest rate
was 11-3/52 p.a, the coammitment charge, 3/4S p.a and the front-end fee,
1-112S on the total loan amount. June 30, '1987, was set as the closing
date.
2.3.2    The Bank declared the loan effective on October 22, 1982 or four
months later than forecast at appraisal. The reason for this delay was
that the Government did not make the initial deposit of US$1,700,000 to the
project account as scheduled; and the Congress, the Government and INVI
acted slowly to approve/prepare the legal documentation required by the
Bank for declaring the loan effective. The delay, in part, is explained by
the fact that on August 16, 1982, between negotiations and loan
effectiveness, a new president took office and appointed a new director of
INVI. A 2-1/2 years relationship between the Bank and the INVI director
ended, and although it was not yet evident at the tIme, the sharing of
comnon goals also ended.
2.4      Maior Covenants of the Loan and Proiect Agreements
2.4.1    Annex 1 includes the major covenants of the Loan and Project
Agreement. The Government and INVI did not comply with their respective
major covenants as explained in detail in Chapters III through V.
III - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
3.1      Imilementation
3.1.1    Stated bluntly, the project was never implemented and uo important
objective was achieved. INVI never completed one house or sold one lot
during the entire period from loan effectiveness to cancellation. At best,
INVI improved an urban property which, It now appears, another government
agency will finish. Repeated changes in the director and key personnel,1
construction delays, lack of counterpart funding and commitment to the
project objectives, contributed to this unsatisfactory performance. In
March of 1987 the project was informally transferred from INVI to the
Coordinating Office (Oficina Coordinadora), an arm of the President's
Office created by President Balaguer to construct government housing.
3.1.2    In September 1982, a month after taking ofEice, President Blanco
announced a US$163 million public housing construction program at a time
11 lVIN had five directors betweert August 1979 and June 1988.



when the government's entire annual capital budget averaged US$250 million.
More striking than the overly ambitious size of the program, which soon
encountered financial obstacles, was the discovery during a December 1982
supervision mission, that this program did not include funding for the Bank
project in the official budget. In September 1982, the new director
announced ITNI's participation in the president's housing program, two
massive multi-family middle-class construction projects, Invivienda Santo
Domingo  __075 million) in the capital and largest city, and Invivienda
Santiago (US$45 million), in the second largest city. Managerial attention
and resources originally intended for the Bank project were diverted to the
new projects. The director of the Sites av.4 Services Division (the
successor to the UPP) resigned in December 1982. Within a year, the
Invivienda projects were suspended for lack of funds, and the president
Appointed another INVI director on October 23, 1983. As of March, 1988,
the date of the PCR mission, not one Invivienda dwelling had been finished,
even though down-payments from prospective beneficiaries and a special
US$60 million bond issue helped finance a significant portion of
construction costs.
3.1.3    During the first year of the loan, the Bank disbursed
approximately US$2,000,000, half on the creation of the special account
(US$1,000,000) and half on other costs, principally project preparation
refinancing (US$532,000), consultants such as the UNDP Habitat resident
consultant (US$125,000) ant front end fees (US$ 375,000). From October
1983 to August 1986, the Bank disbursed US$ 1.7 million for construction
costs and US$ 0.3 million for other costs.  The total cumulative
disbursements were US$3.98 million, but INVI still (as of May, 1989) owes
the Bank a refund of US$0.83 million of unspent funds from the Special
Account. Therefore, the net disbursement will amount to US$3.15 million or
121 of the loan (Annexes 2, 3 and 4). Disbursements by loan categories
were also far different from forecast (Annex 5).
3.1.4    INVI's Sites and Services Division did not complete construction
of one house or one fully serviced lot from October, 1982, date of loan
effectiveness, to March 1988. Works were undertaken on only one of the two
sites, Sabana Perdida. INVI never carried out the expropriation decree or
began construction on the Haina site. A visit to the Sabana Perdida site
in March 1988 revealed the following:
(1)   approximately 50 squatter families still living on the
propertys
(2)   approximately 250 unfinished INVI-built, Bank-financed
homes, 30 delivered at the request of the government to
victims of a fire in a nearby town. These homes have no
electricity, most have no water, no sewer connections and
are virtually uninhabitable. The 30 occupants do not know
how much they will pay for the homes but, in any case,
refuse to pay anything until the homes are completed. INVT
plans to gradually complete the houses under construction
according with the availability of its funds.
(3)   approximately 900 non-Bank financed, non-INVI houses are
being built by the President's Coordinating Office,
President Balaguer's housing construction agency. These
houses, slightly larger than the INV houses, are supplied



to their respective owners totally finished. In this
manner, the serviced lot concept of the Bank-financed
project has been abandoned;
(4)   open unfinished ditches for sewer and rain water lines;
(5)   no paved roadst and
(6)   a sewerage treatment pond is still without pumps or
connecting pipelines.
3.1.5    Although INVI has made infrastructure investment on a part of the
Sabana Perdida property, it had not completed anything to a point where it
could be sold as a finished lot or completed home as of March 1988. The
site as it stands today is a valuable property and could have been sold at
a profit to a more aggressive and efficient developer, but instead the
Government transferred it informally to the Oficina Coordinadora.
3.1.6    It has to be pointed out that the Bank financed the purchase of a
computer which INVI successfully installed and uses today. In addition,
the UN donated a personal computer for the planning unit.
3.2      Reduction of Professional Staff
3.2.1    Another factor that affected the project was substitution of
trained professional staff. The INVI's Division of Sites and Services
initiated itp activities in June 1980, as the Project Preparation Unit
(Unidad de Precaracifn de Proyecto-UPP), financed by the Bank's project
preparation facility (US$ 500,000). This unit rapidly expanded to 20
professional employees. By May 1981, their work was ready for Bank
appraisal. In January of 1982 with the expectation of becoming the leader
of a vigorous national sites and services program, the INVI director
changed its name to the Division of Sites and Services. Instead of
expanding, the division contracted to 12 employees in early January 1983.
In May 1983, after further personnel reductions, the division closed its
office and moved to INVI's building. Thereafter, the division functioned
as the construction supervisor of an underfunded, non-priority INVI housing
project. As of March, 1988, the division had only one full-time employee.
3.3      Bank Supervisions
3.3.1    Two months after President Blanco announced the Invivienda
projects, a December 1982 Bank supervision mission expressed concern that
these projects would divert attention and funds away from the Bank
project. By June of 1983 the Bank noted multiple violations of the project
agreement. In December 1983 a supervision mission recommended suspension/
cancellation of the loan unless INVI effected substantial changes, a
position ratified again during the next supervision mission in April 1984;
but processing within the Bank of such decision did not take place. A Bank
program mission in August 1984 obtained promises of reform from the
government, principally a willingness to transfer the moribund Invivienda
projects from TNVT to another government agency and promises to put current
the overdue government counterpart funds. However, the expectations noted
in the October 1984 supervision mission vanished by June 1985 when a
supervision mission again recommended cancellation or reallocation of
unspent funds.



3.3.2    The first telex threatening suspension was sent on March 19,
1986. The Bank requested the Government and INVI to take the following
actions: (a) furnish a satisfactor7 three year program of action for
implementing the entire Sabana Perdida component; (b) provide satisfactory
evidence that at least US$5 million equivalent of counterpart funds would
be provided for this project in FY86 and US$2 million in FY87; (c) furnish
a three year financial program for INVI; (d) furnish a copy of INVI's board
of eirectors' resolution confirming that INVI would apply appropriate
lending terms, conforming to the provision of the project agreement, to all
housing loans in cities with more than 30,000 inhabitants; and (e) request
cancellation of the amount of the loan allocated to the Haina site
components (401 of the loan amount). The telex outlined several
infractions of the project agreement with INVI and asked for compliance
with a list of corrective actions by May 2, 1986, a deadline which was
later extended to June 19, 1986. A June 24, 1986 meeting in Washington
with government officials from the Office of the Presidency, the Central
Reserve Bank and INVI signed an aide memoire that promised funding by July
14, 1986. The Bank granted two additional extensions of this deadline to
August 30, 1986 and then to Sept mber 30, 1986. On August 23, 1986
President Balaguer's new administration appointed another INVI director who
hoped to rescue the project, but was also unable to secure the necessary
counterpart funds. On December 4, 1986, following a November 2, 1986
government request, that coincided with the expiration of the loan's four-
year grace period on November 3, 1986, the Bank formally cancelled the
unspent balance, US$ 21.4 million or 841 of the original loan amount.
3.3.3    The nine supervision missions from July 1982 to December 1986,
which required more than a man year of staff time in the field, repeatedly
called attention to the unsatisfactory performance. Section 3 of the last
supervision report issued in December 1986, summarizes the deteriorated
situation as follows:
The SAR presentation (March 1, i982) associated the
main risks of this project withs (i) the continuity of
the Government commitment to a decisive turn in public
housing policy; (ii) the capacity of the executing
agency (INVI) to sustain a prolonged process of change
while substantially modifying its product; and (iii)
the adoption of adequate cost recovery policies in
pricing INVI's production and in selecting suitable
beneficiaries. Adverse circumstances have affected the
project in all three respects since its inception in
October 1982. First, President Blanco's administration
immediately diverted the productive capacity of INVI
into an underfunded and unsuccessful drive towards
construction of middle-income housing, which quickly
drained the Institute's staff and resources. Second,
INVI underwent a sequel of top-management changes and
wholesale substitutions of professional staff, thus
wasting away the benefits of accumulated training and
experience. Third, the Borrower indulged in heavily
subsidized, political programs neglecting
implementation of the Bank supported project. The
repeated recommendations by Bank staff, UNDP and GTZ
experts, the external auditors, and the economic
planning and monetary authorities, during four years of
discussions were of no avail to prevent the



decapitalization of the Agency. The new administration
inherited a situation in which the only sensible option
was to apply for a long procrastinated cancellation of
the undisbursed 84Z of the loan."
3.3.4    It has to be pointed out that the time allocated for supervision
was extremely low for an innovative project and in light of the difficult
experience that the Bank had had with other loans to this country.
Supervision missions were carried out at a rate of 4 staff-weeks per year
for the first two years. They should have been in the order of 10 staff-
weeks per year. This situation may have been one of the causes for the
failure of the project. A more intense supervision may have induced action
by the Government and INVI. Alternatively, if no responce was obtained, it
would have induced action by the Bank cancelling the loan immediately.
3.4      Proiect Costs
3.4.1    From October 22, 1982, (date of loan effectiveness) to June 30,
1987, (the date of the mid-year audited financial statements), INVI spent
US$ 6.4 million, approximately 152 of the estimated appraisal costs of USS
41.7 million (Annex 2). The Bank had agreed to finance US$ 25.4 million,
approximately 61Z of total project costs. Excluding the remaining balance
of unused funds in the special account, the Bank disbursed approximately
US$3.2 million or 12Z of the loan amount (Annex 2).
3.5      SDecial Account
3.5.1    The Loan Agreement included a special account amounting up to
US$ 1,000,000. This amount was disbursed from the loan and deposited in an
account in the Central Bank, which was denominated and operated in pesos,
even though the loan agreement required that this account be established in
US dollars or other fully convertible currency. Vhen the undisbursed
balance of the loan was cancelled (para. 3.3.2), the special account had an
outstanding balance of US$ 826,953.04. The Bank asked the Government to
identify any eligible expenditure and send a corresponding withdrawal
application or else refund this amount. No refund had been received by
May 1989. The Bank is insisting with the Government on the refund of the
unused balance and has taken the position that no new special accounts will
be authorized in the Dominican Republic loans unless the -efund is made.
3.5.2    The purpose of the special account was to have funds in a fully
convertible currency available exclusively for the Project, in order to
have an adequate flow of funds for the executing agency (INVI), for
financing expenditures for specific project components with a minimum of
administrative delay. The regulations of the accounts were not totally
fulfilled, particularly the aspects related to the currency denomination of
it. The Bank staff who supervised the Project did not raise any concern
about the operation of the account in local currency. For future
operations, the Bank should examine very carefully the establishment of
special accounts in the Dominican Republic and monitor systematically its
operation.

3.6      Performance of coniultants and contractors
3.6.1    INV  received help from many consultants.  ?he United Nations
provided a full-time architect planner, financed by the Bank for four years
from 1983 to 1987. Another consultant prepared a lengthy report on the
financial viability of NV1 (the Saladin report) which cost over US$ 40.000
and contained many useful recommendations which, in spite of formal
adoption by the INVI Board of Directors, were never implemented. GTZ, the
German technical assistance agency, produced many reports on mechanization
possibilities, cost accounting and other matters. The UN financed a study
of methods to improve mortgage portfolio collections. None of this aid has
had a significant Impact on INVI. To quote a coument about these studies,
23 in all, found on page 19 of the project completion report prepared by
INVI's UN consultant: 'these reports could be potentially useful when the
government grants INVI a definite housing role in the sector'.
3.6.2    INVI awarded a total of six contracts under the Sites and Services
project using Bank-approved bidding procedures. All of the contracts
required renegotiations, once in May 1985 and again in February 1987 due to
delays and inflation. None of the contracts had been completely liquidated
as of March 1988.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1      Construction delays
4.1.1    The project encountered unreasonable delays from the outset.
Construction began before the INVI could relocate the squatters pursuant to
expropriation decrees applicable to 202 of the Sabana Perdida site. INVI
management was unable to stop the invasion of additional squatters even
after loan effectiveness in October 1982, thus complicating a sensitive
task never completed. Six years after the project started, approximately
50 squatter families were still living on the Sabana Perdida land. Delays
in supplying funds for relocation delayed construction and resulted in more
than one construction stoppage. Later, contractors stopped work when INVI
was unable to pay them. Considering the delicate nature of relocating the
squatters and its critical importance to the urbanization of the land,
perhaps a detailed plan for squatter relocation could have been
incorporated into the conditions for initial loan effectiveness.
4.2      The oroiect became too expensive
4.2.1    The pilot project of Sites and Services met a pressing need for
low-cost housing solutions with the possibility of serving as a guide for a
national housing policy. Delays and inflation accompanied by a three-to-
one devaluation of the Dominican peso in January 1985 drove costs upward
faster than the income of the beneficiaries. Cost recalculations prepared
in 1985 indicated that the 85 cost recovery objectives would be difficult
to achieve.
4.3      The Proiect was underfunded      -
4.3.1    After the initial deposit, a condition for effectiveness, the
Government never complied with Article 3.02 td) of the project agreement
requiring it to maintain the peso equivalent of US$500,000 in the project
bank account. The Bank cancelled the undisbursed project in December 1986



- 10 -
principally for lack of counterpart funding, but also because the
Goverrment was not interested in the serviced lot concept of the project
and the cost recovery principle of it. A vigorous entrepreneurial approach
to the project might have salvaged parts of it in spite of the anemic
counterpart funding. Until the Coordinating Office of the president
unofficially commandeered the project site and began to build on it in
1987, INVI owned a valuable improved urban property with the Bank's
approval to sell up to 25Z of the land at market prices to private
developers.   This novel feature, never utilized, could have provided
additional needed funds.
4.4      INVI resumes subsidies to beneficiaries
4.4.1    Starting August 1982, INV  reverted to a policy of subsidizing
beneficiaries by setting sale prices below costs and interest rates on
loans below market values. INVI often charged 62 to 82 to its
beneficiaries, and never as much as the 122 interest rate stipulated in the
loan documents.
4.5      Mortiame portfolio collections unsatisfactory
4.5.1     INVI's mortgage collections continued to be a problem for two
reasons. First, INVI never could muster the resolve to foreclose on one
single beneficiary, no matter how delinquent. Second, INVI officials often
permitted occupancy without signed agreements, and began to bill monthly
payments. Month after month, the delinquency statistics were overstated
reflecting balances overdue for accounts that were not collectable at the
outset.
4.6      Presidential grants
4.6.1    President Blanco's powers apparently permitted him to forgive
mortgages due (RD$ 2.6 million in 1985 and RD$ 6.2 million in 1986) vithout
compensation to INVI. Likewise, the write-off in 1986 of over RD$ 19
million of INVI receivables for completed occupied projects with no sales
agreements could be considered a de facto grant. This practice received so
much unfavorable publicity that a Decree 80-87, promulgated in February
1987, prohibited state institutions from donating their assets.
V. FINANCIAL PEPORMANCE
5.1      Annexes 6 and 7 compare the actual and appraisal income statements
and balance sheets for the period 1981-1987. INVI's financial performance
during the period was poor. All the years of the period show losses (para.
5.5) and the current ratio was inadequate throughout the period. The debt-
equity ratio was extremely low, which reflected INVI's poor
creditworthiness and high government subsidies.
5.2      The project produced no income.  No part of the Project was
completed and nothing was sold in four years. INVI spent 15.32 of
projected construction costs estimated at US$41.7 million.
5.3      A sutmary of project costs from Inception, October 1982, through
June 30, 1987, as reported by the external independent auditors, is shown
as Annex 2. As mentioned In paragraph 5.4 below, INVI records may be



- 11 -
unreliable to determine actual amounts spent. For instance, the local
currency records were adjusted in 1985 to reflect the effect of the
devaluation of the peso in January 1985. Historical local currency
disbursements are not readily available.
5.4      The quality of records and reports to the Bank was consistently
poor. The external auditors required generally over six months to issue
the audited statements, wbich contained many qualifications. INVI never
*         really produced a satisfactory 5-year plan as required under the project
agreement. Separate accounting records for the Sites and Services project
never agreed with the INVI general accounting records. The discussion of
-         costs in the following paragraphs relies exclusively on the annual audited
project accounts as reported to the Bank.
5.5      Contrary to appraisal projections, INVI continued to lose money
from 1980 to 1987. Net income never met appraisal objectives, as shown in
the table belowt

5.6      The major causes of these losses weres persistent losses on sales
of finished houses, a low-interest mortgage portfolio, no income from the
Bank-financed project and a write-down of accounts receivable of houses
occupied with no sales agreements. A table of sales and cost of sales of
homes from 1982 to 1986 is shown below:

VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERPORMANCE AND DEVELOPHENT
6.1     lil
6.1.1   INVI was formed as an autonomous body In 1962 to formulate a
national housing policy, to implement part of this policy to encourage
private participation in housing programs, and to provide technical advice
and promote self-help housing programs. At appraisal the Bank saw in INV5
an institution with the potential, unrealized since its formation, to
assume an effective role in low-cost housing policy formation and
construction. Although the charter granted INVr broad responsibilities,
its activities in fact had been limited to small-scale programs and
administration (collections and repairs) of other government-sponsored
housing projects. Houses were sold below cost on concessionary terms to
middle-class beneficiaries. In seventeen years INVI was unable to generate
sufficient cash flow to build within its own funds and was completely
dependent on government grants. The hurricane reconstruction program
during 1980 and 1981 could have been an important turning point for INV5
and the project. The Bank preparation mission (April, June 1980), pre-
appraisal mission (December 1980) and appraisal mission (May 1981)
consistently detected noteworthy improvements that contrasted sharply with
lnVI's performance from 1962 to 1979. Some of these key improvements weres
(1) Evidence of increasing execution ability. INVI was chosen as the
key executing agency for channelling hurricane reconstruction
aid.  The appraisal mission recognized an impressive performance
in noting that INVI helped over 30,000 families and built over
1,922 houses during 1980, an unprecedented level of activity
compared with the pre-hurricane 17-year average of 500 houses a
year.



- 13 -
(2)   Policy reorientation toward the urban poor.  The new director
oriented the hurricane aid toward the disadvantaged people and
accepted the Bank's offer in February 1980 to finance the studies
and evaluation of the first systematic housing program for
beneficiaries at or below the poverty level.
(3)   Awareness of need for institutional strengthening.  The new
director actively searched for and obtained international aid to
help INVI prepare for its new role. In 1980 the UN sent the
Habitat urban planner to advise on general institutional
development and the German Technical Assistance Agency (GTZ)
signed a technical assistance agreement in 1981.
6.1.2     At negotiations in February 1982, INVI had demonstrated during
the prior 2 112 years a willingness and ability to overturn seventeen years
of lethargy and begin a conversion to a national housing agency for the
urban poor. The Bank was an enthusiastic partner and catalyst in an
innovative pilot program.
6.1.3     The vision the Bank and the INVI airector shared from 1979 to
August 1982 never survived the change in national and INVI administrations
in August 1982. After that, INVI's housing programs were guided in
directions incompatible with the sites and services concept of access to
the lowest strata of the population at a reasonable cost recovery.
aunagement and team formation degraded with massive personnel changes.
Regarding the Division of Sites and Services, the concept of a separate
division with a clearly defined responsibility to build and sell was never
successfully Implemented. The first division manager, the result of a
careful search whose curriculum was approved by the Bank, was replaced
without Bank participation on two occasions with less experienced staff.2
The initial marketing activities of the Sites and Services division
encountered difficulties with the INVI Social Services division, which
attempted to exercise its traditional XNVI role of processing and selecting
beneficiaries. This apparent divisional rivalry resolved itself only when
it became clear that there would be nothing to sell.
6.1.4     As of March 1988, INVI was practically building nothing. INVI's
chief activity is now the collection of a troubled mortgage portfolio of
less than 7,000 accounts, producing a cash flow that scarcely provides for
current expenses and leaves insufficient funds for construction
initiatives. GTZ uses some INVI personnel for the projects it finances in
marginal urban areas. The lNVI organization is demoralized with no
mission, while plenty of funds are available elsewhere for housing
construction (e.g. through the President's Coordinating Office).
6.2       Government
6.2.1     Throughout Project implementation, the Government performed, for
the most part, unsatisfactorily. The new government which took office in
August 1982 gave the least priority to the Project, and consequently did
not provide the counterpart funds for it. The present administration,
which took office in August 1986, decided that the funds for housing would
be channelled through the President's Coordinating Office, which it set up
for the purpose. This office, among an impressive list of projects costing
21 The Loan Agreement did not include a covenant to cover this risk.

a minimum of US$5.0 million a month,   has begun building on the Sabana
Perdida land and is attempting to finish the ill-fated Invivienda projects
begun in 1982 and suspended in 1983.   There is no organized institutional
government housing program with a plan for adequate cost recovery and
orientation toward the urban poor.
6.2.2     The prospects for renewing a low-cost housing dialogue must await
future events and a possible change in administration in 1990. Large state
subsidies implicit in construction of complete houses for beneficiaries who
can afford to pay for them continue as they always have.
6.3       The Bank
6.3.1     The Bank's performance also could be regarded as unsatisfactory,
because it did not allow sufficient time for cupervisLon of the project,
and because even though it was clear since the time tte loan became
effective that the Government did not want to implemen- the Project, it did
not press the Government enough to fulfill its commitments or cancel the
loan once no adequate response from the Government was obtained. The loan
was not cancelled until four years after the date tJ effectiveness.
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1       Given the sensitive nature of land  acquisition and squatter
relocation to the Project, proof of clear title to the land and a Bank-
approved plan for squatter relocation should have been a condition for loan
effectiveness.
7.2       The  project agreement in Section 2.11  obligated INVI to consult
with the Bank on significant project events. Given the expectation that
the Bank-financed project would become INVI's most important activity, the
agreement should have included a capital expenditure limitation covenant.
7.3       There were no warnings that a new government assuming power in
August 1982 would rapidly lose interest in supporting a commitment of its
predecessor. The transition period from the elections in May 1982 to-
inauguration in August may have been an opportunity to brief the incoming
government on Bank commitments incurred on the Sites and Services and other
lank projects. Promptly after it became evident that INVI and the
Government were not fulfilling the covenants of the Loan and Project
Agreements, the Bank should have set a deadline to obtain concrete actions
to solve the problems. There is a possibility that INVI and the Government
might have responded more favorably to this remedial action. If no
positive reaction were achieved, the Bank should have cancelled the loan.
7.4       The balance of the special account of US$ 826,953.04 has not been
refunded to the Baztk as of May 1989. The main reason is that the account
was established anti operated in local currency, multiple devaluations
occurred and the Government currently is experiencing a shortage of foreign
exchange. The lank is pressing the Government to solve this problem in the
context of another Bank operation in the country. It is recommended that
for future operations, the Bank should examine very carefully the
establishment of special accounts in the Dominican Republic and monitor
systematically their operation.

financed out of such proceeds (para. 5.4).
8) Section 2.11 required INVI i) to review with the Borrower and
the Bank,before March 30 of each year, the progress achieved in the
carrying out of the Project in the precedent year; ii) furnish to the Bank
for approval, before September 30 of each year, its proposed Project
execution schedule for the following year, and iii) inform the Bank
promptly of any condition which interferes or threatens to interfere with
the progress of the Project.
9) Section 2.12 required INVI to enter into contractual
arrangements with Corporacion Dominicana de glectricidad (CDE) and with the
Instituto Nacional de Agua potable y Alcantarillado (INAPA) for carrying
out the electrical and water supply works of the Project, respectively
10) Section 3.03 required INVI not to make loans to residents of
housing projects in cities with more that 30000 inhabitants on terms and
conditions that are more favorable than those for the beneficiaries under

COMMENTS FROM THE BORROWER
1.    Attachments 1 and 2 include the English translation and the Spanish
version, respectively, of the comments received from the Technical Secretariat
of the Presidency of the Dominican Republic regarding the PCR for the Sites and
Services Project. These comments do not require changes in such report. A brief
comment on each of the paragraphs of the Borrower's remarks on the report
(Attachments 1 and 2, page 1) is shown belows
Paras. 1 and 2:   The records of the special ac:count are still being
revised by the Central Bank in order to reconcile its
balance with the Bank's. No scheme has been established
yet to solve the problem of the unused balance of the
special account. There is no change on what it is
mentioned in the report regarding this account.
Paras. 3 and 4:   Based on partial  disbursements  data,  the  Borrowet
concluded that the Government counterpart funds to the
Project exceeded the external financing. However, Bank's
documentation and correspondence indicate that the funds
provided by the Government and INVI's own resources were
inadequate. On the other hand, the loan proceeds were
always available during all the time the loan remained
effective, large part of which (US$21.4 million), INVI
did not utilize and was cancelled.
Para. 5:          There is agreement of the fact that the land sites were
considered by INVI and the Bank as the best locations
for the Project at the time of appraisal.
Para. 6s          The Borrower claimed that it was the soil, not the land
acquisition which posed the main problem for the
execution the Project. However, the Bank's records
indicate that the site for Haina was never acquired and
the construction never started. No soil problem was
detected there. However, there was a minor soil problem
in the construction of the sewerage system in Sabana
Perdida, which could have been solved timely if
counterpart funds for the Project had been available.l
Para. 7:          The counterpart funds includes the costs of the land
acquired for the Project as of June 1987, according with
INVI's accounting record.
Paras. 8 to 10:   The  housing  projects  that  the  Government  Works
Coordination and Supervision Office (Oficina Coordinadora
y Fiscalizadora de Obras del Estado) has been building
since 1987 in Sabana Perdida, are not part of the

Project, and does not follow the concept of sites and
services. At the time of the PCR's mission to Santo
Domingo (March 1988), INVI had 250 homes under
construction, which it planned to complete according with
funds availability. 1
1 A letter was sent to the Borrower explaining this point.

REMARKS ON THE sITES AND SERVICES PROJECT REPORT
(LOAN 2104-DO)
MAIN POINTS
1.        Approval for disbursements:  In accordance with the various
investment categories, the Technical Setretariat of t4e Office of the
President approved 16 payments from Banco Central Special Account No.
2262-00-00-00-00-04 (from Nos. 1 through 19, excluding Nos. 16, 17 and 18).
These totaled US$1,799,633.44 (see Annex I), this being equivalent to
RD$3,281,841.45. Because Barco Central has not completed the reconciliation
process, we have not yet received a statement for this Account.
2.        In March 1989, the World Bank informed the Governor of Banco Central
that it was willing to accept his suggestion that funds in the Special Account
totaling US$826,953.04 be transferred to the Third Road Construction Project
(Loan 2609-DO) as soon as the payment instructions to be submitted by that
agency had been signed, since this would provide a means of solving the
problems affecting the balance in that account (see Annex 2). To date, these
have not been signed.
3.        Disbursements for the Sites and Services Project total
US$5,677,543.76, excluding direct payments (details not available), with
US$1.8 million (31.72) in external financing and US$3.9 million (68.3S) in
counterpart funds. Data from the National Budget Bureau show that, since the
Project was launched, government counterpart disbursements to INVI have
exceeded external financing (see Annex 3).
4.        Project Department reports show this also to be true of previous
years. For example, in 1984 the counterpart funds allocation was
RD$2.4 million, but in fact execution totaled RD$2.6 million, thus exceeding
the target.
5.        The INVI legal consultant's report (No. 384, November 1981) refers
to the legal aspects of land acquisition. These were selected after both the
World Bank and INVI had carried out the necessary studies for adopting the
optimum means of choosing the best locations with respect to production
centers, access to main highways, and health.
6.        At INVI's request, the Government issued Decree Nos. 2607 and 2608
of July 23, 1981, declaring sites in Districts Nos. 8, 10 and 17 to be of
public utility. At the time of the report, their status was as followss
(a) Sabana Perdida: Most of the sites in this area belonged to IAD (the
Dominican Agricultural Institute), and only lots Nos. 166 and 42
belonged to individuals. Nevertheless, INVI bad acquired almost all
this land through a grant from the Dominican State or through
purchases from individuals. The area was 102.5 ha, and the cost so
far was RD$258,243.02.
(b) Raina: All the land in this area belonged to individuals, and
therefore INVI would have to purchase 59 ha for about
RD$586,350.00. By that time, INVI had acquired land at a total cost
of RD$8,898.00. This had been expropriated by the Government for
the construction of public housing.  liis component was not
executed, mainly because of problems posed by the terrain.

Page 2 of 5
7.        It should be noted that, as stipulated in the Loan Agreement, the
counterpart funds included the total cost of land.
8.        Currently, the Dominican Government is using domestic resources to
implement (since 1987) the "Sites and Services: Sabana Perdida" Project
through the Government Works Coordination and Supervision Bureau. This
Project comprises the construction of 1,556 housing units, streets, sidewalks
and curbs, together with drinking water and electric power supply.
9.        The total cost of the Project is RD$59,431,071.22 (US$9.4 million).
It is divided into two stages, with RD$28.2 million for the first and
RD$31.2 million for the second.
10.       The Dominican Government has disbursed a total of RD$26.2 million
for the above Project.
