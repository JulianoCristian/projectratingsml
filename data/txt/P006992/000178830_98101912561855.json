project is to develop\n            the sites of Sabana Perdida in Santa Domingo and Haina in\n            the nearby San Cristobal Province as integrated communities\n            to accommodate about 8000 low-income families. The project\n            consists of: (i) offsite infrastructure, including wells,\n            water mains, storage tanks, stabilization ponds, electric\n            power substation and transmission line; (ii) onsite\n            infrastructure, including water, sewerage and electricity\n            networks, public lighting, roads and drainage; (iii)\n            construction of shelter units; (iv) provision of loans to\n            beneficiaries; (v) community facilities, including schools,\n            health centers, social centers, fire and police stations,\n            sports grounds, green areas and trash collection services;\n            (vi) consulting and extension services. The project would\n            include a study of future low-income housing policy and\n            measures to strengthen INVI's finances. A US$500,000\n            Bank advance made under the Project Preparation Facility\n            would be refinanced under the proposed loan."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
