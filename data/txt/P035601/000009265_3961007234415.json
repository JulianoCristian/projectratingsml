"The Population and AIDS Control Project\n            will assist the Government in implementing its long-term\n            strategy in population and family planning (FP) and its\n            medium term plan 1995-1999 for AIDS control. Its overall\n            objectives are to advance the onset of fertility decline by\n            increasing the use of modern methods of contraception, and\n            slow the spread of HIV infection by promoting behavioral\n            change. To attain these objectives, the project will support\n            policies and investments designed to: 1) reinforce the\n            national capacity to implement the national population\n            policy by a) strengthening the national capacity for\n            undertaking population-related activities; b) implementing a\n            community awareness program and dissemination of the\n            population policy; and c) supporting population-related\n            research; 2) strengthening the national capacity to contain\n            the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs by: a) institutional\n            strengthening of the Ministry of Public Health; and b)\n            supporting epidemiological, operational, and socio-economic\n            research; 3) putting in place a social marketing program for\n            the promotion of condoms; and 4) promoting the participation\n            of the private sector and NGOs in population, FP, and\n            HIV/AIDS/STD programs by setting up a social fund."}, "docdt": "1995-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
