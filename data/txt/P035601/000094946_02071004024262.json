"The outcome of the Population & AIDS\n            Control Project is rated as satisfactory, sustainability as\n            likely, institutional development impact as modest, Bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. Several of the lessons learned from this\n            project concern the lack of leadership commitment towards\n            key basic objectives of the project, the need to clarify\n            institutional arrangements during project design, and the\n            importance of baseline data for proper project design and\n            monitoring. There is a great need in Francophone sub-Saharan\n            Africa for enhanced policy dialogue in population and\n            reproductive health. And the policy dialogue needs to be\n            focused. Task teams need to better recognize that results in\n            the area of population, reproductive health, and\n            HIV/AIDS/STDs take time to materialize in the SSA context\n            because they involve tackling sensitive issues in\n            traditional cultures. Monitoring and evaluation systems and\n            baseline data are a priority, particularly in population and\n            HIV/AIDS/STDs projects. The project demonstrated that even\n            in highly traditional and religious cultures, it is possible\n            to bring about social change through the use of good\n            information, education, and communication messages and\n            social marketing techniques, and to get the population to\n            learn fairly rapidly about HIV/AIDS/STDs."}, "docdt": "2002-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
