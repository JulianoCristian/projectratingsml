The project was\n            managed and implemented efficiently overall; and the credit\n            was fully disbursed.  Implementation, however, was\n            constrained by the lack of Government counterpart financing\n            and weak capacity of public sector implementing agencies.\n            Lessons learned include the following: The Bank can be\n            instrumental in stimulating government commitment but that\n            support is insufficient to consolidate and sustain the\n            commitment.  The relevance of the objective and the degree\n            of civil society mobilization are critical to Government\n            commitment.  Stimulation and nurturing of broad-based\n            national commitment requires continuous and multiple\n            efforts.  The health sector's role is pivotal in the\n            achievement of HIV/AIDS and population objectives.  The\n            absence of baseline data undermines opportunities to track\n            and fine-tune the performance and impact of efforts.\n            Intensive information campaigns followed by the recruitment\n            of intermediary NGOs proved effective in engaging civil\n            society activities."}, "docdt": "2005-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
