To attain these objectives, the project will support\n            policies and investments designed to: 1) reinforce the\n            national capacity to implement the national population\n            policy by a) strengthening the national capacity for\n            undertaking population-related activities; b) implementing a\n            community awareness program and dissemination of the\n            population policy; and c) supporting population-related\n            research; 2) strengthening the national capacity to contain\n            the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs by: a) institutional\n            strengthening of the Ministry of Public Health; and b)\n            supporting epidemiological, operational, and socio-economic\n            research; 3) putting in place a social marketing program for\n            the promotion of condoms; and 4) promoting the participation\n            of the private sector and NGOs in population, FP, and\n            HIV/AIDS/STD programs by setting up a social fund."}, "docdt": "1995-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
