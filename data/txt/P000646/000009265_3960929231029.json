the Crop\n            Diversification and Agricultural Services Project will be to\n            assist the government to alleviate rural poverty, improve\n            family nutrition and food security, and raise foreign\n            exchange earnings by import substitution and by promoting\n            the export of traditional and non-traditional crops,\n            including food crops.  The project aims at increasing rural\n            incomes and foreign exchange earnings by import substitution\n            and promoting private sector export marketing over a\n            five-year period.  The project will accomplish this through\n            a combination of policy reforms and investment to: alleviate\n            malnutrition of the rural population by raising production,\n            strengthening agricultural research and extension services,\n            and supporting the organization of farmers and traders,\n            including women.  The policy reforms will cover: (a)\n            improving price incentives through reforms of cocoa pricing\n            and the taxation system; (b) restructuring marketing and\n            input supply systems of the traditional export sub-sector;\n            (c) preparing and implementing programs aimed at removing\n            technical constraints on higher cocoa output, including\n            uncertainties over land tenure; and (d) promoting food crop\n            production and non-traditional exports.  Project investments\n            will comprise marketing, agricultural extension and applied\n            research and institutional development."}, "docdt": "1990-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
