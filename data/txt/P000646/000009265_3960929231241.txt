MEMORANDUIM AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINLA
FOR A CROP DIVERSIFICATION AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea .or SDR 4.7 million
(US$6.3 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. Par I of the document
discusses Equatorial Guinea's development problems and prospects, the key
priorities of the economic reform program at the macroeconomic and sector
levels, and the Bank Group's assistance strategy. It draws upon the Policy
Framework Paper covering the period 1988 to 1991, which was approved by the
Committee of the Whole in December 1988.  Part II of tEe document describes
the proposed Credit.
T.    Countrv Policies and Bank GrouP  isistance StrateRy
Background
1.01       Equatorial Guinea is a small open economy consisting of a
continental area, Rio Muní, on the west coast of Africa, and an island group,
Bioko and four smaller islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Thc capital, Malabo, !,3
located on Bioko island and the other major city, Bata, is on the mainland.
The population in 1988 vas estimated at 350,000 inhabitants and the land area
i8 28.000 kri2. With a GNP per capita of US$390 in 1989, it u8 classified
among the least developed nations of Sub-Saharan Africa. The islands and Rio
Muni have different economic bases. Bioko is the more developed and
urbanized, and the dominant economic activity is cocoa production. In Rio
Muni live approximately 80 percent of the population and the main economic
activity is food crops, followed by timber extraction, coffee, and some cocoa
production.
1.02       Equatorial Guinea's economy is based on agriculture, which,
including fishing and forestry, provides a living for some 80 percent of the
population and in 1989 accounted for 58.5 per cent of GDP and 95 percent of
total exports. Subsistence agriculture predominates, but cocoa, timber and
coffee provide foreign exchange and governrent revenues. Limited
manufacturing exists in the form of wood and cocoa processing, food
processing, brick factories and some simple consumetr goods, accounting for 1.7
percent of GDP. Construction and public utilities represent 9 percent of GDP;
and services accounted for 26 percent of GDP in 1989. The country's main
exports are wood and cocoa which in 1989 accounted for 58.4 percent and 35
percent of export of goods respectively. Equatorial Guinea is endowed with
fishery resources and viable hydrocarbon deposits. However, the Equatorial
Guinean economy presents particularly difficult development challenges:
deteriorated productive capacity and related infrastructure; acute shortage of
suitably trained personnel which hampera public resource management; acute
dependence on two commodities, i.e. cocoa and timber; weak banking system; an
overwhelming debt burden and lack of private foreign and domestic
entrepreneurship.



1.03        Equatorial Guinea has faced serious economic and financial
problems since its independence from Spain in 1968, many of which can be
attributed to the destructive rule of the Macias Nguema regime (1968-1979).
During this period, foreign investment stopped, the state-operated trading
systema broke down and the economy retreated into subsistence agriculture.
When the present Government took offIce in 1979, it vas confronted vith an
economy on the verge of bankruptcy; exports had fallen to a third of their
1967 levels, while foodstuffs, which had traditionally been exported vere
imported to cover the deficit resulting from the breakdown of the marketing
system. With regard to human resources, education and health indicators were
among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa; sanitary conditions vere very poor and
the incidence of diseases and related mortality and morbidity rates were high.
Infrastructure was in total disrepair, financ.al controls vere practically
non-existent, and there was an extreme scarcity of skilled manpower.
Recent Economic Developmentq
1.04       An economic reconstruction program was initiated in 1980, with
Fund support, but vas not sustained. As a result inflationary pressures
accelerated, balance of payments problems rose, and external debt, which had
been nil in 1980, rose to 153 percent of GDP in 1985.  In 1985, efforts to
reconstruct the economy were renewed. A key step in this effort was
Equatorial Guinea's entry into the Bank of Central African States (BEAC). The
domestic currency vas replaced by the CFA franc at a rate that implied a
devaluation of 82 percent. The program also emphasized improvements in fiscal
and external debt management, increases in producer prices to st. dlate
production and exports and efforts to restructure the financial system. The
program was supported by a stand-by arrangement from the Fund, a
Rehabilitation Import Credit (RIC) from IDA, and debt relief from the Paris
Club. While the policy measures under this program represented important
steps in eliminating distortions in the economy, output did not recover as
expected, fiscal and external financial imbalances did not improve, leading to
the accumulation of internal and external payment arrears. In addition, due
to inappropriate and highly expansionist credit policy, acute liquidity
problems emerged in the domestic financial system.
1.05        In late 1987 and early 1988, the Government renewed its efforts to
improve economic manag.iment. To address the crisis in the banking sector, it
began the liquidation process of the two banks in severe financial
difficulties, improvements in tax administrati , were introduced to strengthen
revenues, and controls over budgetary outlays and credit policy were
tightened.
1.06        In mid-1988, the Governnent presented its renewed policy effort in
a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for the period 1989-1991; this effort was
supported by the Fund through a first year SAP program. Its key objectives
were to achieve a real average GDP growth over the program period of 3.5
percent a year, while concurrently sustaining and strengthening the
improvement in the implementation of financial policy so as to reduce domestic
and external imbalances, and lowering the rate of inflation to an annual
average of 4 percent over the program period. The basic elements of the
Government's strategy were: agricultural led growth based on comparative
advantage and a progressive opening of the economy to market forces;



- 3 -
strengthening public sector resource management and stimulation of private
sector initiatives; and mobilization of external assistance on concessional
teras to support the program.
1.07        The improvementa in economíc performance of 1987 and early 1988
proved to be only temporary. With regard to export performance, cocoa
production and exports in 1988/89 declined because of excessive and untimely
rainfall and declining world prices; timber exports declined due to excessive
taxes, high production costa and inadequate maintenance of the sector,s
capital stock as vell as difficulties in bank financing and transport
services. On the budget front, in late 1988 there was a large unplanned
increase in expenditures and, in 1989, while expenditures were brought under
control, revenues declined sharply and the overall budgetary deficit increased
to 5.6 percent of GDP compared to a deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP in 1987.
With regard to other policy areas, little progress was achieved in liquidating
the two bankrupt banks, Guinextebank and the Banco de Credito y Desarrollo
(BCD), and policy reversals have taken place in the area of investment
programing as the Government sought to implement projects whose economic and
social rates of return are estimated to be marginal.
1.08        The deterioration in public finances in 1988-1989, the
disagreements with the GovernmerLt on the public investment program (PIP) and
the delays in liquidating the bankrupt banks have derailed the medium-term
program outlined in the PFP. IDA staff, in close coordination with the IMF,
have resumed dialogue with the Governaent in order to bring the programi back
on track. However, significant improvements in budgetary management and vide-
ranging structural reforms would need to be realized if a sound financial
framework is to be assured and self-sustained growth resumed.
rhe Outlook for 1990-1991
1.09        Economic prospects for 1990 are more favorable than those of 1989,
and real growth may approxinate population growth (2.6 percent) compared to 1
percent GDP growth in 1989. The 1990 budgetary performance is also expected
to improve over that of 1989. This progress on the budgetary front can be
attributed to a large extent to the one-time payments from non-budgeted
resources as vell as the Government's decision to delay the application of the
*           salary increase that had been approved in the bud&et, although there vas also
some progreas in revenue collection. It is expected that this budget
performance vill be sustainable in 1991 and beyond due to the revenues
*           accruing from oil exporte w'hich are expected to start rolling in in mid-1991,
and provided that Government continues to exercise control on expenditures and
continues to improve revenue collection.
1.10        The recently signed exploitation contract vith the private foreign
firm of the Alba Hydrocarbon field has significantly improved Equatorial
Guinea's medium-term prospects. It is expected that by mid-1991, the field
could export some 4000 barrels per day of condensate and Equatorial Guinea
could become a net oil exporter. Provisional revenue forecasts indicate that
revenues accruing to the Government from oil exploitation would amount to
US$1.6 millior, in 1991 and could reach progressively US$7.0 million by 1995,
and oil exports could amount to some US$33.0 million in 1991, increasing to



US$44 million p.a. from 1992 onwards, 1 more than doubling Equatorial
Guinea's total exporto. Thus, both budgetary and BOP resulcs should show a
progressive improvement over the coming years.
1.11        Notwithstanding t:.ese prospects, the underlying issues causing
weak export performance continue unresolved and export prospects for 1990-91
remain dim. In addition, the external debt situation will remain very
difficult to manage, unlese part of the debt is rescheduled. The outstanding
public debt for 1990, including the IMf, is estimated at US$197.5 million or
117 percent of GDP, and the debt service ratio is estimated at 9.1 percent of
GDP.
Central Development Issues
1.12        Despite Equatorial Guinea's relatively rich natural resource base
that coult support in the medium-term enhanced growth and developiáent
prospects, the country faces several development constraints. These include a
weak balance of payments that is highly dependent on depressed exports of
cocoa and timber; domestic resource mobilization that is hampered by the
weaknesses of the tax administration; budgetary expenditures dominated by debt
s.ervice payments; an extremely weak human capital base; a poor and risky
investment climate; and a weak administrative capacity. These constraints
need to be overcomed through improved macroeconomic policies.
1.13        The 60 percent drop in cocri export prices in local currency terms
from 1985 to 1989, combined Y! a a declining production, has severely
undermined Equatorial Guinew   balance of paymente and deprived the budget of
crucial resources. Although      rapid growth of timber exports from 1983 to
1987 has partially compensatea for the disappointing resulte of the cocoa
sector, budgetary revenues aj a percentage of GDP declined from 20 percent in
1985 to 13 percent in 1989. Furthermore, the deep decline of international
cocoa prices has led to sharp cuts in the official producer prices. Hence,
production and techniques need to be improved in order to reduce costs and
increase average yields while alternative export opportunities need to be
identified and actively promoted. One of the objectives of the proposed
project is to ralse foreigu exchange earnings by promoting the export of
traditional and non-traditional crops, including food crops.
1.14       With regard to timber, production and exports have stagnated since
1988. While transportation deficiencies and the crisis in the banking system
have negatively affected the sector, the technical and financial weaknesses of
the private sector firms operating in the sector, the inappropriate tax and
concession system are also key factors explaining this weak performance. TLe
Goverrment needs to perform an in-depth financial and technical audit of the
private firms of the sector and implement a wide-ranging reform of the tax and
concession systems. Although current production levels of 180,000 m3 p.a. are
estimated to be well within estimated maxilmum sustainable production levels,
the Government should finalíze the forestry inventory and ite reforestation
policy before new concessions are granted, so as to ensure the sustainable

exploitation snd managem'nt of this renewable resource.
1.15        While part of the decline in resources is explained by the
performance of cocoa and timber, other sources of revenues, such as import
duties and other indirect and direct taxes, have been declining as a
percentage of GDP. In addition, weaknesses in tax administration have led to
arbitrary methods of revenue collection. Hence, in order to generate fiscal
revenues that grow at least at the same rate as domestic production, a major
effort will need to be made to improve administration. This will include a
simplification of the tax system and restoration of the tax administration
apparatus within the UDEAC rules. In order to ímplement such a reform, the
Government requires substat ~. technical assistance.
1.16        The Government's _&penditure policy is severely constrained by the
overwhelming debt service burden. Debt service payments due in 1991 represent
86 percent of government revenues, and are prLjected to be 70 percent of total
revenues during the period 1991-95. In addition to improved fiscal
discipline, concessional debt relief would be required; depending on the
magnitude and terma of this relief, recourse to further additional resources
from bilateral and multilate-al donors would be needed in order to reduce
considerably the debt service burden and reallocate resources to crucial
sectors such as road transport, health, education aud basic infrastructure.
1.17        The private sector is extremely weak in Equatorial Guinea, and its
development is constrained by a wide array of factors. Property rights ar-
tucertain, the banking sector is weak, key infrastructure needs to be
improved, and the regulatory and incentive frameworks are unnecessarily
cumbersome and distorted. With regard to the banking system, the Government
should accelerate the liquidation process of the two bankrupt banks in order
to create a more appropriate setting for the creation of a new private
commercial bank. Property rights should be clarified by an updating of the
property registries and a review of the legal framework. Ports,
telecommunications and other key infrastructure should be improved and
properly maintained with the assistance of foreign donors and private firmas.
The current policy of assuring management and maintenance of these key
services by private parties whenever appropriate should be expanded. Finally,
regardirng the regulatory and incentive frameworks, the Government should carry
out a review of these policies with the dual objectives of simplification and
liberalization.
1.18        Equatorial Guinea has one of the weakest human capital bases in
Africa, leading to inefficient management of available resources and a ueak
administrative capacity. The Government intends to reform its civil service
so as to increase its efficiency and its capacity to formula e and implement
economic policy. Also, new strategies are being prepared for the health and
education sectors. Equatorial Guinea's poor health indicators are the result
of a combination of deficiencies and constraints. Underlying these
deficiencies in the health system are an inappropriate strategy and deficient
management. Consequently, IDA and tbh Government have agreed on a health
sector strategy which emphasizes the btrengthening of sector management
planning and budgeting, providing operational support to alleviate the
constraints on delivery of basic health care services, and concentrating
resources on preventive and primary health care. Vith respect to education,



the strategy is to continue to support the development of primary education
and the expansien of primary schools.  The Governrent vould increase the
e .ants spent on education, which are currently meager. and strengthen sector
management.
Bank Group Strategy
The Composition of Past Lendine
1.19        Before the present Government came to power in 1979, the Bank
Group had made only one credit of US$2.0 million to Equatorial Guinea, for
highway maintenance, which was cancelled in 1976 at the Government's request.
Since 1982, five IDA credits totalling US$28.8 million equivalent and one
Special Africa Facility Credit of US$4.0 million equivalent have been
approved. Two of the credits vere for technical assistance, one for
agriculture, one for Education and a Rehabilitation Import Credit. Policy
discussions have been fruitful in the context of the preparation and
implementation of agricultural and technical assistance projects and the
fast-disbursing Rehabilitation Import Credit (RIC).  The RIC was approved in
1986 but became effective in 1987, due to slow progreso by the Governnent in
preparing a program with respect to the management of public finances and
external debt acceptable to IDA. The project was designed to support the
Governnent's reform program and prov'4e assistance for the rehabilitation of
the agricultural and selected infrastructure sectors.  The second tranche of
the RIC was released in July 1988. The current portfolio consists of three
IDA credits.

procurement and project administration, and lack of counterpart funds. An
IDA-financed expert, responsible for the administrative coordination of all
IDA-financed projeets in the country, has been assisting the Governrent to
mitigate these problems through training of local project staff in auditing
and accounting, and by putting in place procedures to ensure smooth project
execution.
Country Lending StrateRy and Priorities
1.21        The Bank's priority in Equatorial Guinea is to promote equitable
and sustainable income growth. The policy advice and dialogue focus on (i)
promoting sound economic policies, particularly budgetary management, public
investment programring (PIP), improving the efficiency of the financial
sector, agricultural pricing, debt management, and revriewing the incentive
structure so as to promote private sector supply response and investment: and
(ii) development of Equatorial Guinea's long-term development potential,
particularly human resources, health, agriculture, and environment. The main
instruments for implementing this strategy are policy dialogue, lending, and
aid coordination.
1.22        There are key constraints to achieving these objectives stemming
primarily from issues related to macroeconomic management. Equatorial
Guinea's poor performance in addressing these issues has severely affected the
country's external credibility. The poor quality of the policy dialogue with
IDA has reflected the weak commitment at the highest level to translate the
dialogue into meaningful reforms.  Furthermore, the failure of the dialogue
has reflected the weak institutional capacity available in the country to
implement reform measures.  The Government needs to take decisive up-front
steps to improve economic management aud convince donors that it can
effectively use external resources.
1.23        The most urgent issues which the Governrment neede to address are:
(i) im,covement of budgetary results, focusing on continued expenditure
control and improved resource mobilization (improved tax collection and
adr.nistration); (":1 substantial progress in the liquidation of the two banks
(completion of con--ict negotiations with the selected consulting firm and
setting up of the l quidation unit); (iii) preparation of a PIP that addresses
*        Equatorial Guinea'  development constraints and resolution of outstanding
issues regarding some specific projects --this would entail the preparation of
a realistic three-year rolling investnent program with adequate provisions for
the recurrent costs of planned investnents (a Bank mission to review the PIP
is scheduled for October 1990); (iv) preparation/implementation ot an action
prograia addressing key constraints in the cocoa and forestry sectors
(preparation of a forestry action plan and a medium-term program for the
sector); and (v) strengthening of the economic management team in order to
facilitate the preparation and implementation of a credible adjustment program
as well as the dialogue with key foreign partners.
1.24        Provided that the Governrnent makes satisfactory progress in these
areas, IDA will put in place a program to assist the Government in addressing
Equatorial Guinea's key development constraints. This assistance strategy
would consist of a base case program of institution-building projects and high
priority investment projects which address long-term development issues, and



whose benefits would continue to accrie to the population despite lukewarm
macroeconomic policy performance. The lending program FY91-94 would be
limited to one IDA credit a year, amounting to a total investment of about
US$20 million. The Crop Diversification and Agricultural Services Project
(FY91) aims at alleviating rural proverty by increasing rural incomes and
foreign exchange earnings by import substitution; crop diversification; and
promoting private sector agricultural export marketing over a five-year
period. The project would also improve the nutritional level of the rural
population, and the well-being of rural women. The Second Technícal
Assistance Project would continue to assist the Government strengthen its
capacity to prepare and carry out ita development strategy. This assistance
is warranted given the country's weak human resource base and weak
implementation capacity. The Health Project would aim at identifying the key
sectoral constraints to the delivery of minimum basic health servJces,
focusing on improving human and financial resources use and combating the most
crippling endemic diseases.  The Forestry/Enviroiment Project would promote a
rational use of natural resources and assist the Government in the management
and conservation of the country's rich forestry resources.
1.25        Preliminary discussions on a second year PFP are planned for
October during th, joint Bank/IMF mission. Provided that PFP preparation and
negotiations are successful, that the Government continues to make real
progress in macroeconomic management and that the policy dialogue continues to
improve, then IDA would reassess the likelihood of putting in place an
adjustment program to deepen the country's adjustment process.
1.26        On the other hand, if the Governnent does not take the steps
outlined in para 1.23 above, IDA will not be able to proceed with the base
case lending program described in para 1.24, and lending will be limited to
the proposed Crop Diversification and Agricultural Services Project.
Agriculture is an area where policy dialogue between IDA and the Government
has been fruitful. There exists a broad understanding on key issues such as
agricultural pricing, the important role of the private sector in production
and marketing, and the need to assist in the development of viable private
delivery of agricultural inputs such as credit. The project would build on
progress achieved under the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project, particularly with
respect to establishing a viable credit system, and improving the quality
control of cocoa beans.
Aid Coordination
1.27        Improved aid coordination is critical for Equatorial Guinea, which
receives one of the highest per capita external aid in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The Government's weak administrative capacity implies that the responsibility
for assuring that foreign aid is allocated to priority areas and avoiding
duplication of efforts will lie mainly with the donors. A Round Table
Conference was held in Geneva in November 1988, during which the Government's
program received the support of all major donors and the international donor
community made substantial pledges of continued assistance to the country over
the next years. Taking account of the need for active efforts by donors, it
was agreed that sectoral meetings would be organized to allow more specific
coordination among all the parties involved. Agriculture, human resources,
infrastructure, telecommunications and transport. technical assistance and



public administration were chosen as sectors requiring more consultattons.
UNDP agreed to coordinate overall aid efforts in general and IDA agreed to
coordinate activitíes in the agricultural sector. The sectoral follow-up of
the Donor's Conferer.ce on agriculture took place in Malabo in November 1989.
The meeting was successful not only in mobilizing needed external resources
but also in discussing key agricultural policy issues related to property
rights, agricultural pricing, food security, and sector management. The
infrastructure follow-up meeting was held in Malabo in early July 1990. Other
sectoral followj-up meetings are scheduled to take place in late 1990 and early
1991.
1.28        In view of the high level of external assistance flowing to EQG
and the large number of donors involved, improved coordination will be
essential to ensure that effective use is made of this external assistance.
This task will be considerably facilitated by the coamitment made by the UNDP
to take the responsibility of lead agency for coordination in the field.
Cooieration with the IMF
1.29        The Bank has worked closely with the IMF in the design and
-aonitoring of the PFP. In 1988, the Bank and IMF carried out joint missions
to develop with the Government the throe-year policy framework paper. The
Government recognizes that continued efforts to improve the major
macroeconomic imbalances is a prerequisite for adjustaent and that possible
Fund programo and a SAL are inter-related. In October, Bank and IMD staff
will participate in a joint economic missioni to discuss vith the authorities
the medium-te-m projections and begin to prepare a second year PFP.
. .:mmary Assessment
1.30        After a period of economic and political mismanagemen. in the
19709 which led to the disintegration of the economy, the Government of
Equatorial Guinea has been making attempts at promoting economic recovery
since 1980. From 1980 to 1984 the Government's macroeconomic policies vere
not conducive to a sustained expansion of the economy. Therefore, In 1985, a
more appropriate economic program vas launched, which emphasized redressing
fiscal imbalances, improving debt management and stimulating production and
exports.  However, except during a brief period between late 1987 and mid-
1988, policy performance was veak and budgetary management and the balance of
payments current account did not improve. In addition, there remain a number
of major structural problems which impede the achievement of sustainable
growth, and to some extent explain the weak macroeconomic performance.
1.31        The agricultural sector's considerable potential has not been
developed due to inadequate support services, weak institutions and marketing
and an inappropriate incentive structure. The recent decline in international
prices of Equatorial Guineas mnain agricultural exports has further undermined
the sector. Equatorial Guinea has one of the weakest human resource bases in
Africa and health and education indicators are among the vorst. Furthermore,
the public administration is deficient and as a result project implementation
is constrained by institutional and management bottlenecks. The deterioration
in public finance management in 1989, the policy reversals regarding the
public investment program and the delays in liquidating the bankrupt banks



- 10 -
have derailed the medium-term program outlined in the first year PFP. Given
the magnitude of existing internal and external imbalances and veak public
administration, progress is likely to be slow.
1.32        IDA will continue its dialogue with the Governrnent in order to
help in the formulation and implementation of policy reformas that are
essential to restoring self-austained growth; and to help strengthen the
Government's capacity to implement its development programs.  The level and
composition of lending over the next few years vill depend on the extent of
policy reform. Provided that the steps identified in para 1.23 are taken, IDA
will lend ona project a year in technical assistance, human resource
development (health) and forestry environment.  If no progress is made, IDA
will limit its lending to the proposed project in the agriculture sector--the
Crop Diversification and Agricultural Servi_es Project. If a PFP is
successfully negotiated and policy dialogue continues to improve, IDA vill
seek to assist the Government to deepen the process and assess the possibility
of putting in place a structural adjustment program.
II.    The Proposed Credit
2.01    The proposed credit vill be issued on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity and will help to finance a Crop Diversification and Agricultural
Serv;ces Project. The project will be cofinanced by IFAD for SDR 3.7 million
(US$5.0 million equivalent), BADEA for US$3.9 million, OPEC for US$1.5
million, and the Governnent for US$1.3 million equivalent. The principal
Implementing agency will be the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries
and Forestry (MALFF), and project beneficiaries.
2.02    Background.  The country's economy is based almost exclusively on
agriculture (including fisheries and forestry). In 1988, the sector accounted
for 58Z of GDP and employed 80Z of the labor force. Total export value was
US$31.2 million, with timber contributing 60Z (US$18.8 million), cocoa 31!
(US$9.8 million), and coffee 3! (US$0.8 million). Subsistence agriculture
predominates, based on cassava, cocoyam, plantain, banana, fruits and
vegetables.
2.03    While production of the main traditional exports has fallen
drastically since independence, exports of cocoa have stabilized recently at
around 7,500 tons. The on-going, IDA-financed Cocoa Rehabilitation Project
has been successful in reestablishing a viable credit system (for example
obtaining 98! credit recovery) and improving quality control and marketing for
the entire cocoa sub-sector. The IDA Credit is presently scheduled to close
in December 1990. Coffee remains largely neglected; much of the production is
smuggled to Gabon and Cameroon. Prior to independence, considerable amounts
of pineapples, citrus and avocados were produced mainly on the Island of
Bioko, for local consumption and export, but these crops have also been
virtually abandoned and, except for pineapple and some avocados, little
commercial advantage is taken of their remaining production.
2.04    The future growth of the country's economy will continue to depend
heavily on the agricultural sector. The potential for agriculture is good
since the country is resource-rich without population pressures. Given the
unfavourable international price forecasts for cocoa and coffee, and to some



- 11 -
extent also for tropical woods, future growth will depend on productivity and
quality improvements of traditional export crops and increased production and
export of non-traditional crops.  Under the IDA-financed Techn1, l Assistance
Project, a study was undertaken which confirmed good market po ibilities for
exports to Gabon of cocoyams, plantains, c!iili, cassava, pineapples and
citrus.
2.05    There are pervasive constraints to achieving future growth of the
sector: (a) sub-optimal production and processing techniques; (b) inadequate
technologies and disaemination of new technologies because of the weak
research and extension service; (c) inadequate incentives for producers and
exporters, including poor pricing policies and an aimost non-existent capacity
to market products; (d) inadequate land tenure; (e) poor maintenance of roads
and lack of regular and affordable maritime and air cargo; (f) weak
agricultural credit and agricultural education; and (g) lack of skilled labor.
2.06    These constraints are linked closely to the extremely low level of
economic development. This has been exacerbated by a plunge in public
revenues due to the fall in commodity prices, an overwhelming burden in
servicing public sector debt, and a liquidity crisis in he domestic banking
sector. The Government has indicated its agreement to policy reforms in a
Policy Framevork Paper (PFP) prepared jointly by the Government and the staff
of the Fund and the Bank. The PFP outlines the Government's objectives for
the medium-tern and reflects agreements rerched between the Government and IDA
and the IMF on the adjustment program. The PFP was approved by the Executive
Directors of both the Bank and the Fund in December 1988. In the absence of a
SAL, agricultural policy reforms which are important to the success of the
proposed project have been made conditions in the Development Credit Agreement
and would be implemented as part of project execution.
2.07    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project will be consistent with
the Government's development priorities and IDA's lending strategy which ais
at promoting sustainable growth through increases in production and export
earnings. Support for export crops, particularly of food crops and other
export diversification crops, would be complemented by policy measures, which
would create a better policy environment for exports. In addition, IDA la
well placed to help strengthen the extension and research services of MALFF as
part of its Africa Agricultural Service Initiative. The project vould cover
an important part of the country's agricultural development strategy and have
a significant impact on the entire sector.
2.08    Consistent with IDA's strategy for the development of the sector, the
project will use incentives such as land tenure reforms and rural credit to
increase the profitability of agricultural production by: (a) encouraging
farmers to cuitivate cocoa only in the most productive areas instead of
increasing the total area of production; (D) reducing through research the
cost of black pod treatment and aquirrel control; and (c) encouraging
intercropping to reduce costs of weeding and increase farm revenues from
additional production. The objective of these actions will be that farmers
will become sufficiently productive to profitably roduce cocoa without
subsidy. At the same time, and under the crop diversification program, the
removal of subsidies will encourage farmers growing cocoa in marginal areas to
diversify out of cocoa into other crops with good market prospects.

2.09   Prolect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project will
be to assist the Government to alleviate rural poverty, improve family
nutrition and food security, and raise foreign exchange earnings by import
substitution and by promoting the export of traditional and non-traditional
crops, including food crops. The project will also increase the agricultural
productivity of rural women and improve land use and soil conservation
practices. Expected increases in food crop production vill achieve two
complementary project objectives, namely improving farm family food
consumption and nutrition levels and increasing the availability and variety
of food crops in local markets. By establishing private marketing systems and
building research and extension capabilities, the project will address mador
institutional constraints to further agricultural development. By improving
export earnings, the project will generate the resources needed to finance
future investment aud national agricultural services.
2.10    Proiect DescrJition.  The project aims at increasing rural incomes and
foreign exchange earnings by import substitution and promoting private sector
export marketing over a five-year period. The project will accomplish this
through a combination of policy reforms and investment to: alleviate
mainutrition of the rural population by raising production, strengthening
agricultural research and extension services, and supporting the organization
of farmers and traders, including women. The policy reforms vill cover: (a)
improving price incentives through reforms of cocoa pricing and the taxation
system; (b) restructuring marketing and input supply systems of the
traditional export sub-sector; (c) preparing and implementing programs aimed
at removing technical constraints on higher cocoa output, including
uncertainties over land tenure; and (d) promoting food crop production and
non-traditional exports. Project investments will comprise three componente:
(a)   marketinr, which vill depend primarily on private
initiative, will consolidate and increase the profitability
of traditional export crops, expand markets for food crops
exports, and promote non-traditional exports to new markets;
(b)   agricultural extension and applied research will furnish
T&V-based extension services to individual and organized
farmers supported by demand-driven applied research, vith
the immediate objective of increasing the availability of
diversified food crops for domestic consumption and export.
The component will promote better linkages between extension
and research and develop mechanisms to promote a two-way
flow of information between extension, research and farmersi
and
(c)   institutional development will help sustain project
accomplishments by creating incentives for private sector
investment, building national research and extension
management and training capabilities, and ensuring that
project activities support farmers and trader organizations
and address the needs of women farmere.
2.11        Agreements Reached.  Agreements reached vith Government include:
(a) a plan for constituting the Agricultural Development Organization (OFA) as



-  13  -
an independent and self-financing entity; (b) establishment of
creditworthiness criteria for on-lending; (c) recruitment by MALFF of all
technical assistance personnel, whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment will be satisfactory to the Association; (d)
appointment in post of qualified key national management staff prior to Credit
effectiveness; (e) annual consultation on the rate of interest charged to
credit beneficiaries; and (f) annual consultation on the level of cocoa
producer prices, export taxes and on the public investment program for
agriculture.
2.12        Benefits.  Increasing agricultural exports are the country's only
short-term option for economic recovery. The project will help alleviate
rural poverty, improve nutrition and food security, and raise foreign exchange
earnings by import substitution and by increasing the production and export of
traditional and non-traditional crops. The project will also increase the
agricultural productivity of rural women which represent 55Z of the rural
population in the country and improve land use and soil conservation
practices. It will build sustainable farmer service institutions while
project-financed applied research and extension activities will contribute to
production increases. Continued quality control and marketing improvements
will ensure improved cocoa earnings. At the same time, increased exporto of
diversified crops, including food crops, vill reduce the country's historical
dependence on cocoa exports. The opening of new markets will create
incentives for private investrent by individuals and by emall farmer and
trader organizations, in which women will be heavily represented. Improved
land use and agricultural production practices will support farmer
organization and help secure women's access to land. Increased incomes and
the production of diversified food crops will improve nutrition levels in the
country. It is expected that about 7,000 rural families vill benefit directly
from marketing activities under the project. Improved technology as a result
of strengthened extension service vill benefit, in a relatively short period
the entire rural population of the country, over 35,000 rural fanmilies.
Research results in the cocoa sub-sector will, in the medium to long-term,
benefit the majority of the rural families on Bioko. In addition, the
increase in food production and the direct participation of women in extension
activities vill directly benefit women as an important labor force in cL p
production and as heads of rural households. Additional benefits vill derive
from the training of local staff and the strengthening of farmer
organizations. Quantitative benefits consisting of increased production of
food crops and cocoa give rise to an overall economic rate of return of 212.
2.13.       Risks.  Major risks will relate to: (a) ineffective extension
programa and lack of coordination of donor-financed extension and applied
research; (b) low adoption of research findings; and (c) a lack of private
sector response to production and export marketing incentives. Research and
extension service risks as well as the possible low adoption of research
findings will be rediced by introducing proven T&V extension methods, adapting
those methods carefully to country conditions, linking research and extension
planning to demonstrated market demand, supporting coordination of extension
and research activities among donor-financed projects and providing technical
assistance and training to strengthen Ministry management capabilities. Both
production and marketing will be further supported by project-financed farmer
and trader organization work. Additional incentives for private initiative



- 14 -
vill include the establishment of marketing information services, the
provision of training to farmer and trader organizations, and the
construction/rehabilitation of needed transportation infrastruct4re.
2.14.       Recommendation.  1 am satisfied that the proposed credit complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directora approve the proposed credit.
