Project for Equatorial Guinea were as\n            follows: Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            satisfactory information and monitoring systems to track\n            progress in production and implementation targets, as well\n            as adequate systems for financial reporting must be\n            developed and in place at an early stage of the project. The\n            lack of government ownership and commitment will have a\n            detrimental impact on all aspects of a project. If the\n            successful completion of project objectives depends on\n            co-financing, project appraisal must assure that this\n            co-financing is secure.
