poverty, improve\n            family nutrition and food security, and raise foreign\n            exchange earnings by import substitution and by promoting\n            the export of traditional and non-traditional crops,\n            including food crops.  The project aims at increasing rural\n            incomes and foreign exchange earnings by import substitution\n            and promoting private sector export marketing over a\n            five-year period.  The project will accomplish this through\n            a combination of policy reforms and investment to: alleviate\n            malnutrition of the rural population by raising production,\n            strengthening agricultural research and extension services,\n            and supporting the organization of farmers and traders,\n            including women.  The policy reforms will cover: (a)\n            improving price incentives through reforms of cocoa pricing\n            and the taxation system; (b) restructuring marketing and\n            input supply systems of the traditional export sub-sector;\n            (c) preparing and implementing programs aimed at removing\n            technical constraints on higher cocoa output, including\n            uncertainties over land tenure; and (d) promoting food crop\n            production and non-traditional exports.  Project investments\n            will comprise marketing, agricultural extension and applied\n            research and institutional development."}, "docdt": "1990-10-09T00:00:00Z"}
