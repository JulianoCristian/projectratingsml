MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
Subject:     Project Completion Note on Afghanistan
Third Education Project (Credit 893-AF)
Attached is the Project Completion Note on Afghanistan - Third Education Project (Credit
893-AF) prepared by the South Asia Regional Office.
The project, approved in 1979, had been effective for only a few months when all withdrawals
by the Borrower were suspended in 1980. The entire amount of the US$21 million Credit was
canceled in 1985.
The PCN documents the project objectives and describes how, at the beginning of
implementation, the Borrower requested a shift in Technical Assistance support from the Credit to
grant assistance available from UNDP and Indian Technical Assistance programs. The country
situation from 1980 on curtailed all implementation activities and the project cannot be rated.
The PCN is satisfactory.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
AFGHANISTAN
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 893-AF)
1           This is a short Project Completion Note for the Afghanistan Third
Education Project (Credit 893-AF). The Credit was approved in March, 1979 for
US$21 million, and became effective on July 17, 1979. As with other projects
in Afghanistan, withdrawals were suspended indefinitely in April 1980. On
March 25, 1985, IDA informed the Government that in view of the inability to
undertake effective project supervision, the Closing Date of December 31, 1984
would be adhered to, and that the entire amount of the Credit of US$21
million, none of which had been disbursed, was cancelled.
Proiect Description
2           The project was appraised during June-July 1978.  The principal
objective was to expand primary education on a regional basis and improve its
quality through primary teacher training and curricula reform. The project
provided for the construction, furnishing and equipping of: (i) 5 new primary
teacher training institutes (PTTIs) and extensions of 2 existing PTTIs (total
of 5520 student places); (ii) 6 new demonstration schools for the PTTIs and
refurbishing one existing school (4284 student places); and (iii) one new
academy for teacher trainers and administrators (330 trainee places). The
technical assistance (TA) for the foregoing institutions and the project
implementation unit (PIU) comprised 26 man-years of experts and 40.5 years of
fellowships. The project also included: (a) four man-years of experts for
feasibility studies to delineate training needs and required training
facilities in the areas of management and planning, public and private sector
accounting, mining and para-medical training; and (b) one year of experts for
preparation of a pre-investment design for the national agricultural extension
staff training and resource center. The total cost of the project was
estimated as US$32 million of which US$15 million was the foreign exchange
component.
Project Implementation
3           To ensure coordination between the Ministry of Education (MOE) and
the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) which were both involved in teacher
training, the Credit Agreement called for the maintenance of an Inter-
Ministerial Coordination Committee. The need for such a Committee became
unnecessary when the Government in November 1979 transferred the Construction
Unit in the MOE (CUME), that was implementing the Second Education Project
satisfactorily, was given the responsibility for project implementation.
4           The sites for all the new institutes had been selected.  At the
time of the July 1979 supervision mission (the only supervision mission), the
architectural drawings for the PTTIs were reviewed. The invitation notice for
the pre-qualification of civil works contractors was announced in the
Development Forum Business Edition issue of September 13, 1979. With the



increasingly difficult country situation, only 3 foreign contractors exhibited
interest along with a number of local contractors.
5           By September of 1979, CUME reported difficulty in the commencement
of construction of the PTTIs due to lack of local funds. The Deputy Minister
of Planning gave IDA the assurance in December of that year that funds would
be available.
6           The Credit provided some US$2.3 million for Technical Assistance.
By August 1979, the Government proposed for IDA consideration the utilization
of funds and assistance from UNDP (under existing UNDP-financed projects) and
Indian Technical Assistance (ITEC) with a view to reducing utilization of the
Credit for TA. Following discussions between IDA, UNDP and Unesco, IDA in
November 1979 agreed in principle to substitute IDA funds under Credit 893-AF
with UNDP and ITEC grant assistance with some modification in the details of
the proposal and the inclusion of a coordinator in consultation with IDA.
Tentative approval was accorded by UNDP, subject to Unesco fielding a
preparatory mission. However, by March 1980, UNDP had placed a suspension on
the recruitment of consultants and experts and had also scaled down the UNDP-
IPF allocations.
7           The Bank mission that visited Kabul in March 1980 concluded that
the effective execution of the project would be very difficult and that the
prospects of further supervision by Bank staff were poor.
Proiect Achievements and Difficulties
8            In retrospect, the project was well conceived, concentrating on
the preparation of teachers, teacher trainers and educational administrators,
with a view to improving the quality of basic education. It also sought to
lay the foundation for urgent manpower development programs by financing
feasibility studies. If there is a lesson to be learned from the early months
of project supervision, it is that when a Borrower is faced with budgetary
constraints, it is more likely to seek grants to finance TA than to use Credit
funds. This can lead to delays in implementation of TA and to management and
coordination problems (para 6 above).
9           The all pervading security situation hampered both the IDA
supervision effort and also the submission of quarterly progress reports by
CUME. It is, therefore, not possible to report on the achievement, if any, of
the project targets and goals.
