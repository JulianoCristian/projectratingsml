to expand primary education on a regional basis, and\n            improve its quality through primary teacher training and\n            curricula reform. Another objective is to strengthen the\n            planning and administrative capacities of the Ministries of\n            Education and Higher Education. The project would include:\n            (a) new primary teacher training institutes (partly in\n            replacement of existing inadequate facilities); (b) special\n            provisions to attract women trainees; (c) an academy to\n            train teacher trainers, administrators and planners; (d)\n            curricula reform to make the education system more community\n            and development-oriented; (e) demonstration schools; and (f)\n            related technical assistance. Incremental annual output from\n            the project institutions is estimated at about 1400\n            teachers, and about 275 trainers, administrators and\n            planners. In addition, the upgraded replacement facilities\n            would produce some 1200 teachers and some 25 trainers annually."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
