This single tranche\n            development policy operation (DPO) will help the Government\n            of the Union to consolidate recently-achieved gains with\n            respect to political stability and democracy. It will also\n            support the authorities' efforts to engage firmly on a\n            reform program to enhance macroeconomic stability and\n            address core economic distortions so as to provide the basis\n            for economic development, better service delivery and\n            poverty reduction. It addresses axis one, on economic\n            stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements\n            in government and fiscal operations; as well as axis three,\n            on strengthening governance and social cohesion.
