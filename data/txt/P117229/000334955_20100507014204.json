document on the Economic\n            Governance Reform Support Grant Program for the Union of the\n            Comoros over the period FY10-FY11, for an amount of SDR2\n            million (US$3 million equivalent). This single tranche\n            development policy operation (DPO) will help the Government\n            of the Union to consolidate recently-achieved gains with\n            respect to political stability and democracy. It will also\n            support the authorities' efforts to engage firmly on a\n            reform program to enhance macroeconomic stability and\n            address core economic distortions so as to provide the basis\n            for economic development, better service delivery and\n            poverty reduction. It addresses axis one, on economic\n            stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements\n            in government and fiscal operations; as well as axis three,\n            on strengthening governance and social cohesion. It is also\n            a central component of the new interim strategy note (ISN)\n            for FY10-12, and squarely aligned with its second objective\n            of strengthening state capacity and accountability. Finally\n            implementation of the reform program will also be supported\n            by a technical assistance project that is at an advanced\n            state of preparation and has been extensively discussed with\n            the authorities in conjunction with the proposed development\n            policy operation."}, "docdt": "2010-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
