                         The Comoros DPO has helped set the reform process in motion in two the two key areas of public financial and civil service management. There are signs that the Government is
                         committed to go beyond these initial efforts to consolidate and deepen the reforms already initiated and a parallel WB TA operation is supporting the process. Nonetheless,
                         translating formal reform processes into tangible outcome improvements remains on the agenda and setbacks are possible.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
