The EDP had four principal objectives: (i)\n            enhance the role of the private sector in the economy\n            thereby generating employment and nurturing the development\n            of Gambian entrepreneurs; (ii) improve the performance of\n            the largest bank, the Gambia Commercial and development Bank\n            (GCDB), and increase the participation of financial\n            intermediaries in the financing of private enterprises;\n            (iii) continue the PE reform program; and (iv) develop the\n            capacity of banks and Small and Medium-size Enterprises\n            (SME) support institutions to prepare, appraise, and\n            supervise SME projects, and provide extension services to\n            SMEs. Bank performance in project preparation and appraisal\n            was unsatisfactory. The important lessons learnt from the\n            (i)project are that projects should be well-targeted, with\n            clearly stated objectives supported by components and\n            relevant activities to achieve them, and (ii)project\n            implementation and management arrangements should be\n            carefully defined even if a project appears to be relatively\n            simple and easy to execute."}, "docdt": "1996-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
