support the Government's policy of scaling down the\n            public enterprise (PE) sector and strengthening the private\n            sector. The project has three components. The first, a\n            credit component will finance the foreign exchange and some\n            local costs of : (i) fixed assets and associated working\n            capital of investment projects promoted by small and medium\n            scale enterprises (SME); and (ii) free-standing working\n            capital for such enterprises. The second, is a human\n            resources development component which will be provided\n            through local institutions involved in training and SME\n            promotion for : (i) SMEs and female entrepreneurs on\n            technical matters and project preparation and management;\n            and (ii) participating banks in project preparation and\n            appraisal techniques. The third, is a public enterprise\n            reform component which will support the Government's PE\n            reforms through : (i) technical assistance to the National\n            Investment Board (NIB) to strengthen its role in monitoring\n            PEs and the PE divestiture program, and implementation and\n            supervision of performance contracts for the six largest\n            PEs; and (ii) improvements in accounting, management and\n            computer systems in selected PEs."}, "docdt": "1988-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
