.EMOWADUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE iNTElN&TIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMTIA
FOR AN-ENERPRISE DEVEJLOPMENT PROJECT 
.-1:i.- .  -  -The following memorandum snd recoammendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of The Gambia for SDR 7.3 million
(US$10.0 million. equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, and wo14d
help finance an enterprise development project.
2.            Background.   Since 1985, The Gambia has been implementing a
comprehensive program of economic restructuring in collaborati, 'with IDA
and the IMF.  As part of this program, the Government established - -_:
floating exchange rate regime based on an inter-bank market, abolished-
price controls, and liberalized interest,rates.  In 1986, the Government
also reduced the size of the public sector by a third, and adopted a
parastatal divestiture program. These reforms, together with the revision
of the investment code, streamlining of the company registration and code
administration process, and the absence of import or export controls, have
removed the bias against private SM4- in the policy and administrAtive
areas and significantly improved their prospects for development.
- 3.            Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) dominate all aspects of
The Gambian private economy, are engaged in all varieties of activities,
and account for about 50 percent of GDP. Formal private SMEs are m4inly
active in trade, tourism, construction and fisheries where they provide
about half the employment in these sectors. They are less well reprosented
in manufacturing, but have been gaining ground there. Informal
establishments, which account for a large part of the private SMU sector,
are generally unregistered and many of them do not even maintain a record
of their activities.  Despite these shortcomings, the informal sector is an
important generator of employment, and it -s here that women can generally
be found, especially in those activities that also allow time to care for a
family, such as fish processing, batik making, weaving, bakeries,
restaurants and distributive trades. Most small enterprises in The Gambia
are owned, managed and operated by Gambian nationals, unlike the large
enterprises. Among the medium enterprises, there is some f'*reign
ownership, especially by other West Africans in restaurants, fish
processing and retail and re-export trades. Private SMEs in The Gambia are
productive, labor intensive and less dependent on imported inputs than
large enterprises., There is ample scope for the development.of SMEs in The
Gambia. However, the sector faces constraints. First, more than the
larger, often public enterprises, private SMEs suffer from limited training
facilities, a shortage of technical and managerial skills, and limited
access to formal institutional credit. Secondly, GCDB, the country's
largest commercial bank, has been bankrupt and ineffectual for some years,
and will need to be completely restructured if it is to play an effective
role in financing productive private ventures on which success of the
economic recovery program depends. A recently completed diagnosis of GCDB
formed the basis for its restructuring program which this project will



- ~2-
support. Building on the lessons learned from previous efforts at SME
development both in The Gambia and elsewhere, this project will address
these issues constraining their development by combining improvements in
-the-policy and institutional support structures with improvements-in the
financial sector (through restructuring of GCDB), the channelling of
ginancial. resources throv.ghout the banking- system, and depeadenc. on. local.
SflR support institutions.
4.            The Government's parastatal reform program started'in 1986
has been effectiv, in starting to reduce the size of the public sector and
is now also focused on improving the performance of strategic PEs. There
is now a need to upgrade their management and operational performance
through managemen't-contractvs wh¢ch jAcorporate monitorable performance-
targets. The project will support the NIB, Government's PE oversight
agency, in its implementation of the performance contract and divestiture
exercise.
5.            Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA involvement would
supplement its policy-based lending for adjustment by supporting the   -
Goverrm-ent's efforts to encourage private initiative, stimulate economic
growt', reduce the size of the public sector, and increase employment. The
integLated package of financial resources, training and technical
assistance provided by the- project wouLd result in a smaller and improved
public sector and a healthier financial system and help the development of
SMsE, a sector which has'high employment generation potential and is a
breeding ground for developing a Gambian entrepreneurial class.
6.            Proiect Obiectives. The main objectives of the proposed
operation would be to (i) enhance the role of the private sector in the
economy thereby generating employment and nurtu!-ng the development of
Gambian entrepreneurs; (ii) improve the perfot-ance of the country's
largest commercial bank and increase the participation of financial
intermediaries in the financing of private enterprises; (iii) continue the
PE reform program; and (iv) develop the capacity of banks and SHE support
institutions to prepare, appraise and supervise SME projects and to provide
extension services to SM$s. The project would also start addressing the
technical assistance needs of women entrepreneurs and facilitate their
access to credit.
7.            Proiect Description.  The project, to be implemented t *er
9-1/2 years, would offer an integrated  package of credit, technical
assistance and training tailored to the needs of SMEs defined as private
enterprises with total assets of less than US$400,000. The credit
component would finance the foreign exchange and some local costs of ti)
fixed assets and associated permanent working capital of investment
projects promoted by small and medium enterprises in all sectors of the
economy except trade, real estate and subsistence agriculture; and (ii)
free-standing working capital for such enterpr'ses.  Financing for free-
standing working capital in aggregate would not exceed US$0.5 million. Any
accredited bank in The Gambia in good standing with the Central Bank would
be eligible to participate, subject to its entering into a participating
agreement with the CBG that would specify, inter alia, the lending and
repayment conditions, procurement and disbursement procedures, and the
intermediary's acceptance of responsibility for appraisal and supervision
of subprojects. The human resources development comnonent would be



-3
provided through local i-nstitutions involved in training (particularly the
MDI) and SME promotion for {i) SMEs-and women entrepreneurs on technical
matters and project preparation and management; (ii) Government agencies
responsible for-administering t-he new-investment code: and-(iii)-
participating commercial banks in project preparation and appraisal-'
techiiques. ''It would also'allow Government to implementthethe, GCD
restructuring program and to provide training for GCDB's staff.  The public
enternrise (PE) reform component would support the Government's ongoing PE
reforms through (i) technical assistance to NIB to strengthen its role in
monitoring PEs and the PE divestiture program and implementation and
supervision of performance'contracts; and t-ii) improvements in accounting,
management aud computer systems in selected PEs.
8.            The total cost of the project is estimated at US$13.6 million
equivalent, of which US$9.6 million would be in foreign exchange. A
breakdown of costs and the financifr plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as a disbursement
schedule, appear in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in The Gambia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively.  Map No. IBRD 21025 showing the different
provinces of the country and the location of project related institutions
is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7034-GM, dated Nov. 30, 1988.
is being distributed separately.
9.            Actions Agreed. -During negotiations, agreement was reached
with Government on the following: (i) onlending rates and conditions and
their annual review with IDA; (ii) content of the draft Subsidiary
Financing and Management Agreement between the Government and CBG. The
signing of the Agreement will be a condition of effectiveness; (iii)
content of the Participating Agreement between participating banks and.the
CBG. The signing of the agreement with one participating bank would be a
condition of effectiveness, and signature with a participating bank would
be a condition of disbursement for that intermediary; (iv) reorganization
of the Industrial Business Advisory Service as a key institution for
extension services to SMEs; (v) program of restructuring for the GCrJ3; (vi)
action program for divestiture of public enterprises; and (vii) plan to
recover on loans under the Government's Managed Fund at GCDB.
10.           Justification.  The project would continue the reduction in
the size of the public sector already initiated by the Government and
increase the role of the private sector in the economy. The line of credit
component is expected to help generate about 1,400 jobs at an average cost
of US$6,000 each, and to nurture the development of a local entrepreneurial
class. The impact of the project is also expected to be dispersed
geographically and among diverse income groups. It will not only provide
term financing for SMEs, but would also help build an effective local
capacity for financing, managing and assisting them.  Finally, the project
would ease the access of women to institutional credit and upgrade their
skills and help improve the banking sector by restructuring the GCDB.
11.           Risks.  As the first apex operation in The Gambia, the
project involves institutional arrangements that are new to the
intermediaries and the Central Bank. Some delays in subloan processing may



-4-
occur as the CBG needs to familiarize itself with the system and as
participating banks strengthen their,capacity to appraise and supervise SHE
projects.  This risk would be considerably reduced by the rapid
implementation of the technical assistance components and close supervision
by IDA during the initial- phase -of project -execution.  Another risk, which
relates to GCDB's ability to successfully implement its rehabilitation
program and achieve institut4ional viability, is aIlleviated by the
commitment of the Government and GCDB's management to such an objective. A
third risk relates to th'e progress of the-PE divestiture program, which
depends very much on investor interest and the overall economic outlook.
This risk should1 however. be minimized by the Government's continuing.
commitment to the success of the Economic Recovery Program and to private
sector development, as well as ,he incentives and institutional support
measures provided under the project.
12.           Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
recomend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
