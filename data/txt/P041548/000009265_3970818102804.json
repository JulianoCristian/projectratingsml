the\n            Privatization and Regulatory Capacity Building Technical\n            Assistance Project is to increase the level of private\n            sector investment in Gabon. The current program calls for:\n            (a) facilitating rapid divestiture from state enterprises\n            with major spin-off effects on factor costs and employment,\n            in transport, power, telecommunications, and the largest\n            agro-businesses; and (b) improving the efficiency of state\n            spending in core areas directly aimed at poverty reduction.\n            The project has five components: (1) Public understanding\n            and support of the reform program -obtained by: (a) setting\n            up and operating an information unit; (b) building\n            government capacity to use the media effectively and\n            establishing contacts with influential constituencies; (c)\n            researching public opinion; and (d) training journalists on\n            reporting economic and governance issues. (2) Regulatory\n            framework and capacity building -financing (a) a regulatory\n            agency for the infrastructure subsectors; (b) implementing\n            regulations and laws to attract private investment; and (c)\n            the training of regulatory agency staff. (3) Privatizing\n            selected large public enterprises in priority sectors with\n            financing for consultant and advisory services. (4)\n            Increasing local participation in privatization -preparing\n            to sell the government's minority shares by: (a)\n            drafting regulations on financial markets, trading\n            activities, and financial intermediaries; and (b) passing\n            laws to establish and regulate mutual funds; and (c)\n            updating current laws on securities issuance. (5) Improving\n            the business environment and promoting investment -by\n            financing (a) computerizing legal texts; (b) repealing,\n            amending, updating, or enacting applicable business laws;\n            (c) reviewing existing and alternative business dispute\n            resolution mechanisms; (d) revising the Labor Code; and (e)\n            auditing and financially restructuring the national social\n            security agency."}, "docdt": "1997-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
