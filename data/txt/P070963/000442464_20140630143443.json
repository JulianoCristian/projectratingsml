outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: embedding the\n            project into the national education policy is key to\n            achieving results. Project design should be flexible enough\n            to allow staying the course and not slowing down progress.\n            Bi-lateral agreements provide the flexibility necessary to\n            stimulate ownership, to adapt education policy to different\n            contexts, and to promote innovations at the provincial\n            level. Ensuring smooth implementation requires not only\n            significant technical assistance for the provinces but also\n            a monitoring instrument that can quickly diagnose the\n            issues, trigger a rapid response, and increase\n            accountability. Educational statistics are key for\n            programming and annual monitoring. Dramatic improvements to\n            the monitoring and evaluation system have begun through the\n            project financed improvement of the federal education\n            information network."}, "docdt": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
