                                               vii
1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In 2005, after three years of accelerated growth, Argentina was still recovering from
the severe economic and social crisis that had begun in 1998. The Government’s focus was
to transition from crisis response to addressing long-term structural issues in the economy,
such as improving the investment climate to sustain long-term growth that would further
fuel a strong demand for skilled labor and the social inclusion of vulnerable groups. The
Government sought to provide equal opportunities by improving the educational attainment
of the rural population, particularly in the poorer provinces of the Northwest and Northeast.

2.      In rural areas, the education system was characterized by pockets of limited
coverage with incomplete access to the ten obligatory years of education. In addition, the
quality of education in rural areas was significantly below that of urban areas which
resulted in high repetition and dropout rates. Because they served areas with low population
density, schools in rural areas tended to be low priorities in terms of the allocation of
resources for infrastructure, equipment, didactic materials, and teacher training. Schools in
rural areas were characterized by multi-grade classrooms, teachers with limited access to
information and professional support, poor facilities, and a lack of equipment and material.

3.      The Government’s National Rural Education Program was designed to address the
specific requirements of the education system in rural areas and support full coverage of the
ten years of compulsory education, including preschool, while improving the quality of
basic education, especially as it related to Core Learning Priorities, (NAP: Núcleos de
Aprendizajes Prioritarios) to make the education system more productive and equitable.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.      The objectives of the Project are to improve: (i) the coverage, efficiency, and
quality of the Argentine education system, and (ii) the governance of the Argentine
education system through strengthening of the normative, planning, information,
monitoring, and evaluation capacity at the national and provincial levels. In the PAD, the
key indicators that follow the PDO indicate that “the Argentine education system” means
the rural education system from pre-school to lower secondary education as also indicated
by the Project’s name “Rural Education Improvement Project”.

5.      The original PDO indicators, identified as specific objectives in the PAD, were: (i)
Reduce by half the difference in the access of 6 year old children in 1st grade as compared
to 5 year old children in Pre-School in rural areas in Argentina; (ii) Increase from 73
percent to 85 percent the access of students completing the 7th grade to the 8th grade of
schooling in rural areas in Argentina; (iii) Improve promotion rate in EGB1 (Grades 1 to 3)
in rural areas in Argentina from 76 percent (2002) to 85 percent (2010); (iv) Reduce two or
more years of overage enrollment in EGB2 in rural areas from 24 percent (2002) to 12
percent (2010); (v) Improve the percentage of students in Grade 3 in rural schools
achieving proficiencies in the nationally ratified standards of the NAP); (vi) ) Improve the
                                             1
percentage of students in Grade 6 in rural schools achieving proficiencies in the nationally
ratified standards of the NAP; (vii) Number of bilateral agreements between national and
provincial Governments in satisfactory execution; and (viii) Annual plans regarding the
compilation, analysis, dissemination and use of educational statistics in satisfactory
execution.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

6.      The PDO remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project. At the 09/01/2011
restructuring, the PDO indicators were revised to reflect updated data available from the
National Ministry of Education (NME) and to be consistent with the changes introduced to
the operating environment of the education sector by the December 2006 National
Education Law 2. The indicator measuring overage enrollment in grade 6 was dropped
because Government policy also intended to bring children that had previously dropped out
back to school. The indicators measuring student learning gains in grade 3 and 6 as
measured by the National Student Assessment were dropped and replaced by an indicator
measuring the number of schools with graduated teachers. Due to data processing lags and
delays in implementation of activities, there would only be two data points (2007 and 2010)
taken, rendering comparability of performance over time in schools difficult.

7.      The revised PDO indicators were: (i) Reduce by half the number of 6-year-old
children in 1st grade in rural areas in Argentina who did not attend preschool; (ii) Increase
from 77.8 percent to 85 percent the student promotion rate from 7th grade to 8th grade in
rural areas of Argentina; (iii) Increase the student promotion rate from 6th grade to 7th
grade in rural areas of Argentina; (iv) Improve the average promotion rates in grades 1 to 6
in rural areas in Argentina; (v) Number of rural schools with at least one teacher who had
graduated from the diploma program in Math and Spanish; (vi) Number of bilateral
agreements between national and provincial Governments being satisfactorily executed;
and (vii) Annual plans regarding the compilation, analysis, dissemination, and use of
educational statistics, whose execution is rated as satisfactory.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.     The main beneficiaries were the population age 5 to 14 enrolled in rural schools,
which was estimated to comprise 868,540 students. Other secondary beneficiaries were the
teachers in rural schools and the staff in the line departments in the Ministries of Education
at the federal and provincial levels dealing with management, planning, information
systems, procurement, and school supervision for the rural education system.

1.5 Original Components



2
  The National Education Law increased the length of compulsory education from 9 to 13 years and
restructure the education system from a mandatory basic education (grade 1-9) to a system of kindergarten
plus 6 or 7 years of primary followed by 6 or 5 years of secondary education.


                                                   2
Component A: Improving the Quality and Coverage of Rural Education

   1. Carrying out activities aimed at improving the operating conditions of Rural
      Schools (A.1 Subprojects) and including: (a) provision of didactic materials and
      teaching equipment; (b) construction and/or rehabilitation of classrooms to
      accommodate existing and/or additional enrollment and to meet minimum school
      infrastructure standards, maintenance of Rural Schools and provision of the
      infrastructure and materials required thereof; (c) provision of technical tools
      necessary to access distance education through the educational television channels ;
      (d) provision of technical assistance for the preparation of Institutional Pedagogical
      Activities in Rural Schools serving predominantly indigenous students including
      carrying out training programs for Rural Schools implementing the Borrower’s
      indigenous education programs; and (e) establishment and operation of clusters of
      Rural Schools designed to deal with common sets of problems such as education
      planning, training and management of didactic materials, teaching equipment, and
      other resources for such schools (School Clusters).

   2. Carrying out activities aimed at expanding coverage and improving the student
      promotion flow in Rural Schools (A.2 Subprojects) and including: (a) expansion of
      coverage of preschool education through the development and application of multi-
      grade preschool models, including the provision of educational materials and
      teacher training required thereof; (b) implementation of measures aimed to prevent
      dropout and repetition in the first years of primary education, such as measures to
      increase the reading and mathematics ability of students in the early grades,
      adoption of a three-year learning cycle as a framework for learning and promotion
      of students, and provision of training as required therein; (c) implementation of
      selected actions aimed to assist over-age students in catching up academically and
      reducing the over-age distortion in the latter years of primary education, and
      provision of the materials and training required therein; (d) design and
      implementation of learning modules for delivery of compulsory secondary
      education to students in Rural Schools, including the provision of materials and
      teacher training required therein; and (e) carrying out Institutional Pedagogical
      Activities.

   3. Undertaking activities aimed at strengthening the management of education delivery
      in Rural Schools at the provincial level (A.3 Subprojects) and including the
      provision of technical assistance and training for staff at the Provincial education
      ministries in management, financial management, procurement, internal auditing,
      planning, information management and systems, pedagogical activities,
      administrative tasks, and school supervision.

   4. Carrying out procurement at the national level for Component A activities.

Component B: Enhancing Stewardship Capacity of the MECyT

   1. Strengthening the planning, normative, monitoring, evaluation, implementation,
      financial management, procurement, and internal auditing capabilities of selected

                                            3
        departments in the MECyT through: (a) a review of the institutional arrangements in
        selected departments to identify and correct overlapping of activities and establish
        modern procedures and mechanisms to monitor and evaluate education activities
        and projects; and (b) provision of training to upgrade the technical skills of those
        involved in improving educational quality, principally in the use of implementation
        tools and information management systems.

     2. Carrying out: (a) surveys of the functional conditions of Rural Schools and impact
        evaluation studies of the Project; and (b) student learning assessments in Rural
        Schools and the provision of feedback to these schools.

1.6 Revised Components

9.      The components and sub-components were not formally revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

10.     The 09/01/2011 level 2 restructuring: (i) revised the Results Framework; (ii)
reallocated proceeds because the cost of component B increased as the Project supported
student learning assessments on an expanded sample of rural schools and the provision of
feedback to these schools in 2006 and 2010 and increased consultant costs needed to
support the provincial and national governments3; and (iii) extended the closing date from
October 31, 2011 to December 31, 2013 to allow sufficient time to finalize all Project
activities.

11.     The 04/03/2013 restructuring reallocated proceeds to finance: (i) increased unit
costs in infrastructure activities; (ii) unanticipated consultant services related to the
production of pedagogical materials; and (iii) increased operating costs linked to the teacher
training program, and the financial transfers to schools (“Planes de Mejora”) implemented
in 2,033 schools.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Strengths:

12.    The Project built on the lessons learned from the four previous Bank-financed
education projects. The key lessons were: (i) to provide financing to the Federal
Government, so it would be responsible for the compensatory programs and instruments
required for improved educational service delivery; (ii) to strengthen provincial ownership
through extensive consultations with the Provinces to tailor the Project’s interventions to
their needs and through bilateral agreements between the Federal government and the
Provinces; (iii) to ensure the Project was part of the national policy for rural education in


3
 The increased costs of Component B were financed by reallocating the remaining funds of the categories
“Refunding of Project Preparation Advance” and “Unallocated”.

                                                    4
order to increase its sustainability; (iv) to put emphasis on the timely collection and sharing
of education indicators through the inclusion of monitoring and evaluation in the Project,
along with the provision of resources and technical assistance for evaluation and
dissemination; and (v) to build flexibility into the Project’s design by providing only a
general definition of inputs and including a system for annual review and revision based on
intermediate results.

13.     The Project was implemented within the existing structures of the NME and
provincial Ministries. At the national level, the Directorate General for the International
Finance Unit (DGUFI), in coordination with the other technical directorates was in charge
of coordinating all Project activities. The DGUFI was also responsible for an IDB-financed
project4. The need to build provincial implementation capacity (e.g. procurement, financial
management, or monitoring and evaluation) was to be accomplished by strengthening
existing line departments. This practice was designed to increase both implementation
capacity and the sustainability of the rural education policy.

14.     The Project design was simple and entirely focused on rural education. The choice
of investment and approach were well adapted to the context of rural education, more
specifically: (i) the access of students aged four and five years old to preschool; (ii)
teaching methods for multi-age classrooms; (iii) teaching guides, textbooks, and library
books well suited for learning to read; (iv) a pedagogical and institutional model to develop
secondary education. Initially in the preparation process the Project was designed to cover
rural education, technical education, and the transition to higher education. However, when
the Law funding technical education was adopted in 2005, the Government did not request
the inclusion of technical education. Therefore, the Project was simplified to support the
National Program for Rural Education (NPRE), which exhibited strong ownership by the
National Ministry of Education (NME) and the Provincial Ministries. By expanding
coverage and quality of education in rural areas, the Project addressed the issue of social
inclusion of vulnerable groups, equality of opportunity, and productivity improvement.

15.     The use of bilateral agreements between the federal government and the Provinces
was considered the best way to consolidate support for the reforms, build ownership and
trust, and strengthen capacity and accountability among participating Provinces. The
bilateral agreements: (i) were piloted to facilitate dialogue; (ii) included a requirement for
each province to undertake diagnostic work needed to define the gaps in coverage and in
the efficiency indicators for rural education using a standardized methodology developed
by the NME; (iii) would be supported by annual work plans and would contain targets; (iv)
would allocate funds annually based on a review of progress toward compliance with the
previous year’s work plan and projected activities; and (v) ensured that provinces that were
slow on implementation would receive help and special attention from national authorities.

 The IDB-financed project supported the quality, equity and efficiency in the Argentine education system,
with particular focus on secondary education and expanding infrastructure in urban areas. It was approved in
2004.


                                                      5
Weaknesses:

16.     A more careful assessment of Provincial implementation capacity should have been
undertaken in order to fine tune the implementation arrangements and evaluate the
technical assistance to be provided to the Provinces. Although the PAD and the Operation
Manual clearly delineated responsibilities and processes, they did not fully anticipate the
difficulties that could arise from decentralized implementation. As a result, it took time,
effort, and technical assistance for the Project to commence in the Provinces with weak
administrative and implementation capacity, especially to test procedures and train staff.
This was particularly true for the procurement of civil works.

17.      The PDO, as stated in the loan agreement, was too broad. It should have explicitly
restricted the scope of the Project to preschool, primary, and lower secondary education in
rural areas. This issue arose as a result of the decision to distinguish between general and
specific objectives in the PAD. The specific objectives did restrict the objectives to the
rural areas.

18.    The risk assessment did not anticipate the difficulties that the Project encountered in
implementing and modernizing the system of data collection, analysis and dissemination.
These were due to: (i) the lack of a culture of evaluation and results; (ii) delays in
processing and analyzing the data; and (iii) the impact of changes to the educational
regulatory framework at the secondary level.

2.2 Implementation

Factors generally subject to Government control

19.     The Law for Educational Financing (LEF), approved by the Congress on December
20, 2005, set strategic goals for the education sector and established a set of rules for
resource allocation that provided incentives for the Provinces to meet these goals. The
Project design built on this new funding framework in which provinces would sign bilateral
agreements with the Federal Government committing to achieve specific goals and to
match additional federal resources with their general revenues. When the LEF took effect
in 2007, the funds from PROMER were the first to be allocated to the Provinces according
to the new framework. Essentially, the LEF: (i) led to an increase of the education budget
from 4.5% of GDP in 2006 to 6.4% of GDP in 2010; and (ii) guaranteed the provision of
resources to the provinces for the duration of the bilateral agreements.

20.    The 2006 National Education Law (Law 26.206) recognized the rural education
modality5 in education policy and institutionalized it in the administration at the National
and Provincial levels. In terms of the Project, the most significant features were: (i) to
extend compulsory education to twelve years; (ii) to include 100% of 5 year- olds and

5
  The rural education modality, along with the other eight modalities (bilingual intercultural, art, science and technology,
special, youth and adults, technical and professional, healthcare, and prison inmate education) are organizational and/or
curricular choices within the education system, covering one or more educational levels, that seek to address specific
training requirements in order to ensure equality in the right to education.


                                                             6
increase 3 and 4 year-old enrollment in preschool, particularly in low income areas; (iii) to
ensure that at least 30% of children have a complete school day in basic education; (iv) to
provide one computer to all students at the secondary level; (v) to allocate cash transfers to
families for each child enrolled in school (Asignación Universal por Hijo); and (vi) the
third cycle of basic education (grades 7 to 9), which was integrated in primary education,
became the first cycle of secondary education. However, this change to the legal framework
delayed the expansion of coverage of secondary education in the Provinces as well as the
implementation of the components of the Project related to it because it sparked numerous
debates and controversies regarding the integration of grades 7 to 9 within the institutional
organization of the schools.

21.     In December 2007, the election of a new Government resulted in a change of
officials at the NME. However, the PROMER coordinator, the director of DGUFI, and
most of the staff in charge of the Project remained in their positions. As a result, the impact
on Project implementation was minimal.

22.    On December 13, 2010, the Federal Council of Education approved the document
“Rural Education within the National Education System” as part of resolution 128/10. The
document provided the operational guidelines for the modality and accelerated the
implementation of the Project at the Provincial level. This decision was a major policy step
toward sustaining the rural education modality in each province.

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control

23.    In December 2008, after the Provincial elections, there was a change of the
administrators and technical staff in charge of the implementation of PROMER in 17 of the
22 provincial education ministries. This, with other factors linked to institutional capacity,
explained why Project implementation was slow to start up in many Provinces.

24.      In 2009, after implementation bottlenecks were identified, the DGUFI reorganized
itself at national level to provide increased support to the Provinces through more frequent
visits. At the same time, the Infrastructure Division of the Ministry of Education adopted
measures to improve the pace of physical and financial implementation of the school
construction programs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Design

25.     The Project design emphasized the timely collection and sharing of education
indicators through: (i) the inclusion of monitoring and evaluation requirements in the
bilateral agreements with the provinces; (ii) the provision of resources and technical
assistance to the provinces for data collection, evaluation, and dissemination; and (iii) the
development of a modernized web-based Federal Education Information Network.

26.     The design of the Results Framework exhibited some weaknesses: (i) only the PDO
indicators had baselines, values, and targets; (ii) intermediate indicators were few and were
not structured such that they would facilitate the assessment of the contribution of the

                                              7
different components of the Project to the achievement of the objectives; (iii) the choice of
indicators to measure quality in grade 3 and grade 6 was correct, but the initial, mostly
urban sample used by the Standardized National Assessment Test (ONE) did not allow
authorities to monitor the progress toward the achievement of the Core Learning Priorities
in rural areas; (iv) indicators 6 and 7 measuring governance were weak and vague because
they lacked baselines and targets.

Implementation

27.     The 2011 restructuring corrected some of the Results Framework’s initial
deficiencies. The following changes were made to key indicators: (i) the baselines for the
and targets for PDO indicators 1, 2 and 3 measuring access were modified because
additional information was available in 2007 and a significant number of rural schools
(particularly in the Province of Buenos Aires, where 25% of rural schools were reclassified)
had to be reclassified as urban schools; (ii) a new PDO indicator 3 was introduced to
monitor primary school completion; (iii) PDO indicator 3 was dropped 6 ; (iv) a new
indicator 5 was introduced, replacing the previous indicators 5 and 6, to monitor
improvements in the quality of instruction by measuring the number of rural schools with
at least one teacher graduate from the diploma program in math and Spanish7 ; and (v)
baselines and targets were set for 6 and 7. An important new intermediary indicator was
introduced to reflect that the mostly urban Standardized National Assessment Test (ONE)
sample was expanded and specifically designed to assess student learning including in rural
areas in grade 3 and in grade 6 in 2007, 2010, and 2013.

28.     Regrettably, this restructuring was carried late and did not fully correct all the
deficiencies in the Results matrix: (i) PDO indicators 2 and 3, which measured access, are
insufficient to measure education coverage; (ii) the intermediate indicators related to
component B ‘Enhancing the stewardship capacity’ of the national government, such as
“measuring the timely availability of educational statistics” or “measuring sharing of
educational statistics with schools”, which were dropped were not repetitive as indicated in
the restructuring since they gave more precision to the PDO indicator 7 related to
educational statistics.

29.     Despite the emphasis on monitoring and evaluation, the NME, and more
specifically the DINIECE (Directorate of Information and Educational Quality Evaluation),
often processed the data later than required for effectively monitoring the Project. During


6
  This indicator measuring the over-age enrollment was dropped at restructuring because other complementary policies
such as extra tutoring and flexible hours were intended to bring children that had previously dropped out back to school.
This might have led to stability in the over-age student population even though Project activities were designed to
decrease it. But, in reality, this policy had little impact on the number of children who went back to school so this
indicator remained relevant. Although the initial target was not achieved, the percentage of over-age students and dropouts
decreased substantially in rural areas.

  Indicators C1 and C2 measuring student learning gains in grade 3 and grade 6 as measured by the National Student
Assessment were dropped. As a result of data processing lag and delays in implementation, there would have been only
two data points (2007 and 2010), rendering comparability of performance over time in schools difficult.


                                                            8
the Project, it took about eighteen months after basic education data and Project data were
collected (in April at the beginning of the school year) to process and disseminate them.

30.      It was only in 2013 that the DINIECE successfully overcame these initial
difficulties and put in place a modern and efficient Federal Education Information Network.
During implementation, this system could not be put in place because: (i) the
subcomponent to support the development of a system of data collection, analysis, and
dissemination and to provide technical assistance to the provinces did not begin until 2010;
(ii) there were four changes of leadership in DINIECE between 2005 and 2009; and (iii) the
Federal Education Information Network was ambitious since the objective was that each
school upload their data to the system directly through the Web.

Utilization

31.     A survey of rural schools was performed by the University of La Plata in August
2005 to determine schools’ rehabilitation and equipment needs and to establish baselines
for Project indicators. However, the information from that survey was not fully utilized. In
2007, DINIECE extended this survey of the operating conditions of rural schools in the
provinces using funding from the Project. This survey was used: (i) to determine the sample
of rural schools for the ONE; (ii) to organize various Project activities; and (iii) to initiate
modernization of the Federal Education Information Network.

32.    Because of the delays in processing information throughout the life of the Project,
data tracked by the DINIECE on rural education were underutilized to inform policy
decisions at the national and provincial levels. However, student assessment data was
disseminated to the Provinces in 2007 and 2010.
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental safeguards:

33.     This was a category B Project because it included school construction. An
Environmental Management Framework was prepared and included in the Operation
Manual. All of the construction (mostly expansion and rehabilitation) was completed at the
existing school sites. All construction complied with the environmental safeguards.

Indigenous Peoples safeguards:

34.      One of the Project components is entirely dedicated to indigenous education. It
experienced a delayed start due to technical difficulties locating the indigenous population
and identifying their needs. It commenced with: (i) the 2007 creation of the Autonomous
Education Council for Indigenous Groups (CEAPI Consejo Educativo Autónomo de
Pueblos Indígenas); (ii) decision 119/10 (September 2010) of the Federal Council of
Education which defined the policy guidelines for Bilingual and intercultural education;
(iii) a study of the sociolinguistic situation in the bilingual schools (December 2010); and
(iv) an initial mapping exercise, including the linguistic and cultural criteria of 15,314 rural
schools performed during from 2005-2009.


                                               9
35.    The Project’s main achievements in this area are: (i) a specific and detailed census
and description of intercultural and bilingual education in 499 schools with indigenous
children in 14 Provinces in 2011 and 2012 (there were 237 indigenous students in
preschool, 313 in primary, and 172 in secondary; (ii) the implementation, mostly in 2012,
of 146 school development plans (10 in preschool, 102 in primary, 16 in secondary, and 18
that combined all levels); (iii) 17 trainings organized for 1,260 teachers from 526 schools
organized in 13 provinces; (iv) the organization of five regional round table discussions in
2010 to increase awareness of cultural diversity and knowledge of the traditional language,
while also debating and formulating education policy for the indigenous population; and (v)
an inventory of didactic materials specific to the indigenous population.

Financial management

36.    Overall, the Project’s financial management was handled adequately. Nonetheless,
mid-way through the project, there were some delays in the transmission of audit reports
and minor issues continued to be flagged in these audits. By 2011-2012 the situation had
improved substantially through the joint efforts of the General Comptroller of the Nation
(SIGEN), supervising the actions of the Internal Audit Unit of the NME in coordination
with the Provincial Court of Accounts. The quality of control mechanisms regulating the
use of funds at the subnational level was considerably reinforced. Fund oversight at the
provincial level was adequate. When the audits were flagged, there was a prompt reaction
from authorities at the national and provincial levels to fix the issues. The financial
management of this Project demonstrates good practice for the Bank’s portfolio in
Argentina.

Procurement

37.     The Project procurement arrangements and action plans were adequate, reflecting
the recommendations of the Procurement Capacity Assessment done during Project
preparation The DGUFI already possessed ample experience from previous operations with
the Bank and the IDB. Apart from assessing procurement capacity and arrangements at the
national level, the Bank also undertook a procurement capacity assessment at the provincial
level, using one province as a representative example. Based on this methodology, the
DGUFI carried out an assessment of the capacity of the Provinces (between April and May
2005) and established a risk level for procurement for each participating Province. This was
used to prepare action plans to improve procurement capacity at provincial level. The
DGUFI did an excellent job in annually consolidating the procurement plans from all the
Provinces into a single Procurement Plan (this was considered to be best practice and
PROMER was the only Bank financed project in Argentina that was able to do so).

38.    However, there were difficulties procuring civil work at the Provincial level during
the early years of implementation. The requirement that the Provinces submit all the
technical documentation to the central level for review resulted in considerable delays. To
accelerate this process in 2010: (i) the DGUFI reorganized itself to strengthen its
Procurement unit; (ii) the Bank organized a one day seminar to train the new procurement
staff of DGUFI to use Bank’s documents and guidelines; (iii) the Project paid for
consultants to provide technical assistance to the Provinces and train procurement staff to

                                            10
follow the Bank’s guidelines; and (iv) the Operation Manual was updated with information
on the procurement of training, maintenance funds, and school development plans. As a
result, the procurement difficulties were overcome in all the provinces except for Jujuy and
Santiago del Estero where the initial construction plan had to be downsized.

Covenants

39.       All the covenants stipulated under the loan agreement were met.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The rural modality is now well institutionalized. All the Provinces adopted resolution
128/10 approved by the Federal Council of Education on December 13, 2010. A follow-up
Project PROMER II is in preparation to be financed by a US$250 million Bank loan. Its
PDO is expected to be: (i) to reduce the repetition rate in primary education; and (ii) to
increase access and achievement in secondary education in rural areas. The objectives also
include the upper secondary cycle, which became mandatory in December 2006.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objective: Pre 2011 restructuring rating- High / Post restructuring rating -
High

40.     The Project was instrumental in creating a national policy for rural education in
Argentina. The relevance of Project objectives is fully reflected in the enactment of the
2006 National Education Law (Law 26.206) which among its main provisions: (i)
recognizes the rural modality in education policy8; (ii) and extends compulsory education
to twelve years; (iii), promotes quality at all levels; and (iv) promotes increasing
participation in preschool, particularly in low-income areas. In addition the objective of
improving governance of the education system is included in the LEF, approved by
Congress on December 20, 2005. The Project is consistent with the Government’s strategic
objective of social inclusion of vulnerable groups, and it played a defining role in boosting
the draf of the Federal Council for Education’s resolution 128/10 which institutionalized
the rural education agenda in Argentina. On December 5, 2012 the Federal Council of
Education approved the National Plan for Mandatory Education and Teacher Training
(Plan Nacional de Educación Obligatoria y Formación Docente, PNEDOyFD) which
defined the government’s priorities for 2012-2016. This plan had two main lines of action


8
  The Law 26.206 set up the objectives of rural education: (i) ensuring access to knowledge through flexible pedagogical
proposals that strengthen the link with the cultural identities and local productive activities: (ii) promoting institutional
designs that enable learners to maintain links with their household and local environment of belonging, during the
educational process; (iii) allowing school organization models appropriate to each context, such as clusters of institutions,
multigrade rooms ensuring compliance with compulsory education and continuing studies in different cycles, and levels of
the education system; (iv) promoting equal opportunities and ensuring gender equality.


                                                            11
detailed in specific lines for each level of the education system: (i) improving the quality of
education services; and (ii) providing universal access to education services, especially for
marginalized groups. The objective of the second pillar of the CPS 2010-2012 (the most
recent CPS) continues to be relevant: it consists of expanding efforts to reverse the longer-
term poverty trend by, among other social measures, assuring high-quality educational
opportunities for all by reducing the differences in educational attainment by region, gender
and socio economic status, increasing access to secondary education and improving the
quality of education to ensure improved entry into the workforce.

Relevance of design: Pre 2011 restructuring rating - Substantial / Post restructuring rating -
Substantial

41.     The Project design, which included the lessons learned from previous projects in
Argentina and the best practices from other countries, was substantially relevant to the
objective of improving efficiency and quality of the learning process of rural education by
focusing on the quality of the learning process particularly at preschool and primary levels,
because they are determinant for children’s future, through the provision of textbooks,
learning materials, teacher training and clusters of rural schools; of improving coverage to
preschool and lower secondary education by improving access by building and
rehabilitating classrooms and extending schooling in lower secondary. It was substantially
relevant to the governance objective by: (i) supporting bilateral agreements with the
provinces to ensure flexibility of implementation and accountability for Project results; (ii)
strengthening the implementation capacity at the provincial level to ensure the sustainable
development of rural education; and (iii) supporting the development of modern procedures
and mechanisms to monitor and evaluate education.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.     To assess the Project’s achievement, this ICR considers the four dimensions of the
Project’s PDO (to improve coverage, efficiency, quality and governance of the education
system), relying on the Project’s key outcome indicators but also on several supplementary
indicators collected at the ICR stage.

   A. Improve coverage Pre 2011 restructuring rating - Substantial / Post restructuring
      rating - Substantial

43.     The number of 6 year-old children that did not attend pre-school has been
drastically reduced beyond the pre and post restructuring target. Preschool enrollment in
rural areas (not including the Province of Buenos Aires) increased 32.4% between 2004 and
2013 and in rural areas of the Province of Buenos Aires enrollment increased 5.2% between
2007 and 2013.

    of the Province of BAs                        (Baseline 2007)

44.     The following actions contributed to the expansion of coverage at the preschool
level: (i) the Project supported the implementation of Law 26.206, which expands
compulsory education to preschool and provides access to kindergarten for four and five
year-olds; (ii) the construction and rehabilitation of kindergarten class rooms; (iii) the
distribution of didactic materials and learning equipment to 4,455 preschool facilities
(100% of preschool facilities in rural areas); and (iv) training provided to 6,137 preschool
teachers along with technical assistance to organize multi-grade classrooms. Different
provinces used various alternatives to achieve increased preschool coverage: multi-grade
classrooms annexed to primary schools, independent kindergartens, traveling teachers,
teachers with dual degrees, and attention to children at home.

45.     Enrollment in lower secondary education in rural areas without including the
Province of Buenos Aires increased 30.8% between 2004 and 2013. In the rural areas of the
Province of Buenos Aires, enrollment increased 19.4% between 2007 and 2013. The
increase was remarkable (greater than 40%) in 8 provinces –including the poorest
provinces-10, average in 10 provinces, and insignificant in 5 provinces11. The target for the
access to 7th grade from 6th was 55.3% achieved (this indicator was introduced at the 2011
restructuring). The target of 85% for access to 8th grade from 7th was achieved in 2011, but
in 2012 and 2013 the value slipped slightly below the target.

46.     The Project contributed to an increase in access to lower secondary education
through: (i) the promotion of a pedagogical and institutional model adapted to the rural
context; (ii) the construction and rehabilitation of class rooms; (iii) the provision of libraries,
library books, teaching guides, textbooks, and manuals to 6,168 schools (100% of
secondary schools in rural areas); (iv) equipping schools with science laboratories,
computers, printers, and audiovisual material; (v) technical assistance provided to 1,687
schools for school development plans (27.3% of secondary schools in rural areas); (vi)

     B. Improve efficiency Pre 2011 restructuring rating - Substantial / Post restructuring
        rating - Substantial

47.    The post-restructuring target for the promotion rate in primary education in rural
areas was exceeded, with a significant reduction in repetition and dropout rates. As a result,
the proportion of over-age students declined substantially, in spite of policies that
encouraged over-age students to return to school.

48.     The Project contributed to an increase in promotion rate and reduction of repetition
and drop out among primary education students by: (i) developing students’ reading ability
in preschool using books, teaching guides, and didactic materials; (ii) provision of libraries
with 272 books and 150 textbooks, 7 teaching guides, and a science laboratory to all 6,540
primary schools in rural areas; (iii) training 11,940 teachers in three main areas: a) teaching
techniques to stimulate reading and writing, b)management of multi-grade classrooms, and
c) implementation of the three-year learning cycle as the framework for learning and
student promotion and (iv) training of 2,735 teachers in the rural education diploma
program.

 The clusters grouped an average of 10 schools with the following objectives: sharing experiences, pedagogical
management, achieving economies of scale, organization of supervisors, teacher training, and increasing coverage.

49.     The standardized national learning assessment test (Operativo Nacional de
Evaluación ONE) was conducted in 2007, 2010, 2013 on a sample of schools that ensured
the representation of rural schools. However, it is not possible to draw conclusions for
quality improvement from the ONE since only the 2013 ONE results (not available at the
date of the ICR) could confirm whether some positive trends observed between 2007 and
2010 were sustained as a result of the Project. It is an achievement of the Project that the
ONE was conducted regularly every three years in Argentina, but the test still has some
limitations: (i) it is a universal standard assessment test only in secondary schools in the last
grade but it is administered on a sample of primary schools in grade 3 and 6 ; (ii) the results,
available by province, are disseminated to the public only by region on the website of
DINIECE so their impact on the behavior of stakeholders at the school level is
questionable; and (iii) to guide a policy driven toward quality the ONE should be
complemented by studies that assess the incidence of inputs on the improvement of the

teacher). The evaluation performed in 2011 and the 2013 survey of beneficiaries showed
that17: (i) 95% of the teachers who graduated declared that they received training on the
relevant didactic tools to teach in multi-grade classrooms; (ii) 82.7% received the
methodology to organize their time, space and resources; (iii) 51.9% strengthened their
ability to work more autonomously; and (iv) 49.4% increased their knowledge of the core
disciplines.

52.      The Project contributed to improvement in quality through the training of 6,043
teachers in primary schools of which, 2,735 graduated. The graduation rate is low because:
(i) the training was demanding in addition to teachers’ normal working hours; (ii) the
training was long, 400 hours combining distance education and face to face training; and
(iii) the certification process was strict.

53.     This training was successful. First, it contributed to the installation of permanent
training capacity at the provincial level, with 256 professors in charge of the training and
191 supervisors trained in 47 teacher training institutions in 20 Provinces. Secondly, all the
teacher graduates returned to their positions in their original schools and they expressed a
high appreciation for the training. But the number of teacher graduates is too low to have a
significant impact (about 5.5% of the 47,133 primary teaching staff in all 11,637 rural
schools).
54.     In addition the Project contributed to quality by providing didactic materials,
learning equipment and improving schools facilities (as detailed in previous section on
coverage and efficiency).

     D. Improve Governance of the Argentine education system: Pre 2011 restructuring
        rating - Substantial/ Post restructuring rating - Substantial

55.      The improvement in governance of the Argentine education system is substantial.
The bilateral agreements (convenios bilaterales) including the Provincial Rural Education
Plan and the operational mechanisms for the implementation of Project actions were signed
with almost all the Provinces in 2006 (La Pampa, Neuquén, and San Luis signed them in
2007) conforming to the sample agreed on in the PAD. They were followed in 2007 by the
signing of the first annual covenants (Actas de Monitoreo Anual) specifying activities,
goals and indicators. For each year that the Project was in implementation a complementary
act was signed to update the bilateral agreements followed by annual covenants for
program activities. In 2012, bilateral agreements for the period 2012-2016 were signed with
all the Provinces.

56.     The flexible approach instituted in the bilateral agreements proved to be successful
in particular in terms of: (i) organizing the partnership between the national and provincial
education ministries; (ii) adapting the Project to the implementation capacity of each
province; (iii) promoting a more targeted and differentiated policy to address the
educational disparities in educational opportunity and the peculiarities of school in rural
areas; (iii) programming and monitoring inputs; (iv) introducing more transparency and
promoting a culture of results; and (v) taking corrective measures when necessary. As a
result, most of the Provinces increased the resources dedicated to rural education. The
DGUFI designed a diagnostic tool to assess the performance of the provinces. The
execution of the bilateral agreements in the provinces was uneven: (i) in four provinces
execution was rated highly satisfactory; (ii) in nine, satisfactory; (iii) in seven, moderately
satisfactory; and (iv) in three the execution was not satisfactory.18


18
  The rating has been established by the DGUFI through a diagnostic tool based on five criteria: (i) percentage of
execution of the agreed action plans; (ii) administrative and financial management; (iii) procurement management; (iv)

                                                           17
57.     The Project made a substantial contribution to improve governance at the
provincial level by: (i) undertaking the collaborative planning activities necessary to
prepare and monitor the bilateral agreements; (ii) allowing investment decisions to be made
based on a more careful assessment of learning conditions and educational performance in
rural schools; (iii) transferring all of the elements of the normative framework related to
the rural education policy through technical assistance and training; (iv) funding an average
of 203 positions in the provinces in key areas such as procurement, financial management,
pedagogy, and monitoring and evaluation and (v) the Project was implemented through the
existing institutional structure which increases sustainability of arrangements and outcomes.

58.     DINIECE was successful in establishing a modernized Federal Education
Information Network in 2013 which significantly improved data collection analysis and
dissemination. As a result, an effective annual plan is now in place to collect, analyze and
disseminate the annual education data and the time necessary went from 18 months during
the period from 2005-2012 to 9 months in 2013. The Project contributed to build the
network through different steps: (i) in 2006, the Federal Education Information Network
project design was modernized and strengthened; (ii) in 2007, the procurement plan for the
network equipment (computers, servers, printers) was completed; (iii) in 2010, the
equipment was distributed to the Provinces and the staff was trained; (iv) in 2011, the
software for data collection and analysis and the website for direct queries were finalized;
(v) in 2012, in some of Provinces a new system that allowed the data to be directly
uploaded at the school level through the web was piloted; and (vi) in 2013, the network was
fully operational in all the Provinces.

3.3 Efficiency Pre 2011 restructuring rating - Negligible/ Post restructuring rating - Negligible

59.      The economic and financial analysis that was conducted includes: (i) an analysis of
the fiscal impact of the Project including its contribution to key results achieved by the
rural education sector and comparing the fiscal performance of the Project to the results
initially forecasted in the PAD; and (ii) a cost analysis of the education system, that takes
into account each province as well as the characteristics of the rural education system.
However, it was not possible to measure the efficiency gains in rural areas or to perform a
cost benefit analysis of the Project’s interventions because the Provincial education budgets
do not make a distinction between education in rural areas and total education expenditure.

60.     The increase of the expenditure of the MECyT as a result of the Project was1.5
percent on average (with a minimum of 0.12 percent in 2006 to a maximum of 2.62 percent
in 2010 when Project investment was at its highest). The resulting fiscal impact measured
by this indicator is significantly lower than what was estimated in the PAD (4.6 percent on
average, with varying rates that peaked above 8 percent), chiefly because expenditure on
education by MECyT increased at a faster pace than planned in the PAD, owing to the
provisions set forth in the LEF passed in late 2005 which increased the share of public


management of activities related to the coordination of the program in the provinces; and (v) management of training
activities.


                                                           18
expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP. This suggests that the fiscal pressure
exerted on the Government budget was limited and sustainable. The increase in Provincial
expenditure as a result of the development of rural education (increased enrollment at
preschool, primary, and lower secondary levels) was minimal: 0.9 percent on average
during the life of the Project.

61.     The expenditure increase was accompanied by an expansion in the supply of
services in rural areas which is far more important, as evidenced by the increase in the
number of teaching positions and classrooms during the period under review. The share of
teachers in rural areas relative to the national total increased from 17.1 percent in 2005 to
18.7 percent in 2012. The number of classrooms at each level increased in tandem with the
number of teaching positions in rural areas, climbing from 6,863 to 8,549 at the early
childhood level (an increase of 24.6 percent) between 2007 and 2012, from 29,788 to
34,730 at the primary level (16.6 percent increase) and from 11,082 to 15,330 at the
secondary level (a 38.3 percent increase). This suggests that rural education was given
priority while efficiency gains were realized.

62.     The cost analysis shows that: (i) there was a relative reduction in the Government
transfers to the Provinces for education corresponding to teachers’ salary payments (from
73.9 percent in 2005 to 52.1 percent in 2012) and a corresponding increase in the line items
related to infrastructure and equipment; and (ii) there was great variability among Provinces
in the allocation of resources especially with regard to teacher salaries and transfers to fund
private education. As a result, the level of expenditure per student varies greatly from one
Province to another. In 2012, Tierra del Fuego exhibited the highest level of expenditure
per student, disbursing five times more than Salta at the opposite end of the spectrum.
These differences are partially explained by geographical, socio-demographic, and climate
factors, but the most important reason is the variation in teachers’ salary levels.

4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

63.     Relevance of objective and design are respectively high and substantial both pre and
post 2011 restructuring. Efficacy ratings are substantial pre and post restructuring. Finally,
the Efficiency rating is negligible pre and post restructuring. The combination of these
partial ratings yields an overall moderately satisfactory rating for both periods (Table 5). In
turn, the overall ratings for the two periods are weighted by the disbursement percentages
prior to and following the 2011 restructuring, yielding an overall weighted rating equivalent
to moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

       (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

64.     In dispersed rural areas, about 36% of the population was estimated to be poor and
vulnerable. Low educational attainment levels are strongly associated with poverty.19 The
rural education policy precipitated an important change in the sector by prioritizing rural
areas and adapting schools and programs to fit the context and necessities of a hitherto
marginalized population. At the same time, by improving learning conditions in rural
schools the Project substantially increased access and retention. Since an increase in
educational attainment reduces the likelihood of falling into poverty the contribution of the
project to poverty reduction could be significant but not measured.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

65.     The Project contributed to institutional changes consolidating accountability among
participating Provinces by: (i) implementing bilateral agreements between the federal
government and the Provinces; and (ii) strengthening capacity in the Provinces.

c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

  The invisible poor: A portrait of rural poverty in Argentina World Bank 2010.
The population in dispersed rural areas represents 8% of total population of Argentina and 62% of rural area population.
In dispersed rural areas, it is estimated that 36% of the population are poor according to the unsatisfied basic needs
methodology (UBN), 42.8 percent have not completed even primary education, and a mere 7.3 percent have completed
secondary school. And children are more at risk of not attending school: it is estimated that 5% of households have at least
one child who is not at school.

                                                            20
Rating: Moderate

66.     Overall, the risk that the increase in coverage and improvement in internal
efficiency, quality and governance might not be maintained is moderate. On one hand the
National Program for Rural Education is well established in a legal framework and in the
2012-2016 National Education Plan which defines priorities. In addition, all of the
instruments and inputs are in place to improve the learning processes in rural schools. On
the other hand, the Provinces remain highly dependent on the national Government for their
resources. Even if the financing of the expansion of rural enrollment accounted only for 0.2
percent of total expenditures in the early years of the Project and below 0.1% in the
subsequent years For instance, provincial budgets allocate insufficient funding for the
maintenance of educational infrastructure and for new school supplies and learning
materials. In the event of a budget crunch, priorities may easily shift to urban areas and to
secondary education where enrollment pressure is the strongest. In contrast, the rural
population is declining and the cost per student will probably remain high in rural schools.

67.     The following activities will be pursued with Government financing ensuring that
quality outcomes can be maintained : (i) the provision of school libraries and books for the
schools which have not benefited from the Project; (ii) the provision of didactic materials
and teaching equipment to the clusters; (iii) organization of trainings for the head of
secondary schools; (iv) school development plans at the secondary education level; (v)
infrastructure which was initially planned but not financed by the Project; (vi) meetings for
the primary school teachers (from rural schools with one teacher); and vii) a national plan
for improving teacher training.

68.     Most of the implementation arrangements of the Project will remain in the follow-
up operation ensuring that most of the governance outcomes will be maintained: (i) the
implementing agency will be the NME through the DGUFI and most of the staff presently
in charge of the Project will remain in their posts; (ii) the coordinating units in the
Provinces will remain; (iii) the bilateral agreements that will delineate responsibilities
between the national and the provincial Governments will be signed for five-year periods;
and (iii) within this framework, subsidiary agreements will specify the activities of the
follow-up operation, the monitoring indicators, and the targets to be reached.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

69.    The Bank’s preparation team worked in close partnership with the Borrower. The
Project was well prepared. Its design supported Government policy and creatively built
upon a decentralized approach with the provinces. Moderate shortcomings were: (i) the
lack of a robust results framework; and (ii) the underestimation of the delays in
implementing the bilateral agreements.


                                             21
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The Project was well supervised with regular field missions and in-depth supervisory
missions. Regular field visits were organized in the Provinces. The Bank provided support
when necessary, particularly on procurement issues. There were some moderate
shortcomings:

-     Monitoring and evaluation suffered a systemic lack of quality and timely information
      that was an issue throughout the education sector and was not corrected until the end
      of the Project;
-     The Project restructuring could have been performed sooner. In 2009 and 2010, it was
      confirmed that the Project would be unlikely to achieve its PDO by the 2011 closing
      date and the Government and the Bank agreed that a 24-month extension was
      necessary. However, it took 8 months after the midterm review for the request to arrive
      at the Bank (December 2010) and the restructuring was approved on 09/01/2011.
-     At restructuring, the Bank missed an opportunity to define the content of the impact
      evaluations that should have been carried out during the last year of implementation.
      As a result, no impact evaluation was performed in 2013.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

70.      Overall the Bank’s performance is considered moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

      (a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
71.    The Government provided its full support for the Project as evidenced by: (i) the
approval of the 2005 Law for Educational Financing (LEF) and its enactment in 2007 and
2006 National Education Law (Law 26.206) which recognized the rural education
modality; (ii) the Federal Council of Education’s 2010 approval of the document “Rural
Education within the National Education System” as part of resolution 128/10; (iii) the
annual signings of all the bilateral agreements and annual program covenants with the
provinces beginning in 2006; and (iv) counterpart funding (about 10% of total Project
financing) and resources to the Provinces for the rural education modality.

      (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

72.    The DGUFI exhibited strong ownership of the Project and commitment to the
achievement of its objectives. The DGUFI was staffed with highly qualified professionals
who demonstrated their experience in dealing with complex issues. Designing and
negotiating implementation plans and results with 23 autonomous provincial governments,

                                             22
some with low capacity, was extremely challenging. The Project had a slow start, but only
the activities initiated or procured at the provincial level were affected. When it was clear
that the provinces needed more support to implement the infrastructure program the DGUFI
took the appropriate actions to improve the processes, to reorganize itself, and to provide
more technical assistance to the provinces. The DGUFI made constant efforts to accelerate
implementation and complied with the Bank’s requirements diligently. There were
moderate shortcomings: the coordination between DGUFI and line departments of the
NME, mainly the DINIECE, could have been more efficient to develop monitoring tools
and impact evaluation.

73.     The performance of the Ministries at the provincial level was uneven: (i) in four
provinces the implementation of the Project was highly satisfactory; (ii) in nine provinces,
satisfactory; (iii) in seven provinces, moderately satisfactory; and (iv) in three provinces,
unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

74.      Since the Government performance is satisfactory and the implementing agencies
at national and provincial levels are moderately satisfactory the outcome rating applies.

Lessons Learned

   -   Embedding the Project into the national education policy is key to achieving results.
       Project design should be flexible enough to allow staying the course and not
       slowing down progress.
   -   Bi-lateral agreements provide the flexibility necessary to stimulate ownership, to
       adapt education policy to different contexts, and to promote innovations at the
       Provincial level. However, managing a national project in which implementation is
       decentralized in 23 Provinces remains a complex task. Ensuring smooth
       implementation requires not only significant technical assistance for the Provinces
       but also a monitoring instrument that can quickly diagnose the issues, trigger a rapid
       response, and increase accountability.
   -   Educational statistics are key for programming and annual monitoring. Dramatic
       improvements to the monitoring and evaluation system have begun through the
       Project financed improvement of the Federal Education Information Network. The
       next step is to induce practices and behaviors conducive to quality improvement.
       Common standards should also be introduced and annual testing systems should be
       used to measure learning outcomes and progress in the achievement of the Core
       Learning Priorities, particularly at the end of primary school.

   i)         Providing basic didactic materials and teaching equipment

All rural schools received a standard package of didactic materials and teaching equipment
according to their level and the size. The Directorate of the rural education modality in the
Federal Ministry of Education in coordination with Directorates of each educational level
selected and developed all of the didactic materials. Meetings were organized in the
Provinces with teachers and school directors to adapt the materials, equipment, textbook
contents, and book lists to their needs.

Procurement was centralized at the national level except for the small individual school
supplies procured locally. The distribution was carried out by the Provinces according to
the Operation Manual.

Selections of sets of didactic materials were made in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011 and
distributed every year from 2008 to 2013.

The survey performed among 2,687 teachers participating in national meetings in August
and September 2013 showed that: (i) about 50% received trainings; (ii) they valued that the
didactic material and teaching equipment were specifically designed for rural education;
(iii) they found the materials and equipment particularly useful; (iv) 25% used them every
day; and (v) 20% were worried about the possible deterioration or loss of books and
materials.

   i)      Providing minimum school infrastructure standards for all schools in rural
           areas

   This activity financed: (i) the expansion of existing schools to absorb additional
   enrollment; (ii) the replacement or rehabilitation of dilapidated schools; (iii)
   infrastructure for the provision of drinking water, electricity, and sanitation. Initially,
   the project planned to allocate funding of this activity based on two criteria: the
   unsatisfied basic needs methodology (NBI, Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas) and the
   education challenges. This methodology was abandoned because the Provinces’ needs
   were not homogeneous enough to allow prioritization. Instead, basic standards for
   school facilities were established and a survey of school rehabilitation and construction
   needs was performed by DINIECE in 2006. The total cost was estimated at
   AR$831,770,762 (of which AR$141,835,980 was for replacement and the rest was for
   rehabilitation).

   The program’s implementation was slow. The main reasons were the following: (i)
   many provinces were not able to determine their priorities because of a lack of planning
   capacity and construction specialists; (ii) inconsistencies in the documentation sent to
   the MECyT and a lack of interaction between the provincial staff and the construction
   inspectors; (iii) procurement difficulties at the provincial level (particularly in Santiago
   del Estero, Jujuy, Chubut, Rio Negro, and Santa Fe); (iv) delays between the transfer of
   funds and the signing of the construction contracts; and (v) difficulties with the
   construction processes. In 2008, various measures were put in place which facilitated
   and accelerated the implementation of the program: (i) the improvement of the
   coordination between the Directorate General for Infrastructure and the Provinces; (ii)
   the reorganization of the processes at the national level; and (iii) the organization of
   meetings and training sessions at the provincial level.

   The program initially planned was executed in all the Provinces except for Santiago del
   Estero and Jujuy where it was downsized. In total, 473 school infrastructure projects in
   rural areas (for a total cost of AR$296,968,482) were financed by the Project and 81
   (for a total cost of AR$84,969,404) by the Government.

The average cost for new construction was AR$ 6,121 per square meter (about US$ 1,000),
with rehabilitation costing 60% of this amount per square meter. The construction cost
varied depending of the location: AR$ 8,000 in Patagonia, AR$ 7,500 in Cuyo and
AR$ 6,000 to 6,200 in the NOA and NEA regions. Before approving a project’s technical
documents, the DGI (General Directorate for Infrastructure) compared the cost per square
meter for the project to the average cost per square meter for projects in the same

geographical region, taking into account all sources of funding. Any costs 10% or more
above the average had to be justified and were subject to the DGI’s authorization. Thus, the
cost efficiency of the construction program was ensured by the initial control over the price
of the pre-awarded works.

     iii)     Supplying technological tools to permit schools and students to receive
              distance education through TV channels.

              This activity was not implemented.

     iv)      Developing actions to increase awareness of cultural diversity as well as
              knowledge of the traditional language and culture of the indigenous
              population.
The component dedicated to indigenous education started slowly due to technical
difficulties locating the indigenous population and identifying their needs. This component
commenced in earnest with: (i) the 2007 creation of the Autonomous Education Council for
Indigenous Groups (CEAPI, Consejo Educativo Autónomo de Pueblos Indígenas); (ii) the
Federal Council of Education’s decision 119/10 (September 2010) which defined the policy
guidelines for the Bilingual and intercultural education modality; (iii) the study about the
sociolinguistic situation of the bilingual schools (December 2010); and (iv) the first
mapping exercise including the linguistic and cultural situation of 15,314 rural schools
undertaken during the period from 2005-2009.20

The Project’s main achievements are: (i) a specific and more detailed census and
description of the intercultural and bilingual education system in 499 schools with
indigenous children in 14 Provinces in 2011 and 2012 (the census showed an indigenous
population of 237 at the preschool level, 313 at the primary level, and 172 at the secondary
level); (ii) the implementation, mostly in 2012, of 146 school development plans (10 in
preschool, 102 in primary education, 16 in secondary, and 18 combining all levels); (iii) 17
trainings organized for 1,260 teachers from 526 schools organized in 13 provinces; (iv) the
organization of five regional roundtable discussions in 2010 to increase awareness of

   In 2005, the mapping exercise included 1,200 schools with indigenous enrollment, 5,391 in 2006, 2,570 in 2007, 4,076
in 2008, and 3,700 in 2009.

cultural diversity and knowledge of the traditional language, while also debating and
formulating education policies for the indigenous population; and (v) an inventory of
didactic materials specifically for the indigenous population.

The implementation of the intercultural and bilingual policy demonstrated mixed results in
the provinces depending on their management capacity and the way in which it was
integrated into their legal framework and procedures. No systematic evaluation was
performed, but the best results were observed in the Northeast and Northwest regions where
the indigenous population is the highest.

Sub component A2: Expanding coverage and improving student promotion flow

     i)        Expanding coverage of preschool education

The provinces chose among different alternatives to expand coverage: multi-age classrooms,
independent kindergartens, traveling teachers, teachers with dual certification, and
attending children in their homes, among others. The decision regarding which of these
models to use was the result of an analysis of the local situation. Thus, no universal
solution was implemented.

6,137 preschool teachers were trained on working with books in multi-age classrooms and
the use of games in teaching. The training was divided into monthly 8-hour training
sessions and on-site classroom sessions for practice.21 Two teaching guides (one to improve
reading in multi-age classrooms and the other on using games in the learning process),
created by the Preschool department at the national level were distributed to all preschool
teachers.

     ii)       Reducing repetition in EGB1 (Primary education)

     a) Training on teaching methods in multi-grade schools and to improve reading and
        writing

Primary school teacher training focused on: (i) reading and writing in multi-grade
classrooms in grades 1 to 3; and (ii) "learning to learn” with books in grades 4 to 6. This
training was specifically designed (i) to improve the learning process in multi-grade
classrooms; and (ii) to support isolated teachers. The training was divided into monthly 8-
hour sessions. The training included an analysis and self-assessment of teaching practices.
Meetings were organized at provincial level and in the clusters. Support materials for


21
   The training in preschool, primary, and secondary education followed the same system: (i) an initial meeting was
organized in the province to present the modalities, the curriculum proposal, the didactic materials, and the teaching
equipment; (ii) classroom practice sessions as a first step to analyze the materials and use the teaching guides to
experiment with students; (iii) a meeting organized in the clusters to exchange experiences and discuss teaching practices;
(iv) classroom practice to adapt teaching methods and the use of didactic materials to the school’s and students’ needs;
(v) further classroom practice and analysis of the improvements made; and (vi) a final meeting of the participants in the
province to analyze their experiences and discuss working in multi-grade schools and addressing issues with the teachers.
The training’s duration was 40 hours.

teachers were developed by the Area Plan Reading division in the national Ministry of
Education. 11,940 primary school teachers were trained.

     b) Advanced specialization diploma in rural education (Postítulo)

A new advanced specialization diploma in rural education was organized at the national
level. It consisted of a 400-hour training program organized at 47 teacher training
institutions in 20 Provinces. The national team first created the curriculum and teaching
materials (one on Literacy and one on multi-grade education in rural contexts) and then
conducted a training of trainers with 256 professors and 191 supervisors who were in
charge of training teachers.

Some 6,043 teachers (about 13 percent of the 47,133 teaching staff in the 11,637 rural
schools) enrolled, of which 2,735 graduated. The evaluation performed in 2011 showed that
participants highly valued the training program 22 : (i) 95 percent of the teachers who
graduated stated that they received didactic tools for teaching in multi-grade classrooms;
(ii) 82.7 percent learned time, space, and resource management techniques; (iii) 51.9
percent received tools to help them work more independently; and (iv) 49.4 percent
upgraded their knowledge of core subjects. However, since there was no assessment of the
training’s impact on the learning process in the classroom, it is not possible to determine
how the training impacted education quality. The postítulo model restricted teacher
participation due to: i) the high time commitment on their part, which filtered out less-
motivated teachers; ii) the very high trainer to teacher ratio, limiting the available spaces in
the program; and iii) generalized teaching methods that were not specific enough to
pedagogical models like Horizontes.

     iii)     Increasing attainment in EGB2 (Primary education grades 4 to7)

The actions designed to accelerate the transition of students from grades 4 to 7 were
implemented universally in urban and rural schools. The measures consisted of teacher
training, distributing teaching guides, and disseminating instructions. Although these
measures were not financed by the Project, their impacts on promotion rates were
significant and the gap between rural and urban schools decreased significantly. In general,
most of the actions directed at improving learning conditions described in the previous
paragraphs had an impact on educational attainment in EGB2.

     iv)      Expanding schooling to EGB3 (secondary education grades 7 or 8 to 9)

The Horizontes program was an important step toward introducing lower secondary
education (expansion of the previous seven-year primary school system to nine years) in
rural primary schools. With the promulgation of the 2006 National Education Law (Law
26.206), provinces could choose between different sets of modalities to expand schooling to

EGB3 in rural areas. Differences focused on school enrollment, the presence of permanent
or traveling secondary education teachers, and the availability of connectivity. In order to
define the implementation modalities, the national team worked closely with curriculum
teams, supervisors, and teachers at the provincial level.

The Project contributed to: (i) the recruitment of specialists (writers and editors) for the
preparation of didactic materials (textbooks and teaching guides for Horizontes and a set of
TV programs); (ii) production of the materials (printed for students and teachers and DVD
format for TV shows produced in coordination with the Canal Encuentro); (iii) distribution
of these materials to 6,168 schools; (iv) teacher trainings focused on activities aimed at
knowledge sharing and alternative uses of specially developed materials such as printed
guides, TV programs for students, institutional libraries, and teaching equipment (via 8-
hour training sessions organized by clusters or through traveling teachers); and (v) technical
assistance provided to 1,677 schools by technical provincial teams collaborating with the
national Directorate of Educational Management.

Still, the program was implemented unevenly, with some provinces adopting the approach,
while others were more resistant to the changes in methodology. Provinces that did
implement the program were able to expand coverage at the lower secondary level quite
significantly, despite facing operational challenges such as insufficient numbers of
specialized teachers assigned to rural schools, difficulty among technical teams and
teachers to internalize and implement the pedagogical principles and concepts, weak
linkages between the primary and secondary education levels that limited the possibilities
for synergies and efficiencies in the use of resources as well as other missed opportunities,
and inadequate technical assistance to the schools. In some provinces, implementation was
hampered by the inconsistency presented by transplanting the predominant vision of urban
secondary education to rural areas.

Special education

In special education, 2,893 teachers from 341 schools were trained to use the equipment
and didactic materials provided to the schools. The training was organized according to
clusters in the nine participating provinces.

Creating School Development Plans in rural schools

The school development plans were implemented in 16 provinces (out of 23). There were
1,072 school development plans (May 2012). Each school project received AR$ 4000 in
funding. This activity was initiated at the end of 2009. This start-up delay was caused by
changes to the schools that were initially selected and the appointment of staff to manage
the activities in the provinces.

The school development plans were targeted to multi-grade schools with low enrollment.
Each province carried out a selection process that was checked at the national level. Some
informal interviews conducted during school visits highlighted that it was necessary: (i) to
increase the involvement of the communities to determine the main issues for intervention;
(ii) to strengthen the connection with the curriculum; (iii) to provide more support to the
teachers to enable them to maximize their potential to improve results; and (iv) to improve
the integration of the school development plans school-level time management. There is no
evidence that the funding of the school development plans will be maintained.

Sub component A3: Strengthening line departments at the provincial level

   i)      Strengthening line departments at the provincial level in the areas of
           planning/information management, pedagogy, administration, and
           monitoring

The Project funded an average of 203 positions over seven years to strengthen the capacity
in the Provinces. This number varied each year according to the Project’s implementation
needs, with a peak of 262 positions in 2011. The distribution among provinces varied
greatly according to their needs and the size of the program to be implemented. The main
functions funded were: (i) project coordinator; (ii) programming; (iii) administration and
finance; (iv) infrastructure; (v) accounting; (vi) pedagogy; (vii) procurement; (viii)
monitoring and evaluation; and (ix) bilingual education. Many of these positions will be
maintained with PROMER II.

Provincial jurisdictions were characterized by administrative diversity and complexity in
terms of using Project funds for implementation. As a result, the Project had to fund
technical assistance to make the necessary adjustments. Coordinators, financial specialists,
procurement specialists, and infrastructure specialists were invited to participate in training
sessions and in meetings to promote horizontal cooperation and the sharing of experiences.

To simplify the work of the provincial administrations and increase accountability some
adjustments were made to the Operating Manual after the mid-term review. The changes
were related to accounting policies, recordkeeping, and other issues related to procurement.
The changes related to procurement processes were adopted by the DGUFI for all
internationally funded projects.

During execution, the project improved the use of the UEPEX system as a management
tool both at the central and provincial levels.

                                                14
The Project has been continuously audited by various agencies including: (i) the Auditor
General’s office annually for financial compliance and once (for the period 23/10/2006 to
31/12/2011) for management compliance; (ii) the Office of the Comptroller General
through the Court of Auditors in the participating provinces under the Federal Public
Network Control (annually); and (iii) annually by the internal Audit Unit of the Ministry of
Education for both financial and accounting compliance. All observations and
recommendations resulting from these audits were examined with the provinces in regional
and national meetings. This process has ensured that the information has been systematized
and integrated, increasing the probability that the lessons learned and corrective actions will
be implemented.

   ii)      Developing a provincial plan of rural education in each province

All the activities dedicated to develop rural education in the provinces were integrated in a
single national plan (PNEOyFD)

8.       Component B: Enhancing the stewardship capacity of national Government (US$5.35
million incl.US$4.83 million Bank financing) 3.37% of the total credit

Sub component B1: Strengthening line departments at the national level

This component funded positions in the DGUFI to coordinate Project activities. In 2009,
the Project Coordinating Unit was reorganized, adopting a matrix scheme in which
functions were defined in terms of areas -- Financial Management, Assistance to the
Provinces, and Technical and Monitoring – and subordinated to the Project Coordinator.
The Assistance to the Provinces department was organized in regional teams with each
team consisting of a generalist, a financial specialist, and a procurement specialist. This
reorganization contributed to the improvement of the planning, monitoring, and technical
assistance to the provinces. The provinces’ administrations became more responsive
partners on all management issues and worked toward common goals.

Sub component B2: Supporting the development and implementation of a system of data
collection, analysis, dissemination, and use of information for policy decisions at the national
level.

(i)     Surveys and impact evaluation studies of rural and technical schools

The DINIECE conducted a survey of the operating conditions of rural schools. The purpose
of the survey was to conduct a census of rural schools with one or two teachers that were
isolated and located in remote areas or that were difficult to access. Specific procedures
and methodologies for data collection, processing, analysis, and reporting were used.
The Project financed nine studies for DINIECE related to specific aspects of rural
education:
- A policy study on organizing the school degree programs in the second cycle of the
primary education level in Mendoza province (2008)
- A training proposal in multi-grade rural schools in the province of Santiago del Estero
(2008)
- Improvements in educational conditions in rural areas: teaching processes that include the
use of students’ native language for literacy in Spanish in the province of Corrientes (2009)
- The implementation of a proposal to organize the supply of Basic Secondary Education in
rural areas: provincial management and institutional aspects in the province of Misiones
(2009)
- Possibility of organizing multi-age classrooms in Entre Rios to expand preschool
coverage in rural areas (2010)
- Description of intercultural and bilingual education in rural areas (2010)
- From training to teaching in multi-grade classrooms in rural Education in the province of
Santiago del Estero (2011)
- Secondary schools in rural areas and clusters as strategy for sustaining the educational
trajectories of rural students in the province of Misiones (2012)
- Multi-age classrooms in rural areas: Tensions and transformations in educational practices
with the distribution of games for learning in the province of Tucumán (2012)

The DINIECE progressively instituted a modern and efficient Federal Education
Information Network through several steps: (i) the system was designed in 2006; (ii) the
equipment procurement plan was drawn up in 2007; (iii) in 2010, the PCs, servers, printers
were allocated to the to the provinces and development of the software, including the

                                              16
template for the school survey and data collection, analysis, and comparison was
completed; (iv) in 2011, the province of Cordoba piloted a system to collect data directly
from schools through the web; (v) in 2012 the system was expanded to other provinces;
(vi) in 2013, 20 provinces collected data directly from the schools and the web-based
queries of the Federal Education Information Network were fully operational.

The difficulties encountered included: (i) Subcomponent B2 in support of the development
of a data collection, analysis, and dissemination system and to provide technical assistance
to the provinces started very slowly (the 06/21/2009 ISR could not find evidence of
substantive activities in component B); (ii) it was technically complex to collect, validate,
and standardize data from 23 provinces, some of whose education systems are structured
differently; (iii) there were four leadership changes at the DINIECE between 2005 and
2009; and (iv) the Federal Education Information Network was an ambitious project
because it allowed schools to load their data directly into the system via the Web.

(ii)    The expansion of a sample of standardized national student assessments (Operativo
        Nacional de Evaluación ONE) to ensure adequate representation of rural schools.

The Federal Council of Education resolution No.116/10, states that the National
Operational Evaluation (ONE), which evaluates learners’ cognitive performance, should be
carried out every three years. As a result, the DINIECE conducted the ONE with rural
representation in 2007, 2010, and 2013.

At the primary education level student learning in different knowledge areas (mathematics,
social studies, science, and language) is evaluated in 3rd and 6th grade. The students’
results are measured on a scale with three values: low, medium, and high. The cognitive
and expected capabilities are evaluated according to the curriculum and Priority Learning
Areas (NAPs). Each test consists of 30 questions. A probability sample representative of
the provincial and national level was applied. It is a complex sample that is stratified
according to the public and private, urban and rural systems and clustered according to the
size of the schools. The results of the ONE for primary education are communicated by
provinces to each of the provincial administrations, and they are disseminated to the public
by regions.

In secondary education, the ONE is conducted during the last year in all secondary schools.
The results of the ONE for secondary schools are shared with each school.

The 2013 ONE for primary education was carried out in November, while the secondary
education ONE took place in August. The results of the latter will be available in the first
semester of 2014, while the results of the primary education ONE will be available later.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The economic and financial analysis of the Rural Education Improvement Project
(PROMER) is divided in two sections: (i) an analysis of the fiscal impact of the Project
including its contribution to key results achieved by the rural education sector and
comparing the fiscal performance of the Project to what was initially forecasted in the
PAD; and (ii) a cost analysis of the education system, that takes into account each province
as well as the characteristics of the rural education system. However, it was not possible to
measure the efficiency gains in rural areas or to do a cost benefit analysis of Project
interventions because the Provincial education budgets do not distinguish between
education in rural areas and total education expenditure.

I) Fiscal impact of the project

In order to analyze the project’s fiscal impact, it should first be noted that expenditure by
the National Education Ministry (MEN) (excluding tertiary education) and by provinces on
education, measured in United States dollars, increased substantially between 2006 and
2013, averaging a 15 percent increase at the national level and 19 percent in the provinces
each year during this period (Table 1). The measurement of the trends in dollars was used
as a proxy indicator for the net real changes of the impact of price increases.

The fiscal adjustment underway in the country coupled with the devaluation of the peso in
early 2014 suggest a roughly 20 percent reduction in expenditure on education at the
national and provincial levels in FY 2014, and a rebound in 2015 with a year-on-year
increase of 6 percent in both cases.

During the entire period, expenditure on education in the provinces increased beyond that
spent at the national level, accounting for 89.9 percent of total expenditure in the country
(excluding universities) in 2006, and 92.1 percent during the remaining years. The
expansion of rural enrollment in the provincial education system required widely varying
increases in resources, accounting for 0.2 percent of total expenditure in provinces in the
early years and below 0.1 percent in the subsequent years.

Increased expenditure was accompanied by an expansion in the supply of services, as
evidenced by the increase in the number of teaching positions and secciones during the
period under review. Chart 1 shows that the share of teaching positions in rural areas
increased steadily relative to the national total in five of the seven years between 2005 and
2012, starting with a proportion equivalent to 17.1 percent of the total number of positions
in the first year reviewed and reaching 18.7 percent at the end of the period under review.

When these increases are analyzed by level of education (see Chart 2), there is a higher
percentage over the period at the primary level (an increase from 20.6 percent of teaching
positions in rural areas in 2005 to 22 percent in 2012), followed by the early childhood and
kindergarten level (15 percent of the teaching positions at this level were in rural areas in
2012), and, lastly, at the secondary level, which, despite still accounting for a share of rural
teaching positions relative to the entire country that is lower than at all other levels of
education (14.1 percent during the last year reviewed), had the highest relative percentage
increase in the period under review (the percentage for this education level was 10.8
percent in 2006).

The number of secciones at each level increased in tandem with the number of teaching
positions in rural areas, climbing from 6,863 to 8,549 at the early childhood level (an
increase of 24.6 percent) between 2007 and 2012, while there was a 16.6 percent increase at
the primary level (29,788 in 2007 to 34,730 in 2012). The relative increase at the secondary
level was substantially higher, with a 38.3 percent increase in the number of secciones
during the period (11,082 in 2007 to 15,330 in 2012). The number of secciones and rural
teaching positions increased significantly, attaining a level of relative stability in the last
few years, thus obviating the need to project short-term growth trends, except for a small
group of provinces that continue to address the challenge of expanding rural secondary
education.

The increase in supply can be analyzed in conjunction with a number of key results
achieved by the rural education sector in the last few years. The following succinct
conclusions can be drawn from the data summarized in Table 2. It is necessary to keep in
mind that in all cases these are national averages that include high variability among
provinces that constitute a very heterogeneous territory.

   -    Education coverage gaps at the early childhood education level fell significantly
        (73.6 percent), and in 2012, 4,191 five-year-old children had no access to schools
        (15,861 in 2004).

   -    Promotion rates in rural primary schools increased from 85.3 percent in 91.3 percent
        on average over the six years between 2004 and 2012. As is often the case, this rate
        is lower in the first year of primary school (85.5 percent in 2012). However, in this
        case, it accounts for a higher percentage increase with respect to the 2004
        benchmark, (the promotion rate for Grade 1 students was 77.3 percent in 2004).



                                                           4
   -   The rate for students who are over-age by two or more years in the second cycle of
       primary education in rural areas declined substantially from 21.2 percent in 2004 to
       17 percent in 2012, thus contributing to lower dropout rates.

   -   The rate of transition to basic secondary school in rural areas increased at an uneven
       pace during the period under review. Between the first and second years of this
       level (Grades 7 and 8 of general basic education), the promotion rate increased by 8
       percent from 77.8 percent in 2004 to 84 percent in 2012, while between completion
       of primary school and the first year of secondary school, the transition rate
       fluctuated more and remained relatively stable at around 90 percent, without any
       obvious increases. In any case, there was a marked increase in the number of
       students enrolled in basic secondary school, from 170,520 students in 2004 to
       198,629 students in 2012 (16.5 percent of the increase occurred during the period
       under review).

Ideally, this examination should be supplemented with an analysis of the trends relating to
learning outcomes in language and mathematics. However, available information (the 2010
and 2013 Standardized National Assessment Tests – ONE) can be compared only at the
aggregate level as it is not possible to make a distinction between the corresponding
situation in rural areas.

In the framework provided, PROMER’s fiscal performance (Chart 3) accounted for 1.5
percent of national expenditure on education on average during the period under review,
with a maximum of 2.62 percent in 2010 and a minimum of 0.12 percent in 2006, the first
year of project implementation. The resulting fiscal impact measured by this indicator is
significantly lower than the estimate in the PAD (4.6 percent on average, with varying rates
that peaked above 8 percent), chiefly because expenditure on education by Argentina’s
Ministry of Education increased at a faster pace than planned, owing to the provisions set
forth in the Education Financing Law (LFE) passed in late 2005. Among other things, this
law made provisions for an increase in the share of public expenditure on education in GDP
(during a period of sustained GDP growth), with a 40 percent contribution from the central
government.

As a result, allocations to the project continued during its implementation at the same time
that the central government and the provinces increased educational resources at an
unprecedented rate. The breakdown of PROMER’s expenditure (Chart 4) shows that the
share of allocations started increasing from the third year of implementation, reaching a
maximum equivalent to 80 percent of project expenditure in 2012 and 2013. These capital
investments, especially in infrastructure, helped bridge coverage gaps as previously
mentioned, and meet the needs required by the system to address sector demands in the
short and medium term, at least with respect to early childhood and primary education.

Consistent with the initial cost plan, recurring expenditures were higher during the first
year of project implementation (accounting for close to 80 percent of total project
expenditure), and then fell to close to 20 percent, until 2014 when they began to rise
again as project investment levels decreased. Expenditure on goods and services declined
as well from the start of project implementation until 2014, when its share relative to the
total also increased. From this perspective, it can also be stated that the facilities and
infrastructure in place demonstrate a sustainable level of resources for the system in the
rural areas in the coming years, primarily with respect to early childhood and primary
education.

II) Cost analysis of the education system

In order to carry out a cost analysis of the education system, that takes into account each
province as well as the characteristics of the rural education system, it is important to
begin by identifying how transfers from the central government are allocated to
educational institutions and then examine a breakdown of the related expenditure within
the education system. Such an analysis is not confined to, but includes the rural sector,
since under Argentina’s federalist system; the provinces are responsible for providing
pre-university education at all levels and in all areas.

Throughout the period under review, there was a significant increase in central
government transfers to the education sector in the provinces. The vast majority of these
transfers were effected on the basis of bilateral agreements between the central
government and each school district, and included objectives and monitoring indicators.
Table 3 shows that when measured in real terms and using United States dollar equivalent
values, as mentioned above, government transfers more than tripled between 2005 and
2012.

An analysis of the breakdown of central government transfers (Chart 5) reveals that over
the period, there was a relative reduction in allocations for the payment of teachers’
salaries and a corresponding increase in the line items related to infrastructure and
equipment. Salaries and infrastructure account for 85 percent of central government
transfers to the education sector, while the remaining 15 percent is used to fund study
grants, school textbooks, teacher training activities and other projects carried out by the
educational institutions themselves.

While central government allocations are made to the education sector as a whole, thus
making it impossible to determine the share assigned to the rural area, the aforementioned
change in the structure of allocations is consistent with the increased coverage and
improvement in the educational levels and outcomes, as previously indicated. Ideally, one
should be able to link these trends to the targets and indicators incorporated in the inter-
governmental bilateral agreements alluded to above, in order to identify the link between
funding and the improved performance of the education sector.

Percentage Share




        Source: Compilation based on data extracted from Table 3


An analysis of expenditure by the provinces points to significant differences in the uses
of resources among the various provinces. As shown in Chart 6, some school districts
disburse more than 90 percent of their allocations to defray staffing costs (La Rioja, Jujuy
and Tierra del Fuego), while in others with a more flexible budgetary structure, (City of
Buenos Aires and San Luis), salaries account for less than 70 percent of total expenditure
on education.

Central government transfers to fund private education account for the second largest line
item in educational expenditure in the provinces. In some cases, more than 20 percent of
total expenditure is devoted to private education, while outlays for capital goods
represent an average of 1.9 percent of the total and are only marginally significant in
almost all school districts.

There are also great variations in teachers’ salaries among the provinces. Table 4 shows
that disparities existing between urban and rural areas and that the relationship between
these two sectors is not the same in all provinces. For example, in some provinces, the
gross salary of a grade school teacher with 10 years’ experience working in a rural area
may be double that of a teacher at the same level in the urban area. In other provinces, on
the other hand, the difference may only be around 10 percent or 20 percent. These
disparities in salary levels may arise as a result of salary disputes, demographic
considerations or differences in costs of living among the various school districts.
Specifically in the rural area, the differences may be attributable to difficulties in filling
positions in remote areas, owing to a shortage of teachers with the necessary
qualifications. These shortages are most pronounced among middle school teachers.

On the basis of available data, one can analyze the expenditure per student within the
education system. Table 5 provides data relating to public schools for the period 2005-
2012. It can be observed that over that period, the unit expenditure expressed in dollars
increased steadily at an average year-on-year rate of 21 percent. This suggests that over
the seven years under review, there was a cumulative increase of 270.5 percent for the
national average. The most significant increase (382.3 percent) occurred in Misiones
Province, while the lowest (138.9 percent) was in the Province of San Luis.

The level of expenditure per student varies greatly from one school district to the next. In
2012, the province with the highest level of expenditure per student (Tierra del Fuego)
disbursed more than five times that of the province at the other end of the scale (See
Chart 7). As mentioned above, these differences may be partially explained by
geographical, socio-demographic, climatological, and other factors. However, the most
important reason for the differences is the variation in teachers’ salary levels.

Lastly, on the basis of a review of information supplied by the Cost Monitoring Units
(UOCs) of the various school districts, there are four scenarios on which one may base an
analysis of education labor costs in the different sectors (urban, rural settlements, and
remote or sparsely populated rural areas). It must be noted that while this examination is
not necessarily representative of the entire country, it is nevertheless an important step
forward in analyzing the rural educational sector.

Based on the data derived from Table 6, one may calculate the cost per educational
institution and per student, as well as analyze the differences in the average levels of
early childhood, primary, and secondary education between urban and rural areas. In the
cases under review, the additional cost for rural settlements vis-a-vis urban areas was 2.7
percent, 8.7 percent, 15.2 percent, and 18.6 percent. An analysis of sparsely populated or
remote rural areas reveals even greater divergences, of up to 12.9 percent, 45.5 percent,
34.8 percent, and 144.3 percent over and above the cost for urban areas. The wide
disparity in the data makes it difficult to draw conclusions that may be applied to the rest
of the country. Furthermore, the data represent averages that include performance
indicators associated with the different levels in the education system.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

As per the letter received on June 9th, 2014, the General Director of the International
Financing Unit of the Ministry of Education, on behalf on the Borrower, agrees with the
contents and ratings described in this Implementation Completion Report. DINIECE also
provided comments and informed that the institution considers that all the actions agreed
during meetings with the Bank Team were adequately taken, including provision of
quality information in a timely manner.

Introduction

The Development Objectives of the Argentina Rural Education Improvement Project
(PROMER)—Loan 7353-AR—are to support national Government policy to (i) improve
the coverage, efficiency, and quality of the Argentine education system; and (ii) improve
the governance of the Argentine education system through strengthening of the normative,
planning, information, monitoring, and evaluation capacity at the national and provincial
levels.

With regard to project implementation, passage in 2006 of National Education Law No.
26.206, which established the rural education system and extended compulsory schooling
to the preschool and secondary levels, has been the most substantive modification. In
particular:

   -       Article 17 of the National Education Law establishes that Rural Education is
           one of the modalities of the National Education System.
   -       Article 49 of the National Education Law establishes that Rural Education is
           the modality aimed at ensuring achievement of compulsory schooling through
           methods adapted to the needs and specificities of the population living in rural
           areas.
   -       Article 51 of the National Education Law establishes that the national
           Ministry of Education, together with the Federal Education Council, is
           responsible for defining the necessary measures to ensure that educational
           services in rural areas are of an equivalent quality to those in urban areas.

In this way, comprehensive attention to the specific needs and possibilities (potential) of
the population living in rural areas was promoted, for all schools at all levels located in
rural areas.

Implementation of the components of PROMER

   1. Component A: Improving Quality and Coverage of Rural Education.

   1.1. Subcomponent A.1: Improving Operating Conditions of Rural Schools

Provision of basic didactic materials and teaching equipment:

                                            1
All schools received basic didactic resources, reference materials, and teaching
equipment. Development of this activity focused on the provision of (a) textbooks; (b)
multimedia, computer, and furniture packages; (c) play areas; (d) laboratories; (e)
reagents and other inputs; (f) microscopes and accessories; (g) printing of curriculum
development materials for teachers and students; and (h) school supply kits (done in a
decentralized manner). The regulations/criteria for purchase and distribution included in
the Operating Manual were the same for all provinces.

Provincial meetings on the activities were conducted with directors and teachers, and
schools were visited. On these occasions it was possible to observe the specifics relating
to implementation of the components. In the case of local projects, there was a greater
and more systematic presence over the last two years with a view to completion of a
publication. At the First National Meeting of Professors of Single-Teacher Schools
[Primer Encuentro Nacional de Maestros de Escuelas Unidocentes] (held in August and
September of this year), direct contact was made with professors and the particular
situation in these schools was the topic of analysis.

For the selection, development, and production of didactic materials, the Coordinating
Unit for the Rural Education modality took into account the “Core Learning Priorities”
[Núcleos de Aprendizaje Prioritarios NAP], which form the framework for decisions on
provincial curricula and the different departments under the ministry. Once material was
prepared on the modality, it was submitted to the “Curriculum Areas” teams for analysis.
In addition, it was also submitted to the directorates of each level and in the instances
where it was deemed necessary, decisions were jointly made. This joint work included all
the stages of designing the materials and critical analysis of the output.

Minimum Standards for Schools

The expansion, replacement, and rehabilitation of school buildings were financed with
the aim of improving the condition of the existing school infrastructure. At the beginning
of project implementation, priority was established as follows: (i) provision of basic
services (potable water, electricity, and heating); (ii) improvement of the infrastructure of
schools in particularly dilapidated condition; (iii) expansion of existing buildings; and
(iv) construction of new schools (when restoration would not have been feasible).

The General Directorate for Infrastructure [Dirección General de Infraestructura DGI]
was responsible for defining and disseminating the standards for implementation of the
actions relating to infrastructure. In this context, it reviewed and approved the technical
documentation prepared by the provinces in accordance with the criteria, regulations, and
procedures established in the Operating Manual. In addition, the DGI gave its no-
objection to the work certificates prior to payment and conducted monitoring and ad hoc
supervision of the progress of the work, requesting of its counterpart units in the
provinces fulfillment of the administrative, technical, legal, and financial requirements.
Distribution of the funds for the investment in infrastructure was not completed by quotas



                                             2
because there was insufficient effective demand for works by the provinces in order to
apply this approach.

The delay in implementation was due to various reasons, among which the following
should be mentioned: (i) delays in decision making, in some cases stemming from the
changes in management; (ii) difficulties identifying a shortlist of three competitive
candidates in the provinces and selecting suitable technical personnel; (iii) challenges
with project preparation; (iv) delays in the qualification process in the provinces
regarding those invited to bid; (v) a scarcity of bidders owing to problems accessing the
works or dealing with smaller contracts, with complex procedures, which are less
appealing to businesses; and (vi) prioritization by the provinces of other lines of
financing, whether because they correspond to programs with an approaching due date or
because their implementation would be easier.

With respect to corrective measures, normative and organizational adjustments were
made to improve program performance. In this regard, there was skills redistribution
within the technical teams from the General Directorate of Infrastructure, as a result of
which the professional capacity to review PROMER projects was increased four-fold. In
addition, a new organizational model of linkages was established (outward and inward),
introducing a matrix-based operating scheme through which the assignment of tasks to
the professional project reviewers was based on the school district supported and not the
project framework program. This change significantly accelerated internationally
financed programs, harmonized the technical evaluation criteria, promoted greater
interaction among all the members of the DGI team, and facilitated exchanges with the
provinces whenever there was a professional counterpart in this ministry for all the
financing operations. Regarding the priority established at the beginning of project
implementation for execution of this activity, however, it was decided in 2009 that the
“comprehensive participation” criterion would be incorporated. In this context,
procedures were made more flexible with the aim of reducing the processing time, better
monitoring the work in the provinces, increasing opportunities for provincial technical
teams to work in the DGI and thus make the necessary corrections to more quickly obtain
the “technical skills.”

School Clusters

In the last update of PROMER beneficiaries, done in July 2011, there were 1,687 school
clusters, with an average of 10.1 CUE/Anexos 23 per cluster. Among the beneficiary
schools, it was found that 7,261 were at the preschool level, 11,938 at the primary level,
and 5,264 at the basic secondary cycle (CBS) level. If we take into account the
CUE/Anexos from the State sector in rural areas, along with kindergarten and/or common



23
   All educational institutions in Argentina are assigned a Clave Unica de
Establecimientos y Anexos (CUE/ANEXOS), a nine-digit unique identifying number
issued by the Ministry of Education.


                                            3
primary and/or secondary education up to September 2013, we see that 93 percent are
included in the July 2011 clusters.

The effective functioning of the clusters takes place in relation to specific actions. There
are as yet no benefits noted with respect to the structure of these clusters. In this regard,
work continues with the provinces to create an effective network structure based on an
initial formal definition. With respect to the technical, financial, and institutional
sustainability of the clusters as a management unit to execute the rural dimension policy
in the provinces, it can be mentioned that technical sustainability is the most advanced, as
the clusters have been taken into account for decision making. In November 2013,
resources from the National Treasury were transferred to all single-teacher schools to
complete activities by cluster.

Distance education

No distance education projects or programs were implemented.

Indigenous education

One of the objectives of National Education Law No. 26.206 is the integration of
intercultural and bilingual education (IBE) into the national education system. Against
this institutional backdrop, the ME has proceeded with the restructuring of the Office of
the Undersecretary with responsibility for Equity and Quality, incorporating a
Coordinating Unit for IBE into the National Education Management Directorate. This
activity supported the execution of actions designed to improve education conditions in
rural schools attended by indigenous students, through the hiring of individual
consultants and through training sessions at the national and provincial levels.

IBE activities with respect to PROMER dovetailed into the gradual and phased
introduction of the IBE modality in the provinces. Execution levels and results varied
across provinces based on their respective management capacity. No comparison of the
results obtained in each province was conducted. Instead, technical assistance was
provided to the school district teams, on the basis of their specific difficulties and
capabilities, to help them make progress. And yet, the best results and highest levels of
execution were achieved in Northeast and Northwest Argentina, the regions with the
highest indigenous enrollment rates. In addition, the activity achieving the best results
was the teacher training program.

   1.2. Subcomponent A2: Expanding Coverage and Improving Student Promotion Flow

Expanding coverage of preschool education

With a view to expanding coverage, technical assistance, teacher training, and teaching
guides were provided in the provinces to share alternatives for organizing multi-age
classrooms. The provinces chose from among various alternatives, including multi-age
classrooms annexed to primary schools, independent kindergartens, traveling teachers,

                                             4
teachers with dual degrees, and schooling of children in their homes. In view of the fact
that the selection of these models was based on an analysis of the local situation, no
universal solution was implemented.

Trends in the indicators for monitoring coverage reveal significant progress with respect
to the education policy objectives to which these actions contributed. At the preschool
level in 2010, the expected coverage indicator (number of five-year-old boys and girls
with no access to school) exceeded the 2013 target set by the project for this indicator
(7,979). Since then, the indicator has continued trending downward, as the number of
children with access to education from the first level of preschool education continues to
increase each year.

Reducing repetition in Years 1, 2, and 3 of compulsory education

The activities planned at the start of the Project were executed at the expected rates.
Activities were being conducted in accordance with the PROMER incorporation phases
and all the institutions were covered based on its structure in August 2011. That database
was created for PROMER-financed activities, although provisions were made for
subsequent databases for activities executed on the basis of levels and provinces.

Organization of school programs in Years 4, 5, and 6 of compulsory education –
acceleration program

This activity was not executed because once general activities had been implemented, it
was not necessary to introduce the model provided specifically for rural schools. The
reason for not implementing this activity was linked to two related concurrent factors:
first, alternative solutions were developed for all primary schools (urban and rural) by the
primary education directorate, the unit within the MEN with responsibility for this
activity and, second, the implementation of inclusive social policies that had an impact on
the increase in overage levels, given their capacity to promote the return to school of
adolescents and youth through cash transfers to families for each child enrolled
(Asignación Universal por Hijo). During the project restructuring exercise carried out as
part of the project expansion process, the project’s results matrix indicator used to
monitor overage levels was dropped. However, it bears noting that the analysis of the
project’s various monitoring indicators continued to include the rate for students who are
overage by two or more years among the primary education indicators. Since 2009, there
has been a downward trend in the value of this indicator, which has become more
pronounced in recent years, attaining a value of 18.8 in 2011, 2.4 points below the
baseline value at the start of the project.24

Special education




                                             5
This component and the activities (provision of equipment) that were developed were
implemented in the provinces (Northwest and Northeast). The Coordinating Unit for
Special Education continues to provide technical assistance that is related to an
understanding of the need to adopt the cluster concept in order to design specific
activities for rural schools.




                                        6
Expanding coverage in Years 7, 8, and 9 of secondary education

This activity was implemented under the conditions that each province could provide at
the secondary education level. In 2010, the transition rate from Grade/Year 7 to
Grade/Year 8 at the secondary level exceeded the target set for that year (83). During the
last period, an upward trend was also observed, which made it possible to reach and
exceed in 2011 the target set for 2013 (85). The transition rate from Grade/Year 6 to
Grade/Year 7 increased by less than one percentage point year-on-year during the period
2009-2010 and achieved a value of 89.6 during the period 2010-2011, still falling
somewhat short of the target set for 2013 (93), despite coming very close.

School development plans (local projects)

School development plans were implemented in the following provinces: Buenos Aires,
48 schools; Catamarca, 73; Chaco, 22; Chubut, 46; Córdoba, 133; Corrientes, 32;
Formosa, 93; Jujuy, 22; La Pampa, 33; La Rioja, 62; Misiones, 100; Salta, 77; San Juan,
86; San Luis, 32; Santiago del Estero, 80; and Tucumán, 132. These plans sought to
supplement the proposed teaching method with respect to printed and audiovisual
materials with this activity that is linked to rural development. Each school received
AR$4000 in funding.

   1.3. Subcomponent A3: Strengthening Education Management at the Provincial
        Level

Strengthening line departments at the provincial level

As part of the tasks designed to strengthen management capacity in provincial
administrations, corrective measures were implemented in light of the observations made
in the audit reports to achieve the following: (i) in order to address the diverse and
complex nature of administrative proceedings for the disbursement of funds to each
school district, coordinators and specialists from the provinces were invited to participate
in technical training sessions aimed at promoting horizontal cooperation and the sharing
of experiences, by taking advantage of similar visions; (ii) with a view to simplifying the
work of the school districts and facilitating oversight of reports at the central level,
modifications were made to the corresponding instructions during the second stage of
project implementation; (iii) changes were made in the Operating Manual to the
accounting policies, recordkeeping, and other issues pertaining to procedures and
accountability, as well as to procurement processes carried out at the central level by
DGUFI for all internationally funded projects; and (iv) the function and use of the
UEPEX system as a management tool at the central and provincial levels were improved.

PROMER’s Coordinating Unit ensured ongoing monitoring of the adoption of the
corrective measures provided by each provincial team in response to the observations. In
addition, as a result of visits to the provinces, the degree of progress achieved based on
planned corrective actions was formalized in the Supervision and Technical Assistance
Agreements (Actas de Supervisión y Asistencia Técnica). Although retaining the teams is

                                             7
a provincial-level decision made by the Ministry of Education through the Education
Office, there was a push to maintain the teams as a way to ensure continuity and make
progress toward recognition of rural-focused activities as state policies.

Developing a rural education plan for each province

Activities targeting rural schools were included in the National Plan for Compulsory
Education and Educator Training (PNEOyFD), that is, if a rural education plan for each
province has been integrated into all provincial policies. The Coordinating Unit for Rural
Education has the capacity to update this plan in the same context.

   2. Component B: Enhancing the Stewardship Capacity of the National Government

This component financed the strengthening of the relevant ME line departments involved
in the management of the Project, with a view to (i) making ongoing management of the
system as effective as possible; and (ii) ensuring that the technical and administrative
conditions needed for its execution are in place.

   2.1 Subcomponent B1: Strengthening Line Departments at the National Level

The Project fully supported the national programs, and resources provided at the national
level were aimed at strengthening administration, rural education, intercultural bilingual
education, infrastructure, statistics and internal control activities of the ME’s directorates
and departments involved in their implementation. With respect to the resources initially
earmarked for this subcomponent, although funds were reassigned to the relevant
investment category, this funding accounted for 3.37 percent of the total credit.

The resources provided by PROMER supplemented those for the rural education
modality. In fact, for some stages, it would have been necessary to hold on to some of the
resources financed by the Project, which was not possible for reasons unrelated to
financing restrictions.

The Coordinating Unit for Intercultural Bilingual Education viewed the allocated
resources as inadequate. Consideration is also being given to the possibility in the future
of ensuring the continuity of efforts to strengthen the team at the national level.

   2.2 Subcomponent B2: Monitoring and Evaluation

In order to obtain information on the operating conditions of rural schools, the Rural
School Census (RER) was conducted in the provinces. The RER sought to survey rural
schools with one or two teachers located in provinces in Argentina that were remote or
difficult to access, and propose procedures and methodologies for collecting, processing,
analyzing, and reporting education sector and background information. The information
gathered was used to meet the information needs of ME directorates and provincial
governments.



                                              8
It was reported that INET and not the DiNIECE conducted the longitudinal survey of
graduates of technical schools.

With regard to studies/surveys financed by PROMER, the DiNIECE implemented
systems for the compilation, analysis, and reporting of education statistics, as well as for
the financing of nine special studies for the assessment of specific aspects relating to the
impact of the project’s activities:

   ‐       A policy to organize school programs in the second cycle of the primary
           education level in Mendoza province (2008);
   ‐       A training proposal for multi-grade rural schools in the province of Santiago
           del Estero (2008);
   ‐       Improvements in education conditions in rural areas: teaching processes that
           include the use of native languages to promote literacy in Spanish (2009);
   ‐       The implementation of a proposal to organize the Basic Secondary Education
           program in rural areas: provincial management and institutional aspects
           (2009);
   ‐       Possibility of organizing multi-age classrooms in Entre Ríos to expand
           preschool coverage in rural areas (2010);
   ‐       Description of intercultural and bilingual education in rural areas (2010);
   ‐       Training and teaching in multi-grade classrooms and the advanced
           specialization diploma in rural education (2011);
   ‐       Secondary schools in rural areas and clusters as a policy strategy for
           maintaining rural students on track academically in the province of Misiones
           (2012);
   ‐       Multi-age classrooms (secciones) at the preschool level in rural areas.
           Tensions and transformations in educational practices with the distribution of
           games for learning (2012).

The DiNIECE has been conducting standardized national student assessments (ONE) that
include rural schools every three years since 2007. Each school that participated in the
ONE for secondary schools was informed of its respective results. The 2013 ONE for
secondary schools was conducted in August and the ONE for primary schools in
November 2013. The DiNIECE estimates that the final results [for primary education]
will be available in late 2014, while results for secondary schools will be available in July
or August of the same year.

Sustainability

The allocation of national resources for certain activities is part of the national rural
education policy and relates to the integration of the rural dimension into the education
policy. Resources are received from various sources and pooled. Provinces have achieved
varying degrees of progress.

With regard to teacher training in rural schools, it should be noted that the advanced
specialization diploma was not identified as a general policy. However, training sessions

                                             9
linked to resources provided by PROMER were indeed general in nature, and the content
developed surpassed the resources provided.

Consideration is being given to the continuity of the IBE modality in the context of the
implementation of the 2012-2016 National Compulsory Education Plan (PNEO) and the
National Educator Training Plan (PNFP). Five future activities have emerged from these
plans. They seek to generate strategies for achieving better results with respect to quality
of learning, working in collaboration with the various representative bodies of the
indigenous peoples. It is essential for the IBE modality to institutionalize participation
mechanisms to ensure ongoing involvement in the design of the action plan for each
activity.

Management of PROMER

PROMER’s Coordinating Unit assumed responsibility for general planning,
administration of the fiduciary aspects and monitoring of same, reporting directly to the
DGUFI.

Control and Auditing

The entire operation was subject to internal controls, which were conducted by the
Ministry’s Internal Auditing Unit (UAI). This unit is under the direct supervision of the
minister, and is responsible for conducting audits and issuing recommendations in
accordance with the powers vested by Law No. 24.156 (Law of September 30, 1992 on
Financial Management and Control Systems), with a view to promoting and providing
advice on the implementation of a system that ensures the continuity and adequate
functioning of the administrative, financial, and operating controls and of electronic data
processing, in a way that helps minimize operational risks and maximize Project
efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public funds assigned thereto.

The regulatory framework established for the Project requires provincial school districts
to notify provincial regulatory bodies and incorporate into the provincial budget the funds
agreed to in the bilateral agreement concluded between the central government and
provinces. It also bears noting that the Coordinating Unit conducted supervisory visits
and provided technical assistance in the provinces, in accordance with the transfers made
and the reports submitted. Each province was supervised at least once a year by relevant
staff from the Coordinating Unit and UAI.

In sum, internal controls promoted a fairly secure environment for the achievement of the
following objectives:

   -       Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;
   -       Reliability of financial reports, including reports on budget execution,
           financial statements, and other documents that are prepared for internal and
           external use; and
   -       Compliance with the laws and regulations applied for their execution.

                                            10
Changes in the internal organization and structure of the Project’s Coordinating Unit. In
2009, the Project’s Coordinating Unit was reorganized, adopting a matrix scheme in
which departments and functions were identified and defined in terms of areas—financial
management, assistance to provinces, technical assistance, and monitoring—subject to
the authority of the Coordinating unit. The Assistance to Provinces department was
organized into regional teams, with each comprising a non-specialist, a financial
specialist, and a procurement specialist. This reorganization contributed to the planning,
monitoring, and technical assistance in the provinces, providing them, in this way, with
extraordinary interlocutors with the capacity to respond to all management-related issues,
and, within the Coordinating Unit, to work toward common goals, viewing provincial
management as a collective effort.
