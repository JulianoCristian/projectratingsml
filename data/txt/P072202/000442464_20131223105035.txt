﻿F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The Project's GEO was to promote the environmentally sustainable use of fish resources
through adoption by countries riparian to the Southwest Indian Ocean of a Large Marine
Ecosystem (LME)-based approach to fisheries management in the Agulhas and Somali
LMEs that recognizes the importance of preserving biodiversity.
Key Performance Indicators for the GEO:
(a) To identify and study exploitable offshore fish stocks within the SWIO, and more
specifically to become able to differentiate between environmental (LME-related) and
anthropogenic impacts on shared fisheries.
(b) To develop institutional and human capacity through training and career building
needed to undertake and sustain an ecosystem approach to natural resource management
consistent with WSSD marine targets.
(c)  To foster development of a regional fisheries management structure for
implementing the LME-based approach to ecosystem based management through
strengthening the Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) and other
relevant regional bodies.
(d) To mainstream biodiversity in national fisheries management policy and
legislation, and through national participation in regional organizations that promote
sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources.
Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
Neither the GEO nor the PDO were revised. The Key Performance Indicators for the
GEO were merged into the indicators for the PDO, reduced in number and scope, and
revised as follows:
(a)  Development of a regionally    harmonized  strategy  for ecosystem-based
management of shared fish stocks in the SWIO adopted by all countries participating in
the Project through strengthening existing regional management bodies such as the
SWIOFC.
(b) Adoption by all SWIOFP countries through the SWIOFC of a monitoring and
evaluation framework (including environmental status and stress reduction indicators)
that defines ecosystem.
(c) Adoption of at least one national or multi-national plan for a specific demersal,
pelagic or crustacean fishery by all countries participating in the Project.
Changes to the key performance indicators were made as a result of the Mid-term
Review (March 2011) recommendations to revise the Results Framework table and the
monitoring indicators for the GEO and PDO, realign the targeted values to reflect the
delays in start-up, and redefine what could be realistically achieved in the time remaining
for implementation.

﻿1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.    The Global Environment Facility (GEF) supports environmentally and socially sustainable
management of shared marine resources such as fisheries through its International Waters (OP8) and
Biodiversity (OP2) focal areas. The Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (SWIOFP) was
funded under both focal areas to help develop a sustainable model for management of regionally-
shared fish stocks. The development of this model followed the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME)
approach developed as a tool for enabling ecosystem-based management and to provide a
collaborative approach to management of resources within shared boundaries.
2.    The SWIOFP was one of three linked projects using this methodology to address resource
management issues in two LMEs in the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO), the Agulhas Current and
the Somali Current. The core project is the Agulhas and Somali Currents Large Marine Ecosystems
(ASCLME) Project implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the
other is the Western Indian Ocean Land Based Impacts on the Marine Environment Project (WIO-
LaB), implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The ASCLME project,
along with the associated WIO-Lab project would provide the descriptive information about the
targeted LMEs to the SWIOFP.
3.    The SWIOFP's objective was to use these data to develop a long-term, environmentally
sustainable, management strategy that would link biodiversity protection of fish species (offshore
exploited fish stocks) to the sustainable use of the fisheries.
1.1 Context at Appraisal
4.    The South West Indian Ocean contains several high-value commercial fisheries and also
supports a large number of endemic and threatened species, many of which are under increasing
direct and indirect pressure from commercial fishing. The West Indian Ocean is one of the largest
marine environments in the world (eight percent of total marine waters and 30 million square
kilometers) and contains some of the world's most dynamic and variable large marine ecosystems.
One of the most valuable assets of the West Indian Ocean region is its biodiversity where more than
10,000 species of marine fish and invertebrates have been described from this East African Marine
Ecoregion, with several zones of exceptionally high levels of endemism identified. The coastal zone
of the SWIO represents a source of major economic activity for the estimated 140 million people
who live within the countries along its boundaries, and for the estimated 28-30 million people in the
coastal zones. In some of the SWIO, fish represents the primary source of animal protein available to
the local populations, as well as vital sources of earnings from the fisheries products and licensing'
5.    The African countries and the island states bordering on the Agulhas and Somali Current
LME however, faced rapidly growing coastal communities, coastal pollution and degradation, and
unregulated fishing by local inhabitants and foreign fishing fleets. Nearly 95 percent of the global
yield of fish and other living marine resources are produced in the LMEs.
PAD, Section A.1, pp. 2-5,
17


﻿6.     Little was known of species composition of fish stocks in offshore areas. The potential of the
West Indian Ocean for commercial deep-sea fisheries or what was being exploited was also
unknown. It was likely that distant water fishing fleets were depleting the West Indian Ocean
fisheries resources within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of some of the countries.
Without this information, there are barriers to establishing management institutions under the Law of
2
the Sea2
7.     The rationale for Bank/GEF involvement was to mobilize bilateral grants (GEF, IDA-
financed Adaptable Program Loan (APL)) to establish the status of fish stocks, their viability, assess
future pressures and potential economic values, and make information accessible to the countries
that are beneficiaries of the Project. Such funding was also to be used to develop the institutions and
frameworks necessary to sustainably manage the economically valuable fisheries, conserve for
artisanal and community purposes the overlapping near-shore fisheries, sustain the related
biodiversity, and mobilize coastal communities.
8.     Within this context, the GEF, particularly through its International Waters program,
recommended that countries sharing an LME jointly address coastal and marine issues by analyzing
scientific information on trans-boundary concerns and their root causes, setting priorities for action,
and acting through national and regional policy and legal and institutional reforms to successfully
manage these shared resources.
1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved).
9.     The Project's GEO is to promote the environmentally sustainable use of fish resources
through adoption by countries riparian to the Southwest Indian Ocean of a Large Marine Ecosystem
(LME)-based approach to fisheries management in the Agulhas and Somali LMEs that recognizes
the importance of preserving biodiversity.
Key Performance Indicators for the GEO (as approved and as stated in Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) main text)3:
(a) To identify and study exploitable offshore fish stocks within the SWIO, and more
specifically to become able to differentiate between environmental (LME-related) and
anthropogenic impacts on shared fisheries.
(b) To develop institutional and human capacity through training and career building needed to
undertake and sustain an ecosystem approach to natural resource management consistent
with World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) marine targets.
(c) To foster development of a regional fisheries management structure for implementing the
LME-based approach to ecosystem based management through strengthening the Southwest
Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) and other relevant regional bodies.
2 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

﻿(d) To mainstream biodiversity in national fisheries management policy and legislation, and
through national participation in regional organizations that promote sustainable exploitation
of fisheries resources.
10.   The Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) were to: (i) identify and study
exploitable offshore fish stocks within the Project Area, and differentiate between environmental and
anthropogenic impacts on shared fisheries; (ii) develop institutional and human capacity through
training and career building; (iii) develop a regional fisheries management structure and associated
harmonized legislation; and (iv) mainstream biodiversity in national fisheries management policy
and through national participation in regional organizations that promote sustainable exploitation of
fisheries resources.
Key Performance Indicators for the PDO:
(a) Adoption of at least one national or multi-national management plan for a specific demersal,
pelagic or crustacean fishery by each Participating Country by the end of the Project.
(b) Regional fisheries database fully operational and inclusive of new and historic data, which
contributes to the development of regional management plans for at least two fisheries by end
of the Project.
(c) Production of a baseline assessment (accompanied by a database) that defines the current
status of relevant crustacean, demersal and pelagic fisheries in each of the SWIOFP countries
by the end of the Project.
(d) Production of a sustainable fisheries management framework leveraged onto the agenda of
regional fisheries management bodies that include biodiversity conservation as underlying
principle.
1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
11.   Neither the GEO nor the PDO were revised. The Key Performance Indicators for the GEO
were merged into the indicators for the PDO, reduced in number and scope, and revised as follows:
(a) Development of a regionally harmonized strategy for ecosystem-based management of
shared fish stocks in the SWIO adopted by all countries participating in the Project through
strengthening existing regional management bodies such as the SWIOFC.
(b) Adoption by all SWIOFP countries through the SWIOFC of a monitoring and evaluation
framework (including environmental status and stress reduction indicators) that defines
ecosystem.
(c) Adoption of at least one national or multi-national plan for a specific demersal, pelagic or
crustacean fishery by all countries participating in the Project.
12.   Changes to the key performance indicators were made as a result of the Mid-term Review
(March 2011) recommendations to revise the Results Framework table and the monitoring indicators
for the GDO and PDO, realign the targeted values to reflect the delays in start-up, and redefine what
could be realistically achieved in the time remaining for implementation. The changes were
approved in a Special Session of the Project's Regional and Policy Steering Committee held on
March 12, 2011.

﻿1.4 Main Beneficiaries
13.    The Project's primary target group were the technical institutions of the governments of nine
countries4 participating in the SWIOFP: Comoros, France (by virtue of its islands in the region, i.e.,
R6union and islands in the Mozambique Channel), Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Seychelles, South Africa (East Coast only), the United Republic of Tanzania , and Somalia (as
formal observer). The SWIOFP provided financing to support regional and national fisheries
resource management initiatives, within the scope of the Project, and strengthened the framework
within which the governments and relevant institutions could collaborate more effectively to plan
and manage such resources.
14.    Other organizations expected to benefit from the Project were:
(a) The implementation agencies of the two projects linked to the SWIOFP and applying the
LME approach: the ASCLME project implemented by the UNDP, the WIO-Lab project
implemented by the UNEP;
(b) Regional institutions, supported with institutional strengthening and knowledge sharing
activities, included the SWIOFC, Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), and the Indian
Ocean Commission (IOC);
(c) A limited number of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) contracted for data collection,
research or monitoring activities (e.g., turtle tagging program);
(d) Contractors for commercial fishing vessels wet-leased for survey activities, and private
contractors who were suppliers/installers of technical equipment; and
(e) Other partner institutions and projects such as: EAF-Nansen project and the "Indiseas"
Program (funded by the European Union (EU)) which will benefit from shared research and
survey data collected through the SWIOFP.
15.    Individuals benefitting from direct support under the Project include the students who were
recipients of the Masters of Science (MSc), Bachelors of Science (BSc) funding, and support for
doctoral (PhD) programs provided through participation in the research and survey activities of the

was a participating country through the islands which are under French administration in the area.
The United Republic of Tanzania consists of the Tanzanian Mainland and the People's Revolutionary Government
of Zanzibar. Fisheries are not a "union" issue and representatives of both the Mainland fisheries and Zanzibar
fisheries agencies participated in SWIOFP preparation.

1.6 Revised Components
22.   The components were not revised following Board Approval.
1.7 Other significant changes
23.   The following changes were made:
(a) Early project design originally had seven components - three which focused on fisheries
management issues and four on research; one of the components, "Monitoring, Surveillance
and Compliance of Fishing Effort and Catch", was later dropped due to shortage of funding.
(b) The number of signatories to the Special Account (SA) was increased from three to four
early in implementation to include the Regional Executive Secretary (RES); this was to
facilitate disbursements in the case of absences.
(c) Following recommendations made as a result of the Mid-term Review (MTR), the
performance indicators were revised to take into account start-up delays and to reset targets
to a realistic level for the remaining implementation timeframe.
(d) Reallocations of funds were made to reflect increased budget needs for ship-based surveys,
decrease in expenses for consultants, and increasing expenses for operating costs
(Component 6 - "Strengthening Regional and National Fisheries Management") due to the
large coordination efforts required for activities which were cross-cutting and regional in
nature.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
24.   Project Preparation and Participatory Processes. The preparation phase, from 2002-2007,
was key in obtaining the countries' ownership of the SWIOFP. It was a collaborative effort between
countries, with each country sharing responsibilities for key portfolios: (a) science planning - South
Africa, (b) data management - Kenya, (c) operations and procurement - Tanzania, (d) project
management - Madagascar, (e) legal issues - France, and (f) Secretariat - Mozambique.
25.   The decision to develop a research project with a scientific and capacity-building focus as a
first step towards promoting a regional model of environmentally sustainable management of
fisheries was taken as a result of a series of technical workshops, hosted by different participating
countries over the preparation phase. The World Bank, consultants, members of the project steering
committee of the ASCLME, and country representatives were invited to attend. The proposals for
scientific research reflected country priorities and formed the basis for design of the Project
22


﻿components. The country governments were fully briefed on developments during plenary sessions
and involved in the selection of key activities. The country-driven process was also instrumental in
maintaining ownership of the Project during implementation.
26.    The Bank supported preparation with three preparation grants funded by the GEF, a PDF-A
and two PDF-B/PPG, totaling $720,000, to support the following: the initial planning conference,
the creation of a project implementation unit, and related expenses for the preparation of the
SWIOFP.
27.    Stakeholder Involvement and Project Partnerships. Stakeholders were identified at
preparation in the context of joint LME projects (ASCLME and WIO-Lab). Broad consultations
were held with stakeholders 7 in the nine countries during preparation stage, and respective fisheries
experts and representatives of fisheries management institutions of different countries were involved
in planning of activities. Stakeholders included participating government fisheries management and
fisheries research institutions. Fisheries industry representatives, oceanographic research institutes
from the region, and a variety of institutions involved in marine ecology and biodiversity research,
and institutions or groups involved in coastal and marine management.
28.    Donor coordination happened early in the preparation phase (2002) when UNDP and the
World Bank agreed to integrate the activities of the two projects (SWIOFP and ASCLME) as much
as possible to ensure that the output of the fisheries and oceanographic components of the LME were
mutually supportive. Donor coordination was also strong in attracting other institutions involved in
fisheries to support the preparation phase8.
29.    Project Design contained an appropriate mix of fisheries research and management to be
implemented in a clearly outlined three-phased approach. Results from stock assessments in the
region were meant to provide the scientific base for targeting key fisheries, assess their status,
identify shared fisheries resources (unknown at the time) apart from tuna, assess their commercial
potentials, and provide input for countries in the region to make decisions and strengthen fisheries
resource management at the national level (through fisheries management plans) and at regional
level (Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA), Strategic Action Plan (SAP)).
30.    Project design was also anchored in national institutions and used a newly established
regional organization, the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) (established
by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2004) to ground the policy and steering
committee for the Project. This ensured that activities were mainstreamed into the national
7 Stakeholders included participating government fisheries management and fisheries research institutions. Fisheries
industry representatives, oceanographic research institutes from the region, and a variety of institutions involved in
marine ecology and biodiversity research, and institutions or groups involved in coastal and marine management.
For a detailed stakeholder list, see PAD Annex 17, Table 13 "Stakeholder Groups, Participation and Linkage to
SWIOFP".
8 Funding partners for the initial preparation conference included: SADC, UNEP, IUCN, FAO, NORAD, ICEIDA,
DANIDA, and the Republic of Ireland. Countries which were interested in participating grew from the initial four
(Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania) to the current nine countries during this time.
23


﻿institutions' work program and avoided creating additional institutions in the countries. The choice
of components by theme and by lead country was designed so that each member country participates
in the core fisheries management components and selects only those other components relevant to its
own content. The design also ensured that each participating country had a lead role, and therefore,
an equal share of accountability and stake in the Project's success.
31.    The implementation structure (one Grant Agreement, one SA/Designated Account (DA)
managed by the Regional Management Unit (RMU), and eight Project Agreements) was streamlined
and functional, and allowed for changes to the Project (reallocation of funds between categories and
between countries) to be implemented through changes to a single Grant Agreement whose recipient
was Kenya. Implementation arrangements were streamlined through a coordinating unit, the RMU,
hosted at the Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), responsible for coordinating the
project activities of National Management Units (NMUs) located in each of the participating
countries. It was also the apex unit for fiduciary and project progress reporting.
32.    Project design, however, was ambitious in that it stipulated certain targeted outputs for the
Project's timeframe which were difficult to achieve, e.g., one or more sub-regional fisheries
management plans, establishing a region-wide national observer program, and drafting an integrated
TDA and SAP between the three LME projects, but failed to consider the different implementation
periods of each output. The integrated TDA and SAP, for example, required close coordination of
implementation timeframe and progress between the three projects; however, the WIG-Lab project
closed almost two years earlier than the ASCLME and SWIOFP which made the integration difficult.
The ASCLME and SWIOFP were better aligned later in implementation (from 2011 onwards) with
the same closing dates. Establishing a sub-regional fisheries management plan was sequential to the
research findings and analysis which were still being finalized during the latter part of the project. A
region-wide national observer program required that national observer programs be operational first.
These latter were still being established for most of the countries by the end of the Project.
33.    The Recipient Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR)9 flags that the Project's
design placed a strong emphasis on surveys which were to identify new stocks to be considered in
fisheries management initiatives. However, not many new stocks could be identified and this
weakened the link between the surveys data collection and fisheries management. The report also
mentions that it was assumed that there were many offshore non-tuna/billfish shared between
countries that need to be managed regionally. Experience showed, however, that, while there were
some shared non-tuna stocks, most are not shared regionally, i.e., they are only shared between a
limited number of countries.
34.    Lessons from  Bank experience on projects with multiple funding sources, complex
programs, and other regional International Waters (IW) and Biodiversity Conservation projects were
incorporated into the design. These included: the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project,
the Lake Malawi Biodiversity Management Project, programs supported by GEF such as the

﻿Benguela Current LME dealing with transboundary issues and is considered a success, UNDP
projects such as the Black Sea Ecosystem Recovery Project with early experiences of National
Strategic Action Programs, and the Tanzania Marine and Coastal Environment Management and
Environmental Management Project. These projects are IW and biodiversity projects which are LME
projects, involve the research side of fisheries management, are multi-sectorial in nature, and are
complex to implement requiring large coordination efforts. The LME approach, and its applicability
to fisheries management, was considered a relatively new approach at the time, particularly for the
SWIO area.
35.    Quality at Entry. Measures to assure quality at entry 10 were adequate. Internal review
processes at the Bank and GEF noted the innovative features of the Project which were unique to
Bank operations, and the usefulness of following closely how well the Project's new legal and
managerial initiatives met expectations during implementation. One of the innovative features was
the arrangement of having one country (Kenya) act as Grant recipient on behalf of all eight countries
which proved to be a pragmatic approach compensating for the lack of an established regional
institution at the time. Establishing linkages with the sister projects to establish an LME approach
was established early in preparation with the support of relevant partners and donors (UNEP and
UNDP).
36.    The Project could provide valuable guidance in the design of other regional initiatives. The
GEF endorsed the Project because it was a crucial element in the protection of the Agulhas and
Somali Current LME, and was central to the strategic focus on sustainable fisheries of the GEF
program.
37.    On the fiduciary side, financial management capacity assessment was sufficient. However,
procurement planning did not sufficiently anticipate the need for a procurement specialist, even part-
time or on an initial contractual basis in the event that circumstances might change, as with the case
of piracy disrupting survey cruises. Administrative oversight did not identify the discrepancy
between the implementation period specified in the Grant Agreement (4 years) and that of the PAD
(5 years), and the Results Monitoring and Evaluation Framework, although relevant, was poorly
stated in the annex of the PAD.
38.    Risk Assessment. The Project team correctly identified in the PAD the risks within the scope
of control of the Project. Risk mitigation measures were appropriate. Piracy was the only risk not
identified and mitigation measures were taken during implementation to carry out project activities
using alternative vessels and resources (for the impact of piracy on the Project, see Annex 2).
2.2 Implementation
39.    The date of effectiveness was extended from October 9, 2007 to April 9, 2008 (i.e., by 6
months), then extended for a second time to April 16, 2008. The reason was delays by South Africa
in signing the Project Agreement within the specified period.
10 Quality at entry included: sound Project concept, objectives and approach, adequate technical, financial and
economic analysis, adequate consideration of environmental and social safeguards, fiduciary assessments, relevance
to policy and institutional context, implementation arrangements and risk assessment.
25


﻿40.   Implementation began with a Project launch in July 2008. The Project experienced start-up
delays during the first two years of implementation and was moderately at risk due to the following:
(a) the RMU was fully staffed late (in 2010); it was staffed with an RES (until July 2009), a
Regional Finance and Procurement Manager (recruited in April 2009), an Information Technology
Manager, and a Ships Manager/Logistics Coordinator; until then, it was operating with an interim
RES and an Administrative Assistant; (b) the Project's SA/DA was opened at the wrong location; (c)
piracy incidences in the region which disrupted data collection and research cruise activities; (d)
slow pace of implementation at country and regional levels, delays in nominations to posts or staff
turnover (National Component Coordinators, Regional Component Coordinators); and (e) slow
disbursements due to slow procurement.
41.   The incidence of piracy disrupted planned research cruises and obliged the Project to assume
the costs of leasing vessels to complete the research survey program. Such costs were estimated to
be carried by other donors and through national research vessels. This added an additional
procurement burden and budgeting challenge; however, the Project remained flexible in its
resolution of the problems and the surveys were carried out.
42.   The Ships Manager/Logistics Coordinator position was a key position at the RMU which was
not filled until November 2010. The Project had difficulties attracting qualified candidates and had
to submit two rounds of advertising before a suitable candidate was finally recruited and related
activities began to accelerate.
43.   The Project demanded a large coordination effort on the part of the RMU, and stakeholders.
Work planning and budgeting, clarification of roles and responsibilities (e.g., Government of Kenya
as grant recipient and SWIOFC as the regional policy and steering body), logistics and planning, and
language requirements (French, English, Portuguese) contributed to early delays. Procurement
delays were persistent due to the shortage of staff at the RMU and the cumbersome procurement
procedures caused by the need to comply with both the country's (Kenya) procurement procedures
and the Bank's. In December 2009, actual disbursements (26.7 percent) were lagging behind
projections (39.7 percent).
44.   However, the MTR (March 2011 - about three years after effectiveness) assessed that Project
objectives were achievable despite initial delays: momentum was building, progress was continuing
on data collection and analysis, a regional management structure was being established through the
increasing use of SWIOFC as a regional discussion forum for fisheries work planning and issues,
and participating countries and partners remained committed to the Project's objectives despite the
challenges. Actions taken following the MTR included a realignment of the Project duration (from
four years in the Grant Agreement, to five years as contained in the PAD); a revision of the results
framework and Key Project Indicators, a revision of component outcome indicators and target values,
to a realistic level corresponding to the remaining Project timeline.
45.   During the MTR, the Project attracted new sources of co-financing from donors and
institutions interested in fisheries in the region, including the French Government through the Institut
de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD) and the Institut Franqais de Recherche pour
l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER), IOTC and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) (see
Annex 1(b) - Project Costs and Financing Table). Co-financing was mainly in the form of researcher
staff time, ship vessels use, and resources for technical training.
26


﻿46.   Following the MTR, implementation accelerated as institutions became more familiar with
implementing the regional Project, so that by mid-2012, disbursements reached 84 percent of
projections (due in part to the Project having to finance research cruises which were to be funded by
Norway (through the FAO for the lease of a research vessel) and by national research vessels).
47.   The original closing date of November 30, 2011 was extended to March 31, 2013 to realign
the project duration to a five-year time frame, and to coincide with the ASCLME's closing date for
the completion of the joint TDA and the SAP, to be coordinated by the ASCLME, for the three
linked projects: Western Indian Ocean Land Based Impacts on the Marine Environment Project -
WIO-Lab, Agulhas and Somali Currents Large Marine Ecosystems Project - ASCLME, and the
SWIOFP.
48.   At End of Project (EOP), a substantial part of the revised Key Project Indicators had been
met, and the majority of the revised component outcome indicators had been met.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
49.   The M&E design presented some shortcomings. The choice of key project indicators was
appropriate for measuring desired outcomes from the Project and was clearly linked to the GEO. The
indicator on the "Production and adoption of at least two sub-regional management plans ...
governing management of a specific transboundary fishery..." was removed at MTR because there
was no clear indication of a transboundary fishery as a result of data collection. However, given that
this was unknown at the time of appraisal, this indicator was appropriate at Project design stage. The
choice of indicators, baseline and EOP target values for the GEO were not appropriate and too
ambitious (e.g., adoption of at least three sub-regional management plans, finalization and formal
adoption of environmental status and stress reduction indicators). Arrangements for reporting to be
carried at the level of the RMU were appropriate since this was the level of aggregation for project
reporting.
50.   The M&E, however, was poorly stated in the PAD's main text and in the Annex 3 - Results
Framework and Monitoring making its utilization difficult. The GEO indicators in the main text
were different from the Annex. The PDO was confusing and contained multiple objectives for which
multiple indicators were formulated, but which linked to only two of the objectives. There was some
confusion over output and outcome indicators in the main text and the breakdown of intermediate
level outcome indicators and EOP outcome indicators in the Annex was unnecessarily detailed. This
was revised during MTR to facilitate follow-up as well as to reflect the modifications and merging of
some of the indicators.
51.   M&E indicators and follow-up were progressively reviewed during implementation
assistance missions and improved and eventually revised at the MTR. M&E was carried out
collaboratively with the participation of countries and discussions on revised indicators involved all
countries concerned and provided guidance to track project progress during implementation.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
52.   Safeguards. The Project was rated a Category "C", not requiring an assessment. There were
no safeguard issues during implementation.
27


﻿53.   Financial Management of the Project was adequate. Early in implementation (2009) there
were some delays which were eventually resolved. The NMU had a mixed record of submitting
Interim Financial Reports to the Bank in a timely manner until end 2011. The Project's SA/DA was
erroneously opened in Nairobi as a Treasury DA at start-up. The RMU lost control of a balance of
about $400,000, until it was finally transferred to the Project's DA in August 2011. Some
irregularities on small expenditures were noted during the final supervision mission, but overall, the
Bank's reviews on financial management at end of project was rated "Satisfactory".
54.   Procurement. Procurement entailed limited amounts of small works (construction of fish
aggregation devices), national and a small amount of international shopping, and consultant services.
Overall, the compliance with Bank rules and procedures on procurement was rated "Satisfactory" by
the Bank's internal reviewers. However, delays in procurement did occur, due to several reasons: no
dedicated procurement officer recruited for the RMU, dual compliance requirements with Kenyan
Government procurement and Bank procurement procedures, and lack of familiarity with Bank
procedures at start-up. Procurement was carried out mainly by the Financial Manager who also acted
as Procurement Manager, with the support of the RES. Furthermore, because of the small amounts of
procurement contracts planned at appraisal (most of the cruises were to be carried out by the
FAO/Norwegian research vessel R/V Dr. FridtjofNansen or by national research vessels), the Bank
did not see the need and, therefore, did not stipulate the recruitment of a separate procurement
specialist in the Grant Agreement. This need changed when the Project was forced to assume the
costs of research cruises (through leasing of commercial vessels) when the piracy incidences
increased and the contributions of research vessels committed at appraisal did not materialize. The
RMU did launch the recruitment process for a procurement manager following recommendations
made at the MTR, but because of procurement delays caused and cumbersome procedures (use of
country systems) the process took close to a year, by which time very few procurement contracts
remained until the Project closed, so it was cancelled.
55.   Despite the difficulties, the Project management units showed remarkable flexibility in
adjusting to the changes in conditions regarding surveys. Through flexibility and organization, the
project implementing units managed to continue the research cruises and complete most of the
surveys in the time remaining.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
56.   Under the Project, a strengthened the SWIOFC, whose responsibilities included acting as the
Regional Policy and Steering Committee (RPSC) and as the Scientific Committee, worked closely
not only with participating countries, but also with other donor agencies (FAO, Fonds Franqais pour
l'Environnement Mondial (FFEM), WWF) and projects (ASCLME, EAF-Nansen). A review by the
SWIO countries of SWIOFC's performance rated positively the Commission's valuable contribution
and effectiveness in the region, enhanced by a proposal to broaden its role further from, not only an
advisory, but also regulatory Commission for the region. Discussion is ongoing as to the extent to
which the Commission could make decisions and recommendations which will be binding on
participating countries. Countries are discussing and preparing to request donor funding for
negotiating SWIOFC's transformation from an advisory to a regulatory body. In support of this
preparation, Mozambique has proposed to host the future headquarters of the SWIOFC and would
finance the office through the IDA allocation from the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries
Governance and Shared Growth Program (SWIOFish), a World Bank and GEF project currently
28


﻿under preparation. SWIOFish will build on the results of the SWIOFP to develop sustainable
fisheries resource management through strengthening governance capacity to manage fisheries,
providing investments to harness sustainable fisheries to national economies and strengthen further
regional cooperation.
57.    In addition, a $1.1 Million grant to the IOC has been approved from the Development Grant
Facility (DGF) under the Global Partnership for Oceans (GPO) in Support of Rights-Based Fisheries.
The grant supports key activities of the SWIOFC and IOTC, through the IOC. The grant agreement
was signed with IOC in February 2013. The SWIOFC will be the Steering Committee approving
work plans and budget, a similar arrangement to the SWIOFP.
Sustainability
58.    Issues to consider for sustainability are: (i) mainstreaming and maintaining the regional
structure into country priorities; (ii) mainstreaming the ecosystem-based management approach
launched into national work programs; (iii) devising long-term mechanisms to generate fees for the
operation and maintenance costs of regional databases (including regular updating of project
websites and inputting of data); and (iv) securing sustainable financing for SWIOFC's continuing
operations.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
59.    In terms of relevance to global priorities, the Project's objectives were to promote an
ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in the ASCLME which was strongly driven by
the research needs of fisheries management in the region. As a result, the Project has contributed to
filling the data gaps globally in these areas.
60.    In terms of relevance to the GEF's objectives, the approach was considered new at appraisal,
but was indicative of where fisheries management was moving globally. It was in line with current
GEF IW emphases on fisheries management approaches for LMEs and also with current World
Bank initiatives such as the GPO11, which supports the developing coastal and island countries in
improving the health of their ocean resources and supports countries in transitioning to more
sustainable fisheries.
3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
61.    Project performance is rated moderately satisfactory as most of the revised GEO objectives
were substantially achieved:
The Global Partnership for Oceans is a growing alliance of over 140 governments, civil society organizations,
private sector companies and associations, research institutions, UN agencies, multi-lateral banks and foundations
committed to addressing the threats to the health, productivity, and resilience of the oceans. Further details are
available at www.globalpartnershipforoceans.org.
29


﻿(a) The first outcome indicator for the GEO    has been partially achieved. A   regionally
harmonized strategy is in place through collaboration with UNDP's ASCLME and UNEP's
WIO-Lab and others, a joint governance and policy assessment completed with the
ASCLME project, and the ecosystem approach in fisheries management (EAF) has been
promoted through collaboration with the FAO EAF-Nansen project. National fisheries
management plans have been prepared for all member countries using this EAF; and
SWIOFC's role in regional fisheries management has been strengthened.
(b) The second GEO outcome indicator has been substantially achieved. An M&E framework
which includes environmental status and stress reduction indicators was prepared and
submitted to the SWIOFC Scientific Committee for review and endorsement at EOP and
approval is expected by end of 2013. Ecosystem indicators have been defined and were
submitted also the SWIOFC for review at EOP but not yet adopted, and EAF scores are
available for all countries.
(c) The third GEO outcome indicator has been substantially achieved. More than one national
plan for a specific fishery has been adopted. In all, 11 national fisheries management plans
were prepared (Mozambique and Kenya prepared 2 plans each), of which 3 adopted
(Tanzania, Madagascar, and Comoros). No multi-national plan was prepared; however,
dialogues have been initiated on coordinating management plans between certain countries,
with strong indications for future cross-border collaborationl2
62.    Overall, the Project has resulted in an increased knowledge and awareness of the biodiversity
dimensions of fisheries activities in the sector and the ecosystems approach. Data sharing is provided
through regional data bases; regional management institutions have been strengthened, national
fisheries resources management plans have been completed and include biodiversity-related
concerns, national fisheries management agencies' capacities have been strengthened, and a network
of technical specialists has been established across countries broadening the pool for expertise in the
region. Technical training (e.g., observer programs, research surveys) fostered knowledge sharing
and transfer as institutions with weaker capacities were able to work with regional and international
experts (France, Norway) with stronger capacity in their field.
63.    New insights emerged with regards to shared fish stocks in the region as a result of the
Project. It was found that: (a) there were few, non-tuna-like fisheries that were shared regionally; (b)
of the few fisheries that were regional, none, or very few were managed on a regional basis; (c) some
biologically-linked fisheries were identified in the sub-region which provided justification for the
cost of regional management; and (d) genetic assessments allowed for the identification of shared
stocks across countries, which provided the justification for regional fisheries management plans
developed during the SAP exercise. Therefore, the fact that the Project disproved a theory that was
widely held at the time of preparation, i.e., that there were many shared, non-tuna like fish stocks in
12 The following countries: Kenya and Tanzania, and Madagascar and Comoros, have met to coordinate
management plans (small pelagic/line fisheries), and Seychelles and Tanzania have met to exchange knowledge on
the implementation of fisheries management plans. Seychelles and Mauritius will also probably collaborate on the
Bank's fisheries.
30


﻿the region, saved financial costs for countries which could have been managing fish stocks that were,
in fact, not shared.
3.3 Efficiency
64.    Cost Effectiveness. The implementation structure of the Project relied on existing national
institutions and regional structures for implementation, which represented significant contributions
on the part of governments and donors to the Project's operations. Linkages with the sister LME
projects included cost sharing for jointly beneficial project activities and additional donor
contributions during implementation further reduced investment and operating costs for the Project.
Survey and research activities were partly funded by Norway, national governments, and the French
government. Piracy disrupted the planned surveys and budgeting but the Project adjusted its program
and found alternatives to complete most of the surveys (see survey cost details in Annex 2 - "Survey
Activities" footnote 15).
65.    Total Project Costs and Co-financing. In addition to GEF funds, co-financing contributions
were received from the French Government, Norway, and the FAO, and from the Governments of
SWIO countries. Appraisal estimates for total project costs were $22.65 million. Actual estimates are
at $22.08 million or 97 percent of appraisal estimates, with the GEF disbursing the entire amount
committed (cf. Annex 1). Actual counterpart contributions from participating countries were $6.64
million or 99 percent of appraisal estimates. Price and physical contingencies could not be estimated
at EOP.
66.    Encouraged by the progress of the SWIOFP during implementation, the project also attracted
additional funding from the French Government (through the research institutions of IRD and
IFREMER), the IOTC, and WWF. Actual costs for FAO's contribution for financing SWIOFC's
personnel were higher than estimated at appraisal, while Norway's contribution was lower than
projected due to the cancellation of the research vessel following piracy incidences.
67.   Rate of Return Analysis. Because the Project was primarily driven by a fisheries research
agenda, a rate of return analysis was not calculated and would not be relevant for this phase. The
Project established a preliminary data inventory and built knowledge of selected target fisheries and
species on which to provide a scientifically valid base for decision-making in a future phase, which
would likely include productivity and commercial interests.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
68.    The Project has met most of the stated GEF objectives. The objectives and design remain
highly relevant today as the global trend moves towards promoting regional collaboration in the
management of fisheries resources. It has established a repository of knowledge for the region to
monitor environmental and fisheries resources through capacity building activities. Global benefits
include new and historical data on target species, identified gaps on transboundary and other species,
biodiversity impact data, regional species baselines, and other stock assessment data. The SWIOFC
is well placed to move member countries forward towards a policy and governance agenda now that
the scientific baselines have been established. The strong member country commitments and donor
31


﻿support represented significant and shared cost savings during preparation and throughout
implementation to balance out the benefits.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
69.    The SWIOFP did not deal directly with coastal artisanal fisheries, which play the most direct
role in terms of poverty reduction, as improved management of inshore stocks should have been
supported by the ASCLME project. However, in partnership with the EAF-Nansen project, it
contributed to the drafting of national fisheries management plans based on the EAF, which include
artisanal fisheries since stocks being researched are present in both inshore and offshore areas, i.e.,
they are potentially exploited by artisanal fisheries in the inshore areas. Eight of the nine member
countries convened EAF task groups, prepared baseline reports on specific fisheries, carried out
ecological risk assessments, and drafted management plans assessing high-risk issues. The
introduction of an EAF is essential for ensuring a balance between the growing catch of industrial
fisheries and the need to sustain food security and employment in the region.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
70.    The Project's key achievement was the institutional strengthening of existing government
and regional institutions. In addition, it strengthened research and built capacity for regional fisheries
management at human and institutional levels. At the national level, experts have established a
network of scientists, reinforced with data access, training and technical assistance from regional and
international institutions (FAO, WWF, IOTC, IOC, UNDP, UNEP, etc.). On the institutional level,
national and regional institutions have exchanged and built capacity for national observer programs,
stock assessments, fisheries management and development, and regional collaboration. Joint outputs
such as the TDA and SAP, EAF fisheries management plans established partnerships with several
regional projects and donor programs, fostered partnerships with research institutions (IRD,
IFREMER, Oceanographic Research Institute (ORI)) and universities (student grants), and
developed working relationships with developed countries (France, Norway). The partnerships have
facilitated knowledge exchange and transfer to the SWIO countries.
71.    The SWIOFC, an established regional fisheries body under the FAO, provided a forum for
the scientific results of the Project to be translated into practical management, within a regional
resource management framework. Under the Project, its role was strengthened through the
establishment and financing of a regional work program and the insertion of the RPSCl3 into the
SWIOFC's structure, defining a role that SWIOFC could assume once the Project implementation
phase was over. In addition, an independent review14 conducted in 2011 through interviews with key
stakeholders and through desk study on the performance of the SWIOFC found that member
13 The RPSC is made up of high-level decision-makers such as the permanent secretary/Director General level
representatives from government agencies hosting the National Management Units. These representatives speak for
the government they are representing.
14 This independent review followed the FAO Committee on Fisheries demand for assessing the performance of
regional fisheries bodies.
32


﻿countries rated the SWIOFC as highly effective. Performance reviews of Regional Fisheries
Management Organizations (RFMOs), as well as Regional Fishery Bodies (RFBs), were emphasized
by the Committee of Fisheries as well as by the FAO Conference since 2007, to strengthen regional
governance, modernize mandates and adopt improved approaches to management. Discussion is
ongoing on how to broaden the SWIOFC's role in the future, with the possibility of transforming the
15
Commission from an advisory, to an advisory and regulatory commission
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
72.    The first positive unanticipated outcome of institutional strengthening was the proposal
submitted by participating countries to transform the SWIOFC from an advisory body to a regulatory
body. The second positive outcome was that the Project attracted additional co-financing and in-kind
contributions from WWF and French research institutions, IRD and IFREMER. The third
unintended outcome was that, during the course of implementation, Project activities prompted the
establishment of additional databases in the region to accommodate new data: Pasgear, and the
Observer data base.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
73.    No beneficiary survey was carried out.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High.
74.    One of the main outcomes of the Project is that the countries' capacities have been
strengthened to the point where regional collaboration have produced, for the first time, a regional
analysis and policy documents for the two LMEs. The risks for the sustainability of these outcomes,
however, are high. The issues to consider in the future are:
(a) endorsement of the SAP by member governments, and adoption of changes to policies and
regulations requiring long-term commitments;
(b) regional and national level staff turnover leads to loss of expertise, networks, and continuity
of activities;
(c) continued instability in the operating environment (such as piracy, political/economic
instability, war and natural disasters) impedes regional collaboration.
1 During the Special Session meeting of the RPSC/SWIOFC which took place in February 2013, member countries
agreed to begin the transformation process of the SWIOFC from an FAO Article IV body with only an advisory role,
to an FAO Article XIV body with both an advisory and regulatory role. This means that the SWIOFC could make
recommendations related to fisheries conservation and management which are binding on its members.
33


﻿75.   The risks could be mitigated as follows. The TDA and SAP were screened and approved by
the SWIOFC (which is also the RPSC for the Project) and the countries. It is anticipated that
governments will endorse the SAP since its national experts were involved in the preparation of both
the joint TDA and SAP documents. The second risk would be mitigated if the regional collaboration
agenda is mainstreamed into the national fisheries institutions' work program and budget. This is
expected to continue in the implementation of the fisheries management plans and the SAP agenda.
The third risk could be long-term and recurrent and would be difficult to manage except through
close monitoring of the security situation with the assistance of United Nations agencies and bilateral
partners, and cooperation between the countries.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
76.   The Bank provided an appropriate level of support and guidance during preparation which
did not impede a country-driven process. The task team established strong partnerships with
participating countries' governments, ensured early donor coordination to secure project partnerships
and co-financing, provided adequate preparation grants for a long preparation process, carried out
fiduciary assessments to ensure adequate financial management and procurement capacities, and
obtained funding from the GEF mobilized under IW and Biodiversity programs. However, the
overall rating is based on the multiple changes in Task Team Leaders which affected continuity,
added to the duration of project preparation process and was disruptive for the recipient countries;
the administrative oversight on the divergence on project length between the PAD and Legal
Agreements, the ambitious outputs and targets set as indicators, and the unanticipated need for a
procurement specialist for the Project.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory.
77.   The Bank provided implementation assistance through missions carried out on a regular basis
of about every six months, rotating between the participating countries. The task team was
responsive to the client countries' needs, and maintained close coordination with other donor
programs through joint supervision meetings, and at times with the participation of GEF
representatives. The task team provided decisive advice regarding piracy issues on alternative
solutions and optimizing scarce resources. It also left the implementing units sufficient room for
maneuver, which created significant ownership of the project. Supervision was constrained by a
smaller budget than normal for a regional project due to the single financing source; however, the
task team remained flexible and drew on regional Bank offices to provide support on the fiduciary
aspects. The skills mix was limited for a regional fisheries research and coordination project due to
budget constraints, but, most importantly, fisheries guidance and expertise was provided through the
Task Team Leader. Bank management provided timely guidance and support with resources as
34


﻿needed. Additional assistance would have been useful from an M&E specialist, particularly at the
MTR for the revisions of the results framework.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
78.   Overall, the Bank's assistance was moderately satisfactory. The Bank team ensured adequate
quality at entry to ensure that the Project met GEF objectives and countries' needs, combined with
an appropriate level of support necessary for encouraging country leadership during preparation and
also maintaining the high level of country ownership throughout implementation. However,
administrative oversight errors affected the pace of implementation in the beginning of the Project.
5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
79.   Overall, the performance of the Governments of the SWIO countries in preparing and
implementing the Project was exemplary. There was high ownership in designing a difficult regional
mix of fisheries research and management applications with the Bank, with an appropriate
sequencing of activities, and coordination with other regional projects (ASCLME). Counterpart
funding commitments were honored to the full; the governments made available to the Project its
national staff to actively participate in Project activities, ensured adequate representation at SWIOFC
session meetings, and demonstrated willingness to adopt difficult measures outlined in fisheries
management plans and the SAP.
80.   The Government of Kenya's performance, as the recipient of the Grant, was moderately
satisfactory. It initially delayed the closing of the Treasury account in Kenya, opened in error for
depositing project funds. This caused disruptions in the disbursement of funds early in
implementation. The Government's response time towards the latter half of Project implementation
improved and remained timely. Delays in signing the Project Agreement by the Government of
South Africa was due to the timing of the required Parliamentary approval of the Memorandum of
Understanding for transboundary research, extended the date of effectiveness by about six months.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
81.   The pace of implementation early on in the Project was slow; the RMU was understaffed and
procurement challenges hampered disbursements, efforts were concentrated on sorting out logistics
issues, collaboration arrangements, and clarifying roles and responsibilities for various parties in a
challenging regional context. Implementation accelerated once the RMU was fully staffed and,
following MTR adjustments, activities and outputs increased considerably. Although procurement
was slow, compliance with Bank procedures was satisfactory and the quality of documentation was
good. The RMU within KMFRI demonstrated consistently good management of a complex Project
35


﻿and maintained regional coordination and collaboration necessary to produce the key outputs for the
Project.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
82.   The rating reflects the high level of involvement and ownership of the Governments and the
efficient management of the RMU within KMFRI in obtaining Project results in the context of a
complex regional project requiring intense collaboration and management efforts. However, the
SAPs were not yet adopted by all countries by EOP although the process is ongoing following
Project closure and deficiencies and delays experienced by the Implementing Agency contributed to
delays in startup.
6. Lessons Learned
(a) In a regional project with high potential for political priorities to dominate a project, the point of
entry for collaboration was built first on technical cooperation (trust building and collaboration
on research front), which then facilitated political collaboration across countries (regional
collaboration and counterpart contribution to project, support to the RPSC and SWIOFC),
leading to economic approach and discussions (follow-up phase - SWIOFish).
(b) The country ownership of the SWIOFP was a result of a long preparation process necessary for
confidence building as participating countries took the lead in designing the project. The Bank's
approach was to take a step back and provide guidance only when it was needed. Although the
preparation from 2003-2007 was much longer than most operations at that time, the project was a
complex regional operation and obtaining country ownership played an important role in the
Project's results.
(c) Political commitment throughout preparation and implementation was essential to maintaining
the momentum of the operation, not only at national level but also at the regional level for
coordination and oversight (SWIOFC and the RPSC). This contributed to the successful
performance of the RPSC and SWIOFC and lent credibility to the TDA and SAP processes.
(d) In a project which is heavily output-based, evaluating capacity building aspects is an important
means of assessing outcomes and impact. In the SWIOFP, this happened through the
strengthening of national and regional institutions, and through the global benefits generated by
the project's baseline data and research activities which can be shared between the countries and
outside the region.
(e) By signing one Grant Agreement with Kenya on behalf of all the beneficiary countries, instead
of a Grant Agreement per beneficiary country, the project managed to pool financial resources
among them. This allowed for a greater efficiency in the utilization of the funds, and avoided the
situation where resources would be lost due to absorption capacity limitation of some countries.
(f) Delays in signing by one country delayed the effectiveness date for other countries. The Bank
could explore ways to delink the cross-conditionality in regional operations involving multiple
36


﻿countries by allowing separate dates of effectiveness when multiple project agreements are
involved.
(g) Use of country systems is meant to provide a standard procurement process for projects but in
reality places additional burdens on implementation agencies and requires more coordination,
procurement experience, and time, to implement successfully.
(h) M&E indicators need to be clearly stated and focused on impact, with outputs and targets
indicative of outcomes to be achieved; in the case of the Project, difficulties were experienced
with the results framework because the intermediate indicators were lost in unnecessary detail
and there was confusion between the GEO indicators (outcome-based) and poorly stated PDO
indicators (output-based) before they were revised and merged into outcome-based GEO
indicators more appropriate for the Project.
(i) Relations with the client countries were facilitated with the selection of the right skills mix (tri-
lingual task manager and fisheries specialist) and the use of translation services for meetings and
implementation aide memoires.
(j) Successful project experiences need to be shared with other projects, especially with regional
operations and similar projects in the GEF portfolio. This supports cross-learning, sharing of
experience, and application of lessons learnt.
(k) As the project activities move into a follow-up phase, sustainability issues to consider will be
quality and verification of data, sustaining operation and maintenance costs of the knowledge
and data bases, staff turnover, financing of high cost operations such as the surveys and observer
activities, and support to the regional bodies for the longer terms.

﻿Annex 2. Outputs by Component
1.     Implementation was slow to get started, particularly for Components 2-5, due to the
following factors: (a) the late recruitment of the Ships Logistics Coordinator (SLC) (recruited in
November 2010, 2.5 years after effectiveness); (b) slow procurement and disbursements; (c)
increasing incidences of piracy from mid-2009 which impeded ship-based surveys; (c) shortage of
appropriate vessels and/or gear in some cases; (d) lack of capacity (trained personnel, experience) to
implement the observer deployment program.
The description of outputs begins below with a summary of factors affecting cross-cutting activities,
followed by assessments of each component's outputs.
Cross-cutting Activities
Survey Activities (Components 2-4)
2.     Surveys at sea were conducted following national and regional data gap analyses and were
carried out, when feasible, jointly with the sister project, the ASCLME, cofinanced between the
UNDP, World Bank, FFEM and FAO depending on which component activity each donor agency
financed. The at-sea data collection would be obtained through scientific surveys using project or
research vessels such as the Dr. FridtjofNansen, an oceanographic data collection cruise vessel in
support of the ASCLME, cofunded by Norway6, or through deployment of observers on commercial
vessels. Piracy disrupted the possibility of using fully the Dr. Fridtjof Nansen when, in July 2009,
the FAO and Norway stipulated that the vessel could not enter the northern parts of the project area.
Consequently, the research cruises took place only in the southern parts. Late in 2010, the vessel
could only be used on the Mascareigne Plateau and not in the North-western project area. One of the
planned activities for Year 2 of implementation (2009), for example, was a joint cruise between
three projects (ASCLME/ SWIOFP/EAF-Nansen) in the waters of Tanzania and Kenya which could
not be carried out and substitute vessels had to be found. Survey activities could not begin again
until 2011, leaving about two years for implementation of the program. By EOP results were 80
percent of the planned surveys completed despite the impediments of piracy, weather conditions
(monsoons), and fish behavior which limited the usefulness of data collected. Reports from cruises,
however, were delayed in being submitted which limited their input to management plans. Some
cruises were reported in the Recipient ICR as not being regional in nature (e.g., Tanzania) but were
used wet-leased vessels which increased costs without added benefits.
3.     Survey activities funded by SWIOFP for Components 2, 3 and 4 are summarized in the table
below, with a breakdown by component in later sections of the Annex:
1 At appraisal, it was estimated that Norway co-financing would provide the Research Vessel Dr. FridtjofNansen
for SWIOFP survey activities, of which the Project would pay 50 percent of the daily rate and Norway pays the
other 50 percent. This represented significant savings, halving of initial cost estimates for such cruises. In July
2009, 52 days of survey was planned at a cost of $520,000 total or $10,000/day.

4.    Another approach used to obtain survey data included sharing survey cruises organized for
one component to obtain data for other components; at times surveys scheduled for ASCLME
project, or financed by the FFEM were used to obtain or share data with the SWIOFP. This cost-
efficient arrangement increased the number of surveys in total conducted to obtain data as follows:

5.    Deployment of observers on leased vessels was one of the means of collecting data and could
be either at sea on board of leased vessels or at landing sites. The Project's objective was to build
capacity nationally for countries to have their own Observer Programs and in support of this
objective, the Project provided training and funded deployments with regional cruises or
international experts to foster transfer of experience and knowledge.
6.    At project start up, four countries had National Fisheries Observer Programs (NFOP) in place
and in operation - France, Mozambique, Madagascar, and South Africa. Among the other countries,
Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Tanzania had some experience with deploying scientists for data
collection on board vessels, while Comoros had no experience. By EOP, Kenya and Tanzania were
also implementing an NFOP, and Mauritius and Seychelles were initiating their programs. In
absence of an industrial or semi-industrial fleet Comoros had started port sampling.
7.    Overall, deployment of observers was less successful than the survey      cruises.
Implementation experience demonstrated that observers were more easily deployed from countries
which already had NFOPs in place before the Project began. The other countries were gaining
experience along with a learming curve for organization, logistics and skills shortages. In addition,
implementing national observer activities required a substantial investment and commitment from
countries in terms of establishing mandates and recruitment or availability of staff to coordinate and
implement the program, which countries which did not already have a program in place were not
able to make. In addition, overlapping donor projects and programs would work in each country,
often with the same objectives, using the same personnel, and trying to work with the same NFOP
added to the fray. Such efforts are at times uncoordinated, use different data collection tools and
techniques but in the same country. There is a great need to standardize the tools used for data
collection and training methods and avoid the duplication of efforts for countries. The observer
42


﻿deployments were also delayed by the slow procurement at the regional level which affected the
delivery of observer materials and tools.
8.    The SWIOFP observer deployment strategy respected national norms and procedures
regarding salaries to civil servants which varied from one country to the next. For countries which
did not have an observer platform, the Project support the development of a platform through the
development and harmonization of MoUs, work guidelines, observer protocols, observer data forms
and development of an observer data base. These were developed with the RMU's Ships Logistics
Coordinator (SLC).
9.    Training for observers was completed in 2010. The recipient ICR reported that training was
provided at considerable cost to the Project but that by EOP there was no clear regional strategy in
place to use the trained observers. It is expected that such training would be useful in future
programs as it is a requirement in the EAF approach to fisheries management and is included in
fisheries management plans.
10.   The Project financed standard observer training for 45 observers from five countries through
the Oceanic Research Institute (ORI) of South Africa, and the purchase of data collection tools and
equipment in support of the development of NFOP. However, the basic support needs to be fostered
through national or regional workshops for transfer of knowledge from the more experienced and
mature NFOPs to countries which only begun to develop these programs. The national capacities
exist but needs to be developed further through shared experiences.
11.   Other challenges to the program included piracy, the absence of ports of call for industrial
fleets, data collection methods which vary from one country to the next, new formats for data
collection which had to be accommodated as a result of the Project, new data which had to be
collected, training needs, briefing needs.
12.   Observer deployment activities by country, as of February 2013 are as follows.

Piracy
13.   Piracy originating in Somalia increased in 2009. As a result, several research cruises were
cancelled, and the observers could not be deployed; some fisheries in the surrounding areas stopped

﻿altogether. When piracy disrupted the possibility of using the research vessel, Dr. Fridtjof Nansen
package i.e., scientist crew including chief scientist and local staff which was important for transfer
of knowledge, for surveys, the Project adjusted by restructuring the survey program, i.e., determine
how many surveys could be carried out with commercial fishing vessels and local staff. However,
the challenges encountered with this option included screening data for quality and data collection
techniques which varied by country.   Commercial fishing vessels were used because of the
prohibition placed by some countries (South Africa, Nansen - Norway, France) on their nationals
navigating into pirate threatened waters. Countries subsidized surveys by providing armed guards
on commercial fishing vessels but only Kenya had an organized anti-piracy policy, providing sea
and air protection to SWIOFP surveys implemented in Kenya EEZ, with armed guards on wet-leased
vessels if required.
TDA and SAP (Components 1 to 6)
14.    The preparation of the TDA and SAP were key outputs for the Project. The data and
knowledge gap analyses on targeted species and fisheries (including biodiversity impact) which were
conducted at the national levels and consolidated into a regional level gap analysis, reflected country
needs, determined preliminary selection of priority species, outlined related key issues, and proposed
a framework for a research plan. The research plan drove the data collection and research agenda to
fill data and knowledge gaps; these were carried out through ship-based surveys, observer activities,
and various research topics (and publications), supplemented by cost-effective sponsorship of higher
education grants. The grants provided a lower cost means of supplementing the research as student
grants for Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees or higher, researched various topics relevant to the
Project, and also provided a means to fill a skills gap in the sector.
15.    The retrospective analyses reviewed the quality and adequacy of the data and information
inventory, by species/theme, to assess the state of priority species in the region. The gap analyses,
together with the retrospective analyses provided input into the preparation of the TDA, following
which the SAP would map out the program of country-driven reforms and investments countries
would commit towards managing the LME resources.
16.    The above analyses provided a broad overview of the state of fisheries in the SWIO area as it
prepared to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. In summary, the main concerns
were the changes in population balance of the following species: sharks and rays, large and small
pelagic fish, reef and demersal fish, sea cucumbers, prawns and shrimps, lobsters, and non-target
species (crustaceans, marine mammals and seabirds)".
17.    The Project supported capacity building and the Project's research agenda through grants for
graduate and post graduate degrees, and publications of scientific books and articles as well as
unpublished scientific and technical reports, theses, and newsletters, to raise awareness and increase
the visibility of the Project.

﻿Impact
18.    SWIOFP activities carried out / undertook a regional fish stock assessment and fishing
pressure surveys; developed a preliminary level of harmonization of regulation and management
cooperation; fostered regional cooperation between fisheries research and fisheries management
scientists, and strengthened the capacity of Government agencies involved.
Outputs by Component
Component 1: Data Gap Analysis, Data Archivinz and Information Technoloy.
19.    The objective of the component, to establish a regional database and appropriate data
management systems which would allow access to national datasets across the region, has been
achieved.
20.    Data from national and international sources have been downloaded into seven regional
databases piloted under SWIOFP.      The databases reflect information obtained from   several
completed activities: data atlas, gap analyses, and retrospective analyses for the key fisheries of
SWIOFP. Databases are now accessible to participating countries and linked with data from
previous LME projects such as ASCLME and WIO-Lab Projects.
21.    This component was coordinated by Kenya. The regional database was to be housed in
Kenya at the RMU, with the objective of creating a regional center for fisheries research data.
Previously, national data sets were scattered in various locations in each country and ran an
increased risk of becoming lost over time.
22.    Data collection proceeded slowly during the first two years of project implementation due to
several factors, mentioned earlier in the ICR. These factors affected the pace of implementation
across the components. Provision and populating the data was the responsibility of the National
Management Units (NMU). The first year of implementation was focused on training and workshop
activities to develop a plan for capturing, processing and disseminating data, initiating a data gap
analysis, and selection of an efficient data management system. National databases were to be
consolidated and integrated into the StatBase  system. Training on metadata management and
several sequential training workshops on StatBase were held with the Institut de Recherche pour le
Developpement (IRD) 19 between November 2008 and August 2010 on such topics as inventory of
datasets, harmonization of data across countries, data integration and consolidation, in preparation
for establishing the data collection and management requirements. The workshops also identified the
current status of fisheries data sets and constraints encountered (highly variable time series, missing
catch data, uncertain status of length measurements, some species breakdown missing).
1 StatBase is an archival software system for fisheries statistics developed in West Africa. This was to facilitate
archiving of existing data, and development of the data gap analysis.
19 The French development research institute, IRD, is one of the sponsors the Indiseas Program, a scientific program
which evaluates the effects of fishing on the health status of marine ecosystems. A joint workshop was held with
the SWIOFP on Ecological Indicators in January 2010.
45


﻿23.   A regional data atlas, reflecting repatriated and consolidated data from various sources, was
developed under an electronic format through Statbase; the related cartographic module was
completed in September 2012.
24.   Regional data gap analyses were completed in late 2009 for the three main types of
consumptive species/fisheries specified for Components 2 to 4 (crustaceans, demersal and pelagic
fishes) across the SWIOFP region, and for non-consumptive species specified for Component 5
(mainstreaming biodiversity in national and regional fisheries management).
25.   National level gap analyses conducted in each SWIOFP country and combined into a
regional analysis, following which a regional workshop would be held to harmonize the selection of
priority species, identify key issues and data needs, and make recommendations for appropriate
research projects to address the countries' data needs/gaps.
26.   At the Mid-Term Review (MTR) carried out in March 2011, the piloted databases were only
partially populated. However, they were expanding to include data on artisanal fisheries (needed for
the ASCLME project which was responsible for this subsector) and various data required under the
SWIOFP from research cruises which were beginning to come in. Other delays included the
repatriation of historical data and the procurement of the Endnote software for cataloguing
bibliography as well as the recruitment of the consultants responsible for capturing and processing
such data. This in turn delayed the downloading of data into the Western Indian Ocean Fisheries
Database (WIOFISH), a software for tracking small-scale fisheries inventory under the Project.
27.   By EOP, Endnote has been implemented. A copy of the Endnote database has been sent to
all participating countries. The Geonetwork node created for metadata cataloguing all SWIOFP data
was ongoing.
28.   Regional retrospective analyses were used in conjunction with ship-based surveys to
identify and collate available information on the target fisheries and also to meet the requirements
specified in Component 5 for mainstreaming biodiversity in fisheries management.
29.   Relevant databases were expanded and new fields added to accommodate new data collected
from research cruises, project-leased vessels, and commercial vessels with observers on board.
Cruise data was captured in the Nansis software used for facilitating cruise data management for
active fishing gear.
30.   Fisheries-related IT and communications infrastructure have been supplied to member
countries; all NMUs are equipped with IT equipment, communications and data handling equipment.
However, improvements to the SWIOFP-KMFRI infrastructure network were still outstanding in
late 2012 due to procurement delays going back to November 2011.
31.   Although component activities were implemented with delay, the databases were largely
populated with new and historical data by end of Project (EOP). Eight fisheries and environmental
indicators were also defined. Participating countries were able to take stock of all research cruises
carried out in the region as well as identifying 30 datasets of which eight were of high priority for
the SWIOFP. Historical information from over 150 cruises, carried out by numerous countries in the
Western Indian Ocean between 1933 and 2011, has also been captured into the databases. The data
collection activities also enabled the countries to identify important missing survey data which were
46


﻿carried out by the USSR, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Norway which were of high
priority to the Project but were difficult to locate or "rescue". However, the cost of "rescuing" this
missing data was estimated to be costly and take two to three years beyond the closing date of the
Project closing date to complete (particularly for the USSR data set which needed to be transferred
from paper for electronic format). For other data, reports were collected.
32.    The component was also cofinanced by France whose contribution covered:
*  Setting up a working group on fisheries indicators in an ecosystem perspective, first
workshop organized during Year 2 in conjunction with the EAF-Nansen project;
*  Consolidation and integration of national databases into StatBase;
*  Implementation of the web-based version of StatBase and the related support website;
*  Contribution to the development of a fisheries atlas, accessible online.
33.    France was responsible for developing the online fisheries atlas which has been completed.

35.    The following issues were underlined during implementation:
*  Irregular updating: the data base management system was dependent on member countries
submitting data on time;
*  Data quality remains an issue which has not been clearly addressed in Project reporting; FAO
was mentioned as having this responsibility;
*  Not all databases have been fully uploaded because countries have yet to input information;
and
*  The Retrospective analysis carried out in 2012 showed that the StatBase was incomplete
compared to the statistics databases of WIOFISH and FAO.
Impact
36.   At appraisal, nearly all the participating countries lacked sufficient data to describe the state
of fisheries and the anthropogenic pressure on fish stocks.  Knowledge of the impact of

﻿environmental fluctuations on fish stocks and ecosystems were weak, and data on ecosystems
indicators in specific areas (biological characteristics, fishing pressure, fish stocks, effects of land-
based sources of pollution, and linkages between ecosystems) were incomplete.
37.    Under this component, the SWIOFP was able to support the first-ever stock assessment of
the two LMEs in the region. New and historical data are being captured and data gaps identified and
data is being shared through several regional databases. The main fisheries database (StatBase) is
hosted at a centralized location in Kenya (the RMU's server) having been transferred from an
outside research institution (IRD). Although improvements are still needed in certain areas of data
collection and analysis, activities funded under this component have assisted member countries to
increase their knowledge base in fisheries data collection and management, fisheries research and
analysis.
Component 2: Assessment and Sustainable Utilization of Crustaceans
38.    The objective of this component, to support the assessment stock dynamics of shallow and
deep water crustaceans and their fisheries, has been achieved. The intermediate outcome indicators
have been met through the following key outputs, and provide the basis for the baseline and impact
assessments of crustaceans in the selected countries:
(a) A regional gap analysis has been completed;
(b) Three planned retrospective analyses completed (March 2012) for deep-water trawl, deep-
water trapping, and shallow-water trawl fisheries for crustaceans;
(c) Ship-based surveys carried out to assess the potential of new and existing; data collected on
species composition, distribution, biological and environmental data collection and
disseminated; survey data harmonized and analyzed within a regional context;
(d) Four research themes for priority species identified; related research projects completed
through Masters of Science (MSc) degrees;
(e) Harmonization workshops and meetings were held at country and at regional level to solicit
endorsement of findings.
This component was coordinated by South Africa.
39.    Data collection data of species composition and distribution, biological and environmental
information, was carried out through ship-based surveys, using project or leased commercial vessels.
Some ship surveys were shared with the ASCLME project and integrated all components (1 through
5). Of the 15 surveys completed, SWIOFP funded 13 surveys, of which 11 (see table below) related
specifically to Component 2.

40.   The regional gap analysis for crustaceans was completed in 2009. A regional workshop
was held at the Oceanographic Research Institute (ORI) on 20th - 22nd April 2009, attended by the
National Component Coordinators from the participating countries, to combine the five national gap
analyses into one integrated regional analysis. The gap analysis provided the basis for the ship
surveys and data collection to be carried out and outlines the research agenda.
41.   Findings from the regional gap analysis for Component 2 revealed:
*  Substantial existing data on the priority species;
*  The existence of common priority species but few industrialized fisheries;
*  Questionable existence of local or shared stocks;
*  Lack of knowledge/information on the biology and distribution of priority species;
*  Management plans exist only at the national levels and were either weak or arbitrary; and
*  Weak scientific capacity.
42.   The gap analysis also recommended a research plan on four themes for the priority species
and fisheries:
* Shallow-water prawns (trawling) (4 projects on biology, distribution patterns and genetic
connectivity);
51


﻿*  Deep-water prawns and langoustines (2 projects on biology, distribution patterns and genetic
connectivity);
*  Shallow-water lobsters) (1 project on genetic connectivity of lobsters in South Africa and
Mozambique); and
*  Deep-water lobsters and crabs (trapping) (3 projects on genetic connectivity of lobsters on
SWIO seamounts, analysis of existing data).
43.   The provision of education grants, mainly for Masters of Science (MSc), was one of the
means used to address some of the key questions under the research plan. Most MSc research
projects crossed national boundaries due to samples which had to be collected on ship surveys, some
are planned to be expanded to regional scale. Topics such as the genetic population studies on
transboundary connectivity were ongoing at EOP; Stellenbosch University in South Africa was
conducting the genetic analyses. Relevant reports and publications are available on the Project
website (www.swiofp.net). MSc projects supported by the Project are listed below:

44.   The three planned retrospective analyses on existing data for crustacean fisheries were
completed in March 2012 and covered all the SWIOFP countries except Seychelles (although it was
included in the PAD). The analyses were contracted to the Oceanographic Research Institute in
Durban, South Africa and were carried out through consultation workshops held with the fisheries
experts (government and private), fisheries institutes, and data specialists of member countries,

coast of Kenya and Tanzania; (ii) a potential for small deep-water trawl fishery off the coast of
Madagascar; (iii) trapping surveys for lobster and crab are sub-optimal; (iv) genetic analyses show
panmictic shallow-water prawn populations in Malindi-Ungwana Bay; and (v) genetic analyses
show structured populations of deep-water prawn and langoustines off the coast of Mozambique,
Madagascar, and South Africa.
45.   The key findings were that, although the information obtained to date from Project activities
were a large step forward towards regional integration, important information gaps remain. The
analyses provided a series of recommendations for future research and management strategies by
country and by fishery and served as input into the TDA and SAP which was to be carried out jointly
with the ASCLME project.
52


﻿Impact
46.   The retrospective analyses provided a baseline for preparing the joint TDA and SAP with the
ASCLME project. Survey data has been harmonized facilitating data sharing across the region and
strengthening collaboration. The new research projects, combined with information sharing have
strengthened networks among scientists/specialists in the region.
Component 3: Assessment and Sustainable Utilization ofDemersal Fish
47.   The objective of this component, to support the assessment of the stock dynamics of
demersal species and their fisheries, has been substantially achieved. The intermediate indicators are
met through the following key outputs which provided input for the baseline assessment of demersal
stocks and fisheries in the EEZs of Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Mauritius,
Seychelles, Comoros and Madagascar:
(a) Regional data gap analysis completed (December 2009);
(b) Ship-based surveys and data collection activities completed;
(c) Historical data compiled in Project databases; and
(d) Retrospective analysis completed (December 2012);
This component was coordinated by Tanzania.
48.   Implementation of the component activities were also slow to begin for the reasons outlined
earlier. Little was accomplished apart from some cruises conducted by the Nansen in Mozambique
and Madagascar waters in late 2009 and minimal baseline data was collected. Progress in
implementation was also hampered by a change in the Regional Component Coordinator at this time.
49.   By 2012, the retrospective analysis of demersal fisheries was completed. Shallow demersal
trawl surveys for all countries were completed, except for Kenya, and some delay was experienced
in the timely submission of cruise reports which limited their use as input into management plans.
Deep-water demersal and acoustic surveys using droplines were conducted in Mauritius (15 days)
and Madagascar (five days) while those planned for Mozambique, Kenya, and Tanzania took place
later in 2012. Drop line cruises for Mauritius and Madagascar were delayed due to difficulties
obtaining fishing gears. This in turn delayed the related training until May 2012. Acoustic dropline
surveys were being implemented. A workshop on cruise data analysis was conducted in late 2012 to
prepare the final cruise report. The pace improved during the last two years of implementation.
50.   The regional gap analysis for this component was completed in December 2009. The
analysis drew on available data and information sources for Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar,
Mozambique, Tanzania, Seychelles, and South Africa. Prior to its preparation, a regional workshop
was held at the Tanzanian Fisheries Research Institution (TAFIRI) in early June 2009, attended by
NCCs for the component, to prepare the regional gap analysis which would combine eight national
level gap analyses into an integrated report. The intent was to identify and agree on key demersal
species and fisheries and recommend research projects to follow, but also served to screen issues
such as quality of data, duplication of selections, etc., between countries.
51.   The gap analysis resulted in the identification of 24 priority species in the region, for which a
preliminary proposal was made for the development of projects and activities, and recommendations
53


﻿for surveys and data collection. With the exception of small-scale fisheries, all the fisheries
identified by workshop participants were of a semi-industrial or industrial nature and include: drop-
line, line-fishing, long-line, fish trawl, crustacean trawl, industrial trap and small-scale.
52.   By EOP, most of the planned activities for ship-based surveys were completed, including for
trawl surveys using wet-leased vessels and the Dr. Fridtjof Nansen research vessel, surveys for
Tanzania and Kenya and regional data from the surveys which were analyzed and submitted for
publication as an FAO special issue. One result of trawl surveys was that a decline in demersal fish
catch rates was observed. Five dropline surveys were completed for Mauritius, Madagascar,
Mozambique, Tanzania, and Kenya; technical reports submitted and data analysis completed.
Results from dropline surveys and related data were analyzed at a regional workshop. Biomass
estimation data were analyzed by an acoustic expert. Findings will also be published by FAO.
53.   Observer activities for this component were land-based and carried out through commercial
fishing boats. The results were as follows:

56.   The regional retrospective analysis was completed in December 2012, drawing information
and data from the same sources as for Component 1 and 2. The report identified the key issues and
made recommendations on how they could be addressed and dealt with: ambiguous species
differentiation and in fisheries classification, limited spatial differentiation in catch and fishing effort
data, limited understanding of biology, population dynamics and status of priority species, likelihood
of several species being shared or transboundary, and overexploitation of demersal species or few
priority species are covered in national fisheries management plans although all the SWIOFP
countries have planned or existing fisheries management plans. The results of the analysis were
incorporated into the preparation of the TDA and SAP carried out jointly with the ASCLME project.
Component 4: Assessment and Sustainable Utilization of Pelagic Fish.
57.   The objective of this component, to assess the stock dynamics of large, small and meso-
pelagic species, and develop strategies to optimize small and large-scale pelagic fisheries, has been
achieved.
58.   Key outputs were produced but the short implementation time remaining limited the
achievements. The main constraints involved the difficulty of wet leasing vessels for conducting
cruises, the postponement or cancellation of cruises due to unavailability of suitable fishing vessels,
and the limited success in the placement of FADs were constraints to data collection.
55


﻿59.   Key outputs under the component were:
(a)   Regional gap analysis completed;
(b)   Some ship-based surveys for data collection;
(c)   Deployment of Fish Aggregation Device (FAD) launched;
(d)   Study on the Socio-economic assessment of FAD impact completed; and
(e)   Regional retrospective analysis completed.
The component was coordinated by Seychelles.
60.   Implementation for this component also experienced delays for the first two years. By 2011,
research and deployment of FADs were underway in Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius,
Seychelles, and Tanzania, including training and analysis of related data. A socioeconomic study
(phase 1) was carried out to examine the impact of FADs on fishing communities. Five MSc
degrees were funded.
61.   Studies on the migration and movement of specific large pelagic species (including sharks)
have been completed and were conducted with the deployment of pop-up satellite archival tags
(PSAT) on swordfish and sharks. Eleven PSAT tagging cruises were planned, but five were
cancelled. Fish which were tagged in 2011 off the coast of South Africa, Mozambique Channel, and
off the Reunion islands were followed for 60 to 90 days. Results suggested the existence of a
bounded home range for swordfish in the Mozambique Channel. Key information is now available
to revisit stock delineation.
62.   The Dr. Fridtjof Nansen research vessel has conducted mesopelagic cruises in Northern,
Southern, and Western parts of Madagascar, in Northern Mozambique, and in the Comoros.
63.   The regional gap analysis was completed in December 2009. A Regional workshop was
held at the Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) in August 2009, with NCCs participating, to combine
nine national gap analyses into integrated regional data gap analysis. The report compiled and
assessed existing fisheries information, prioritized species, and outlined key issues to provide a
baseline for planning project activities. Key findings on data availability and quality were similar to
findings for Components 2 and 3. The regional gap-analysis also showed that a significant amount
of data collection and research on large pelagic fishes had been carried out in the region, largely
through French initiatives and under Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) jurisdiction. A list of
81 pelagic fish species were selected, which included:
-  For large pelagic fishes, four oceanic sharks, swordfish, bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna; it was
expected that projects on these species may strengthen IOTC assessments;
-  For medium-sized pelagic fishes included the small tunas and seerfishes, some gempylids,
dolphin fish and cobia (important to fisheries in various sectors - artisanal, sport, and
industrial) and may be insufficiently covered by existing IOTC projects; and
-  The small pelagic fish category covered small mackerels, scads and clupeids, most targeted
by artisanal fishers.
64.   Proposed projects for data collection included surveys for: acoustic, mid-water trawls,
medium-sized tuna- and tuna-like species, instrumented long-line surveys, and development of FAD
56


﻿fisheries. Data-collection would be carried through use of research vessels/ships, port sampling, and
deployment of fisheries observes on board commercial vessels and/or through wet-leasing of
commercial long-liners.  Scientific capacity building to sustain and implement the activities
successfully would include training, workshops of technical data handling content, development of
an observer program, and support to post graduate degrees with related research agenda.

66.   Optimization and development of FADs for large and small-scale pelagic fisheries.
FAD deployment and tagging around FADs met with limited success. Materials and equipment
were acquired late in Project implementation, around June 2012 following a lengthy procurement
process. Of the 17 FADs deployed to Kenya (4), Mozambique (2), Seychelles (4), Tanzania (2),
Madagascar (2), Mauritius (1), and Comoros (2), many were lost or damaged by the local
community fishers, probably due to insufficient sensitization prior to the FAD deployment.
Consequently, training on FADs could not be completed as planned by the time the Project closed.
Only Mauritius was able to complete both data collection and tagging.
67.   FAD socio-economic assessments were carried out in all countries to ascertain the viability
of using the devices region wide. The key findings are: (i) that the potential of large pelagic fish
stocks appears to be sufficient to allow the implementation of FADs without risk of overexploiting
resources (excluding juvenile capture); and (ii) FADs should be deployed within range of non-
motorized canoes should a fleet exist (with the exception of Mauritius and Seychelles); (iii)
provisions should be for the monitoring and maintenance of FADs within national budgets to ensure
sustainability of FAD fisheries.
68.   A regional Retrospective Analysis was completed in November 2012. It considered a large
number species caught in the eight member countries and a multitude of fishing gear used.
69.   France provided cofinancing through FFEM for the following activities in this component:
(a) FADs:
- a workshop on FAD deployment, research monitoring;
-  first phase of a socio-economic survey for coastal pelagic fisheries prior to FAD deployment;
- FAD deployment with the assistance of French experts.
58


﻿(b) Experimental longline surveys and Pop Archival Tagging (PAT):
-  Regional workshop on experimental longline-related research;
-  Development of software dedicated to longline data analysis and strategies;
-  Operations at sea with commercial longliners, including one cruise in association with a
research vessel R/V ANTEA in the Mozambique Channel, in conjunction with a WIOMSA-
MASMA project and the ASCLME; and
-  Progress review and assessment workshop at End of year.
Component 5: Mainstreaminz Biodiversity in National and Rezional Fisheries Manazement
70.   The objective of this component, to assess the state of knowledge of non-consumptive
resources and marine biodiversity for inclusion in the data atlas, has been substantially achieved.
The component has met most of the outcome indicators revised following the MTR.
The component was coordinated by Mauritius.
71.   Most key outputs were produced: a regional data gap analysis, data collection on biodiversity
assessment of by-catch impacted by artisanal fisheries methods, regional retrospective analysis
providing input for mapping biodiversity hotspots, sensitive zones and biodiversity reference sites.
72.   Sixty-five biodiversity hotspots have been identified including turtle and seabird nesting sites,
areas with high numbers of vulnerable species and fish aggregating and nursery areas. The hotspots
have been related to known marine protected areas and fisheries. These outputs were taken into
account in the preparation of the EAF strategies and for the joint TDA and SAP. The SAP proposed
actions to address habitat and community modification, and declining living marine resources
through: (a) monitoring, control and surveillance and enforcement techniques; (b) observer and
compliance/control officer training; (c) by-catch (including seabirds) mitigation measures; (d) stock
assessment training to develop harvest control regulations; and (e) safety training for fisheries
(including diver training for sea cucumber harvesting). Fisheries management plans also include the
biodiversity and social dimension in resource management.
73.   Other outputs from the Component which have not been completed, however, are the GIS
mapping of key marine species, and assessments of marine biodiversity as alternative sources of
income.
74.   The implementation of Component 5 was also slow to start, not only for the same reasons
that affected the other components, but also because it was less well understood than the other
components. The Recipient ICR mentioned that this was related to a lack of familiarity with the
ecosystem and biodiversity issues under the Project, in addition to a confusion about how to use the
budget allocated to the Component's activities. These issues were eventually resolved later in
implementation.
75.   Tagging experiments to monitor migration of turtles was contracted some of the work to
Non-government organizations (NGO). The tags were deployed but the program was not developed
after the MTR because of the relatively high cost of the exercise and no new tags were procured.
59


﻿76.    Steps taken to determine indicators for ecosystem health were carried out under the Indiseas
Program (www.indiseas.org) and were completed for Tanzania and Madagascar, but delayed for
Mozambique and Kenya.
77.    The draft regional data gap analysis was completed in 2011. While the gap analyses for
Components 2, 3, and 4 were based on fisheries resources and species, the analysis for this
component is based on the main biodiversity issues affecting fisheries activities including:
(a) Bycatch (fisheries with different gear types, non-target species, vulnerable species, discards
vs. retained bycatch);
(b) Habitat destruction through fishing (trawling grounds, fishing practices);
(c) Ecosystem effects (trophic interactions, predator removal);
(d) Sensitive areas (critical habitats, biodiversity "hotspots", aggregating sites, nurseries); and
(e) EAF approaches.
78.    No ship surveys were carried out under Component 5.
79.    Grants for MSc degrees were the following:

80.    The retrospective analysis, completed in 2012, reviewed knowledge of non-consumptive
resources in the region including identification major biodiversity hotspots. The preparation of the
bio-indicators of ecosystem health, however, was not completed for Mozambique and South Africa
(benthic communities) as of end of 2012. Similarly, the interactions with fisheries (investigation on
bycatch and bycatch reduction methods were also not completed.
81.    The sixty five "biodiversity hotspots" identified included turtle and seabird nesting sites,
areas with high numbers of vulnerable species, and fish aggregating and nursery areas, and were
described in a study of the biodiversity of WIO under the Project. The hotspots relate to Marine
Protected Areas (MPA) and fisheries activities and provide input for fisheries resource management
planning (EAF strategy, etc.).
82.    A rapid by-catch assessment of artisanal fisheries was completed in May 2012. The
assessment flagged a number of concerns. At least 59 species were identified as bycatch or by-
products species, including five species of sea turtles, eight species of marine mammals and 46
species of elasmobranchs. An ecological risk assessment revealed that at least 17 species (including
five species of turtles, the dugong, three species of dolphin and eight species of elasmobranchs) were
60


﻿vulnerable to artisanal fisheries. The assessment also identified the types of nets used by artisanal
fishers which were more harmful that others (multifilament drift gillnets caught more species than
monofilament drift gillnets, and posed a higher risk for dolphins, sea turtles and elasmobranchs) and
which methods had the least impact. In particular, it underlined an urgent need for integrated
regional management of large and mobile marine vertebrates across the LMEs, particularly since
wide-ranging species interact with both coastal and artisanal and oceanic industrial fisheries.
Training on rapid by-catch assessment was held in 2011.
83.   French cofinancing through FFEM supported:
(a) Marine mammals: (i) regional workshop for identification of cetaceans and methodology for
surveys; (ii) surveys at sea (with observers) and operations around cetacean hot spots; and
(b) Marine turtles: (i) regional workshop on sea turtles (tagging methodology and monitoring);
and (ii) start ARGOS surveys from Europa spawning site.
Impact
84.   The results from the studies on biodiversity supported by the Project provided valuable input
for decision-making on fisheries management and the future management plans using the EAF and
other strategies. Unlike the situation at the beginning of implementation, the knowledge base has
expanded and has led to an improved understanding of fisheries and its relationship to biodiversity.
Component 6: Strengthening Reqional and National Fisheries Management.
85.   The objective of this component, to support an emerging regional fisheries management
framework in the SWIO and build capacity in regional and national fisheries management bodies,
has been substantially achieved.
86.   Relevant national and international legislation and other instruments relevant to the Project's
objectives have been identified and areas of harmonization proposed to the SWIOFC. National and
regional resource management structures are operational through the establishment of the NCCs,
RCCs, the RMU, RPSC, and SWIOFC. The national structures are interacting with regional
structures for information sharing, coordination and decision-making. The SWIOFC, the technical
advisory body under the FAO, has been supported to become an effective forum for discussing and
resolving fisheries management issues and actions for the Project; at EOP, a formal proposal was
being considered to increase its role in the region to become a regulatory body. Support to the
SWIOFC was a GEO Key Performance Indicator for the Project. The prospect for establishing a
regional management structure is encouraging.
The project management aspects of this component were coordinated by Kenya.
87.   The key outputs were:
(a) Establishment of a regional management unit and national project offices;
(b) Establishment of National and Regional resource management structures;
(c) Establishment of a functioning working relationship between the Project and the SWIOFC;
(d) EAF Fisheries management plans prepared for nine countries;
61


﻿(e) Assessment of Governance and Policy in the region (includes the review of fisheries
regulations of the SWIO countries); study completed with ASCLME; and
(f) Joint TDA and SAP with ASCLME project (complements the WIO-Lab TDA and SAP).
88.   Implementation under this component was delayed at start-up. The Regional Management
Unit (RMU) was not fully staffed until November 2010 (2.5 years after effectiveness). Personnel
included a Regional Executive Secretary (RES), a Finance Manager, an IT manager, a Ship Logistics
Coordinator (SLC), and an administrative assistant. Until August 2009, the unit was minimally
staffed with an interim RES and administrative assistant. This in turn delayed the implementation of
all components until MTR (March 2011). The main constraint to the effective performance of the
RMU was the slow procurement process.   Overall, however, the RMU, and KMFRI, has been
effective in coordinating with member countries the challenging requirements of a regional and
complex operation.
Capacity strengthening for improved fisheries management planning.
89.   National and regional project offices were established in the first year of implementation
ready to implement Project activities and included nominations of the NCCs, RCCs, and the
establishment of the RMU (although not fully-staffed). Participating countries were able to
complete a substantial number of activities planned for the three phases of the Project:
Phase 1- Data collection and analysis, and identification of data gaps; regional sharing of
information facilitated (i.e., gap analyses, regional fisheries-related databases, training and
coordination);
Phase 2- Collection of new data and information, and establishment of baseline information on fish
stocks, fishing pressure (surveys, observer deployments, research, retrospective analyses);
and
Phase 3- Identification of regional issues to be addressed (joint TDA and SAP);
90.   The RMU provided the overall coordination for project activities, fostered collaboration on
Project activities, and supported strengthening of partnerships with important institutions in the
sector across a complex regional operation. The logistics and coordination required was a daunting
task involving nine countries, multiple programs, diverse interests of different institutions and
donors, and several language requirements (English, French, and Portuguese). Partnerships with the
SWIOFP have been built or reinforced through joint training programs, joint activities (surveys,
cruises), or collaborative exercises (joint analyses and proposals such as the TDA and SAP). The
main partners to the SWIOFP were the ACP FISH II Project, the ASCLME, IOC, EAF-Nansen
Project/FAO/IMR (Norway), IFREMER, IRD, SADC, SWIOFC, and the WWF.

and Aquaculture Department. The concept of "Ecosystem
Approach to Fisheries (EAF)" has been recommended for
implementation by the FAO Committee for Fisheries (COFI).
The purpose is to plan, develop and manage fisheries in a
manner that addresses the multiplicity of societal needs and
desires without jeopardizing options for future generations.

﻿A Project website (www.swiofp.net) has also been developed for disseminating Project documents,
data and information with member countries and the general public. Most Project related outputs
such as meeting reports, technical reports, publications, and linked sites are available, although not
all the information is up to date or contain latest versions of reports.
91.   Reinforcing the regional management structure for resource management. In addition to
the establishment of the national and regional units for managing the Project, the SWIOFP was
represented and actively contributed to SWIOFC decision meetings, carried joint capacity building
activities with institutions such as the IOC and EAF-Nansen project, established working groups on
stock assessment, cruise data analysis, and others, and funded technical training for, e.g., EAF
management plans for each country. SWIOFC provides a technical support to member countries
through its Scientific Committee which reviews and endorses scientific findings/results of the
Project. Member countries jointly participate in all SWIOFC management and technical meetings
and are represented in technical working groups on project activities.
92.    Transforming the SWIOFC   Formed in November 2004, its role was initially built on a
weak agenda for ecosystem-based management of regional fisheries. It acted as an advisory body
for the management and development of fisheries with the EEZ of the SWIO coastal states.
Throughout the project implementation period, however, the Commission has been implicated and
consulted in the implementation of the SWIOFP and ASCLME projects. It provided a technical
review and discussion forum for member countries and endorsed research findings. Currently, there
is a proposal to transform the Commission from an advisory body (under FAO Article VI) to an
advisory and regulatory/managing body (FAO Article XIV), which would greatly aid technical
research data and information to be translated into practical management application. Post
transformation will need additional donor funding.
Implementing the LME-based approach to ecosystem based management.
93.   Review of national fisheries regulations and identification of areas for harmonization. A
regional Governance and Policy Assessment study was carried out jointly with the ASCLME project.
This followed workshops held jointly by SWIOFP and the ASCLME with member countries to
consolidate individual country reports (ASCLME). The study looked at the fisheries policies and
governance issues in the region and its endorsement was sought in several meetings prior to its
finalization. In addition, a review of legislation and harmonization of legislation and protocols,
jointly financed with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has also been produced. It included a review
of Rights-based Management (RBM), an examination of fisheries management plans in the region
with a review of options on ways to improve the SWIOFC.
94.   Development of Fisheries Management Plans. Nine countries have prepared between them,
eleven fisheries management plans in the region, with the assistance of the Project and in partnership
with the EAF Nansen project. The SWIOFP and Nansen project provided back-up mission support,
consultant services, meetings and workshops to help the member countries in preparing the plans
based on the Ecosystem Approach in Fisheries management (EAF) model. The status of fisheries
management plans at EOP are:

Preparation of the fisheries management plans is continuing after Project closing. As of November
2013, at least one additional management plans has been endorsed and their progress will be
monitored by the SWIOFC.
TDA and SAP
95.   The TDA and SAP were prepared jointly with the ASCLME project in 2012. At appraisal, it
was anticipated that the TDA and SAP would be presented as integrated outputs between the three,
linked, LME projects (SWIOFP, ASCLME and WIO-Lab). However, the different implementation
timeframe for the WIO-Lab (2005-2010) and the timeframes for the SWIOFP and ASCLME (March
2013) did not allow for an integrated TDA and SAP. However, WIO-Lab did prepare its own TDA
and SAP and its contents are integrated into the joint ASCLME/ SWIOFP reports. This satisfies a
GEF-IW requirement for a harmonized TDA/SAP across the different LME projects. The Recipient
ICR reported, however, that the linkages between the projects were poor because of the different
implementation pace of each project. The combined ASCLME and SWIOFP TDA and SAP was also
drafted before many of the relevant SWIOFP activities had been completed; hence, the TDA and
SAP relied on a smaller base of fisheries data and information than would have been ideal had the
projects been implemented at the same pace.

﻿Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.    Because the Project was primarily driven by a fisheries research agenda, a rate of return
analysis was not calculated and would not be relevant for this phase. The Project established a
preliminary data inventory and built knowledge of selected target fisheries and species on which to
provide a scientifically valid base for decision-making. These baselines were required to enable
better governance of the fisheries and more sustainable management of an industry that contributes
$2.35 million to GDP annually, for the nine SWIOFP beneficiary countries21. The fisheries and
related industry would likely deteriorate without this succession of interventions.

1. Introduction to the Project
The South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (SWIOFP) Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant
agreement between the Republic of Kenya (on behalf of the participating countries) and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (on behalf of the GEF) was signed on
October 9th 2007, and became effective on 16th April 2008. The project closing date in the grant
agreement was specified as 30th November 2011, but following the Mid-Term Review (MTR) and a
re-alignment of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the grant agreement, the closing date
was changed to the 31st March 2013, with an additional four month completion period to finalise
all project audits and accounts. The total project budget planned during the design was US$22.65
million, with US$12 million provided by the GEF, US$6.68 from participating countries as
counterpart finance, US$2.27 million from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the
EAF Nansen project, US$1 million from the French Global Environment Fund, and US$0.7 million
from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations.
SWIOFP had the overall objective 'To promote the environmentally sustainable use of fish resources
through adoption by countries riparian to the Southwest Indian Ocean of a Large Marine Ecosystem
(LME)-based approach to fisheries management in the Agulhas and Somali LMEs that recognizes
the importance of preserving biodiversity.' This was to be achieved through identification and study
of offshore non-tuna species and their exploitation within the South West Indian Ocean,
development of institutional and human capacity for both fisheries science and management,
development of fisheries management plans at both national and, where appropriate, regional
levels, and mainstreaming biodiversity in fisheries management, policy and legislation. The project
had six main components to achieve these outcomes. Component 1 addressed data and
information technology. Components 2-4 covered assessment and sustainable use of crustacean,
demersal, and pelagic species respectively. Component 5 focused on ecosystems and biodiversity
issues, while Component 6 had responsibility for both the project management structures (e.g. the
Regional and National Management Units) as well as for the preparation of management plans, a
Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA), and a Strategic Action Plan (SAP).

﻿The following countries participated in SWIOFP: Comoros, France (by virtue of its islands in the
region although it is not a beneficiary of the grant agreement), Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa (East Coast only), and the United Republic of Tanzania.
Somalia is also an observer to the project.
2. Information about the ICR and summary results
This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) was prepared by the participating countries, and
facilitated by a consultant recruited for the purpose. Over a three week period during November-
December 2012 the consultant consulted with all countries covered by the project to illicit their
views about the project. With the exception of Reunion for which remote consultation was
completed with the France National Management Unit (NMU), all other countries were visited by
the consultant and meetings were held in person with country NMUs and stakeholders, the RMU,
and other relevant international organisations (e.g. Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the Indian
Ocean Commission, the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission). A stakeholder
questionnaire prepared by the consultant was completed by all NMUs based on facilitation
provided by the consultant. The Regional Management Unit (RMU), The Kenya Marine and
Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), and the South West Indian Ocean Commission also completed
a questionnaire. The completed questionnaires form the basis for the findings presented in this ICR.
In keeping with the participatory nature of the project's design and implementation, this ICR was
thus prepared in a truly participatory manner. Based on the World Bank guidelines for the
completion of ICRs22, the stakeholder questionnaires, and this report, were structured around
three main areas: factors affecting implementation; success in achieving the project objectives; key
lessons learned. Ratings of performance have been provided for key questions are suggested in the
Bank's ICR Guidelines, and a table of the ratings is provided below. The standard deviations for the
answers/ratings to each question are low, and the 'word ratings' shown in the table below using
averages, were found to be the same as those when using a median.

The project design was 'Satisfactory' and generally well conceived, largely due to its participatory
nature, and beneficiary countries all report good involvement in the design process. The
background analysis presented in the PAD is sound, and included a list of relevant policy, legislation
and management documents in each partner country, with a description of the linkages, coherence
and contribution of SWIOFP to them. The analysis also profiled previous projects and those existing
at the time of the design, both to inform the appropriate technical content of the project, as well as
the key lessons learned which were then incorporated in the SWIOFP design. Some of the key
lessons learned and incorporated into the project. Beneficiary countries view the project design as
being well conceived in terms of a phased approach, discrete components dealing with different
issues, and recognition that countries would have different levels of interest in participating in
different components and sub-components. However as noted in the Mid-Term Review (MTR),
Components 5 and 6 were not given sufficient attention in the project design and as a result were
not sufficiently funded at the outset within the overall project budget envelope. The project design
was not overly complex in terms of the institutional structure specified. The functions and
responsibilities at different levels of the institutional structure for the project were clearly and
appropriately defined in the design, along with a clear specification of the relationships between
the different hierarchies. The project design was ambitious in terms of achieving the objectives
specified within the lifespan of the project, but stakeholders generally feel not overly so if the
project had commenced immediately on signature and proceeded without any delays and if
piracy23 had not come to present such a problem during implementation, although an additional
year for implementation might be have been appropriate. One significant problem in the design of
the project was that the PAD planned for implementation of the project over a five year period,
while the grant agreement only provided for a four year project implementation period. This
inconsistency was resolved following the MTR and a re-alignment of the project.
With respect to the design, it is appropriate to highlight the overall approach to implementation
incorporated into the design, whereby the project was implemented by and for staff already part of
the institutions in the region in a truly participatory manner, rather than by external/international
consultants. Given Bank rules which meant that the NCCs and RCCs could not be paid extra monies
to implement project activities, and given existing workloads of government/university staff, this
approach certainly had a negative impact on the speed of project implementation, and to some
extent the motivation to participate in the project. However given the positive aspects of this
overall approach in terms of stakeholder buy-in, capacity development, and support for lasting
regional networks for improvement fisheries management, project beneficiaries feel strongly that
such an approach was on balance preferable to the approach used by other projects (e.g. the
ASCLME) which relied heavily on consultants or larger numbers of technical support staff.
23 Piracy peaked around late 2008, and started regressing late in 2012 just as the project was ending.
74


﻿The PAD provided detail on the perceived risks at the time of the project design, and proposed
some mitigating strategies. The stated risks are clearly articulated and comprehensive. The most
notable risk not considered during the design of the project, and one which could not have been
foreseen during design, was piracy in the region.
Project performance in completing the actions recommended by the MTR, and the usefulness of
the MTR recommendations, are rated as 'Satisfactory'. The MTR of the project was completed in
March 2011 and resulted in a list of 58 specific recommendations, with assigned responsibilities
(most of which were for the participating countries [RMU, NMU, KMFRI] to complete) and
timeframes. Performance in terms of completing the recommendations was good, with forty-seven
of these recommendations completed in full subsequent to the MTR, and a further 3 partially
completed. Beneficiary countries reported that the impact of the recommendations and their
completion, was a positive and marked change in implementation
The M&E for the project is rated as 'Satisfactory', with design, implementation, and utilisation all
individually rated as 'satisfactory'. M&E requirements for the project were specified in the PAD,
and elaborated in greater detail in the Project Implementation Manual. The principal monitoring
reports used by the project as required in the PAD or PIM were: quarterly interim financial reports;
quarterly activity reports; annual audits; and annual progress reports. The quarterly and annual
M&E reports were prepared as required at NMU, RMU and component levels, reviewed and
amalgamated by the RMU which had overall responsibility for monitoring progress, and then
submitted to the World Bank, KMFRI, The Kenyan Treasury, the RPSC, and other relevant
supervisory project structures as appropriate. The project logframe and result/outcome monitoring
framework in the design and Annex 11 of the original version of the PIM was weak, but this was
addressed during the MTR. Post-MTR, the revision of the logframe and indicators allowed for
considerable improvements in tracking the progress of the project, both within the project
institutional structure and by its supervisory bodies (RPSC, KMFRI and the Bank). M&E information
was used well in a feedback loop so as to better improve the likelihood of ultimate project success.
The overall rating for fiduciary aspects and safeguards is 'Satisfactory'. Procurement performance
was moderately satisfactory with some delays experienced by the project, but performance
improved post MTR. Disbursement was satisfactory, and was particularly impressive during the last
2 years of the project. By the end of the project overall disbursement of GEF funds was close to
100% with strong performance was reflected across all 6 components. With respect to
disbursement from i) the EAF Nansen project, ii) FAO, and iii) French funds, actual disbursements
were in excess of those originally budgeted. The financial safeguards associated with the project
were satisfactory, and included the requirements for quarterly financial reports to be provided by
the NMUs and for annual audits of all NMUs and the RMU, and periodic fiduciary assessments
made by the Bank. Performance by NMUs in completing financial reports and audits and submitting
them to the RMU in a timely manner was varied between countries, but improved during the
project as project staff became more familiar with the requirements, as training was provided, and
as the financial management guidelines were clarified and improved. The individual audits
completed did not result in any significant issues or concerns being identified. The project adopted
a flexible and adaptive approach to fund allocations which proved satisfactory, and the annual
budget and planning meetings enabled the project to revise fund allocations as necessary and
based on performance. The financial management guidelines contained within the Financial,
Disbursement and Procurement manual were satisfactory.
The overall rating for partnerships fostered by the project is 'Satisfactory', based on the ratings for
the partnerships achieved by the project with different stakeholder groups outside of the project.
75


﻿These groups included: the ASCLME project; other donors, projects, and international
organisations; with governments in the region through the NMU's; and with NGOs and
stakeholders.
The overall rating for the institutional arrangements for the project and their functioning is
'Satisfactory'. The institutional structure for the project provided for a RMU, and NMUs in each
participating country, with National Component Coordinators (NCCs) for each of the six
components in each of the NMUs. Regional Component Coordinators (RCCs) were nominated for
each of the six components so that for each component one of the NCCs was also the RCC. This
structure was appropriate given the regional nature of the project and different types of activities
to be completed within the different components. KMFRI also played an important role in the
project given that it had responsibility for the special account for the project, and was responsible
for ensuring due diligence in both procurement and disbursement of funds, and for providing
overall supervision of the RMU. For all of these institutions individually, and taken collectively,
performance was disappointing during the first 18 months of the project, but improved markedly in
later years. The reasons for this were because a fully staffed RMU was not in place from the
beginning of the project, and because the project was implemented primarily by government staff
(without additional financial incentives being provided) rather than external consultants. This
meant that progress was initially slowly, and that the capacity of the NCCs and the RCCs and their
engagement with the project was variable. However over time all project participants came to
realise the benefits and successes of the project, and this helped to increase implementation
performance. It is also noteworthy that 91% of the intended co-financing by participating countries
was provided in terms of individual country contributions towards staff salaries and operating
costs.
With regards to sustainability, key outcomes of the SWIOFP have included strengthening of
institutional and human capacity, fostering a regional identity, development of regional protocols
and standards (e.g. for cruises, management plans), and establishing regional networks which were
not present before the project started. These outcomes will themselves serve to support the
sustainability of other project outcomes. Of particular note is that staff working on the project
were staff from, and embedded in, the implementing institutions, rather than being consultants
brought in to implement the project. On completion of the project, stakeholders in the region feel
confident that staff will remain in these institutions, and that the capacity and networks built by
the project, and not previously in existence, will remain. A number of important steps were taken
both by NMUs/countries, and at the regional level, to ensure sustainability of project outcomes.
Nevertheless risks to sustainability of the project's outcomes remain despite the mitigating
strategies and activities completed, and the overall sustainability risk is rated as 'Moderate'.
4. Project Outcomes
Performance in achieving the project outcomes was 'Moderately satisfactory'.

﻿The relevance of the project objectives is rated as 'Satisfactory'. The project objectives were highly
relevant to the needs of both individual beneficiary countries, and the region as a whole. The main
focus of the project objectives on improved management through building capacity, filling research
gaps, and promoting regional networks and collaboration, were strongly supported by
stakeholders. The project objectives were also highly relevant to the Bank's assistance strategy
given the potential long-term impacts on beneficiaries in low income countries. Furthermore, the
objectives were relevant for all the main funders of the project, with the project objectives having
high relevance: for GEF in terms of its International Waters (0P8) and Biodiversity (0P2) focal
areas; for FAO given their advocacy and support for an ecosystems-based approach to fisheries
management; and for both the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French Global
Environment Fund given their focus on capacity development and sustainable management of
resources.
The global project objective was "To promote the environmentally sustainable use of fish
resources through adoption by countries riparian to the Southwest Indian Ocean of a Large Marine
Ecosystem (LME)-based approach to fisheries management in the Agulhas and Somali LMEs that
recognizes the importance of preserving biodiversity)". There were three indicators to measure the
success in achieving the objective, and overall performance in achieving the objective was
'Moderately Satisfactory'.
Overall performance in achieving the four Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and the four
associated indicators is rated as 'Satisfactory'. None of the indicators for the PDOs were well
matched with the second PDO 'to develop institutional and human capacity through training and
career opportunities'. The project performance in developing such capacity was particularly
satisfactory, with many training opportunities provided by the project and with an extensive
programme of funding for MSc students. Indeed many project participants felt that institutional
and human capacity developments, and regional networking, brought about by the project, were
critically important outcomes of the project.
The project certainly generated considerable outcomes in the region, and contributed significantly
to the intended objectives. However, in many cases success in achieving the objectives and
indicators was only partial, with the project having made some progress and having laid the
groundwork for the objectives to be realised, but with full realisation of the objectives only likely
after the lifespan of the project and with additional follow up and action necessary by donors and
stakeholders. The slow start of the project and poor implementation performance in the first 18
months meant that the project was thereafter trying to catch up, and this had a negative impact
both on the project's ability to achieve its objectives, and on the project efficiency with a focus at
times on disbursing monies so as to complete project activities, but without sufficient thought
about the resulting impacts/outcomes/benefits. In hindsight, while there were many positive
examples of project efficiency, there was also considerable expenditure on cruises, Fish
Aggregating Devices (FADs), tagging, and training of observers, which can be considered to have
only marginally contributed to the project's intended outcomes and objectives. Performance in
project efficiency is therefore rated as 'Moderately Satisfactory'.
5. Lessons Learned
Lessons learned from the project design are that:
77


﻿*  A truly participatory design process helps to ensure stakeholder buy-in to the project,
relevance of the project, appropriate institutional mechanisms for implementation, and
suitable levels of complexity;
*   It is easy to specify overly-ambitious objectives given the timeframe allocated for a project
- the SWIOFP could have benefitted from at least one more year for its implementation
given the objectives specified;
*   Having a functioning and fully staffed regional/core management unit from day one of a
project is critical for projects in achieving their intended objectives. If there any concerns
that this may not be the case, then projects should build-in additional time for
implementation and not assume that activities will commence immediately/rapidly
following grant agreement signature. A failure of the SWIOFP to have the RMU in place
from the beginning of the project had a significant negative impact on the project that,
even with good RMU performance in later years, was hard to recover from;
*   Careful thought should be given to the amount of monies allocated to different activities,
so as to ensure that the project is able to fully benefit from them in achieving project
objectives. In the case of the SWIOFP, considerable funds were spent on cruises, with the
project ultimately unable to use many of the outputs in a meaningful/timely manner to
support the project's main objectives (although benefits from the cruises are expected to
be realised post-project);
*   Linking fisheries management projects in their design with regional bodies (as was the case
with SWIOFP linkages with SWIOFC) can provide significant benefits during later project
implementation, as well as contributing to project sustainability post project completion;
*   Involving large numbers of countries (and languages) greatly increases the complexity and
challenges for successful implementation, but can result in very significant benefits in
terms of regional collaboration, networking, and capacity development of institutions and
individuals that may not have existed before. This was certainly the case for the SWIOFP;
*  A regional project such as the SWIOFP which is designed to be implemented primarily by
government staff (without additional financial incentives being provided) is likely to
progress more slowly than one implemented largely by consultants. However, it may also
provide good value for money, and provide more lasting and sustainable improvements
due to the greater stakeholder buy-in and involvement that result from such an approach.
A project design such as for the SWIOFP can ensure that ownership of data and research
remains within, and is shared within, the region. However it is imperative if such an
approach is used, for suitably qualified and motivated individuals to be nominated by
participating governments;
*  A suitably staffed regional management unit is critical for large regional projects such as
SWIOFP. SWIOFPs implementation and the realisation of outcomes would have been
greatly enhanced if the RMU had been staffed with one or two additional technical staff to
support the RCCs, NMUs and NCCs;
*   Using existing institutional structures within a project to pass science information to
national and regional fisheries managers (as was the case for SWIOFP with the use of
government research institutions completing much of the work and feeding information to
fisheries departments and Ministries) provides a strong science/policy linkage;
78


﻿*   Project designs which link projects and assume their parallel implementation can be risky.
The programmatic approach taken to the SWIOFP, the ASCLME and the WIOLaB projects,
with three different implementing agencies, and ultimately differing timeframes for
implementation, created varying degrees of difficulties for all three projects given the
intended integration of many activities, outputs and outcomes; and
*  A strong focus on activities related to marine science is important in underpinning the
achievement of higher level objectives focussing on sustainable fisheries and ecosystems-
based management.
Lessons learned from the project's implementation are that:
*   Good partnerships with other projects, donors and institutions (such as those fostered by
the SWIOFP), are critically important in ensuring success in project implementation, and
ultimately in achieving project objectives;
*  Well designed and implemented     M&E systems, with clearly defined reporting
requirements, logframe and indicators, are invaluable in ensuring successful project
implementation, and in identifying and correcting project deficiencies as they occur. The
SWIOFP experience was positive in this regard, with the M&E system serving project
implementation well;
*   Oversight bodies or steering committees for projects must be suitably rigourous and critical
in their guidance of project activities, and their composition must be of people not involved
directly with project implementation. This was not always the case for the SWIOFP RPSC
during the early years of the project (although was rectified post MTR), and resulted in
some cases in a failure to provide the necessary guidance needed for the project;
*   Mid-Term Reviews must take place at the appropriate stage during a project's lifespan,
with clear recommendations and agreed actions provided (with assigned responsibilities
and timeframes). In the case of the SWIOFP, successful completion of the agreed actions
made a positive difference to many aspects of project implementation;
*   NCCs and RCCs were not always as engaged with the project to the extent they might have
been, largely due to the Bank rules prohibiting additional payments from being made to
government staff. Creative solutions to this problem, while not infringing Bank rules,
should be sought during future projects to better incentivise government staff
participation, and implementing institutions must complete proper staff time management
to ensure that staff are available for project activities. High turnover of project staff (as was
the case for NCCs during the early stages of the project) can also negatively impact on
performance;
*   It is unlikely that any project can ever be implemented exactly as was expected during its
design. Implementing institutions must therefore be flexible and adaptive, as SWIOFP was,
so as to find solutions to problems that arise (e.g. piracy and the use of wet lease vessels
rather than the R/V Dr. Fridtjof Nansen) and to adapt project budgets to needs (e.g.
through the use of budget and work planning meetings). Timeframes for project
implementation should be generous enough to allow for unplanned events; and
*   Procurement processes, if slow or unresponsive to the demands of the project's
participants, can greatly de-motivate project staff and cause problems for implementation
79


﻿progress. SWIOFP procurement problems were largely resolved as the project proceeded,
but could have been better in the early stages of the project.
Lessons learned with respect to project outcomes are that:
*  A strong emphasis by donors, project management units, and project beneficiaries on
disbursement can have a negative impact on efficiency. In the case of the SWIOFP, the
project was very successful at disbursing funds, but could have done more to ensure that
such funds were spent wisely in achieving project outcomes and objectives. In some cases
funds were spent without sufficient thought taking place about the resulting
impacts/outcomes;
*  The SWIOFP's success in achieving the objectives and indicators was only partial (despite
the accrued progress in other areas), with the project having made some progress and
having laid the groundwork for the objectives to be realised. However full realisation of the
objectives is only likely after the lifespan of the project and with additional follow up and
action necessary by donors, stakeholders, and particularly by the SWIOFC (which will
provide a critical role in ensuring sustainability given the linkages established between the
project and the Commission). Ensuring that projects 'hit the ground running' (not the case
for the SWIOFP and perhaps the main reason why objectives were not fully achieved) is
critical in ultimately achieving their stated objectives; and
*   Having project outcomes that are    highly relevant to the  needs of project
stakeholders/participants, as was the case for SWIOFP, is likely to result in strong
stakeholder support for the project, and increase the likelihood of stakeholder buy-in and
motivation in achieving a project's objectives.
