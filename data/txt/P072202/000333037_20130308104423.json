Budget reallocation is necessary mainly to reflect\n            properly illustrate the regional nature of expenses incurred\n            by the project and reduce unnecessary administrative\n            procedures and to, in a lesser extent, reflect changes in\n            means of implementation. Main change in categories is in the\n            consultant services, that increase slightly to reflect needs\n            for more consultant time than expected during November 2011\n            restructuring. The consultants services budget remains\n            however low compared to initial budget, increasing from\n            $1,669,190.33 to $1,822,530.54 compared to $2,827,700 before\n            November 2011 restructuring, since regional collaboration\n            and arrangements permit direct implementation by the staff\n            of participating institutions with limited use of\n            consultants' support."}, "docdt": "2013-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
