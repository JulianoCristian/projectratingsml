                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective relates specifically to assessing the current status of offshore fisheries within the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ?s) of
                         coastal states in the South West Indian Ocean. The project aims to generate scientific knowledge and develop legal and institutional capacity to implement an action
                         plan in order to mange these fisheries for maximum economic returns, consistent with a management strategy that stresses environmental sustainability and socially
                         equitable distribution of the benefits of exploitation. The project will adopt an ecosystem approach which will lead to an improved understanding of transboundary and
                         environmental influences on stock health, the life histories of key species and variability in inter-annual estimates of stock abundance.

                         Outcomes

                         1) A defensible Transboundry Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) of regional fisheries;
                         2) A Strategic Action Plan (SAP) defining how each of the SWIOFP countries propose individually and collectively to address any regional issues identified.
                         3) Development of institutional capacity to better manage the resources identified.

                         Indicators

                         1)   Awareness raised amongst key stakeholders (Coastal States) on the TDA and;
                         2)   TDA recognized by the Coastal Sates;
                         3)   SAP approved by the contracting parties (Coastal States);

                         4)   Coordination and synergy established between regional efforts;
                         5)   Improved analysis of historical, existing and new data.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is advancing satisfactorily for all components. Five databases are now operational and two more are under development, the research cruise program is close
                         to completion despite the constraints generated by the piracy threat. Most of the training activities have been completed and MSc students are being financially supported by the
                         project for SWIOFP-relevant research. SWIOFP supported SWIOFC working group on demersal fisheries in Mombasa (7-18 Nov 2011) and the SWIOFC Scientific Committee in
                         Cape Town, South Africa (27 Feb – 1 March 2012); SWIOFP participated in the 16th Session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission in Australia (16-26 April 2012). Fisheries
                         management plans are under preparation in all the beneficiary countries, and among the nine projected plans three are already in draft. A Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA),
                         inclusive of an ecosystem Monitoring & Evaluation framework, is under preparation and will inform the preparation of a Strategic Action Plan (SAP) to be completed by end of 2012.

                         Clear progress is noted toward achievement of the projects objectives: (i) operational, populated and updated databases, research cruise program results and data analysis support
                         improved knowledge of exploitable fisheries resources; (ii) participating institutions' personnel training and SWIOFP-financed MSc support institutional and capacity building at
                         national and regional levels; (iii) effective use of the Regional Fisheries Body, the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC), by its Member Countries to debate
                         fisheries management supports the materialization of a regional fisheries management structure.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The TDA report will be presented to the SWIOFC Session in September 2012 for adoption, before the Strategic Action Plan (SAP) drafting. The finalized SAP should be presented to
                         Ministers for formal adoption by end of 2012.

                         The SWIOFP (Project) and SWIOFC (Commission) will work together to decide how and on what SWIOFP outputs will be inherited by SWIOFC once SWIOFP activities have been
                         concluded. Outputs include all database piloted by SWIOFP. The matter will be discussed during the SWIOFC Working Parties on statistics in June 2012, and to be raised at
                         SWIOFC Session in September 2012.
