7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The Project Development Objective relates specifically to assessing the current status of offshore fisheries
within the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ?s) of coastal states in the South West Indian Ocean.
The project aims to generate scientific knowledge and develop legal and institutional capacity to implement
an action plan in order to mange these fisheries for maximum economic returns, consistent with a
management strategy that stresses environmental sustainability and socially equitable distribution of the
benefits of exploitation. The project will adopt an ecosystem approach which will lead to an improved
understanding of transboundary and environmental influences on stock health, the life histories of key
species and variability in inter-annual estimates of stock abundance.Outcomes 1) A defensible
Transboundry Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) of regional fisheries; 2) A Strategic Action Plan (SAP) defining
how each of the SWIOFP countries propose individually and collectively to address any regional issues
identified. 3) Development of institutional capacity to better manage the resources identified. Indicators
1) Awareness raised amongst key stakeholders (Coastal States) on the TDA and; 2) TDA recognized by
the Coastal Sates; 3) SAP approved by the contracting parties (Coastal States); 4) Coordination and
synergy established between regional efforts; 5) Improved analysis of historical, existing and new data.
