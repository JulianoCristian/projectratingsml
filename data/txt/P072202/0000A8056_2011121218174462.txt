                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective relates specifically to assessing the current status of offshore fisheries within the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ?
                         s) of coastal states in the South West Indian Ocean. The project aims to generate scientific knowledge and develop legal and institutional capacity to implement
                         an action plan in order to mange these fisheries for maximum economic returns, consistent with a management strategy that stresses environmental
                         sustainability and socially equitable distribution of the benefits of exploitation. The project will adopt an ecosystem approach which will lead to an improved
                         understanding of transboundary and environmental influences on stock health, the life histories of key species and variability in inter-annual estimates of stock
                         abundance.

                         Outcomes

                         1) A defensible Transboundry Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) of regional fisheries;
                         2) A Strategic Action Plan (SAP) defining how each of the SWIOFP countries propose individually and collectively to address any regional issues identified.
                         3) Development of institutional capacity to better manage the resources identified.

                         Indicators

                         1)   Awareness raised amongst key stakeholders (Coastal States) on the TDA and;
                         2)   TDA recognized by the Coastal Sates;

                         3)   SAP approved by the contracting parties (Coastal States);
                         4)   Coordination and synergy established between regional efforts;
                         5)   Improved analysis of historical, existing and new data.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation has accelerated and most historical problems have been addressed and progress is globally satisfactory for all components. Important progress is noted
                         toward achievement of the projects objectives: (i) databases are operational and populated, research cruises and data analysis support improved knowledge of exploitable fisheries
                         resources; (ii) participating institutions' personnel training and SWIOFP-financed MSc support institutional and capacity building at national and regional levels; (iii) effective use by
                         the Member Countries of the Regional Fisheries Body, SWIOFC, to debate fisheries management supports the materialization of a regional fisheries management structure. The
                         SWIOFC should soon be supported by SWIOFP-generated knowledge for the development of a Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) and a Strategic Action Plan (SAP), for
                         which preparation process has effectively started.
