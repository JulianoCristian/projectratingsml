                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective relates specifically to assessing the current status of offshore fisheries within the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ?s) of
                         coastal states in the South West Indian Ocean. The project aims to generate scientific knowledge and develop legal and institutional capacity to implement an action
                         plan in order to mange these fisheries for maximum economic returns, consistent with a management strategy that stresses environmental sustainability and socially
                         equitable distribution of the benefits of exploitation. The project will adopt an ecosystem approach which will lead to an improved understanding of transboundary and
                         environmental influences on stock health, the life histories of key species and variability in inter-annual estimates of stock abundance.Outcomes 1) A defensible
                         Transboundry Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) of regional fisheries; 2) A Strategic Action Plan (SAP) defining how each of the SWIOFP countries propose individually and
                         collectively to address any regional issues identified. 3) Development of institutional capacity to better manage the resources identified. Indicators 1) Awareness raised
                         amongst key stakeholders (Coastal States) on the TDA and; 2) TDA recognized by the Coastal Sates; 3) SAP approved by the contracting parties (Coastal States); 4)
                         Coordination and synergy established between regional efforts; 5) Improved analysis of historical, existing and new data.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A key project result resides in its contribution in the strengthening of the SWIOFC role and the decision of the participating countries to transform the SWIOFC into a Regional
                         Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) of the SWIO Coastal States, that would be competent for their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and for living marine resources, without
                         prejudice to the management responsibilities and authority of other competent fisheries and other living marine resources management organizations or arrangements in the area e.g.
                         IOTC - Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and SIOFA – Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Arrangement. The transformation of SWIOFC into a RFMO provides an important basis for
                         future interventions in the sector. Partners are engaged in discussion on a regional program, SWIOFish, that will build upon the success of SWIOFP and other initiatives.

                         Participating countries have agreed on starting the negotiation process for transforming SWIOFC in a RFMO, and made a specific request to the Bank and the Global Environment
                         Facility (GEF) for a Medium Size Project (MSP) to support this process. The countries also agreed on Mozambique’s proposal to host the future headquarter of the SWIOFC.
                         Mozambique has confirmed its intention to finance the SWIOFC building with an IDA allocation under the SWIOFish. Kenya has agreed to continue to manage, through KMFRI, the
                         project’s databases as Seychelles agreed to host a mirror server for these databases. Project sustainability risk seems consequently moderate to low.

                         Other key results reside in knowledge base improvement on the fisheries of the region, capacity strengthening, biodiversity mainstreaming in fisheries management through
                         promotion of the Ecosystem Approach in Fisheries management (EAF), but also in the building up of a strong coherence between the countries of the region.

                         Key project products have been delivered: (i) the Strategic Action Plan (SAP) has been submitted to the High Policy Review Committee and to the countries, and endorsement has
                         started with support of the GEF-financed sister-project ASCLME (Agulhas and Somali Currents Large Marine Ecosystem Project), which has been extended for this purpose, since
                         SAP production and endorsement is an ASCLME responsibility; (ii) an Ecosystem Monitoring & Evaluation framework was endorsed by the SWIOFC Members and will be reviewed
                         by the SWIOFC Scientific Committee for final adoption by SWIOFC during their next meetings; (iii) 11 fisheries management plans, based on EAF, have been prepared of which two
                         (2) are already formally adopted (Tanzania, Madagascar); (iv) the fisheries legislation harmonization report has been finalized and supports the on-going fisheries laws’ reviews in
                         most of the beneficiary countries (e.g., Seychelles, Mauritius, Kenya, Tanzania, Comoros and Madagascar). Mozambique has already adopted a new fisheries law.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The SWIOFC Members decided to consider transforming the Commission from an FAO Article VI body with only advisory role into an FAO Article XIV body with a wide advisory role
                         and a regulatory role that may make recommendations relating to fisheries conservation and management binding on their Membership. During the SWIOFC Extraordinary Session in
                         February 2013, countries have agreed on starting the negotiation process for transforming SWIOFC in a RFMO, and made a specific request to the Bank and the Global Environment
                         Facility (GEF) for a Medium Size Project (MSP) to support this process. The countries also agreed on Mozambique’s proposal to host the future headquarter of the SWIOFC.
                         Mozambique has confirmed its intention to finance the SWIOFC building with an IDA allocation under a future BAnk and GEF-financed regional fisheries program (SWIOFish). Kenya
                         has agreed to continue to manage, through KMFRI, the project’s databases as Seychelles agreed to host a mirror server for these databases. Project sustainability risk seems
                         consequently moderate to low.

                         The Members also agreed to create a Working Group on Tuna Management, without prejudice to the management responsibilities and authority of the Indian Ocean Tuna
                         Commission, the competent regional fisheries management organization (RFMO) for tuna management in the region.
