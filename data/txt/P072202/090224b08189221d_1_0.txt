                         The project implementation has accelerated, despite re-emergence of regional procurement issue under Kenya national system (i.e., important delays in procurement), in part
                         because the RMU was able to hire consultants under the sister-project ASCLME and progress is therefore globally satisfactory for all components. Clear progress is noted toward
                         achievement of the project’s objectives: (i) seven regional databases are operational and updated, the research cruise program is almost completed and data generated support
                         improved knowledge of exploitable fisheries resources and serve management purpose; (ii) most of the Gaps Analysis and Retrospective Analysis are completed as well as the

                         Regional By-Catch Assessment report; (iii) the scientific cruise survey program is almost completed despite constraints generated by the piracy threats, and weather and technical
                         constraints, (iv) participating institutions' personnel benefited from training, as SWIOFP-financed MSc students who, in return, support the project research program; (v) number of
                         published articles and report based on SWIOFP activities increases regularly; (vi) review of national fisheries regulations and identification of areas where changes and harmonization
                         is needed took place together with ASCLEM sister-project, and (vii) participating countries regularly debate fisheries management in the frame the Regional Fisheries Body, SWIOFC.
                         Observers deployment for monitoring fisheries interaction with non-consumptive marine resources suffers from constraints such as piracy, absence of port call from industrial fleets
                         and structured National Observer Programme, however adaptive strategy are being implemented or envisaged to collect the relevant information e.g., port data collection, observer
                         on-board research vessels.

                         The SWIOFP and ASCLME prepared jointly a Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) of the Large Marine Ecosystems of the Western Indian Ocean. The process for finalizing a
                         Strategic Action Plan (SAP) has been agreed and a draft SAP prepared that will be presented in all participating countries before end of year. A regional Monitoring and Evaluation
                         plan including environmental status has been prepared and submitted to the SWIOFC Session, and will be reviewed by SWIOFC Scientific Committee for final adoption. The
                         Ecosystem Approach for Fisheries Management (EAF) approach supported the preparation of management plans (10), some with potential for regional coordination (e.g., for small
                         pelagic resources between Kenya and Tanzania). Progress towards achievement of the GEO is consequently rated Satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The SWIOFC Members decided to consider transforming the Commission from an FAO Article VI body with only advisory role into an FAO Article XIV body with a wide advisory role
                         and a regulatory role that may make recommendations relating to fisheries conservation and management binding on their Membership. Option and costs for such transformation will
                         be presented and reviewed in the SWIOFC Extraordinary Session to take place by February-March 2013.

                         The Members also agreed to create a Working Group on Tuna Management, without prejudice to the management responsibilities and authority of the Indian Ocean Tuna
                         Commission, the competent regional fisheries management organization (RFMO) for tuna management in the region.

                         The SWIOFP (Project) and SWIOFC (Commission) agreed on outputs to be inherited by SWIOFC once project activities have been concluded. Outputs include all database piloted
                         by SWIOFP. The databases will be hosted by Kenya and a mirror server could be created in another SWIOFC country. The cost for maintaining the database in their present status
                         and will be discussed during the next SWIOFC Extraordinary Session in February - March 2013.
