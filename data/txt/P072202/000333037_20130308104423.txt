                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

  A. SUMMARY

1. The South West Indian Ocean Fisheries project (SWIOFP) is a GEF-funded Project
($12 million) which was approved by the Board on June 28, 2007 and became effective
on April 16, 2008. The revised Closing Date is March 31, 2013. In addition to the main
GEF support, the project benefits from parallel financing from the French Global
Environment Facility (FFEM); Norway (FAO/EAF Nansen Project); and FAO (South
West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission).
2. The SWIOFP is one of three linked projects that address resource management in two
separate Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) in the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO). The
core project consists of the Agulhas and Somali Currents Large Marine Ecosystems
Project (ASCLME) implemented by the UNDP. The ASCLME Project, along with the
associated Western Indian Ocean Land Based Impacts on the Marine Environment
Project (WIO-LaB) implemented by UNEP and SWIOFP, aims at providing descriptive
information about the targeted LMEs and to develop a common Transboundary
Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) and Strategic Action Plan (SAP) to the three sister-projects.
3. The SWIOFP Global Environmental Objective (GEO) is to promote the
environmentally sustainable use of fish resources through adoption by SWIO-riparian
countries of a LME-based ecosystem approach to fisheries management in the Agulhas
and Somali LMEs that recognizes the importance of preserving biodiversity.
4. The project objectives are to (i) identify and study exploitable offshore fish stocks
within the Project Area, and differentiate between environmental and anthropogenic
impacts on shared fisheries; (ii) develop institutional and human capacity through
training and career building; (iii) develop a regional fisheries management structure and
associated harmonized legislation; and (iv) mainstream biodiversity in national fisheries
management policy and through national participation in regional organizations that
promote sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources.
5. SWIOFP provided the ASCLME with the necessary information to prepare the
common TDA and SAP.
6. The SWIOFP comprises six components:
Component 1: Data gap analysis, data archiving and information technology including (i)
Fisheries data collection and evaluation; (ii) Compiling of a data atlas; and (iii)
establishment of information technology, data handling and communications systems.
Component 2: Assessment and sustainable utilization of crustaceans including (i)
assessment of deep-water crustaceans; and (ii) assessment of shallow-water crustaceans.
Component 3: Assessment and sustainable utilization of demersal fishes including (i)
assessment of deep-water demersal fish; and (ii) assessment of shallower water fish.
Component 4: Assessment and sustainable utilization of pelagic fish including (i)
assessment of large pelagic species; (ii) assessment of small pelagic species and (iii)
assessment of super-small pelagic species.

                                           4
Component 5: Mainstreaming biodiversity in national and regional fisheries management
including (i) assessing the state of knowledge of non-consumptive resources and marine
biodiversity; (ii) identification of key biodiversity values; (iii) identification of interaction
with fisheries including by-catch and (iv) identification of bio-indicators of ecosystem
health.
Component 6: Strengthening regional and national fisheries management, including (i)
identification of relevant national and international legislation and other instruments
relevant to the SWIOFP goal; (ii) harmonization of legislation between countries; and
(iii) development of regional resource management structures and capacity.
7. The project is managed by Kenya, which acts on behalf of all the participating
countries, and it is implemented through an independent Regional Management Unit
(RMU), based in Kenya, and National Management Units (NMU) in the participating
countries. The South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) acts as the
Regional Policy and Steering Committee (RPSC) of the project.
8. The change proposed in this restructuring paper is a reallocation of proceeds. This
change is necessary to properly illustrate the regional nature of expenses incurred by the
project and reduce unnecessary administrative procedures, and for this purpose it is
proposed to pool expenses into the regional sub-categories (RMU) rather than spread
over the various beneficiary countries sub-categories. This regional budget pooling has
been discussed and agreed to with the project’s governing body (the RPSC hosted by the
SWIOFC), consisting of representatives of all participating countries, and the Bank.

9. Minor budget reallocation is also necessary due to a need to re-adjust amounts for each
budget category and components so as to reflect the realities of project and to achieve the
GEO. The changes mainly relate increasing allocation for Consultant Services and
decreasing the other categories, and adjustment of component budget.

10. The GEO and associated outcome targets remain the same and are achievable.

   B. PROJECT STATUS

11. The current GEO performance rating is Satisfactory since important acceleration and
progress have been observed in project implementation, and most historical delays have
been offset. There is no outstanding audit report.
12. To date, the SWIOFP project has contributed to recent progress made in biological
research, strengthened regional networking and improved collaboration in the socio-
economic, environmental and geopolitical dimensions. The project has built real
momentum notably in training civil servants and students from all over the region, in
stock assessments, in research cruise deployment and in regional databases development.
Worth mentioning are the MSc courses that have proved to be excellent instruments in
supporting capacity development and project activities at low cost. A regional fisheries
management structure is materializing through the effective use of the South West Indian
Ocean Fisheries Commission as a platform to discuss information on fisheries
development and management, and member countries recently agreed to transform the
Commission from an advisory body under FAO Article VI, to a management body under
FAO Article XIV.

                                               5
13. Improved knowledge of exploitable fisheries resources has been supported by gap
analyses for the four main groups of species (crustaceans, demersal, pelagic and non-
consumptive species), 33 research cruises, and implementation of seven (7) regional
databases (bibliographic, fisheries statistics, cruise data management for active and static
gear, small scale fisheries inventory and observer data) and more than six (6) peer-
reviewed scientific papers1.
14. Improved institutional and human capacity has been supported by various training
including Turtle Tagging and Monitoring, Stock Assessment, Observers, Ecosystem
Approach in Fisheries management, and financing provided to 18 Master of Sciences
(MSc) students and 2 Bachelor of Sciences (BSc).
15. Improved regional fisheries management structure has been supported fueling the
regional fisheries body, the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission’s (SWIOFC)
Scientific Committee with research data and using the SWIOFC as the Regional & Policy
Steering Committee of the project, consequently reinforcing the role of SWIOFC as a
platform to debate fisheries information and management and supporting the
materialization of a regional fisheries management structure. Twelve (12) SWIOFC
meetings have taken place since the project started. The project also supported the
Beneficiary Countries to develop a common understanding of and position on tuna
management in preamble of sessions of the regional fisheries management organization
for tuna fisheries, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), and SWIOFC member
countries agreed to create a specific Working Group to discuss tuna matters.
16. Mainstreaming of biodiversity in fisheries management has been supported by the
definition of fisheries and environmental indicators to be used in the future by the
Beneficiary Countries for monitoring ecosystem health, the training of fisheries managers
in Ecosystem Approach in Fisheries management (EAF), the development of 11 EAF
fisheries management plans and the preparation of a Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis
(TDA) and a Strategic Action Plan (SAP) for the region.

    C. PROPOSED CHANGES

        Financing

17. Budget reallocation is necessary mainly to reflect properly illustrate the regional
nature of expenses incurred by the project and reduce unnecessary administrative
procedures and to, in a lesser extent, reflect changes in means of implementation.

18. Due to the regional nature of expenses incurred by the project, and to reduce
unnecessary administrative procedures such as requesting authorization to overdrawn on
country categories, it is proposed to pool expenses into the regional sub-categories
(RMU) rather than spread them over the various beneficiary countries sub-categories. As
a matter of fact, expenses charged against country categories are not illustrative of
national expenses but expenses done in a country for the region. At time, one country
may seem to have spent beyond set budget yet the expenditure may be regional in nature

 19. Change in means of implementation consists in use of more consultant time than
 estimated during the November 2011’s restructuring and use of the Regional
 Management Unit (RMU) and component 6 instead of National Management Units
 (NMUs) and technical components, i.e., components 1 to 5.

 20. The increase of the regional and national fisheries management budget (component 6)
 illustrates greater use of regional mechanisms and implementation of cross-cutting
 activities compared to the original budget. Increase is possible by the transfer of the
 financing from the technical components (1 to 4), for which expenses have been lower
 than expected.

 21. Main change in categories is in the Consultant Services, that increases slightly to
 reflect needs for more consultant time than expected during November 2011
 restructuring. The Consultants Services budget remains however low compared to initial
 budget, increasing from $1,669,190.33 to $1,822,530.54 compared to $2,827,700 before
 Nov. 2011 restructuring, since regional collaboration and arrangements permit direct
 implementation by the staff of participating institutions with limited use of consultants’
 support.

 2.      The current GEO performance rating is Satisfactory since most historical delays
 have been offset. There is no outstanding audit report. The SWIOFP project has
 contributed to recent progress made in biological research, strengthened regional
 networking and improved collaboration in the socio-economic, environmental and
 geopolitical dimensions. The project has built real momentum notably in training civil
 servants and students from all over the region, in stock assessments, in research cruise
 deployment and in regional databases development. Worth mentioning are the MSc
 courses that have proved to be excellent instruments in supporting capacity
 development and project activities at low cost. A regional fisheries management
 structure is materializing through the effective use of the South West Indian Ocean
 Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) as a platform to discuss information on fisheries
 development and management, and member countries recently agreed to transform the
 Commission from an advisory body under FAO Article VI, to a management body
 under FAO Article XIV.

 3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to mainly to reflect properly illustrate the
 regional nature of expenses incurred by the project and reduce unnecessary
 administrative procedures and to, in a lesser extent, reflect changes in means of
 implementation. Due to the regional nature of expenses incurred by the project, and to
 reduce unnecessary administrative procedures such as requesting authorization to
 overdrawn on country categories, it is proposed to pool expenses into the regional sub-
 categories (RMU). As a matter of fact, expenses charged against country categories are
 not illustrative of national expenses but expenses done in a country for the region. At
 time, one country may seem to have spent beyond set budget yet the expenditure may be
 regional in nature covering expenses of participants from all the beneficiary countries
 (e.g. regional workshop, survey). Change in means of implementation consists in use of
 more consultant time than estimated during the November 2011’s restructuring and use
 of the Regional Management Unit (RMU) and component 6 instead of National
 Management Units (NMUs) and technical components, i.e., components 1 to 5.
