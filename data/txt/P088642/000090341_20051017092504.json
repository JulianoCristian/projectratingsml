(ii)\n            This component will support the expansion of the existing\n            basic package of maternal and child health services, and the\n            strengthening of nutritional interventions. (iii) This\n            component will support the National Civil Registry (RNPN) in\n            expanding legal access to basic education and health\n            services in the 100 municipalities targeted under the Red\n            Solidaria.
