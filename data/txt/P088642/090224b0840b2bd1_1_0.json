One of the most critical\n            challenges for development faced by El Salvador was to\n            strengthen the poor populations. The project supported\n            Conditional Cash Transfer Program, which encouraged\n            extremely poor households to send the five to fifteen years\n            old children to preschool and primary education. It expanded\n            the supply of basic health and nutrition services,\n            strengthened community-based health care interventions to\n            prevent chronic malnutrition amongst the poor. It ensured\n            that all target household members were incorporated into the\n            vital statistics bureau and have the necessary personal\n            identification documents to access basic public services."}, "docdt": "2007-03-06T08:15:05Z"}
