of\n            Botswana's economy. The project would provide 500\n            primary school classrooms and 31 new, replacement or\n            upgraded junior secondary schools, especially in rural areas\n            where school facilities are often inadequate and\n            overcrowded, besides textbooks and library books. Through\n            the financing of two new vocational training centers and an\n            industrial trade testing center, the project would provide\n            timely support for the establishment of a national program\n            of apprenticeship training and trades testing with which\n            most of the major agencies and private enterprises will\n            progressively be involved."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
