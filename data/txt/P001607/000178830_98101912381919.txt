I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy and Performance
1.01      At independence in 1964, Malawi's industrial sector was practically
limited to tobacco and tea processing on a few agricultural estates. From
that narrow base, industry has expanded and diversified at a remarkable
pace into a vhriety of import-substituting and food - processing activities.
Until 1973, industrial production 1/ grew by an average rate of 13% per year,
about twice as fast as the overall GDP in constant terms. Between 1973 and
1976, its growth was more irregular averaging 5% per year, due primarily to
the rerouting of trade with Rhodesia, but signs of a strong recovery appeared
in 1977 (para 1.16). Overall from 1964 to 1976, the industrial sector has
contributed 18% of the GDP increment and increased its share of GDP from 13%
to 17% 2/. This industrial growth has been fuelled mostly by import substitu-
tion industries with export oriented manufacturing activities taking a rela-
tively small role; they represent only a marginal contribution - 1.6% - 3/
to total exports. In 1976, industry provided average earnings per employee
of K36 per month, 3.3 times higher than agriculture, to 54,500 employees
or 21% of the national wage employment among enterprises with more than 20
employees. Together with an estimated employment of 35,000 people in smaller
enterprises, industry thus accounted for about 5% of the active population
estimated at 1.7 million. By comparison, agriculture, which is by far the
largest sector of the economy, contributes about 40% of the total paid employ-
ment, 46% of total GDP and 94% of exports 4/.
1.02      The industrial sector appears to have a good record of efficiency
and profitability. The latest reliable available data on the industrial
sector dates from 1973, when a comprehensive survey of the 164 existing in-
dustrial enterprises with more than 20 employees was made by the National
Statistical Office (NSO). The survey showed a net profit before tax averaging
1/   It includes, essentially, manufacturing and construction.
2/   If only manufacturing activities are considered, these percentages are
about 9% to 13% respectively.
3/   This percentage excludes the industrial processing of a few major
agricultural crops (mainly sugar, tobacco and tea).
4/   Four main crops account for almost 90% of exports:  tobacco - 48%,
tea - 20%, sugar - 13% and groundnuts - 8%.

averaging up to 24% of fixed assets and 13% of total assets over the whole
sector, indicating a rather good performance. According to this survey, the
Malawian industry also appears as one of the most labour-intensive in Africa
with fixed assets averaging K1330 per employee in 1973. Productivity is
satisfactory with a net value-added of K840 per employee. For the period
after 1973, the evidence suggests that this good record of profitability and
labor intensiveness has been maintained in the more recent years. Indeed,
industrialists report that dividend payments above 10% of equity after tax are
common, and these high returns are confirmed by the recent performance of the
companies financed by INDEBANK (paras 4.05 to 4.07). Concerning industry's
labor intensiveness, on the basis of the list of licenses for new industrial
projects (para 1.10), the ratio of project capital costs to number of jobs
created has increased notably in 1970-1975 but still remains rather low with
an average of slightly above K9,000 for new investments in the period 1974-77.
1.03      Official statistics available on capital formation up to 1973 show
an acceleration of industrial investment in the early 1970s, particularly for
import substitution of consumer goods. The gross fixed capital formation in
manufacturing increased from 11% of the national total in 1970 to 19% or K13
million in 1973. For the period 1974-76, investments do not seem to have
grown significantly. Indeed, although no statistics are available for the
period after 1973 an indication of this lack of growth is apparent in examin-
ing the licenses issued to new industrial investments from 1974-76. The main
reason for this relative tapering off is the negative impact of the external
factors described in para 1.15 on the investment climate. In 1977, however,
and as a result of the improvement of the overall situation, industrial
investments have picked up (paras 1.16-1.17).
Structure
1.04      Sectoral Distribution.  In 1976 industrial production came mostly
Erom manufacturing (72%) and construction (28%). According to the 1973 NSO
survey, manufacturing production had spread out from the traditional process-
ing of tobacco - 13% and tea - 7%, to engage in food processing - 16%
(sugar, meat, grain milling, bakeries and canning); textiles, clothing and
footwear - 17% (including cotton fibers for export); beverages - 10%; metal
works and assembly engineering - 8%; drugs and cosmetics - 8%; sawmilling and
wood furniture - 7%; paper and printing - 6%; and non-metallic minerals also
6%.
1.05      In recent years, production in these subsectors has been differently
affected by the evolution of the external factors described in para 1.15.
However, over the same period, the most significant change was a large in-
crease in sugar production (13% of domestic exports), which became the third
major export, after tobacco and tea. The importance of sugar processing
is likely to continue with the implementation of the large Dwangwa Sugar
Project (para 1.17). In addition, on the basis of the licenses issued in the
period 1974-77, an increasing number of new production units have been created
in the agricultural implements and engineering, and motor and vehicle assembly
activities - representing 34% and 18% of new project's investments through
these last years, excluding the Dwangwa Sugar project.



1.06      Geographical Distribution.  Industry is heavily concentrated in the
Southern Region. In 1975, industry employed 25% of the wage earners in the
Southern Region but only 15% in the Central Region and 13% in the Northern
Region. The Southern Region comprised three-fourths of industrial employment
and Blantyre alone one half. Within industry, manufacturing is more skewed
than construction in favor of the Southern Region which includes up to 90% of
all manufacturing employees 1/.
1.07      Ownership Pattern.  At independence, local entrepreneurship was
virtually absent and British owned firms dominated the industry. Because
of the poverty and the low level of savings in the country, only a few indi-
vidual Malawian entrepreneurs have slowly emerged in the small scale industry.
Most of the industrial investment has been contributed by a few larger local
enterprises with strong Government support and participation, and with
complementary foreign financing: the private holding company Press Holding
Ltd (paras 2.13-2.14), the parastatal for crop marketing ADMARC (paras 2.11-
2.12), the publicly owned Malawi Development Corporation (paras 2.09-2.10) and
its trading subsidiary Import-Export Ltd. (para 2.15). Strengthened by the
profitability of their investments, these four companies have gradually placed
the larger part of the industrial sector under majority Malawian ownership,
with the major exception of textiles. Through a complex system of interlock-
ing participations and joint ventures, they are now estimated to own more than
half of the industrial sector in Malawi.
1.08      Most of the managerial and specialized technical positions in the
large industries are still occupied by expatriates, frequently under a tech-
nical assistance contract with a minority foreign partner. In 1977, the 215
industrial firms with more than 10 employees licensed by the Ministry of
Industry were employing 600 expatriates, that is about three per firm or 1.2%
of their total employment. The lack of local managerial and technical skills
is an increasing constraint to industrial development. The main vehicle for
vocational training in industry and commerce, at present, is the Polytechnic
of the University of Malawi, with a staff of 85 full-time teachers. Apart
from its 500 students in University courses, mostly in engineering and
business, it accommodates an average of 800 students in apprentice courses
(welding, motor vehicle repairs and maintenance, secretarial, etc.) and
provides evening classes, in Blantyre and in its two branches, in basic
business and industrial skills to about 2,000 students per year. The next
three year development programme of the Government provides for a large
increase in education expenditures (from 2.4% of total expenditure to 5%),
and places its main emphasis on vocational training in the specialities most
needed by the industry: accounting, engineering and management. 2/
1/   Corresponds to all enterprises with more than 20 employees.
2/   Indeed, the Polytechnic plans to:  (a) start an engineering - Master's
equivalent - degree and, (b) prolong the Business degree up to a
chartered accountant equivalent.



-4-
Government Policies
1.09      General Development Policies.  Since independence the Government
has applied a pragmatic and consistent industrial policy. Its main prin-
ciples, set out in the DEVPOL (Development Policy 1971-1980) 1/, are to
encourage private investment in industry, support promotion of Malawian
entrepreneurhip and place emphasis on a better regional distribution of
investments. Strong emphasis has been placed on the need for private, com-
petitive and profitable companies which are viewed as the main motor of
growth in industry.  To attract foreign investors, Malawi has pursued and
publicized continuously since independence a liberal policy allowing free
repatriation of profits and, eventually, disinvestments. In view of Malawi's
landlocked situation, the priority has focused on the development of indus-
tries based on local resources and aiming at self-sufficiency in basic goods
(food, clothing, building materials, etc.).
1.10      Licensing.  The main control instrument on new investments is the
licensing by the Ministry of Industry under the 1966 Industrial Development
Act, which applies to all industries employing more than 10 persons or using
more than 25 horse-power. Its main purpose is to regulate investments by
sector and, in particular, avoid investments: (i) in a few domestic markets
already saturated; clothing, metal sheets, (ii) below the minimum efficient
scale or (iii) requiring large imports in relation to the value-added.
Licenses are seldom denied (11% of applications in 1977) but applicants rather
are persuaded to modify their projects. In addition, the licensing system is
used selectively to encourage the development of Malawian entrepreneurs.
1.11      Incentives Systems.  Industrialists benefit from a wide range of tax
and customs duty incentives. They may apply for the following tax deductions
which are most often granted automatically: (i) 10% of new plant and equip-
ment costs (ii) all expenditures incurred during the 18 months prior to the
start of operations, and (iii) a large initial depreciation at the rates of
10% on buildings and 20% on new plant and equipment. They may also request
the following customs duty incentives which are negotiated on a case by case
basis: (i) concessionary duty rates on machinery imports for important
projects (5% in general and duty free for imports from the Commonwealth and
EEC), (ii) variable tariff protection from imports for major investments
and (iii) rebates of duties on parts and raw materials imported for further
processing in selected industries. This incentives system has been applied
selectively and, as a result, the level of protection remains rather limited
compared with other developing countries. Indeed, high duty rates exist only
in a few sectors: 35% for cotton fabrics and 30% for clothing, furniture and
wheat flour. Manufacturers of export commodities are automatically granted a
full drawback of duties on parts and raw materials.
1/   DEVPOL is a statement of intent with targets and priorities for develop-
ment, implemented through three year roll-over public investment programs,
revised annually.



1.12      Price Control.  The Government applies a flexible and limited price
control system. Maximum retail prices are set only for a few essential con-
sumer goods (meat, sugar, matches), but for most other locally manufactured
products, the Ministry of Industry issues "recommended" retail prices, which
are generally observed although not legally binding. Both controlled and
recommended prices are reviewed regularly in consultation with the industries.
Usually manufacturers consult with the Ministry before increasing prices and
price increases are generally granted if they can be justified by higher costs
of production or imports. This rather flexible policy is complementary to the
Government's policy limiting wage increases to productivity increases. It
does not, thus, appear to have represented an undue burden on industrialists.
1.13      Government Institutions.  Central Government institutions exercise a
relatively modest role on industrial development except in the general formu-
lation of overall policies and through the day to day administration of the
licensing system. The Economic Planning Division at the President's office
defines the overall planning and policy formulation in the context of the
DEVPOL. Its influence on the decision-making process for individual indus-
trial projects appears to be, though, rather limited. The Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Tourism is the administrator of the licensing and incentives
system and, thus, formulates the Government's position on a license applica-
tion. In addition it plays a promotional role in pushing ideas for the
implementation of individual projects, having, thus, the major influence in
the day to day activities of the country's industrial sector. Finally, the
Ministry of Finance (Economic Affairs Division) plays the usual - and crucial
- role of financial planning for the specific development projects through its
overall control of funding for public institutions, Government bodies and
international financiers.
Recent Developments
1.14      After the initial period of fast expansion Malawi's manufacturing
production has been hampered by several external factors in the recent years.

2/   Based on the first eleven months of 1976 and 1977.
3/   The increase in the total output share in 1970-1976 is mostly due
to surgar processing which NSO includes in this category.
1.15      In 1974, excessive rains for the estate crops caused a decline in
the output of export industries, and the disruption of the trading routes
between Malawi and the Indian Ocean ports due to the political situation
in Mozambique also caused a decline in the output of the intermediate goods
industries, more sensitive to supply conditions. As a result, the growth
rate of the total manufacturing output fell to 5.8% in that year. In 1975,
as the weather improved and trade through Mozambique resumed, there was a
strong recovery as indicated by a 15.4% growth rate. In 1976, however, the
closure of the border between Mozambique and Rhodesia cut the traditional
trading route to Rhodesia and South Africa which accounted together for 36% of



- 7 -
Malawi imports in 1975. Manufacturers had to reroute their supplies by air
or through the Mozambique ports which became congested with the resulting
delays in bringing raw materials and equipment. This was compounded by the
foreign exchange crisis which followed the withdrawal of Malawian miners
from South Africa. Thus, the total manufacturing production declined for
the first time since independence.
1.16      In 1977, most industries appeared to have completed the rerouting
of their supplies and resumed normal production, albeit with higher costs of
raw materials and inventories. Industrialists were also reporting shorter
delays in processing supplies through the Mozambique ports than in 1976.
These improvements appear to be confirmed by the manufacturing output level
registered during the first eleven months of 1977, which indicated a 10.0%
increase over 1976. The only integrated textile manufacturer in Malawi, David
Whitehead and Sons Ltd., completed its $12.4 million expansion during 1977,
which IFC helped finance with a $6 million loan. The expansion will increase
the company's capacity by 25% to 30 million yards per annum. In addition, the
number of licenses - and corresponding investments - to new industrial enter-
prises in the first nine months of 1977, reached already the average annual
level of 1975 and 1976. Other indicators of industrial activities like
construction work and electricity consumption also show upward trends, in-
dicating that a clear recovery is under way. Finally, the share of transport
in total Government expenditures, already substantial - 35% - in the past
three years, is brought up to 46% in the DEVPOL for 1978-80, and this effort
should inter alia contribute to alleviate constraints on the trade of manu-
facturing supplies.
1.17      This recovery should be bolstered by a number of important projects
coming into fruition. The Dwangwa Sugar Corporation is a K59 million sugar
development project in Lake Malawi cultivating about 13,000 acres. It would
create employment opportunities for some 3,000 people, and, with expected
production of 67,000 tons per year, almost double the country's existing
capacity. Financing agreements were signed in May 1977 by DEG, EIB, IFC -
which provided a $9 million loan - and INDEBANK. The Viphya Pulp and Paper
project - costing about K500 million 1/ - is a very important pulp project
in the Northern Region, with a total acreage of about 160,000, and a planned
annual capacity of about 180,000 tons of bleached kraft pulp, entirely for
exports. Financial arrangements are being sought by the Government. If they
can be negotiated in the near future, it is hoped that the mill would be
operational in the early 1980's. Finally, KfW has granted DM 1.2 million to
undertake, during 1978, a series of feasibility studies to develop industrial
opportunities in activities using local resources. They are: molasses util-
ization, ceramics, tannery and leather-working, motor oil rerefining, knitted
fabrics and infusion solutions. The Ministry of Industry also requested UNDP
assistance for three other feasibility studies: production of furfural from
waste materials, of calcium carbide from hydrated lime, and creation of kilns
for hand-made bricks. Additional investment opportunities should result from
these studies. This recovery should be sustained and prospects for further
development in the industrial sector are good (para 5.01).

-8-
Small Scale Industries
1.18      Definition and Structure.  Although there is no legal definition,
SSIs in Malawi are understood to refer to any business engaged in manufactur-
ing, processing, assembling or repairing, owned and operated by Malawian
private citizens. The emphasis is, thus, put on the personality of the
promoter and the type of activity rather than on the size of the unit. How-
ever, publications of the NSO classify as "larger" industries those with 20
or more employees, which indicates that enterprises below this limit would
then be medium/small size units. The Industrial Development Act of 1966
provides, however, another dividing line since industries which employ 10
persons or more are subject to licensing policies (para 1.10). SSIs would
then be generally those employing less than 10 people 1/. There is no defi-
nition of what the informal sector would be in Malawi, nor is there a lower
limit to differentiate SSI from handicraft activities.
1.19      In reality, most existing SSIs are just emerging from the level
of self-employed artisans and rarely employ more than 10 people. No quantita-
tive information is available but, on the basis of information on recent SSI
financing examples SSIs with total investments above K 50,000 seem to be very
rare. Main activities appear to be wood and metal working, garment making and
leather working, furniture making, construction materials and light metal
products. According to a recent small survey 2/ on 64 SSIs in the Blantyre
area, more than half of them (39) are in metalworking/woodworking activities,
eight in textiles, seven in automobile repairing, the remaining 10 being
scattered among food and paper products and other activities. Investment
and employment patterns confirm the main features of SSIs' as they have been
described above. Investments per job appear to be below K 1,000.
1.20      Financing of SSIs.  There is no established financing scheme in
Malawi which specifically caters to SSI needs. Some financial assistance was
provided to SSIs in rural areas by the Government under the Government Loans
Board, administered by the Ministry of Industry. Further allocation from
Treasury are however necessary to maintain the activities of this Loans
Board.
1.21      The commercial banks have been providing to a limited extent, short
and some medium term credit to SSIs. The National Bank of Malawi (para 2.07),
in particular, launched in 1973 a special program for SSI financing. Since
1/   Special regulations exist, however, for textile industries - which
are exempted from the licensing system if they employ less than five
people - and some categories of metal working, paper confection and
other activities, for which the limit is three employees.
2/   The Ministry of Industry circulated questionnaires to more than 100 SSIs
requesting the applicants to fill information concerning their activities
(i.e. sector, location, number of employees, investment and type of
assistance required).



- 9 -
inception, the scheme attracted over 750 applicants, but only half of the
applications were processed. A total of 350 loans totalling K 620,000 has
been granted (about K 150,000 per annum average) of which K 484,000 have
already been repayed, leaving a K 136,000 portfolio outstanding of over 140
loans at September 31, 1977. Repayment experience has been very reasonable,
with less than K 10,000 written off since inception.
1.22      The Commercial Bank of Malawi (para 2.08), although with no special
scheme for SSI financing, has an outstanding portfolio of close to K 300,000
of mainly short-term credit to small entrepreneurs, most of them, however,
being small holders in the agricultural sector. Repayment experience is also
good. No technical assistance is carried out.
1.23      Government Policies and Present SSI Development.  DEVPOL 1971-80
states that there should be increased opportunities for Malawian SSIs as
development proceeds; reportedly, more emphasis on SSI development will be put
during the 1978-1980 review, which is still to appear. In fact, SSI develop-
ment has not been among the Government's priorities until recently, given the
country's setting of its main priorities in agriculture and transportation
during its development efforts after independence. The Government has however,
decided to put an increasing emphasis on SSI development mostly as a result of
its increasing reliance on regional decentralization, employment generating
activities and Malawian entrepreneurship.
1.24      SSI development has also been promoted by the recent setting up of
two industrial estates: one in the capital city of Lilongwe, as a component
of the Government's policy to develop that city, and another one in Liwonde
under the aegis of the Import-Export Company (para 2.15). However, no SSI
has yet set up on the Liwonde Industrial Estate, while the estate in Lilongwe
is moderately successful with 18 SSIs installed at the end of 1977.
1.25      Responsibility for SSI development lies in the Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Tourism which receives technical assistance from UNIDO and UNDP.
In 1975, a Small Scale Industries Unit was set up within the Industrial Devel-
opment Division of the Ministry to propose policies and legislation to promote
and to provide technical assistance to SSIs. There are only two Malawian pro-
fessionals in the unit at present: one senior industrial development officer
and one industrial economist seconded by the Economic Planning Division of the
President's Office. In addition, Dutch technical assistance provided one SSI
expert at end 1977 and another is to join the unit by mid-1978 1/.
1.26      In order to better understand the SSI sector, the Bank and the
Government have agreed to undertake a joint feasibility study to gather the
basic data and evaluate the situation, needs, constraints and potential for
SSI development in Malawi. Terms of Reference for the study have been agreed

sionals and recruitment is in progress for four more.

with the Government. A Bank consultant, together with three local counter-
parts (the three existing officers at the Ministry of Industry's SSI Unit,
including the Dutch expert) will carry out the study in mid-1978. This
should provide the Bank and the Government with enough basic data to allow
for an appraisal for an SSI nationwide project, if justified, hopefully dur-
ing FY 79 1/. The European Development Fund, which has also been approached
by the Government for the financing of the eventual scheme, agrees with this
proposal.
II - THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
,The Central Bank's Role, Credit, Policies and Interest Rate Structure
2.01      The Reserve Bank of Malawi has the usual powers of a Central Bank
and, thus, the authority to prescribe cash ratios and minimum percentages of
specific liquid assets to the demand and time liabilities of the commercial
Banks. In addition to changing the Central Bank's lending rate and commercial
banks' interest rates, credit control has been traditionally effected by way
of moral suasion with the banking community. More active, and direct, involve-
ment of the Reserve Bank took place in the second half of 1976 in light of
the worsening of the balance of payments situation. Accordingly, compulsory
ratios (25%) were established and a stricter definition of liquid assets was
implemented. The Reserve Bank can lend to any "statutory corporation or
body" 2/ subject to the prior consent of the Minister of Finance, following
an amendment of the Reserve Bank of Malawi Act passed at the end of 1976. No
major constraint exists in the availability of foreign exchange.
2.02      Domestic credit has been sharply increasing in Malawi in the last
few years, by more than three times. This has been the result of credit going
to Government to finance larger budget deficits and to statutory corporations.
Although this increase in domestic credit has been mostly due to the public
sector's borrowings, credit to the private sector has also increased very
fast: by 43% in 1975 and by about 30% in 1976. The slower growth in 1976
was a result of the Central Bank measures (see para 2.01) and, at end of
March 1977, total credit outstanding had levelled off to the same level as
of the end of 1976. In the first half of 1977 the financial developments
were characterized by a marked resumption in the accumulation of resources,
the continued slow down in the expansion of domestic credit and some build-
ing up of reserves (a turnaround from the situation of sharp decline in the
fourth quarter of 1975 through 1976).
1/   It is also possible that assistance to rural SSIs could be channelled
through the Bank's next agriculture project in Malawi (FY80 or FY81).
2/   Quasi-Government controlled institutions reporting directly to the
President of the Country, but enjoying a relatively high degree
of autonomy in the management of their day to day operations.



- 11 -
2.03      The two principal instruments of Government borrowings in Malawi
are treasury bills (mostly held by the commercial banks and the Reserve
Bank) and medium-long term securities known as local registered stock (LRS),
most of which are held by the financial intermediaries and the statutory
corporations but with the Reserve Bank and the commercial banks taking
increasingly important proportions. In 1976 the Government subscribed its
first Eurodollar borrowing, arranged by Chase Manhattan, at 2% above the
London Interbank rate (resulting in a final rate of close to 9% in 1977).
The issue was oversubscribed. Similar borrowings have been carried out by
other Government bodies. Main sources for private sector borrowing are the
banking sector, the financial intermediaries and the foreign private finan-
cial institutions. The private sector subscribes marginally to the LRS,
representing only slightly above 10% of such borrowings. There is no stock
exchange in Malawi.
2.04      From 1970 to the beginning of 1976 interest rates in Malawi were
generally low and unchanged. The Reserve Bank's discount rate was 6% and
rates for savings and time deposits were around 4.5-6%, with minimum lending
rates of the commercial banks at 8.5%. A small increase in the commercial
banks' deposit rates took place at the beginning of 1976. In November 1976,
and in support of the restrictive credit policies and to further stimulate
domestic savings, the discount rate was raised to 7% and the minimum rates of
commercial banks to 10% with their lending rates restricted to a maximum of
15%. Additional increases in deposit rates, together with those of the New
Building Society (para 2.16) also took place. The Government aims at main-
taining rates at levels conducive to encouraging the growth of savings
and investments within Malawi's economy. Deposit rates now range from 5.5% for
savings deposits to 8.5% for 36 month deposits, with varying rates in between
for call and deposits for different time periods up to 36 months. Lending
rates range from a low 8 1/2% for individual housing loans (up to 15 years) 1/
to a maximum of 15%. The commercial banks' average lending rates oscillate
between 12-13% (charges included). This interest rate structure is coherent
with Malawi's monetary objectives and its present and expected level of
inflation. INDEBANK's rates are presented in para 3.27.
The Institutional Base
2.05      For a country with limited resources and at a rather early stage of
its development, Malawi has a well developed financial system. In addition
to the Central Bank (para 2.01) it comprises: (i) two commercial banks - The
National Bank of Malawi (NBM) and the Commercial Bank of Malawi (CBM); (ii) a
"traditional" development bank - INDEBANK: (iii) eight specialized financial
institutions, of which six have medium and long-term funds available for
development; the Malawi Development Corporation (MDC), the Agricultural
Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC), the National Insurance Com-
pany Ltd (NIC), the Old Mutual, the New Building Society (NBS), and the
i/   ADMARC has lent on occasions, at lower rates for specific projects
(para 2.12).



- 12 -
Malawi Housing Corporation (MHC), while the other two are of marginal impor-
tance - the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) and the Mercantile Credit Ltd;
(iv) one holding group involved in agriculture, industry and trade promotion,
Press Holdings Ltd; and (v) a trading company, Import-Export Company of Malawi
Ltd.
2.06      Among these institutions, the two commercial banks, INDEBANK, MDC
and its subsidiary Import-Export Co, ADMARC, and Press Holdings Ltd are
involved in industrial development. Indeed, NBM and CBM provide the typical
financial services offered by commercial banks. INDEBANK and MDC are both
promoters and term-equity financiers of industrial projects. ADMARC is a
source of financing for specific projects but does not promote - nor evaluate
- them.  Finally, Press Holdings plays solely a promoter's role, and so does
the Import-Export Co. A summary of each of these institutions' activities
follows.
2.07      The National Bank of Malawi (NBM) is the successor of a series of
banking institutions, beginning with the African Lakes Corporation in 1894.
In 1971, NBM was reorganized, with Barclay's Bank Ltd and Standard Chartered
Bank Ltd keeping a 51% control, and the rest held by Malawian interests.
Since 1976, Press Holdings Ltd (para 2.13) owns 57% of the shares, and
Standard and Barclays 10% each, with the balance being held by other local
interests. With assets totalling Kill million at March 31, 1977 NBM has had
a continuously strong performance in the recent years with no write offs for
bad debts and an excellent profit record (a 20% dividend is proposed for
1977). Close to 50% of NBM's lending goes to the agricultural sector - of
which more than 30% to the tobacco related activities - with manufacturing and
trading activities taking close to 30%. NBM has a special program for SSI
Development (see para 1.21). The overwhelming majority of NBM's lending is in
the form of overdrafts. The Board is chaired by the Managing Director of the
Press Holdings Group. Management and extensive experience in commercial bank-
ing business is provided to the Board by the representation of Barclays and
Standard Banks. NBM trains local staff to assume senior positions; the number
of expatriate officers was 36 in 1916, as opposed to 126 in 1971. The bank
has a widespread coverage in the country: 12 branches and 59 other offices
were operating at mid-1977. NBM's share in the private sector domestic
deposits is 70%.
2.08      The Commercial Bank of Malawi (CBM), was founded in 1969 with local
interests holding 60% of the shares and the Portuguese Banco Pinto 40%.  Since
1974 and following the withdrawal of Banco Pinto, the ownership is as follows:
Press Holdings Ltd 40%, MDC 20%, ADMARC 10% and Bank of America 30%. Since
that restructuring, CBM has evolved satisfactorily eliminating past accumulated
deficits and distributing its first dividend in 1976. As NBM, CBM is princi-
pally engaged in financing the agricultural sector, mainly through overdrafts:
by mid-1977, 72% of its total lending was in the agricultural sector, 21% in
the trade and manufacturing sectors, with the remaining scattered among
various activities, including, to a very limited extent, SSI financing (para
1.22). CBM's Board Chairman is the same as NBM's, and its management is also
provided by its foreign shareholder. A policy of increasing Malawianization



- 13 -
is, similarly, being pursued. CBM's agencies network is even more extended
than that of NBM; 14 branches (one overseas) and 88 other offices, but, with
total assets of about K 40 million at June 30, 1977, CBM's size is slightly
more than one third of NBM's. Its share in the private sector domestic
deposits is close to 30%.
2.09      The Malawi Development Corporation (MDC) is a statutory body (para
2.01) wholly Government owned, its shares being held by the Ministry of
Finance. It was set up in 1964 to promote joint venture undertakings with
foreign investors as well as to undertake its own projects deemed of national
importance and within the priorities set up by the country's DEVPOL. It is
today a holding group with a number of subsidiaries (i.e. companies controlled
- directly or.indirectly - at more than 50%) and associated companies (i.e.
with an MDC share of between 20 and 50% plus one seat at the Board). MDC
operates mostly through equity investments and it lends solely to companies
in which it holds shares. Its policy is to take a seat on the Board of the
companies it assists - about 40 today - and to provide management to all its
subsidiaries. MDC's objective is to develop and promote new project ideas in
all productive activities, except in the agricultural sector. MDC does not
have any single limit exposure in individual projects nor any minimum or
maximum loan amount. It has a staff of 14 professionals, of whom three are
expatriates. Some training has been financed by UNIDO.
2.10      MDC is financed by annual equity contributions - and also loans -
from the Government, and it has also borrowed from official and private
sources, both locally and, since 1973, internationally (Eurodollar borrowings
from Bank of America and First National City Bank, with Government guarantee
at 2 1/4% above the Libor rate). It manages its finances and liquidities
on a centralized basis and, as a result, there are a number of intergroup
transactions. Total amount of loans and equity investments by MDC was
around K 1 million per annum until 1976 but rose dramatically to above K 4
million in 1977, (mostly on account of a few rather large projects). Projec-
tions call for average yearly approvals of K 3 million in the coming years.
Close to 60% of MDC's operations are in the manufacturing and agroindustrial
sectors, slightly above 10% in tourism, the rest in commerce and service
activities. Most of these are medium-large scale industries. MDC's involve-
ment with SSI has been nil, following a reportedly bad financing experience in
its early years of operations but mostly because of its lack of adequate funds
for SSI financing and staff constraints. At end 1976, MDC's total assets were
about K 14.3 million and the group's consolidated situation totalled K 44
million.
2.11      The Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC),
was established in 1971 as a statutory body with the objective of promoting
the volume of exportable crops from Malawi by improving the standards of the
country's agricultural production, providing an efficient system for the
purchase of crops produced by small farmers, marketing the main agricultural
export crops, and developing agro-industrial enterprises. ADMARC, which took
over the responsibilities of the earlier Farmers' Marketing Board, admini-
stratively depends on the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and



- 14 -
has an extensive network of more than 760 branches throughout the country
including three regional offices and four divisional offices. Most of these
branches are depots and buying markets for the main crops traded by ADMARC:
tobacco, cotton, groundnuts, maize, cassava and rice being the most important.
ADMARC's minimum guaranteed buying prices are fixed in consultation with
Government at levels supposedly consistent with world commodity market prices
and with the need to provide adequate stabilization funds to protect the
farmer from market price fluctuations.
2.12      With total assets of K 84 million at March 31, 1976, ADMARC is
the single largest non-banking institution in Malawi and the country's most
important foreign exchange earner. It employs more than 15,000 people (of
Which 1/3 seasonal) at the peak season. Most of ADMARC's resources are self-
generated funds, coming from the substantial profits made by its operations
(annual profits of K 8.5 million average in 1975-76). Additional resources
come from the Government and Central Bank's borrowings and an outside Euro-
dollar borrowing from Chase Manhattan for onlending to the Press Holdings
Group (para 2.14). Of ADMARC's total portfolio of K 39 million at March 31,
1976, close to K 25 million were made to Press Holdings. Outside Press
Holdings, ADMARC's involvement in the industrial sector mainly relates to the
growing agro-industrial activities, but there are also a few investments in a
cement factory, a shoe manufacturing and in the two commercial banks and most
of the country's other financial institutions (MDC, INDEBANK, Malawi Housing
Corporation etc). Although in its agricultural activities, ADMARC deals
predominantly with smaller farmers, its industrial operations have been to
medium/large firms and no financing of SSIs has ever taken place so far.
ADMARC's investment policies are subject to Government directives and the
institution - which has no appraisal capabilities - tends to invest its
surpluses at the specific request of the Government.
2.13      The Press Holdings Ltd.  The origin of the Press Group, a sub-
stantial - highly diversified - holding company, is the creation in 1960,
of the Malawi Press Company, mainly to publish the "Malawi News" as the
publicity instrument of the Malawi Congress Party 1/. In 1969 it converted
itself into a private limited holding company whose shares are registered
under the name of the President who keeps them "in trust for the people of
Malawi". The group has developed rapidly into an important conglomerate
with a very diversified outlook: It has now 15 subsidiaries - of which 14
are wholly owned - and 23 associated companies (in which the group holds
non-majority interests) active in agriculture (the Group produces about 20%
of the country's flue-cured tobacco and 40% of burley tobacco, and is heavily
involved in ranching), industry (textiles, wood making, agro-industries,
construction materials), wholesale and retail trade (also of petroleum and
petroleum products), real estate, transportation and banking and insurance
underwriting. The group's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1976
shows assets of K 69 million.

2.14      The Press Group's policy is to take equity investments and identify,
implement and develop its own projects. It has recently started to develop
its appraisal capabilities and has established good relations with both MDC
and INDEBANK, on whom it traditionally relied for appraisal work. Sales of
the subsidiaries totalled close to K 37 million in 1976 (with net profits
close to K 4 million). The substantial profits generated are reportedly being
reinvested within the group. Additional resources for Press come from local
(ADMARC, commercial banks, financial institutions), and foreign borrowings
(Bank of America, Commerzbank). Press does not thus, receive direct financial
support from the Government.
2.15      The Import-Export Co. of Malawi, was created in 1975 as a subsidiary
of MDC (51%), with Press Holdings owning the remaining 49% of its capital.  It
is mainly a trading company and has two monopolies on imported items (second
hand clothing and light gauge iron roofing sheets) and three monopolies on
locally manufactured items (sugar, matches, and agricultural hoes). In these
cases, the prices are subject to Government controls but, in all other mer-
chandise activities, it operates in a competitive market. In addition, it has
leased from MDC an industrial estate at Liwonde, is capable of offering pur-
chasing and marketing assistance and it has a substantial training program
for its employees, hoping to expand these activities to include the training
of Malawian businessmen and their staff. The company, with its four subsidi-
aries, had total sales around K 34 million in 1975/76. Assets were K 15.2
million according to the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1976. The
company is organized into five divisions. The two main ones take care of:
(i) trade in general (Chipuku Wholesale stores: 59 depots and K 25 million
annual turnover in basic consumer goods) through which it is implementing the
Government's policy to replace the Indian traders in the rural areas by
Malawian businessmen; and (ii) marketing services, through mobile vans,
selling about K 9.5 million per annum worth of more sophisticated interna-
tional brands of imported products. The remaining three divisions have mar-
ginal importance. They deal with: (iii) pharmaceutical and related products
(through its subsidiary Malawi Pharmacies Ltd); (iv) imported motor vehicles
(through its subsidiary Malawi Motors Ltd); and (v) radio and electrical
equipment also providing services and repairs.
2.16      Finally, the National Insurance Company Ltd (NIC) and the Old Mutual
are insurance companies. The New Building Society (NBS) and the Malawi Housing
Corporation provide funds for residential, low and modern cost housing develop-
ment, and the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) and Mercantile Credit Ltd are
two small private financing institutions lending to Government and financing
hire purchase activities respectively. Accounts of these institutions together
with annual reports and accounts of those described in paras 2.07 to 2.15
above are available in the Project File.

III - THE INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MALAWI LTD (INDEBANK)
Background, Structure and Role
3.01      INDEBANK was established as a private limited company incorporated
in December 18, 1972 under Malawi's Companies Act 1/. It operates as a tra-
ditional development bank set up to promote, finance and expand commercially
viable development projects of value to the economy of Malawi in the agricul-
tural, industrial and commercial and other sectors, sponsored by private or
public investors. Particular focus is to be given to projects sponsored and
partly financed by Malawian interests but, on unwritten instructions by the
President, it is prohibited from financing projects sponsored by Government
Ministers, Chairmen of Statutory Corporations and Senior Executives of the
Malawi Congress Party. In addition, projects promoted by foreign owned com-
panies have to prove that they cannot raise financing overseas and, prefer-
ably, that a local partner is going to be found.
3.02      Basic functions are laid down by the Memorandum and Articles of
Association; the institution is widely allowed to carry out all borrowing,
investment, and lending activities with the objectives above mentioned.
INDEBANK does not have any branch office and its headquarters are in Blantyre.
By 1980, however, it plans either to move the head office to the capital
city of Lilongwe or open a branch office there.
Ownership
3.03      INDEBANK's promoters, and its present shareholders, are ADMARC
(paras 2.11-2.12) and three bilateral development agencies, the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC), the Deutsche Gessellschaft fur Wirtschaftliche
Zusammenarbeit (DEG), and the Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor
Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (FMO). INDEBANK's authorized share capital is
K 4.5 million, of which K 3 million have been issued equally (25%) to each
of the shareholders. Both concerning its ownership and its operational
procedures INDEBANK is similar to the Development Finance Company of Kenya
(DFCK) and the Tanganyika Development Finance Company (TDFL), in Tanzania.
3.04      The contractual agreements defining the Government, the sponsors
and the institution's rights and obligations are set up in the Finance and
Cooperation Agreement signed in December 30, 1972 by the Government of
Malawi, INDEBANK, and its shareholders. This agreement defines: (i) the
partners' general objectives in creating INDEBANK, (ii) the procedures
governing the creation of shares and income notes (paras 4.09 to 4.13),
(iii) the arrangements for the company's first General Manager and the
management and technical advice to be provided by the shareholders, (iv) the
1/   The British Companies Acts 1900 and 1913 as applied to Malawi by the
Companies Act (Cap. 46:03).



- 17 -
obligations of INDEBANK and those of the shareholders, and (v) the tax and
repatriation advantages given by the Government to INDEBANK and to its
shareholders.
Policies
3.05      INDEBANK's Investment Policy Principles are contained in the Annex
to the Finance and Cooperation Agreement mentioned above, as amended from
time to time by special resolution of the Board. This prerogative has been
often used and, over time, a set of regulations have defined in a very
precise way these policies.
3.06      The objective of the company is to assist in the development of
Malawi's economy while being viable on its own account. Refinancing is
considered only in special circumstances. No investment in infrastructure
projects will be made but all other sectors are to be considered while
attempting to diversify investments as much as possible both geographically
and sectorally. Financing for existing or new projects is to be made avail-
able in the form of equity and medium and long term loans, subject to an
overall limit on the proportion of shareholdings set by the Board (currently
at one third). No management responsibilities will be normally accepted.
3.07      Sponsors are expected to put up 25% of total project's cost and
INDEBANK will not normally provide more than 35% of the total equity needed
by the project. Each investment by INDEBANK must make a significant con-
tribution to the capital cost of the project and no token investments will
normally be made. Loans are limited to a maximum amount which was increased
in March 1978 from K 600,000 to K 1,000,000 in view of the increasing equity
base of the institution. In case of projects of particular national impor-
tance, lending above this maximum is left to the Board's discretion on a case
by case basis.
3.08      Although INDEBANK's general policy principles are in accordance
with Bank policies regarding lending through financial intermediaries, it was
necessary to have these policies incorporated - in a summarized way - in a
document which would constitute INDEBANK's Policy Statement. At negotiations
INDEBANK presented such a Policy Statement in a satisfactory form and its
Board has approved it. INDEBANK further agreed that its new Policy Statement
will not be changed without the Bank's consent.
3.09      For the purpose of the Loan Agreement with the Bank, INDEBANK agreed
to have a limit on its total exposure by project related to INDEBANK's own
equity, which would not need to be revised as the institution grows. This
limit was set at 25% of INDEBANK's equity to give due consideration to the
institution's special financial structure, and, particularly, to the nature
of income notes (paras 4.09 to 4.11). This limit should satisfactorily help
INDEBANK to keep a sound and well diversified portfolio, without unduly
limiting the company's possibilities to finance relatively important projects.
3.10      Concerning the question of INDEBANK's financing above K 600,000
for projects of particular national importance, the Board has been somewhat



- 18 -
restrictive in the application of the cases of particular importance.
InAeed, INDEBANK has, so far, invested more than K 600,000 in two projects;
(i) two loans of K 0.9 million and 0.3 million were made to General Farming
in 1973 and 1977 respectively (total loans outstanding to the company at
September 31, 1977: K 1.2 million) and (ii) a K 1 million loan was made to
the Dwangwa Sugar Processing Company in 1976. These two projects are both
ilalawian controlled and fully export oriented. General Farming grows
flue-cured tobacco and maize; it is one of the largest flue-cured tobacco
growing organization in the world and it profitably produces 20% of Malawi's
flue-cured tobacco, the country's main domestic export commodity (45% of
total exports). Dwangwa Sugar is a very important export oriented sugar
growing project (para 1.17). In addition, two other companies, - publicly
owned - each received two successive loans totalling more than K 600,000;
Grain and Milling (maize and wheat milling) and Malawi Housing Corporation
(low cost Housing); these loans are guaranteed by ADMARC and the Government
respectively.
3.11      In spite of this satisfactory performance and independence of views,
and to safeguard the institution's financial soundness, INDEBANK was requested
to obtain a Government guarantee in all cases for the part of its financing
exceeding its normal exposure limit (25% of equity), and INDEBANK agreed to
this condition during negotiations.
Board of Directors and Management
3.12      Under the Articles of Association each shareholder or group of
shareholders holding shares having a total value above K 200,000 has the
right to appoint two directors to the Board (list in Annex 1). ADMARC's
Director is the Chairman of the Board. The foreign shareholders have
usually opted for having one Director coming from headquarters and appoint-
ing a local businessman as alternate Director.
3.13      The Board meets about four times a year and is responsible, under
Lhe Articles of Association, for the Management of the Company. These
powers have been delegated to the General Manager, subject to Board guide-
lines on matters of policy, under the Finance and Cooperation Agreement
between INDEBANK's founding shareholders (para 3.05). INDEBANK's Directors
take a very active interest in - and contribute substantially to - the
development of the company, striking a very well balanced equilibrium between
local - "in situ" - experience and views from the institutions' headquaters.
Their major contribution is, thus, one of quality control over INDEBANK's
activities although they also provide new ideas and, more precisely, technical
assistance in project and general matters. In conjunction with IFC's proposed
equity investment (para 6.09), INDEBANK invited IFC to participate on its
Board by appointing a Director.
3.14      INDEBANK's General Manager, who is not a member of the Board, is a
CDC staff member provided by the institution since the time of INDEBANK's
creation. Under his aegis, INDEBANK has sailed through its first - difficult -
years, and has achieved a solid reputation and a strong financial base. How-
ever, his contract expires by mid-1979 and it is clear that, unless specific



- 19 -
arrangements are made soon to provide for his efficient replacement, his
departure at that time would be disruptive for the institution. INDEBANK's
Board decided in December 1977 to appoint, as soon as possible, an experienced
Controller of Project Investigations who would be responsible for coordination
of project evaluation work and deputize in the absence of the General Manager.
INDEBANK, in consultation with the Bank, is looking for a suitably qualified
person to take up this post.
3.15      During negotiations, the Bank was informed that INDEBANK, under
Government's recommendation, was able to appoint a Malawian General Manager-
Designate in April, 1978, who will work with the General Manager, undergo
some specific development banking-oriented training programs, and succeed
the incumbent in mid-1979. The new appointee has occupied various high-level
Government positions and was General Manager of the Reserve Bank of Malawi
prior to this appointment. In this context, the early recruitment of the
Controller of Project Investigations should provide for management continuity
and strengthen the control and coordination of INDEBANK's project evaluation
work during this transition period. The recruitment of an experienced Con-
troller of Project Investigations is a condition for effectiveness of the
proposed Bank Loan. The foregoing management arrangements are satisfactory.
Staff and Organization
3.16      INDEBANK's organization chart is attached in Annex 2.  Given the
company's size, INDEBANK's organization is a relatively simple one: it is
divided in two parts, one dealing basically with the evaluation of projects
and the other taking care of financial and administrative matters. The two
Project Investigation Departments are responsible for the promotion, identi-
fication and appraisal of the agricultural, and industrial and other projects
respectively. The Financial Adviser is responsible for reviewing the finan-
cial aspects of the appraisals prepared by the projects departments and for
the - case by case - follow-up of projects. It advises also the General
Manager on specific aspects of the company's financial policies. The Account-
ing Department carries out the accounts and general administrative matters.
In addition it serves the Board as a secretariat. INDEBANK's organization
is well adapted to the needs of the institution at its present stage.
3.17      INDEBANK's staff totalled 16 at end November 1977, of which 10 are
professionals. Four professionals, including the General Manager, are expa-
triates. The two Project Investigation Managers, are provided by Dutch and
German Aid. INDEBANK's staff is, overall, of good quality and with solid
academic backgrounds but still rather inexperienced. With the exception of
the General Manager, only 4 professionals have been with the institution
for more than one year, and the remaining five for less than six months.
INDEBANK's policy is to progressively recruit and train Malawian nationals;
two Malawian professionals have received overseas training.
3.18      In order to be able to process the increased level of operations and
to provide for a solid base for the future, INDEBANK plans to hire an addi-
tional Projects Investigation Manager to start technical analysis of projects



- 20 -
(para 3.21). In addition, and to diminish gradually the institution's depen-
dence on expatriates, its Board has agreed to accelerate both the hiring of
additional Malawian staff and its training. It has consequently undertaken
to hire 5 more Malawian professional staff before the end of 1978; two in the
proposed technical department, two for supervision work (para 3.25), and one
in the accounts department. Furthermore, INDEBANK's Board has also undertaken
to train overseas two Malawian professional staff per annum and has requested
Bank's help to do so. Development banking courses in England, Ireland and
India, management courses in US, project evaluation courses at the CDC's
Agricultural Training Center in Swaziland, and training periods in development
banks in the area with experience relevant to Malawi's (Mauritius and Kenya)
are amongst the concrete possibilities envisaged.
3.19      During negotiations, INDEBANK confirmed to the Bank the undertakings
defined in para 3.18. The recruitment of the new Projects Investigation
Manager and the identification and agreement to recruit the five Malawian
professionals are conditions for effectiveness of the proposed Bank Loan.
Procedures
3.20      Appraisals.  Preliminary screening of all serious applications is
made by the General Manager. A particular feature of project processing is
that, once a project is found worth studying, a clearance in principle is
required from the shareholders before formal appraisal is undertaken, to
ensure that the projects proposed do not contravene the principles of the
shareholders. Clearance is provided on a no-objection basis in a maximum
delay of one month after reception of the request. In practice, INDEBANK
never waits for the month to start studying projects and no clearance in
principle has ever been refused. This procedure has, thus, never been a
limiting factor and, in practice, it has just a formal nature and does not
detract unduly from the institution's independence.
3.21      Although investment decisions have generally been taken on a sound
basis, the overall quality of INDEBANK's appraisals could be improved. Indeed,
there are a few weaknesses: (i) a rather sketchy and summarized presentation
which does not usually offer all the information accumulated through the
appraisal process, (ii) some lack of coordination between the market, finan-
cial and other aspects, (iii) no evaluation of the projects' technical aspects,
which is exclusively dependent on outside consultants, or promoters' views,
and (iv) no formal economic evaluation of projects is made. The hiring of
INDEBANK's Controller of Projects Investigation with specific responsibility
for appraisal coordination (para 3.14) would remedy the weaknesses described
in (i) and (ii), while the hiring of the new Projects Investigation Manager
(para 3.18) will permit to develop the technical aspects of INDEBANK's ap-
praisals. Also, with the help of the Bank, INDEBANK's General Manager is
preparing an "appraisal manual" which should consolidate procedures and have
an additional beneficial impact on its future quality. During negotiations,
INDEBANK agreed to formally focus on the economic aspects of the projects it
finances and undertake to calculate economic rates of return, at least for
import substitution projects.



- 21 -
3.22      Promotion.  Since its inception, INDEBANK has played an effective
catalytic role by putting together proposals emanating from the Press Group,
MDC and its subsidiaries, the Government - and some of its own - and bringing
in foreign investors and technical expertise into the country. Most of
INDEBANK-financed projects have these features. In addition, and since 1976,
three projects have been wholly promoted by INDEBANK: a project for feeding
cattle for slaughter with cane-tops, a plant for moulding plastic bottles and
a pension scheme for medium-income people (INDETRUST); the latter, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of INDEBANK, would contribute to local resource mobilization
and provide a market for INDEBANK's selling its shareholdings in the long
term. 1/ These complete promotional efforts started after the institution
achieved its priority goal of creating a sound portfolio and financial struc-
ture. Having achieved this goal, INDEBANK plans now to be more aggressively
involved in ptoject promotion by reinforcing - and even institutionalizing -
its collaboration with MDC and with the Press Group. The hiring of the
Controller of Projects Investigation should free INDEBANK's General Manager
and the Projects Managers from some of their appraisal tasks and allow them
to develop promotional activities in line with these policies.
3.23      Disbursements.  INDEBANK's disbursement procedures are adequate.
They are made on the basis of the predetermined investment program for
each project and upon presentation of invoices, once the sponsors's equity
funds have been fully used. Control of these disbursements is the respon-
sibility of the Accounts Department which checks that all preconditions
have been - and continue to be - met in accordance with the legal agree-
ments, which have been prepared by the Company's lawyer 2/.
3.24      Procurement.  Although INDEBANK does not have special rules
regarding the source of supply for equipment, competitive quotations are
always required. All possible steps are taken to ensure that plant and
equipment are acquired from the cheapest source in relation to the quality
specifications of the project. This has been hampered in the past by the
lack of engineering staff but, in some cases, outside consulting engineers
1/   Following a request made by the tea industry, INDEBANK set up this
pension fund -- INDETRUST -- which, turned out to be potentially
applicable to all non-Government employees. The rationale for the
creation of such a fund stems from the lack of any national pension
scheme in Malawi together with the wish to start a simple mechanism
of capital accumulation. The fund has been set up as a subsidiary of
INDEBANK and will be managed by an insurance broker, who will, thus,
carry all the administrative work involved. Investments to be made with
INDETRUST's resources will be decided by INDEBANK's Board. With rather
modest amounts (K 100,000) estimated available for investments in
1978/79, the proposal could, in the longer run, represent an addition
to the local resources mobilized by INDEBANK.
2/   Sacranie, Gow and Company, a Malawian firm handling, among others,
IFC's investments in the country.



- 22 -
have been engaged, with the concurrence of the project sponsor, to advise
INDEBANK. The recruitment of the Project Investigation Manager to develop
technical evaluations should also improve this aspect of INDEBANK's work.
Overall, procurement policies are acceptable.
3.25      Project Follow-up.  Supervision of projects is handled by the
Financial Advisor but, because of their special nature, agricultural projects
are followed up primarily by the Projects Investigation Manager for agricul-
ture projects. Also, supervision is done through INDEBANK's representation
at the Board of its clients. Reports on the performance of every project
financed by INDEBANK are submitted at each Board Meeting. However, because
of staff constraints and the resulting scarcity of formal supervision visits,
INDEBANK has been mainly relying on information regularly provided by its
clients and reporting to the Board has tended to focus on those few projects
encountering specific problems. Given the general soundness and relatively
small size of INDEBANK's portfolio, the procedure followed until now has
proven to be adequate. However, with the development of INDEBANK's operations,
supervision work needs to be extended and made more systematic. Two Malawian
professionals for this department will be recruited (para 3.18), and the new
Project Investigations Manager will contribute to technical supervision of
projects under construction, which is practically non-existent today. In
addition, and with Bank's help, INDEBANK's management is preparing a "Super-
vision Manual", which should help institutionalize procedures.
Terms and Conditions of Loans: Interest Rates
3.26      INDEBANK's loans are not normally made for less than three years and
in any case, no longer than the economic life of the main assets which secure
the project; usually between 9 and 12 years for industrial projects including
an appropriate grace period. Adequate securities are taken in the form of
secured debentures and INDEBANK's position as a lender will not usually be
subordinated to that of any other lender.
3.27      INDEBANK's interest rates vary depending on the type of loan, its
duration, risks and security offered. Loans in the industrial sector are
made at 10.5%/11%, while those in the purely agricultural sector at 9.5%, and
those for commercial and real estate activities, at a minimum of 11%. A few
low cost housing loans were made at 9% in the past but no such operations will
be made in the future. INDEBANK will not normally lend at a rate lower than
that of other lenders for equal terms. A commitment fee of 0.1% per month is
charged on undrawn balances of the loan and, on occasion, a study fee of 0.5%
will also be charged. The weighted return on INDEBANK's portfolio during 1977
was 10.3%, as compared with a weighted average interest payable on its out-
standing borrowings of 8%, leaving an average interest spread of 2.3%, which
is adequate given the institution's low leverage. The level of INDEBANK's
interest rates is consistent with the country's interest rate structure (para
2.04) and is - and will be - positive in real terms when compared with the
projected average inflation rate of 8-9% for Malawi in the coming years. Up
to end 1977, INDEBANK's resources, both in equity and in income notes, have
been denominated in Malawi Kwacha. INDEBANK's lendings in foreign exchange



- 23 -
started with a line of credit from EIB (para 4.08). The foreign exchange risk
associated with it will be passed on to INDEBANK's borrowers. INDEBANK, as a
policy, will pass on to its clients the foreign exchange risk on its foreign
borrowings, which is satisfactory and consistent with the policy of those
other institutions in Malawi lending in foreign exchange 1/.
Auditors
3.28      INDEBANK's annual accounts are audited by Deloitte Haskins and
Sells, a firm of international repute and world-wide coverage. INDEBANK's
auditors have agreed to follow in the future the Bank's Illustrative Form for
Audit of Development Finance Companies. Auditing arrangements are, thus,
satisfactory. INDEBANK confirmed its agreement to retain competent auditors
and to submit audited accounts to the Bank three months after the end of the
year. A clean opinion on INDEBANK's accounts at December 31, 1977 has been
received by the Bank.
IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCE
Operations
4.01      From its inception in December 1972 until December 1977, INDEBANK
has approved 29 loans and 13 equity investments in 31 projects, for a total
of K 12.9 million, 87% in loans and 13% in equity, and has disbursed already
K 10.9 million. A summary of INDEBANK's operations is presented in Annex 3;
INDEBANK's operations reached a substantial level in its first year but have
remained roughly constant thereafter with total approvals averaging K 2.6
million per year during 1973-1977.  INDEBANK had adopted   a prudent policy
adapted to the country's temporary economic difficulties and in view of its
limited economic resources. It, thus, placed priority on establishing a solid
portfolio in low-risk investments, rather than on growth. Considering that
INDEBANK had no more than 7 professionals until 1977, its volume of approvals
indicates a good staff productivity which compares favorably with most devel-
opment banks at the same stage of development. In addition, INDEBANK has
an unusually good record in processing projects rapidly. The lags between
approval and commitment and between commitment and full disbursement average
4-1/2 and 5 months respectively.
4.02      Project Size and INDEBANK's financing.  The projects approved by
INDEBANK in 1973-1977 are listed in Annex 4 and their characteristics are
analyzed in Annex 5. By far the largest is the new Dwangwa Sugar project,
with a total cost of K 59 million (para 1.17). When excluding this project,
the total project cost averages K 2.1 million. Projects with a total cost
1/   Edesa, the Swaziland-based South African Group, has loaned at 10.5%
plus foreign exchange risk. The same goes for MDC's financings with
its Eurodollar borrowings (para 2.10). Suppliers credits are not a
significant source of financing.



- 24 -
between K I million and K 6 million account for 81% of the amount approved.
Most of INDEBANK's approvals of loans and equity investments range between
K 200,000 and K 600,000, with 40% of total amounts invested between K 400,000
and K 600,000, and close to 30% between K 200,000 and K 400,000. Indeed,
INDEBANK's total investment per project averages K 415,000 and represents
a rather normal share of 20% of total project costs (excluding the Dwangwa
project).
4.03      Project Ownership.  INDEBANK's approvals reflect the general
interlocking pattern of ownership in Malawi (para 1.07). Press Holdings,
ADMARC and MDC together have major shareholdings in two-thirds of the 28
companies financed by INDEBANK to date. ADMARC is a frequent shareholder
in agricultural and agro-industrial companies and MDC in industrial and
commercial companies, while Press Holdings is present in all sectors. The
total share capital of all companies 1/ is distributed approximately into
28% from Press Holdings, 16% from MDC, 7% from ADMARC, 6% from INDEBANK,
8% from other local partners, mostly public corporations, and 34% from for-
eign investors. Overall projects under majority Malawian ownership are
largely predominant and account for 79% of total amounts approved by INDEBANK.
Less than 20% of INDEBANK's approvals have been to fully Government owned
corporations.
4.04      Economic Characteristics.  Projects using primarily local raw mate-
rials are predominant and account for 78% of the amount of approvals to date.
The proportion of new projects as opposed to expansions is relatively small
but it increased from 40% of the amount approved in 1973-1975 to 54% in
1976-1977, following the start of INDEBANK's involvement in project identifi-
cation (para 3.22). Despite their relative large size, INDEBANK's investments
are reasonably labor-intensive and show an average investment cost per job of
$13,000, notably below the overall average of about $25,000 observed among
other African development banks. The FRR, calculated for a sample of INDEBANK's
projects show that they average about 24%. No ERR is calculated. The total
amount of approvals is rather well distributed among three main sectors: 54%
in industry and agro-industry, 19% in pure agriculture (mostly tobacco growing
- 16%) and 17% in commercial buildings and housing. INDEBANK's Board has
decided to monitor closely the relative concentration in the tobacco sector
and to maintain the share of investments in commercial buildings and housing
below 20%. The foreign exchange component in INDEBANK's projects, can be
estimated at about 60 to 65% of total project's cost, on the basis of an
analysis of a representative sample of its projects financed.

holders are ADMARC (39%) and Press Holdings (20%).

Financial Condition
4.05      Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1977, INDEBANK held a portfolio
of K 9.6 million 1/ of which 82% were loans and 18% equity investments
(Annex 6). Projects in the portfolio reflect with a slight lag the main
characteristics of approvals; apart from a moderate concentration in tobacco
growing (19% by amount), the portfolio is well diversified among a variety
of industrial (17%) agro-industrial (43%), commercial buildings and housing
(12%) and other activities (9%). Out of the 27 projects in the portfolio,
two-thirds are already completed and only three (10% by amount) are causing
some concern: Grain and Milling Ltd., (wheat overstock and competition of
subsidized European flour), Malawi Pharmacies Ltd., (slow-growing market and
high rent of premises) and Capital Hotels (low occupancy until the new capital
city develops). These three loans were guaranteed by ADMARC, MDC and CCDC
respectively, and INDEBANK has been following them up closely and providing
advice to management. Apart from these three, companies operating in
INDEBANK's portfolio all made profits in FY1976 and one third of them,
accounting for 29% of portfolio amount, showed net returns on equity above
20%. Overall the quality of INDEBANK's portfolio is good and ranks above
average among African development banks.
4.06      Loan Portfolio.  Since its inception, INDEBANK rescheduled loan
principal repayment in three cases: by two years for the industrial estate in
Lilongwe due to a deferment in the building program, by one year for a
brewery which needed to build up its stocks after the Rhodesia- Mozambique
border closure, and by six months for a corrugated steel manufacturer due to a
delay in machinery delivery. All three companies are now in a good position
and are paying interest regularly. The brewery started principal repayments.
As of November 30, 1977, eight loans, representing 33% of total outstanding
loan portfolio, had commenced repayment periods but INDEBANK had no interest
or principal arrears on its loan portfolio. Prospects for interest and
principal collections are good.
4.07      Equity Portfolio.  INDEBANK has earned a regular and high dividend
income from its investments; in 1976-1977, the return on the equity portfolio
averaged up to 12.5% per annum. Dividend prospects appear good.
Resources
4.08      The four shareholders (paras 3.03 to 3.04) have provided pari passu
all INDEBANK's resources through 1977. On a need basis, they contributed to
an increase in the paid-up share capital in each year and followed each
increase by the disbursement of a threefold amount in income notes, a peculiar
form of longterm debt (paras 4.09 to 4.11). As of December 31, 1977, INDEBANK
had withdrawn K 2,840,000 in share capital and K 7,350,000 in income notes,
1/   According to the actual figures at September 30, 1977 and the scheduled
account movements of the last quarter of 1977.



- 26 -
and its shareholders were committed to complement these amounts to K 3 million
in share capital and K 9 million in income notes during 1978. In addition,
INDEBANK applied successfully for a loan of K 3 million equivalent from EIB,
which was signed in November 1977. The use of this loan is restricted to
finance INDEBANK's loans in industry, mining and tourism but excluding agri-
culture. It carries an interest rate of 5.05% which will leave to INDEBANK
a substantial spread on its loan income (para 5.13). Annex 7 presents
INDEBANK's resource position at December 31, 1977 which shows that, at that
time, INDEBANK had K 2.3 million available for new commitments.
4.09      Income Notes.  INDEBANK's sole borrowings prior to EIB have been the
income notes subscribed by its shareholders. The nature and conditions for
,the subscription of income notes, are described precisely in the Finance
and Cooperation agreement (para 3.04). All income notes are convertible
into ordinary shares, at par, at the option of the holders. Interest rate
is fixed at 8% but this payment depends on INDEBANK's capacity to pay interest
out of profits and is, thus, to be made only after deduction of administrative
expenses, provisions for losses and write offs (as determined by the Auditors),
depreciation, and interest payments on loans received by INDEBANK other than
income notes. Since its operating margin has been satisfactory, INDEBANK has
been paying 8% on its income notes since inception.
4.10      The income notes, which are unsecured, are to be repaid by INDEBANK
in the year 2020 but no precise form under which this repayment is to take
place has been defined. It is assumed that, at that time, the income note
holders would decide on converting them -- totally or partially -- into
equity. However, certain features of the income notes allow the shareholders
to request repayment prior to 2020 from INDEBANK which, if exercised, could
clearly impose a major financial burden on INDEBANK. Such features were
introduced by INDEBANK's shareholders, inter alia, as a leverage to ensure
that the company carries out its business -- and is permitted to do so -- in a
manner consistent with the objectives subscribed to at the time of INDEBANK's
creation. Given this rationale and the composition of INDEBANK's sharehold-
ings it is clear that the shareholders' Governments have a moral commitment
to support INDEBANK and to ensure its financial viability under any foreseable
circumstances.
4.11      In order to protect, nevertheless, its legitimate interests,
the Bank should be in a position to ask for early repayment of its loan
to INDEBANK if a shareholder envisages a similar action. To this end, a
financial covenant has been added to the usual negative pledge clause in
the proposed Loan Agreement, whereby INDEBANK will notify the Bank as soon
as it becomes aware that an early repayment will be required. INDEBANK
agreed to that covenant at negotiations.
Operational Performance
4.12      Financial Position.  INDEBANK's financial statements in 1973-1977
are summarized in Annexes 8 to 10. INDEBANK's total assets have increased
at an average rate of 26% per year since 1973 to K 11 million in 1977. The



- 27 -
shareholders' policy of accompanying gradual increases in the paid-up share
capital by threefold payments of income notes has maintained a reasonable
leverage of debt over equity. INDEBANK's liquidity position in 1977 was
satisfactory with a current ratio of 1.7:1. To cover possible future losses
on investments INDEBANK has included no provisions in its expenses to date
but has limited dividends to 75% of its profit after tax to keep sufficient
levels in its general reserve, now amounting to about 1% of total portfolio.l/
Specific provisions for projects in difficulties would, nevertheless, be made
above these levels on a case-by-case basis. This practice is acceptable and
adequate for the time being in view of the portfolio quality and its relative
youth (paras 4.05 to 4.07), but it had not been formally defined. However,
for the future, INDEBANK agreed at negotiations to specify its provision
policy as a covenant to the proposed loan, emphasizing that (i) at least 25%
of the profit of each year will be accumulated in a non-distributable general
reserve, and (ii) in addition, specific provisions would be deducted from its
profits or its general reserve to cover the investment risk on specific
projects in difficulties. Overall, INDEBANK has shown a proficient financial
management and its financial position is satisfactory.
4.13      Profitability.  Despite its youth, INDEBANK certainly is one of the
most profitable DFCs in Africa. Net earnings before tax have increased at
an average rate of 70% per year and reached K 291,000 in 1977, i.e. a return
of 11.7% on average equity. After tax, net earnings in 1977 amounted to
K 154,000 - i.e., a return of 6.2% on equity. Administrative expenses have
decreased regularly from 34% of total expenses in 1974 to 23% in 1977. Dur-
ing the last three years, the return on portfolio equity investments averaged
10.3%. As a result of this high profitability, dividend payments started
in 1975 and amounted to an average retVrn of 3.9% on equity in 1975-1977.
The most relevant ratios applicable to INDEBANK's financial statements in
1973-1977 are presented in Annex 11.
V. PROSPECTS
Industrial Development
5.01      Prospects for industrial development in Malawi are good and they
appear to support further growth. Main reasons for this are: i) large
import substitution opportunities still exist and the Government is aware that
they have to be fully utilized, ii) the take off of a few major development
projects which will create additional manufacturing activities around them:
Dwangwa Sugar (K 60 million), Lilongwe International Airport (K 60 million),
and Viphya Pulp and Paper (close to $300 million), iii) the gradual -- though
unpublicized -- return of Malawian workers to South African mines will have
a considerable impact on today's depressed income levels of the rural popula-
tions, iv) the generally stable political situation based on a rather cohesive
11   INDEBANK's financial situation is so presented:  i.e., the full
amount of the General Reserve included in the equity of the company.



- 28 -
social system and helped by a relatively efficient administration and by
liberal investment regulations geared towards attracting foreign investment,
and v) in the longer run, the relatively good export possibilities for the
low bulk, low weight, high value-added activities (textiles, handicrafts,
etc.) supported by what probably is the cheapest -- yet fairly productive --
labor force in Africa. Constraints to these good prospects for the develop-
ment should be, as in the past, the lack of supplies (only low quality coal
may be available in the North), scarcity of managerial skills and experience,
limited domestic purchasing power for consumer goods, and high sensitivity
to events -- both economic and political -- in neighboring countries, which
are outside Malawi's control. These constraints have existed in the past and
industrial growth has taken place at a reasonable pace in spite of them.
There is no reason to believe now that they will not continue to be more than
offset by the additional positive features mentioned above.
5.02      In view of this, the country stands a rather good chance for con-
tinued industrial investment to fuel the expansion of the existing industrial
base and the creation of new activities, mostly of an import substitution
nature. DEVPOL for the period 1977/78 to 1979/80 reportedly maintains past
priorities in the private sector, including foreign investment, and gives more
emphasis to export oriented industries and SSI development.
INDEBANK's Strategy
5.03      During its five years' existence, INDEBANK has built up its
financial security with a particularly sound portfolio through a difficult
economic period. Now that the country's economic recovery is being conso-
lidated INDEBANK plans to strengthen its staffing and formalize its pro-
cedures in order to expand substantially the volume of its operations over
the next five years. While sustaining its high quality standard in financial
management, INDEBANK will place a new emphasis on project promotion and
technical assistance activities so that project proposals at an earlier
stage of formulation than in the past may be added to INDEBANK's operations
with an acceptable level of risk. It will also put more emphasis on the
economic impact of the projects submitted to it. In view of the firmness
of INDEBANK's pipeline of future projects (para 5.04) and considering
that INDEBANK's disbursements have averaged less than 2% of the estimated
investment in the monetary economy in 1973-1976, there is ample scope for
INDEBANK to achieve substantial increases in the volume of its operations.
Forecast Operations
5.04      Project Pipeline.  At the end of 1977, INDEBANK had a large pipeline
of 36 projects representing total possible financing by INDEBANK of K 16 mil-
lion (Annex 12). Many are medium-scale projects to be sponsored by INDEBANK
and, with an average total project cost of K 1.9 million, projects in the
pipeline are slightly smaller than in past approvals (para 4.02). The dis-
tribution of INDEBANK's financing in the pipeline confirms the trend towards
an increasing proportion of new projects as well as the continued emphasis on
private sector projects under majority Malawian ownership. The pipeline



- 29 -
continues to be centered on industries (32% by amount of financing) and
agro-industries (28%) mostly based on local raw materials, but it shows
a further diversification in several new subsectors: hotels (10%), mining
(9%), services for the airport project in Lilongwe (12%), transport (8%),
tea and rubber processing.
5.05      Volume of Operations.  INDEBANK's projections of operations are
presented in Annex 13. The expected operations are based mainly on INDEBANK's
past performance in project processing and on the annual level of approvals
indicated by the pipeline 1/. This would represent approvals of about K 4.9
million in 1978. However, to allow for the time needed by the new recruits
(para 3.18) to become operational, it was assumed that INDEBANK will not reach
that level of'approvals before 1979. From 1979 onwards, however, INDEBANK can
be reasonably expected to achieve a growth in approvals on the order of 12%
per year following its increase in staffing and the development of its pro-
motional activities. On this basis, total approvals should grow from K 3.9
million in 1978 to K 6.9 million in 1982. Following some lag, total disburse-
ments should average K 5.1 million (US$5.9 million) per year over the period
1977-1981 and thus represent about 3-4% of the expected total investment in
Malawi throughout the same period. INDEBANK should have no difficulties in
increasing its share of investments in the country given its role in the
country's industrial sector and in view of its more aggressive promotion
policy.
Resource Requirements

needs for funds on the basis of the forecast of operations as presented in

million uncommitted resources available at end 77.
3/   K I million from INDEBANK's local shareholders plus the cash generation
of the period 1978 - mid-81.
5.07      INDEBANK's projected commitments are expected to total K 17.2
million over the period 1978 to mid-1981. Over the same period, INDEBANK's
operations are projected to yield a total cash generation of K 4.0 million
in addition to the uncommitted surplus of K 2.3 million carried over from
1977 (para 4.08); this leaves a resource gap of K 10.9 million. To meet
this gap, INDEBANK has already secured from EIB a loan of 3 million units
of account- or approximately K 3 million - which was signed in November
1977 and is expected to be effective in early 1978. The use of this loan
is, however, restricted to manufacturing industry, mining and tourism.
In addition, the shareholders have accepted to contribute up to K 4 million
to cover part of INDEBANK's needs during the next four years (para 5.10).
5.08      The proposed Bank Loan of $3 million or about K 2.6 million equiva-
lent and the proposed IFC investment of K 500,000 would cover about 80% of
the remaining resource gap of K 3.9 million and about 84% of the estimated
foreign exchange component of this gap (K 3.7 million). INDEBANK should
have no problem in securing additional resources: indeed EIB is prepared to
consider a second loan to INDEBANK once the present one is exhausted - by
1980. Together, the Bank Loan and the IFC investment would represent about
24% of INDEBANK's total commitments over the two and a half year period 1979
to mid-1981, which is a reasonable percentage.



- 31 -
Forecast Financial Results
5.09      Increase in Share Capital.  Financial projections, presented
in Annexes 14 to 16, indicate that INDEBANK's total capitalization (i.e.
long-term debt plus equity) will build gradually up to K 29 million in 1982.
Considering INDEBANK's sound portfolio and the special nature of its repayment
obligations on income notes (paras 4.09 to 4.11), INDEBANK may increase its
debt to equity ratio to extend its sources of funds during the projected
expansion in its operations, but such increase should remain limited in view
of INDEBANK's relative youth. At negotiations INDEBANK agreed with the Bank
to observe an upper limit of 4:1 on its debt to equity ratio. INDEBANK's
current equity consists of K 3.0 million of issued share capital and K 97,000
of retained earnings.  Thus, according to the financial projections, INDEBANK
needs to start increasing its share capital by 1979 to maintain a 4:1 debt to
equity ratio.
5.10      The existing shareholders, ADMARC, CDC, DEG and FMO have already
agreed to provide K 250,000 each in share capital out of their expected con-
tribution of K 1 million, the remaining K 750,000 being income notes, or a
Sterling loan in the case of CDC. 1/ In addition, INDEBANK has requested IFC
to provide K 0.5 million of share capital, which would give IFC 11.1% of
INDEBANK's share capital.
5.11      With these new share capital contributions, INDEBANK would have
ensured that it can maintain the proposed 4:1 debt to equity limitation
over a reasonable planning period up to the second-half of 1981. At that
time INDEBANK could request the Bank to increase its debt to equity ratio
from 4:1 to 5:1 if its financial condition continues to be sound.
5.12      Financial Position.  Following the increased volume of operations,
total assets are expected to reach K 30.7 million by 1982. Projected balance
sheets show that INDEBANK is capable of sustaining this growth while main-
taining a good liquidity position with a constant current ratio of 1.7 and
keeping its debt to equity ratio below 4:1. During 1977-1982, INDEBANK has no
substantial repayments obligations on its borrowings; and thus shows a high
debt service coverage with a ratio above 2.7 through the period.
5.13      Profitability.  The financial ratios corresponding to INDEBANK's
projected financial operations are attached in Annex 17. Although assuming
conservative provisions for possible future losses on investments, financial
projections show that, during the next five years, INDEBANK can easily main-
tain a rather high spread of about 2.4% between the return on portfolio and
cost of debt, mainly due to the low interest charged by EIB (para 4.08).  Due
to this high spread compounded by the growth of operations, INDEBANK's net
profits are expected to increase from 6.2% of equity in 1977 to 7.7% in 1982.
1/   CDC is reported to draw its present funding solely from UK Government
loans, which makes its contributions in income notes increasingly
difficult. Conditions of the K 750,000 loan are yet to be defined.



- 32 -
This level of profitability should allow the institution to build up a general
reserve of 1.6% of total portfolio while distributing dividends of 5.8% in
1982.
VI. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN AND IFC INVESTMENT
Recommendations
6.01      INDEBANK is today one of the most independent, reputable and effi-
cient institutions involved in industrial development in Malawi. It has played
an effective catalytic role by putting together proposals emanating from the
Press Group, MDC and Government - and some promoted on its own - and has
become a focal point in bringing into the country the needed foreign capital
and technical expertise. After an initial strategy of careful investments in
commercially viable - yet development oriented - projects, INDEBANK is today
an efficient institution at the crossroads of the second - crucial - stage of
its development. Supported by a good portfolio, a solid financial situation,
capable management and active, involved, shareholders very experienced in -
and geared towards - economic development, INDEBANK will enter into a more
aggressive policy of project promotion, double the level of its business and
that of its staff - particularly Malawian professionals - and consolidate its
organization and operational procedures.
6.02      All the above features make INDEBANK a particularly suitable
allocator of Bank resources into Malawi's industrial sector, one that has
good growth prospects and which is increasingly among the Government's
priorities after the initial stages of the country's successful economic
development efforts after independence. Consequently, a Bank loan of $3
million and an IFC investment of K 0.5 million (about US$560,000 equiva-
lent) are recommended. This would represent a coverage of about 24% of
INDEBANK's projected total commitments during the period 1979 to mid 1981
for the financing of medium and large scale industrial, agricultural and
tourism projects. Some agriculture related projects, like ranching, cattle
and rabbit raising etc, should also be acceptable for Bank financing, given
their complementarity to industry in an overwhelmingly agricultural country,
and in order to provide INDEBANK with some flexibility in its resource
utilizations.
Main Features of the Bank Loan
Support to INDEBANK
6.03      Sector Distribution.  The $3 million Bank loan to INDEBANK would
provide equity, medium and long-term financing for fixed investments and
permanent working capital of medium/large industrial, agro-industrial and
tourism projects, with some agriculture-related projects being accepted.
Pure agriculture projects and commercial building financing, together with
trade operations would be excluded.



- 33 -
6.04      Ceiling on Loans and Free Limit.  Maximum credit granted to a
single project by INDEBANK under the Bank loan should be limited to K 600,000
to avoid that the Bank loan be used up by a few large projects. The indi-
vidual free limit should be set up at $100,000 and the aggregate free limit
at $750,000; this should allow the Bank to review about 80% in number of the
projects submitted by INDEBANK for financing and, thus monitor closely
the expected improvements derived from the institution's consolidation of
its procedures.
6.05      Relending Rate, Foreign Exchange Risk and Commitment Fee.  The
interest rate charged by INDEBANK to its subborrowers would be 10.5 - 11%,
with the foreign exchange risk passed to them. This would mean a positive
interest rate,,in real terms, above the forecast level of inflation in
Malawi.
6.06      Debt/Equity Limit.  A 4:1 debt equity limit is proposed.  This is
reasonable in view of INDEBANK's solid financial situation, good portfolio,
and to recognize and take into account the special nature - as debt - of
the income notes used by the company in the financing of its operations.
6.07      Disbursements.  The proceeds of the loan, expected to be fully
disbursed by 1982 as shown in Annex 18, will be used for the financing of:
(i) the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment and services needed for
the implementation of eligible subprojects; (ii) up to 75% of the cost of the
equipment previously imported in Malawi and purchased locally for the imple-
mentation of the above subprojects; and (iii) up to 50% of the total cost of
civil works, representing the foreign exchange component.
6.08      Amortization Schedule.  As usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming sub-
stantially with the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the subloans made
by INDEBANK, with a maximum of 15 years, including two years grace period.
Main Features of the IFC Investment
6.09      By investing in the share capital of INDEBANK, IFC would be support-
ing an institution which has been the main source of assistance and encourage-
ment to the development of the private sector in Malawi. The Chairman of
INDEBANK, with the agreement of its Board of Directors, has written to IFC
that INDEBANK and its current shareholders consider INDEBANK's support of the
private sector to be an important role which the Company performs in Malawi,
as has been demonstrated by its past operations. The proposed IFC investment
is expected to be reasonably profitable. The discounted return on the invest-
ment is expected to be about 9%, given the projected dividends and assuming
capital appreciation resulting from selling our shares at net asset value in
1982 1/ and no change in the kwacha/dollar exchange rate. Given the forecast
1/   The last year for which projections have been prepared.  In fact IFC
would very likely hold its shares for a longer period, which should
increase its return.



- 34 -
that INDEBANK's profitability and dividend yield will continue to increase,
its shares could become a reasonably attractive investment, especially for an
institutional investor such as one of the half-dozen financial institutions
in the country. However, like many DFCs, the potential marketability of
INDEBANK's shares is affected by its Articles of Association. These provide
for INDEBANK being a private company, limiting the number of shareholders to
50 and prohibiting a public offering. The Articles also provide that, should
any shareholder wish to sell his shares, then the other shareholders have
pre-emptive rights.  They further provide that the seller should agree on a
sales price with the directors or, in the case of a difference, that the price
should be determined by INDEBANK's auditors. The current shareholders have
agreed that if IFC should want to sell its shares, then the price would be net
asset value. In addition, ADMARC has agreed to give IFC a put option whereby
if the existing shareholders do not take up IFC's shares offered to them and
IFC has been unable to find other purchasers, then IFC may require ADMARC to
buy its shares at their net asset value over a period of 4 years after IFC
had held the shares for 8 years. Through this investment IFC would provide
both financial assistance to support INDEBANK's operations as well as tech-
nical assistance by having a seat on its Board of Directors. The investment
would meet IFC's objectives of supporting the private sector in the smaller
and poorer countries through establishing closer links with local DFCs. It
is also likely to be a reasonable investment from the point of view of profit-
ability and marketability.
Oblectives, Benefits and Risks
6.10      This first loan and equity investment in INDEBANK would give the
Bank Group the opportunity to participate actively in the development of
Malawi's industrial sector given the institution's key role and position in
it. In addition, support of INDEBANK at this crucial stage of its development
would have considerable institution building improvements which would parti-
cularly be prompted by the Bank Group's intervention at this stage. Main
aspects of this impact are: (i) improving the operational policies and
financial strategy of the institution in order to put INDEBANK on a sound
footing to efficiently play its increasingly important role in the future;
(ii) reinforcing INDEBANK's strategy to be a more aggressive, promotionally
oriented institution; (iii) reinforcing and training INDEBANK's staff -
particularly Malawian professionals; (iv) rationalizing and consolidating
appraisal and supervision procedures.
6.11      The proposed total financing of about $3.6 million for INDEBANK
will support investments totalling about $18 million. On the basis of the
same average cost per job than in projects financed by INDEBANK in the past
($13,000), 1,400 new jobs would be created, i.e. about 2% of present employ-
ment in manufacturing enterprises in Malawi. There are no specific risks
related to INDEBANK, which appears as a solid institution.
6.12      The study on SSIs in Malawi, which would pave the way for a full
fledged SSI project, would allow the Bank to collaborate closely with the
Government in the formulation of policies conducive to efficient SSI develop-
ment in the future.
