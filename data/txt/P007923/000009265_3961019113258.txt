MEMORANDIJM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO PARAGUAY
FOR A SECONDARY EDUCATION IMIPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Paraguay for the equivalent of US$24.5 mnillion to help
finance a Secondary Education Improvement Project. The loan would be at the Bank's
LIBOR-based interest rate for US dollar single currency loans, with a maturity of up to 15
years. Each semester's aggregate disbursements (Disbursed Amount) will have a grace
period of three years and a final maturity of nine years from the rate fixing date of that
Disbursed Amount. Paraguay is eligible for single currency loans because it has converted
all its VLR 82 loans to VLR 89 terms. The proposed US$24.5 million loan represents 100
percent of the planned FY96 lending program for Paraguay, but is within the US$100
million limit for single currency lending.
2.    Background. Paraguay has recently begun to emerge from a long period of
relative political and cultural isolation. The transition to a democratic system has been
stable after the 1989 coup that ended the 35-year dictatorship. Extreme poverty is low
and income distribution is better than the average for Latin America. Despite some
fluctuations, macroeconomic management of the open economy has been generally sound.
However, key challenges remain, both to consolidate economic results and to further
alleviate poverty. The education sector is central to the twin goals of sustaining growth
and improving living standards, particularly in light of the opportunities and challenges
emerging from the consolidation of the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR).
3.    Considering the fast-growing school-age population and the country's largely rural
and dispersed population, achievements in basic education are laudable. The illiteracy rate
is low compared with other Latin American countries, and gross primary school
enrollment rates have been above 100 percent since the early 1970s. In contrast, gross
secondary school enrollment, at 33 percent in 1992, is well below both the average for the
Region (about 47 percent) and for countries of comparable income levels (about 55
percent). Sirnilarly, higher education enrollment levels are less than half of the average for
middle income countries.
4     Paraguay's public expenditures on education are among the lowest in Latin
America. They grew to 2.9 percent of GDP in 1993 from 1.9 percent in 1991, due in
large part to increases in teachers' salaries, compared with an average in the Region of
about 4 percent. In terms of the overall budget composition, education's share rose to
about 17 percent by 1993 after a decline throughout most of the 1980s. While
maintaining universal primary school enrollment, this limited public spending on education
has been possible through (a) constraining access to the higher-cost secondary education;
(b) sacrifices in quality at all levels; and (c) significant private spending on education.



2
5.    The main issues in the secondary education system are: (a) limited and inequitable
access; (b) generally low levels of learning achievement, and particularly in basic skill areas
such as Spanish, mathematics and basic sciences, (c) often ill-prepared graduates that do
not satisfy the needs of either higher education or the labor market; (d) system
inefficiencies as charactenrzed by an estimated average repetition rate of 9 percent and
drop-out rate of 15 percent over the six years of secondary school (though statistics are
unreliable); and (e) weak institutional capacity to design and execute the modernization
and reform process. Problems of quality of secondary education are exacerbated by the
low quality at intake of secondary school from a largely bilingual (Spanish/Guarani)
population. Textbooks and educational materials are scarce, outdated and poorly utilized
as learning instruments. Physical facilities suffer from overcrowding, particularly in many
peri-urban schools. Teaching practices are further thwarted by the large number of
teachers that are either uncertified or have not had formal training in the area in which they
are teaching. In addition, information on student and sector performance is incomplete,
and there is no standardized system for comparing student achievement across schools.
6.    Government Strategy. Following the political changes in 1989, the government
created the Educational Reform Advisory Council under the Ministry of Education (MEC)
to prepare an analysis of the education system, design a reform program, and oversee its
implementation. The key features of the 1992 reform programn include: (a) restructuring
the present six years of primary and six years of secondary education (three years of lower
secondary and three years of upper secondary) into a system of nine years of basic
education (first cycle: grades 1-3, second cycle: grades 4-6, and third cycle: grades 7-9)
and three years of upper secondary education; (b) lowering the age for entry into primary
school from seven to six years; and (c) revising the curriculum to emphasize the opening
of civil society, the development of critical thinking skills and student-centered learning
processes, and local choice in defining curriculum content. The education reform strategy
was endorsed by the 1992 Constitution, which mandates an obligatory and free nine-year
basic education cycle, and requires that 20 percent of the national budget be allocated to
education (as compared with nine percent in 1990 and 17 percent in 1993).
7.    The Government which took office in August 1993 places education as a priority.
Some reform initiatives are already underway, such as the implementation of the revised
curriculum at the primary level. The MEC has also made initial efforts to increase its
administrative and operational efficiency. Transparent and competitive recruitment
procedures have been introduced, particularly for school supervisors and directors. An
independent audit of the payroll identified areas of significant potential savings. To
support further the reform program, the Government has developed a significant
investment program in education, centered on the US$59.0-million 1DB-financed Primary
Education Improvement Project and the proposed Secondary Education Improvement
Project under Bank financing. The 1DB project, effective as of March 1994, focuses on:
(a) at the primary level, implementation of a new curriculum, provision of textbooks and
teaching materials, expansion of access to pre-school education, rehabilitation of primary
school infrastructure, and overhaul of the primary school teacher training system; and (b)
overall strengthening of the MEC in the areas of management and administrative systems,



3
execution of a school mapping exercise, support for a National Education Evaluation
System, and development of a proposal for a new functional organization of the MEC.
Preparation of the two projects has been closely coordinated, and areas of joint support
have been clearly identified. A Coordination Agreement will institutionalize this process.
8.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. Since the early 1970s, the Bank has supported
five education and training projects in Paraguay. Ongoing operations were halted in the
mid- I 980s after the Bank suspended disbursements in response to deteriorating
macroeconomic management. With significant improvements in economic policies in the
early 1990s, the Bank renewed its partnership with Paraguay. As a first step, intensive
efforts went into rebuilding the Bank's analysis of economic and social conditions'
9.    The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Paraguay, discussed by the Board on
December 21, 1993, focuses on three objectives: (a) private sector development; (b)
agricultural development and natural resource management; and (c) poverty alleviation
through human resource development. The Bank group's assistance strategy in poverty
and human resource development calls for increasing access to secondary education,
improvements in educational quality at all levels, deconcentration of sector management,
promotion of community participation, and strengthening of institutional capacity.
Attention to the secondary education level will bear particular relevance to improving
Paraguay's opportunities within MEERCOSUR. The proposed project is fully consistent
with these objectives and would provide essential inputs while building the institutional,
analytical and policy foundations of a more far-reaching reform agenda in the future.
10.   Project Objectives. The proposed project would support the Government's
initiatives to improve the quality, efficiency and coverage of secondary education
(particularly the third cycle of basic education, i.e., grades 7-9), and to increase the MEC's
institutional capacity for information-based decision-making. The specific objectives of
the project would be to: (a) build the necessary information base on educational system
conditions and performance, essential for the design and monitoring of sectoral policies
and strategies; (b) improve teaching and learning conditions within the classroom through
the provision of essential inputs and improved physical conditions; (c) gradually ease
overcrowding and expand access at the secondary level through the construction and
rehabilitation of classrooms and other school facilities (starting with grades 7-9); and (d)
support more dynamic and participatory school management at the local level.
11.   Project Description. The project consists of five components. It would increase
institutional capacity through: Institutional Strengthening (US$3.2 million, or nine
percent of project base costs) to (a) develop an educational statistics system to track
student flows and system efficiency; (b) design and implement a student assessment system
Including: Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 9147-PA, October 15, 1991), Public
Expenditure Review: The Social Sectors (Report No. 10193-PA, June 16, 1992), MERCOSUR and
Paraguay's Growth Prospects (Report No. 10902-PA, January 28, 1993), Poverty and the Social
Sectors in Paraguay (Report No. 12293-PA, June 29, 1994), and June 1994 updated Country
Economnic Memorandum (Report No. 11723-PA).



4
to measure learning achievement; and (c) conduct research and policy studies to facilitate
information-based decision-making and increase the capacity to evaluate the impacts of
education investments. These efforts would apply to the education sector in general. The
quality, efficiency and coverage of secondary education would be improved by: Provision
of Textbooks, Educational Materials and Curricular Support (US$6.1 million, or 17
percent of project base costs) to support the implementation of the revised curriculum and
access to and quality of learning materials for grades 7 - 9; Training for Teachers and
School Managers (US$2.2 million, or six percent of base costs) to support upgrading and
innovations in the professional ability of secondary school teachers, as well as training in
school management for supervisors, school principals and parents' associations;
Infrastructure Upgrading and Expansion (US$20.5 million, or 57 percent of base
costs) to finance the rehabilitation and expansion of classrooms and school facilities and
the provision of basic school furniture, while continuing incentives for the involvement of
parents' associations in the cofinancing of school infrastructure; and a Pilot Proposal for
School-Based Innovation Projects (US$1.0 million, or three percent of base costs) to
develop a small pilot experience in demand-driven, school-based innovations designed by
the schools themselves, modeled after the experiences underway in Chile, Brazil, and
Uruguay. In addition, support to the Project Coordination Unit and PPF refinancing
accounts for the remaining six and one percent of base costs, respectively.
12.   Project Costs and Financing Plan. Project costs are estimated at US$40.5
rmillion, including contingencies. A Bank loan of US$24.5 million would finance 60
percent of total project costs, and would be disbursed over a period of five years. Support
from parents' associations (cash contributions, donated labor and materials) is estimated at
US$4.1 million (10 percent of project costs). The Government would finance the
remaining US$11.9 million (30 percent of project costs). Preparation activities have been
supported through a PHRD Japanese Grant for the social sectors and a US$450,000 PPF
advance. The attached Schedule A presents project costs and financing plan.
13.   Economic Analysis. At US$190, the total investment per student is in line with
the scale of investment in other Bank-financed secondary education projects in the Region.
Although an economic rate of return is generally not applicable to this type of project,
empirical results of the links between education and earnings do point to acceptable
private ( 15 percent) and social ( 13 percent) rates of return for individuals who complete
their secondary education. In addition, unit costs have been optimized, including: (a)
selection of appropriate architectural altematives, (b) involvement of parents' associations
which is expected to lower the unit costs of construction by one-third; (c) international
competitive bidding to lower unit costs for textbooks and educational materials; and (d)
choice of a school-based teacher training model which affords considerable savings.
Recurrent costs to be generated by the project consist largely of teachers' salaries to staff
new classrooms. These new classrooms would generate by the end of the project between
US$5 million and US$1 1 million annually in operating costs (depending on number of
shifts), equivalent to between 2 and 4 percent of the 1994 MEC budget.

14.   Project Implementation  The MEC would be responsible for overall project
planning and execution. A PCU, reporting directly to the Minister, would coordinate all
project activities and would ensure that the project's execution is carried out in
accordance with established guidelines, procedures and agreed targets. The PPF has
facilitated the establishment of the PCU and training in Bank procedures prior to Loan
effectiveness. A draft Administrative Manual has been prepared which sets forth the
PCU's functions and structure, administrative and financial procedures, procurement
arrangements, and reporting and auditing requirements Schedule B provides procurement
and disbursement arrangements. Schedule C and D sunimarize key project processing
steps and the status of Bank operations in Paraguay, respectively.
15.   A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) has been prepared by the Government. The
PIP has been incorporated into an Operational Manual which specifies objectives,
activities, targets and institutional arrangements for each component. To allow for
adjustments during implementation, the PCU would be responsible for furnishing to the
Bank an Annual Implementation Plan (Plan Operativo Anual). In addition, an
Administrative and Procurement Review would be held to assess the legal, procurement
and administrative aspects of project implementation. A Bank-Government Mid-Termn
Review would also be carried out.
16    Project Sustainability. Institutional sustainability of project benefits would be
furthered through: (a) technical assistance and training to build long-term implementation
capacity; and (b) a proactive role for school principals and parents' associations in local
school management. Financial sustainability would be fostered through community
financing of school maintenance and the establishment of a mechanism at the national level
to generate resources for textbook replenishment. The MEC would fully finance
incremental salaries associated with institutional strengthening, as well as maintenance of
vehicles and equipment, through the counterpart financing requirements of the project,
equivalent to about one percent of the 1994 MEC budget on an annualized basis. For the
new classrooms to be constructed, the Government would commit to assigning
incremental teaching slots as needed.
17    Bank Experience and Lessons Learned. Relevant lessons from Bank
experience in the education sector and in Paraguay have been taken into consideration as
follows: (a) giving priority to improvements in core skills at the secondary level; (b)
creating an appropriate information and analytical basis for monitoring project and sector
developments; (c) strengthening of community participation and local school management;
(d) incorporating school-based teacher training linked explicitly to the textbooks and other
educational materials to be provided by the proposed project; (e) building elements of
teacher selection into the procurement of these materials; and (f) defining an appropriate
strategy for student assessment given the weak institutional context, including sub-
contracting of selected parts of the system. General lessons from project implementation
in Paraguay have been incorporated in terms of project ownership, attention to
procurement and disbursement arrangements, incorporation of community participation,
and agreement on counterpart funding mechanisms to ensure timely disbursements.

1 8    Key Issues and Actions. Prior to negotiations, the Government presented revised
versions of the Adminrstrative and Operational Manuals, as well as a Coordination
Agreement between the project coordination units of the 1DB-financed Primary Education
Project and that of the proposed Bank project. During negotiations, assurances and
agreement were confirrned on: (a) counterpart funding arrangements; (b) independent
auditing satisfactory to the Bank; (c) that the PCU be staffed with high-caliber personnel
whose qualifications and experience would be satisfactory to the Bank, and that no
changes in the Administrative Manual would be made without prior consultation with the
Bank; (d) an Annual Implementation Plan to be furnished to the Bank no later than March
I of each year; (e) no later that September 30 of each year, the Government would present
an action plan for implementation during the following year, satisfactory to the Bank,
including a list of the expected teaching positions to be assigned to new classrooms to be
constructed during the following year; (f) procurement procedures, including the format
and content of prototype National Competitive Bidding documents, standard contracts
and prior review arrangements; (g) the scope and timing of the Administrative and
Procurement Review, and the Mid-Term Review; and (h) the submission of annual
progress reports no later than February 15 of each year covering the prior calendar year.
Conditions of loan effectiveness would be: (a) establishment of the Research Committee
to coordinate policy studies and impact evaluations, satisfactory to the Bank; (b)
presentation of the budget proposal for the MEC for 1996 submnitted to Congress,
including the counterpart funds necessary to carry out the project during its first year; (c)
the presentation of the first Annual Implementation Plan, satisfactory to the Bank; and (d)
presentation of the Administrative Manual and Operational Manual duly approved by the
MEC. A condition of disbursement for School-Based Innovation Sub-Projects would
be that the MIEC presents operating procedures and selection criteria for the program
satisfactory to the Bank. A condition of disbursement against textbook purchases and
distribution would be that the MEC prepare, validate and furnish to the Bank a new
curriculum and lesson plans (guidelines) for grades 7 - 9.
19    Poverty Category. Access to and improved quality of secondary education offers
to increase the earnings potential and "trainability" of secondary school students and
thereby improve individuals' chances of rising out of poverty. Although not included in
the Program of Targeted Interventions due to the general profile of the secondary school
population, eligibility criteria for the infrastructure component target schools with a low-
income student population.
20.   Environmental Aspects. The project is expected to have no significant
environmental impact. An environmental rating of"C" is assigned.
21.   Program Objective Category. Within the broad category of human resource
development, the project would address issues of secondary education access and quality.
22.   Participatory Approach. The preparation process sought out the preferences
and feedback of key stakeholders in education, including the Education Reform Council,
managerial and technical level staff of the MEC (including supervisors, school principals,



7
and teachers), members of Congress, the pnrvate sector (e.g., local publishers) and the
experience of several NGOs in the sector. These consultations helped promote technical
and local relevance of the proposed project, political and institutional support for its
implementationi, and capacity building in new ideas and systems. Parents' associations
would be strengthened by the project and would be actively involved in its execution.
23    Expected Benefits. The main benefits to be realized during implementation of the
proposed project are: (a) improvement in the quality of the learning process through
provision of better learning tools, teaching practices and physical facilities; (b) partial
satisfaction of the social demands for access to lower secondary schools, particularly from
underserved marginal urban and rural areas; and (c) increased understanding of sector and
student performance, and the resulting enhanced capacity of the MEC to monitor and
design sector policies. In the longer term, this should contribute to a more productive and
trainable workforce, increase the internal efficiency of the education system, create a more
dynamic and better-managed school setting, and establish the analytical foundations of
evolving sector policies and strategies.
24.   Risks and Safeguards. Risks of administrative difficulties which hamper
efficient procurement and disbursement and slow project execution, a common problem in
Paraguay, would be minimized through the application of an Administrative Manual to
clearly define administrative and procurement procedures, agreement on standard
procedures and documents prior to implementation, and an Administrative and
Procurement Review to address any issues arising during implementation. Risks of
inconsistency between the primary and secondary levels would be addressed through the
incorporation of the lower years of secondary education into the basic education cycle and
the implementation of the revised curriculum in a phased-in manner. On the operational
level, the proposed project would be coordinated closely with the IDB-financed
investments at the primary level. The risk of overload of the implementation capacity of
the MEC would be mitigated through the MEC's preparation of a PIP. Flexibility will be
built in through the preparation of Annual Implementation Plans. Key activities will be
sub-contracted outside of the MEC or phased in as pilot activities. The risks related to
counterpart financing have been addressed through agreement on counterpart amounts
and disbursement mechanisms, as well as incentives to share the costs of secondary
education with parents' associations.
25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
