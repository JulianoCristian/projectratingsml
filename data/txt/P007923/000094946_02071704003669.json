sustainability, and substantial\n            institutional development impacts. Lessons outline the\n            importance for the project design to maintain a balance\n            between detail, and flexibility, which in this case, was\n            afforded to component development, and change during\n            execution, namely in the teacher training component, in the\n            significant increase in textbooks provided, and in the\n            addition of new subject texts. Moreover, the broad-based\n            ownership of the project within the Ministry of Education,\n            is an important explanatory factor for the project success :\n            the semi-autonomous Project Unit was able to successfully\n            involve the relevant parties, in the design, and\n            implementation processes, while maintaining an effective\n            administrative control of the project. However, despite the\n            overall simplicity of project design, the coordination of\n            support for the new curriculum, and teaching methods fell\n            short. The main weakness from the Bank's perspective\n            was in the content of teacher training; instead, an earlier\n            attempt to target specific, partial quality improvements,\n            such as the use of textbooks, might have facilitated earlier\n            quality gains on a limited scale. Other lessons address the\n            demand for better education, and the importance of local\n            stakeholder participation; the importance of having an\n            evaluation plan in place at the project start-up; and, the\n            need to involve the Borrower in donor coordination."}, "docdt": "2002-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
