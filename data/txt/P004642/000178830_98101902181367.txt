INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIDN OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE FOR AN
EDUCATION PROJECT
(THE UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE)
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Singapore for the equivalent of US$9.5 million to finance
the foreign exchange cost of the expansion and relocation of the University
of Singapore. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, with interest at 7¼ percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTIDN
2.        The Bank has so far made ten loans for projects in Singapore,
eight of them since Singapore became an independent republic in August 1965.
The amount outstanding and held by the Bank as of December 31, 1971 was
US$105.7 million, as shown at Annex I. These loans have been for power, port
modernization and expansion, water supply and sewerage, and, through the
Development Bank of Singapore, for industrial development. Project execution
and loan disbursements have generally been in line with expectations, except
in the case of the 1966 port project (Loan No. 462), where unforeseen problems
with land reclamation seriously delayed the start of construction. These
problems have been overcome. The feeder berth is in use for general cargo,
the first container berth will be in operation by the end of February 1972,
and the terminal is expected to be completed in November, 1372. Allowing
for time required for the payment of retention monies, disbursements are now
estimated to be completed in June 1973; this will require a further extension
of the closing date, which is currently December 31, 1972.
3.        The loan now proposed for education marks the beginning of a change
in the emphasis of Bank lending to Singapore. Although the loans currently
under preparation for submission to the Executive Directors in the next
twelve to eighteen months, will be for the seccnd phase of the port program,
for telecommunications and fcr sewerage, they will be the last to be considered
for these sectors at this time. The agencies concerned are reaching the point
where they are strong enough financially and administratively to finance their
future expansion from their own resources and from borrowings abroad from
commercial sources. The focus of Bank lending will accordingly shift to
projects that call as much for technical as for financial assistance.   These
may include technical education, urban development and mass transit, which
is the subject of an ongoing UNDP study, for which the Bank is executing agency.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
1~.      An economic mission visited Singapore in September 1971.   Its report
(EAP-29, dated January 24, 1972) is being circulated separately. The principal
conclusions are discussed below. Country data are at Annex II.



5.        Since independence from Great Britain in 1959 Singapore has
faced a number of difficulties, arising from the confrontation with Indonesia
between 1963 and 1965, separation from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965,
after having belonged to it for only three years, and the gradual withdrawal
of the British forces which started in 1967 and was completed in 1971. The
main objective of the Government's policy since 1965 has been to provide
sufficient employment for the fast-growing labor force by establishing a
domestic industrial base which would also reduce Singapore's dependence
on entrepot trade. This was to be achieved by encouraging direct foreign
investment through the granting of economic incentives, the provision of a
first-rate industrial infrastructure, and the maintenance of wage stability.
At the same time the social services were to be improved to provide increased
benefits for the people as a whole.
6.        The Government has been largely successful in overcoming these
difficulties and attaining its objectives. The economy has grown at an
impressive rate over the past decade - in excess of 10 percent annually in
1961-70 and 15 percent in 1968-70. The high growth rate was accompanied by
a movement away from the traditional trading activities towards the establish-
ment of a domestic industrial base and, in the last three years, by virtual
wage and price stability. The growth and transformation of GD? was led by
the manufacturing sector which was responsible for nearly one-third of the
increase in GDP during 1968-70. One quarter of the increase was from
domestic trade and 12 percent from entrepot trade. By 1970 the manufacturing
sector had increased its share of GDP from 10 percent in 1961 to 21 percent,
whereas the share of entrepot trade had dropped from 17 to 11 percent over
the same period.
7.        The rapid growth of the manufacturing sector has also been a major
factor in reducing unemployment, which had stood at 8 percent of the labor
force in 1967. Employment in manufacturing increased by over 60,000 between
1967-70, or well over half of the increase in the number of persons employed.
Most of the remainder were absorbed by the public sector and in the tourism
and construction industries, both of which grew rapidly in the same period.
Thus by the end of 1970 unemployment had dropped to about h percent of the
labor force despite the closing down of most of the British bases. Ln fact,
by 1971 Singapore began to face shortages of unskilled labor in some sectors,
particularly construction and ship repairing, and in some categories of
skilled workers, resulting in a sharp rise in the number of immigrant workers,
particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia. A shortage of qualified personnel
at the managerial and supervisory levels also appeared and was only partially
met by the hiring of expatriate staff.
8.        Apart from drastically reducing unemployment, the Government has
also provided substantial social benefits in the form of low-cost housing
and heavily subsidized educational and health services. At the same time
pressure on social services has been eased by a highly effective family
planning program which has managed to lower the crude birth rate from 30 per
thousand in 1965 to 22 per thousand in 1969 and 1970.
9.        Singapore's rapid development has been financed by rapidly rising
domestic savings (averaging 24 percent of GDP between 1968-70) and large
inflows of foreign private capital. The rate of investment rose impressively



- 3 -
from l1. percent of GDP in 1966 to 27 percent in 1970. Most of the gains were
made in the private sector. Private investment increased its share of total
investment from 4a0 percent to 60 percent during this period; however, the
proportion of private investment financed by direct foreign investment also
rose rapidly from 30 percent to 70 percent. The financing of the private sector
was facilitated by the rapid evolution of financial institutions, which mobilized
domestic and external resources and channelled them into investment.
10.       Public sector finances have been marked by sound management and an
improvement in the savings performance of the Government. Current account
surpluses increased over the last four years from about l4 percent of GDP to
7 percent. Revenues have been strengthened by greater reliance on domestic
taxes rather than customs duties, making the tax system more responsive to
increases in income. Public sector development expenditures have risen rapidly.
Most of these expenditures are made by a group of well-run and financially
strong statutory authorities which are responsible for most large-scale
development projects.
11.       Singapore's balance of payments position continues to be strong.
Although a current account deficit appeared in 1970 for the first time since
1965 due to a massive increase in imports of capital goods for the fast ex-
panding manufacturing sector, this was more than offset by the large surplus on
capital account. Most of this surplus can be attributed to private long-term
capital. As a result net exchange reserves rose by US$196 million in 1970,
to reach US$1,319 million at the end of 1970 and US$1,1.77 million as of June
1971 or equivalent to over 8 months cf retained imports at current levels.
12.       The Government is currently working out a development strategy for
the 1970's based on a growth rate of about 15 percent annually throughout
the decade. Although the planning process has not yet reached a stage where
any definite conclusions can be drawn about the feasibility of this target
for the decade as a whole, the large-scale investment already under way or
committed indicates this is likely to be achieved over the next three to five
years. In addition to foreign investment commitments already made there is
also a lengthening pipeline of applicatinns by foreign firms attracted by
the economic incentives offered by the Government. The growth pattern of
the recent past with foreign direct investment providing the impetus through
the manufacturing sector is therefore likely to continue. Export prospects
for manufactured goods are good since many of the manufacturing firms are
subsidiaries of multinational companies with established overseas markets.
A high growth rate in the range of 12 to 15 percent per year therefore
appears possible even beyond the next three to five years.
13.       The future is however not without problems. First,entrepot trade
will continue to be vulnerable, both to world price fluctuations and to the
efforts of Singapore's neighbors to establish their own direct trading links,
although trading companies have so far shown a strong preference for Singapore
as a regional distribution center. Secondly, there is the possibility of
serious manpower shortages in certain industries and certain manpower categcries,
which will require expanded training and educational facilities. The prcposed
project will help in this direction. Thirdly, there may be growing pressure
for wage increases which could affect Singapore's attractiveness as
a base for foreign manufacturing firms. However, the expected growth



- 4 -
in productivity as more technologically sophisticated industries are established
in Singapore should offer scope for increased wages without serious pressure
on labor costs. Fourthly, some decline in the Government's current account
surplus can be expected due to increased expenditure on economic services and
defense, which have recently risen sharply. On the other hand the Government
has shown its ability to keep current expenditures within bounds and there is
some scope for raising Government revenues. Lastly, large investments will
have to be made to expand public utilities, transportation facilities and
other economic and social infrastructure to meet rapidly increasing demand.
14.       None of these problems is insuperable and given continued strong
financial and economic management, Singapore should be able to take them
in its stride. Singapore should be able to meet the increased demands on its
social and economic infrastructure without major difficulty, at least in the
medium-term. The high income elasticity of government revenues and the
efficient management of the statutory authorities encourage confidence that
public sector savings will be adequate to finance an expanded public invest-
ment program. Moreover, the Government has accesstoa growing reservoir of
low-cost funds in the Central Provident Fund which is financed by compulsory
contributions from all enployees' wages and salaries, and which has been the
main source of funds for the Government's domestic borrowing in the past.
15.       Official external borrowing requirements will depend lBrgely on
the size of long-term private inflows. Given the commitments already made,
and the large number of applications for "pioneer" status in the pipeline,
these inflows will probably be sufficient to cover most of Singapore's
external capital requirements for the next three years. It is too early
to draw firm conclusions about the likely level of private capital inflows
beyond 1974 and it remains to be seen to what extent Singapore will be able
to continue to attract foreign investment to develop further its export and
domestic manufactures and to deepen its industrial structure. It does
appear likely that the proportion of private investment financed from abroad
will decline from the recent unusually high level of two-thirds, which was
due mainly to the concentration of private investment in large projects such
as oil refining and shipbuilding, and a deepening of the industrialization
process beyond 1974 would call for greater participation by local capital.
On this assumption and given some further increase in reserves, but at a
declining rate in relation to imports from the current high level, there
appears to be a need for official borrowing on a modest scale in the medium-term
and possibly at a rising level in the latter seventies. The borrowing require-
ments would, in fact, turn out to be quite large even in the medium-term if
the expected growth of entrepot trade does not materialize or the proportion
of investment financed from abroad declines more than expected.
16.       Singapore's external public debt situation is good with only some
US$285 million outstanding (including undisbursed) as of June 1971. About
one-third is due to the Bank, one-quarter to the U.K. Government and 18 percent
to the Asian Development Bank; suppliers' credits are only about 15 percent of
the total. The debt service burden arising out of the present debt is minimal,
equivalent to less than 2 percent of domestic and less than 3 percent of gross
domestic savings.   Singapore is thus creditworthy for considerable external
borrowing on conventional terms.



PART III - THE SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
17.       Singapore's education and training system follows the British
pattern but is being reformed to meet local needs. Primary education covers
six years and is attended by 90% of the relevant age group. Most of the
teachers are qualified and the quality and efficiency of education is high.
Secondary education covers a lower cycle of four years and a higher pre-
university cycle of two years. It is attended by 4O% of the relevant age
group most of whom take general courses but an increasing proportion is
enrolling in vocational and technical courses. Reforms in curricula,
examination and science teaching are being implemented. Higher educatiorn
is provided at two universities, the public University of Singapore and the
semi-public primarily Chinese language Narqang University.
18.       As rnoted above the recent high rates of growth hale given rise tc
shortages aot only of certain categories of unskilled and skilled labor but
also of qualified people at management and supervisory levels. A continued
high rate of growth will be dependent to an important degree on the availability
of sufficient supervisory, technical and professicnal manpower. In the short
run Singapore can continue to import high level manpower and technicians, but
in the longer run it will have to increase and improve the technical and
managerial capabilities of its own work force.
19.       The Government    plans to meet the future demand for skilled high
level manpower mainly through expanding the capacity of the University of
Singapore, particularly that of the Faculties of Engineer:ing and Architecture
and the School of Accountancy and Business Administration.
20.       The University of Singapore, established in 1962, at present cffers
diplom  courses, undergraduate programs and graduate studies at se-ven faculties
(Arts and Social Sciences, law, Physical Sciernces, Medicine, Dentistry,
Engineering, and Architecture) and five schools (Education, Pharmacy, Account-
ancy and Business Administration and the School of Graduate Studies). Research
activities are conducted at special Institutes or Centers, such as the Economic
Research Center, the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and the United
Kingdom Research Council.   It is an academically and administratively well-run
University although further integration cf its adninistrative and academic
services is required and it should diversify and expand its programs. Some
faculties and schools have also experienced difficulties in recruiting and
retaining competent staff. Since 1962 enrollment has more than doubled to
reach 4,600 in 1971. Enrollment in architecture, engineering and accountancy
and business administration is about 38 percent of the total and will reach
about 40 percent of the 7,400 projected enrollment by 1980. By that time the
University would graduate annually 365 engineers, 70 architects, building
surveyors and urban Dlanners anc 250 business schccl graduates and acccentants.
21.       The e,dsting buildings of the University are located at fcior
different sites: (a) the main campus at Bukit Timah, which houses the Facul-
ties of Iaw, Arts, Social Sciences and Physical Sciences and the School of
Accountancy and Business Administration; (b) the Faculty of Engineering, which is
temporarily housed at the Polytechnic; (c) the Faculty of Architecture, which is



- 6 -
temporarily accommodated in ex-military premises; and (d) the Faculties
of Medicine, Dentistry and the School of Pharmacy which occupy premises
adjacent to the Singapore General Hospital. None of these sites is
suitable for the long range expansion of the University and continued
dispersal of faculties and schools would hamper seriously the integration
of both administrative and academic services. The University is therefore
to be relocated and consolidated at a new site, Kent Ridge, about 10 miles
from the center of Singapore, where a former military base offers about
125 acres of usable land (see map attached).
22.       The proposed project is the first phase of this program and
consists of: (i) the construction, furnishing and equipping of facilities
for 1,820 student places in the Faculty of Engineering, 360 places in the
Faculty of Architecture and 920 places in the School of Accountancy and
Business Administration, with supporting administrative and communal
buildings, boarding facilities for 900 students and quarters for 51 graduates
and supervisory staff; (ii) the construction and peripheral equipment (card
punch and reader, high speed printer and magnetic tape drives) for a computer
center, the University renting or buying the computer itself from its own
resources; and (iii) the provision of specialist services to develop teaching
aids and to coordinate the execution of the project. The project would be
completed in about five years.
23.       In addition to expanding its output of civil, electrical and
mechanical engineers, the Faculty of Engineering would offer a new course
in industrial engineering. The School of Accountancy and Business Administra-
tion would also offer new courses of special relevance to Singapore, for
example, export marketing and industrial production.
2a.       The plans for the first phase of university development are based
on conservative estimates of the demand for skilled high level manpower on
the one hand and of the expected availability of qualified teachers on the
other. The output of graduates from the expanded faculties may still fall
short of the actual demand and the difference would have to be met by poly-
technic students, upgraded technicians and expatriates.
25.       To improve and increase the staffs of the Faculty of Engineering
and the-School of Accountancy and Business Administration the University will
keep its employment policies under continuing review to ensure that it can
recruit and retain an adequate number of qualified staff. The University wrill
also continue to seek fellowships for further training of its staff abroad
and plans to employ, with assistance from the Government, bilateral and multi-
lateral sources, specialists from overseas to improve curricula and the standard
of research.
26.       The physical aspects of the proposed project closely follow the
guidelines of a physical master plan prepared by a UNDP-financed consul&int
which provides a framework for the integration and long-term physical
development of all university facilities on the site at Kent Ridge. WShen
the entire university has been moved to the new site it will occupv less
than half of the space available, leaving ample room for future expansion.



27.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$20.0
million, taking account of the recent currency realignments. The break-
down of costs is given in the Loan and Project Summary at Annex III. The
proposed loan, which would be made to the Government and passed on to the
University on a grant basis, would cover the foreign exchange cost estimated
at US$9.5 million. The Government of Singapore would finance the local cost
of the project. The University of Singapore differs substantially frcm
institutions being financed under other Bank Group education projects and
costs are not readily conparable. However,the estimated capital cost of
$3,800 per student place and $2,600 per boarding place are considered reasonable
for the type of university accommodation to be provided.
28.       Contracts for construction and for the supply of furniture and
equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
A margine of preference of 15 percent or the applicable customs duty whichever
is the lower would be applied in the comparison of foreign and local bids for
the supply of furniture and equipment. It is likely that construction and
furniture contracts will be won by local firms and equipment contracts by
foreign suppliers. Disbursements would be made against the directly identi-
fiable foreign exchange costs of imported furniture and equipment and of
technical assistance and 42 percent of contracts awarded to local contractors
and suppliers, representing the estinmated foreign exchange component.
29.       The University of Singapore Development Unit, staffed by architects
and engineers seconded from the Public Works Department and the Housing and
Development Board, will be responsible for the execution of the project.
With the addition of a procurement officer, an accountant and some supporting
staff, which the University has undertaken to engage by September 30, 1972,
the Development Unit would be fully capable of carrying out the proposed
project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Singapore and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the University of
Singapore, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for education
projects.
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
32.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
