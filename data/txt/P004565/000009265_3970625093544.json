     Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            sharing supervision responsibilities between Washington and\n            the resident mission can be efficient and effective. During\n            the project, staff from the resident mission and\n            headquarters participated in all missions, and several\n            useful studies were produced. For the future, the\n            development of a supervision management system within\n            Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) will\n            broaden the pool of shared information resources, lead to\n            more collegial relationships between Bank and DECS staff and\n            reinforce the Borrower's self-evaluation capacity.\n            Management information, coordination mechanisms, and\n            financial accounting systems must be operational at loan\n            effectiveness. The lack of fully functional systems\n            compromised DECS ability to monitor ongoing activities,\n            execute action plans, and plan supervision missions."}, "docdt": "1996-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
