MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A SECOND ELEMENTARY EDUCATIGN PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of the Philippines for US$200 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 20 years including
five years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would
help finance a second elementary education project.
2.       Background.  Recent Bank sector work (Report No. 7473-PH, December
1988) noted significant achievements of the Philippine educational system:
enrollment rates comparable to those in developed countries, extensive private
sector participation, and exceptionally high female representation. Another
unique feature is that public resources for education are directed largely
toward elementary schooling, a pattern of subsidization fully justified by
the positive externalities associated with basic education, and which
contributes to a high degree of structural equity in the system. At the same
time, however, the system is characterized by serious internal inefficiencies,
reflected in high dropout rates and low levels of student achievement,
particularly among students from lower-income housqholds. This adverse
Social selectivity originates in the early grades of the basic education
cycle. Efforts to reduce social inequities in the system, therefore, need
to focus on improving survival at the elementary leve_. Similarly, as the
outcomes of elementary schooling determine the quality of entrants into
subsequent educational levels and into the work force, sector-wide development
depends strongly on the improved provision of basic education services.
3.       The first Elementary Education Project (Loan 2030-PH), which was part
of a ten-year (1981-90) development program of the Department of Education,
Culture and Sports (DECS), was recently completed with Bank assistance. The
project introduced new policies and structures for financing and management,
a revised curriculum with improved instructioz.al materials, and staff
development programs for central and local DECS offices and for schools.
Reports on project performance show major accomplishments in expanding the
institutional capacities of the DECS operating units involved in planning,
management and program implementation for the elementary education subsector,
as well as encouraging signs of improved student achievement. However, much
remains to be done to build on these accomplishments, as well as to address
the continuing weaknesses in the subsector which include the following;
(a) the physical inputs necessary for teaching and learning remain inadequate;
(b) schooling effectiveness is limited by weaknesses in teachers' subject
mastery and pedagogical skills and by the lack of professional support from
school administrators and supervisors; (c) serious inefficiencies and
inequities exist in the system due to the high dropout rate at the elementary
level; (d) related to the dropout issue, some six million out-of-school youth
and adults lack functional literacy skills, with an additional half million
joining their ranks each year; and (e) subsector as well as sector planning
and management are hampered by inadequacies in the systems for management
information and monitoring and evaluation.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has maintained a dialogue
on general education issues through the first Elementary Education Project and



-2-
recent sector work. The proposed project vould enable the Bank to continue
this dialogue and to provide the technical and financial support that would
enable the Government to adiress the outstanding sector issues.  Bank
involvement would also support poverty alleviation by targeting educational
resources to depressed localities and children at a high risk of failure and
dropout, which is a priority need in the Philippines.
5.        Proiect Objectives.  The overall objective of the project would be
.o increase equity, efficiency and quality in elementary education through
assistance to the DECS subsector investment program and action plan for
Government fiscal years 1990-92. Specifically, the project would aim tot
Ca) provide essential school infrastructure and other physical resources
equitably; (b) improve the effectiveness of teachers and administrators;
(c) increase the basic learning attainments of targeted groups; and
(d) strengthen DECS institutional capacities in planning and management.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project would support the
three-year DECS physical investment program for elementary education through:
(a) construction of school facilities to reduce classroom shortages and
accommodate enrollment growth, and the rehabilitation and replacement of
damaged classrooms and workshops; these would be allocated according to a
formula based on physical need and poverty incidence; (b) provision of about
1.5 million desks to reduce severe deficits5 (c) production and distribution
of some 47 million textDooks and other instructional materials to improve the
student-textbook ratio to 1:1 by 1992; and (d) provision of school equipment
and instructional aids to further enhance learning. The proposed project would
also support the DECS action plan for elementary education, comprising three
components to meet specific objectives. To improve teacher and administrator
performance, the project would institutionalize the program for in-service
training developed under the first Elementary Education Project, and continue
to provide training for teachers, school principals, district and subject
matter supervisors. Studies to increase the effectiveness of pre-service
teacher training and certification would also be carried out in preparation
for future actions and investments. To increase basic education attainments
for children at risk of leaving school prematurely and the out-of-school
population lacking functional literacy, the project woulds (a) introduce
dropout prevention measures on a pilot basis in selected low-income
municipalities in six regions of the country, involving the participation of
nongovernmental organizations in these communities; (b) carry out a study to
determine the relative effects of school and non-school factors on student
attendance, achievement and retention; and (c) expand the DECS literacy program
through the development and dissemination of learning materials, training of
literacy teachers, support for organizing, monitoring and evaluating classes,
and assistance for post-literacy activities including community reading centers
and provision of neo-literacy materials. To strengthen DECS capabilities to
plan and manage the sector, the project woulds (a) introduce an annual
assessment program of elementary school performance; (b) improve the DECS
management information system; (c) carry out studies to improve methodologies
for enrollment and financial projections; and (d) establish a system for more
efficient dissemination and maintenance of DECS organizational information.
7.          The total cost of the project is estimated at US$410 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$102 million (252). The
proposed Bank loan of US$200 million equivalent would finance 55Z of total
project costs, net of taxes and duties. Retroactive financing of up to



US$20 million equivalent would be provided for eligible expenditures incurred
before loan signing but after January 1, 1990. A breakdown of the costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively, and a map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8395-PH
dated May 30, 1990, is being distributed separately.
8.       Actions Agreed.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) the maintenance of a newly-created Project Advisory Group and Project
Implementation Coordinating Unit in DECS throughout the project period;
(b) annual meetings between the Government and the Bank to review and update
the action plan and corresponding budget requirements; (c) setting aside of
the budget for textbook distribution to ensure timely transport of textbooks
to schools; td) authorization of district offices of the Department of Public
Works and Highways to send reimbursement documents for school building
construction directly to the DECS central office, to expedite disbursements;
and (e) separation of the budget for elementary school desks from the general
category of supplies and materials, to help assure budget availability for
the planned quantity of desks.
9.       Benefits.  The project would improve the quality of the national
elementary education program and enhance learning at the primary level.
It would also promote equity and support the Government's poverty alleviation
efforts by: (a) using budgetary allocation criteria which target the
distribution of educational resources to disadvantaged areas; (b) laying the
groundwork for reducing dropouts from elementary schooling among children of
poor families; and (c) expanding literacy training to the out-of-school youth
and adults who lack functional literacy. In addition, the development of
student assessment capacities at the elementary level would provide a basis
for improved sector-wide monitoring and evaluation, and improvements in the
DECS information system would result in more efficient and effective sector
planning and management.
10.      Risks.  The main risk is delayed project implementation due to
inadequate budgetary allocations to the subsector and changes in the project
management organizational structure and staffing. To minimize this risk, the
Bank has confirmed that sufficient funds have been appropriated to meet the
1990 project costs; joint annual reviews of project performanc  and budget
allocation requirements would be held; and organizational and staffing
arrangements as agreed with the Bank would be maintained throughout the
project period.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
