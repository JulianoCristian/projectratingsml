Education Project\n            will constitute a second phase of further improving equity,\n            efficiency, and quality in elementary education through\n            support to the 1990-92 subsector investment program and\n            action plan of the Department of Education, Culture, and\n            Sports (DECS).  The project's objective is to increase\n            equity, efficiency, and quality in elementary education\n            through assistance to the DECS investment program.  This\n            will be pursued through short and longer term measures which\n            aim to : a) meet the subsector's requirements for\n            essential physical resources; b) improve the professional\n            competence of teachers and school administrators; c) expand\n            the population with basic knowledge and skills, with efforts\n            targeted to at-risk children and illiterate youth and\n            adults; and d) further develop DECS instituional capacities\n            in planning and management of the elementary education\n            subsector.  In support of these objectives, the project will\n            comprise the following : 1) increasing the provision of\n            educational infrastructure through rehabilitation of\n            classrooms, printing and distribution of textbooks, and\n            acquisition of small equipment and instructional aids; 2)\n            improving teacher and administrator performance through\n            in-service training of teachers, and administrators; 3)\n            expanding basic education through introduction of 3 dropout\n            prevention measures on a pilot basis, and expansion of the\n            DECS literacy training program; and 4) strengthening\n            planning and management."}, "docdt": "1990-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
