This\n            will be pursued through short and longer term measures which\n            aim to : a) meet the subsector's requirements for\n            essential physical resources; b) improve the professional\n            competence of teachers and school administrators; c) expand\n            the population with basic knowledge and skills, with efforts\n            targeted to at-risk children and illiterate youth and\n            adults; and d) further develop DECS instituional capacities\n            in planning and management of the elementary education\n            subsector.  In support of these objectives, the project will\n            comprise the following : 1) increasing the provision of\n            educational infrastructure through rehabilitation of\n            classrooms, printing and distribution of textbooks, and\n            acquisition of small equipment and instructional aids; 2)\n            improving teacher and administrator performance through\n            in-service training of teachers, and administrators; 3)\n            expanding basic education through introduction of 3 dropout\n            prevention measures on a pilot basis, and expansion of the\n            DECS literacy training program; and 4) strengthening\n            planning and management."}, "docdt": "1990-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
