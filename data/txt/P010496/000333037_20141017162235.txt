                                                      Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector




  Executive Summary
In 2007, the World Bank (Bank) completed a Detailed Implementation Review
(DIR) of five health projects in its India portfolio (the India DIR): the Food and
Drugs Capacity Building Project (FDCBP), the Orissa Health Systems Develop-
ment Project (OHSDP), the Second National AIDS Control Project (NACP II), the
Malaria Control Project (MCP), and the Tuberculosis Control Project (TCP). The
Bank and the Government of India agreed to conduct a DIR of the India health
sector after a 2005 Bank investigation revealed systemic fraud and corruption in a
large India health project and suggested that other projects may have been simi-
larly compromised.

   A DIR is a proactive tool that examines Bank-financed projects in a specific
country or sector to determine their susceptibility and possible exposure to fraud,
corruption, collusion, and coercion (fraud and corruption). A DIR is not a tradi-
tional fraud or corruption investigation that determines whether specific allega-
tions of misconduct can be substantiated; rather, it reports whether the projects
exhibit indicators, or “red flags,” of fraud and corruption that may impact upon
the achievement and sustainability of their development objectives. The nature,
patterns, and prevalence of these indicators provide the basis for remedial action
by the country and the Bank.

   The India DIR found significant indicators of fraud and corruption in all five
projects. These indicators appear to have affected, to varying extents, the projects’
implementation and outputs. The DIR found indicators of fraudulent and corrupt
practices related to procurement, such as collusive behaviors, bid rigging, brib-
ery, and manipulated bid prices. It also found indicators of fraudulent and cor-
rupt practices related to project implementation, including deficient civil works
certified as complete; broken or damaged equipment certified as compliant with
specifications; and under-delivery of services from contractual obligations. More-
over, the DIR observed inadequate project financial, audit, and internal controls
systems. These findings will result in a number of Bank investigations into specific
cases of possible fraud and corruption.

   In addition to the indicators, all five projects exhibited: (a) persistent weak-
nesses in the Bank’s pre-project assessment and mitigation of fraud and corruption
risks; (b) persistent weaknesses in the ability of Bank project supervision to iden-

                     tify, assess, and respond to indicators of fraud and corruption; and (c) a high risk
                     of fraud and corruption in decentralized procurement (local contracting), which
                     is increasingly utilized in Bank projects but is subject to only minor procurement
                     review. The DIR found that several projects with high project implementation rat-
                     ings exhibited significant problems in the quality of project implementation, sug-
                     gesting flaws in the Bank’s project evaluation methodology.

                        The DIR’s findings are consistent with the findings of the Bank’s previous inves-
                     tigation and related Bank reports regarding its New Delhi procurement hub and
                     trust fund operations.

                        This executive summary outlines the DIR’s findings and sets out its observa-
                     tions regarding the five Bank-financed health projects. Part I of the executive sum-
                     mary explains the DIR’s rationale, objectives, and methodology, and introduces
                     the projects reviewed, and Part II provides a summary of findings.




                     I. Background
                     Why Conduct a DIR of the India Health
                     Sector?
                     The Bank and the Government of India agreed to a DIR of the India health sector
                     because India’s need for health sector assistance is great; the Bank’s lending to
                     the sector is increasing rapidly; and a Bank investigation raised significant con-
                     cerns that Bank-funded projects in the sector are being compromised by fraud
                     and corruption.

                        India faces significant health challenges. Despite rapid economic growth, rising
                     life expectancy, and falling infant mortality rates, India suffers from widespread
                     poverty and severe public health issues. More than 27 percent of its population
                     lives below the poverty line, and 36 percent of its people live on less than USD 1
                     per day. India also bears a disproportionate burden of the world’s diseases. Mea-
                     sured in terms of healthy years lost to illness, the World Health Organization esti-
                     mates that Indians—who make up 17 percent of the world’s population—suffer
                     28 percent of the world’s total years lost to respiratory infections, 25 percent of
                     the years lost to tuberculosis, 24 percent of the years lost to diarrheal diseases, 21



                                                               2
                                                       Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


percent of the years lost to measles, and 45 percent of the years lost to leprosy. In
addition, 2.5 million people in India are living with HIV/AIDS.

   The Government of India has recognized that large improvements can be made
in the health sector. Public health spending constitutes only one percent of GDP,
placing India below most low-income countries and in the bottom 20 percent of
all countries. Nearly 80 percent of India’s health spending comes from individuals’
out-of-pocket payments at the point of service: private funds finance 93 percent of
all hospitals, 64 percent of all hospital beds, and 80 percent of all doctors nation-
wide. Being unable to pay, the poor are shunted to inadequately funded public
hospitals or refrain from seeking medical care. As a result, the poorest 20 percent
of Indians suffer mortality and malnutrition rates more than twice those of the
wealthiest 20 percent.

   For half a century, health constituted only a tiny fraction of the Bank’s work
in India, but this dramatically changed in the 1990s. Between 1990 and 2000, the
Bank began 22 new India health sector projects with a total financial commitment
of USD 6.8 billion: more than triple the number, and 16 times the funding, of all
of the previous India health projects combined. Since 2001, the Bank has approved
10 additional health projects and authorized supplemental financing for two more,
totaling USD 1.5 billion in new loan and credit commitments. Overall, since 1990,
health has constituted approximately 37 percent of India’s new Bank financial
commitments. India is currently the Bank’s largest borrower, with 75 active proj-
ects worth a total IBRD/IDA commitment of USD 15.2 billion.

   The Bank’s focus on the India health sector will continue. The most recent
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India emphasizes increased health sec-
tor activity, including projects to improve the private market for health, increase
public health spending, reform state health systems, combat communicable dis-
eases, and improve sanitation and clean water supplies. In keeping with this broad
agenda, the CAS planned at least 10 new health sector projects between the fiscal
years 2005 and 2008 that would represent 16 percent of India’s new borrowing.
Some of these projects have been approved, while four others, costing a combined
USD 950 million, are in the Bank’s project pipeline.

   However, studies suggest that corruption is a widespread problem in India: in
the largest empirical study of corruption in India, conducted in 2005 by Trans-
parency International’s India chapter, 62 percent of survey respondents said that
they personally had paid bribes to receive government services, and 27 percent
of respondents—statistically representing about 30 million households—reported


                                          3
India DIR (Executive Summary)


                     paying bribes at government hospitals in exchange for medicines, patient admis-
                     sion, and medical consultation and treatment. These survey results accord with
                     the 2005 findings of a Bank investigation into the Reproductive and Child Health
                     Project (RCH). The Bank’s investigation revealed systemic fraud and corruption in
                     the project, including large-scale collusive practices between bidders, systemic fal-
                     sification of performance certificates, and evidence that the project’s procurement
                     agents and government officials were receiving kickbacks. The RCH investigation
                     also received allegations that similar problems were affecting other India health
                     sector projects. Because of these findings, the Bank and the Government of India
                     agreed to have a DIR conducted on five projects in the sector.


                     DIR Objectives and Methodology
                     Fraud and corruption undermine the Bank’s development efforts in many ways,
                     most notably by diverting precious funds from Bank projects and thereby deny-
                     ing those projects the full complement of goods and services that they need to
                     fulfill their development goals. A DIR’s objective is to identify “red flags,” called
                     indicators, which suggest the presence and prevalence of fraud and corruption in
                     a project. The indicators utilized by the DIR range from facts that directly indicate
                     fraudulent or corrupt activities (such as witness admissions or documents con-
                     firmed to be fraudulent) to facts that indicate a high likelihood of fraudulent or
                     corrupt activities (such as bidders sharing same addresses or providing sequentially
                     numbered bid security documents) to facts that suggest an increased risk of pos-
                     sible fraudulent or corrupt activities (such as inadequate auditing methodologies
                     or failure to follow proper procurement guidelines). Although different indicators
                     have different abstract evidentiary weights, indicators can be understood properly
                     only when they are analyzed holistically and in their surrounding contractual con-
                     text. This report discusses identified indicators accordingly. The DIR considered
                     indicator weights in its initial contract data review, and INT may consider weight
                     when prioritizing investigations based upon the DIR’s findings.

                        A DIR is not an investigation that aims at substantiating specific allegations
                     of fraud and corruption. Instead, it has a broader objective to indicate whether a
                     project likely suffers from fraud and corruption, to suggest how large that prob-
                     lem may be, and to identify areas for follow-up investigation and intervention. In
                     so doing, the DIR also identifies weaknesses in project design, implementation,
                     controls, and evaluations that could facilitate fraud and corruption or obscure the
                     Bank’s observation of their effects.


                                                               4
                                                       Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


   The DIR follows a holistic and flexible methodology that reviews the actions and
activities of, among others, project implementation units, procurement agencies,
suppliers, contractors, and others who could divert or misuse project funds. The
DIR searches for indicators throughout a contract’s life cycle, from procurement to
final payment. For example, if the DIR identified sequential bid security numbers
across different bidders, it would: (a) conduct additional computer data analyses
to identify other links or patterns connecting the suspect bidders; (b) review pro-
curement records for indicators that the bidders engaged in bid rigging or collu-
sion; (c) conduct site visits to assess whether the bidders executed their contracts
deficiently by supplying substandard goods or inoperable equipment; and/or
(d) conduct pricing research and analyses to determine if the bidders’ prices
appeared to be manipulated.

   The presence of indicators does not conclusively prove that a contract or proj-
ect has been exposed to corrupt or fraudulent practices. Rather, the presence of
indicators means that observed facts suggest an elevated risk that the contract or
project may have had such exposure. Similarly, the absence of indicators does not
mean that a project or contract has not been exposed to fraud and corruption.
Because fraudulent and corrupt acts are illegal and usually covert, a lack of observ-
able indicators provides no guarantee that they did not occur.

   An abundance of indicators is an important finding, because a high number
and/or diverse set of indicators appearing across multiple contracts signal possible
widespread and systemic procurement or implementation problems. However, all
indicators should be assessed in light of their type, strength, prevalence, and inter-
relationship with other indicators. DIR findings should be considered as a whole,
and in the context of the project’s implementation, reports, and assessments, in
order to identify the vulnerabilities in the project’s design and implementation.
Absent additional investigation or analysis, specific DIR findings should not be sta-
tistically extrapolated across projects, sectors, or country loan portfolios because
projects often vary in ways that affect DIR findings, including project design, con-
trols, and implementing bodies. Any corrective actions taken on the basis of DIR
findings should be guided by a holistic and fully contextualized reading of those
findings.


The India DIR Effort
The India DIR sought to answer the following questions:



                                          5
India DIR (Executive Summary)


                         ■■     To what extent do the five reviewed projects exhibit indicators of fraud
                                and corruption?

                         ■■     Do the projects exhibit implementation deficiencies that relate to any
                                observed indicators of fraud and corruption?

                         ■■     How well did the Bank’s project supervision and internal controls identify
                                and respond to indicators of fraud and corruption? Are there areas for
                                improvement?

                        Two key factors made the India DIR far more complex and resource-intensive
                     than past DIRs. First, the India DIR was simply larger in scale and scope than
                     previous DIRs. It involved the review of a greater number of contracts and field
                     visits to more locations across a more expansive and logistically challenging
                     territory. Second, the India DIR’s methodology was expanded to incorporate addi-
                     tional forensic data analysis techniques, a larger number of analytic tests and pro-
                     cedures, and even more rigorous validation and quality assurance procedures. The
                     DIR took these steps to observe indicators of fraud and corruption unidentified
                     by previous DIRs, and to integrate its findings with an analysis of Bank project
                     supervision and evaluation procedures, in order to increase the usefulness of its
                     findings and observations.

                        The India DIR began in mid-2006 and involved over 75 Bank staff, consultants,
                     and subject matter experts. The DIR team consisted of professionals from a large
                     range of disciplines, including investigators, forensic accountants, information
                     technology specialists and analysts, procurement and financial management spe-
                     cialists, doctors, engineers, and attorneys, as well as support staff provided by the
                     Bank’s India country office in New Delhi. The DIR team operated from a dedicated
                     office space, located near the Bank’s India country office, which the country office
                     provided and refurbished specifically for the DIR.

                        The India DIR’s examination of procurement encompassed: (a) collecting and
                     analyzing data regarding 100 percent of the 835 available international competi-
                     tive bidding (ICB) and national competitive bidding (NCB) contracts procured
                     by the Procurement Support Agencies (PSAs) relating to the five projects; (b)

decentrally procured contracts—chosen by project, district, and value—for indi-
cators of fraud and corruption.

   The India DIR involved constructing and populating a large database of
procurement and contract data; collecting and reviewing thousands of project
procurement files, hundreds of complaints, and volumes of project documents;
interviewing many witnesses, suppliers, and project staff; visiting over 100 loca-
tions across five Indian states; and documenting field observations in thousands of
digital photographs and several hours of digital video. In addition, the DIR team
also drafted a series of hierarchical reports documenting the DIR’s findings, which
include analytical tables and charts, photographs, scanned copies of significant
documents, and the work of subject matter experts.

Reviewed Projects
   The DIR selected five health projects for review. All five projects addressed
some of India’s most pressing and urgent health issues and needs, making their
successful implementation extremely important. Their objectives and details, and
the reasons why the Bank selected them for review, are as follows:

Food and Drug Capacity Building Project
   The FDCBP sought to improve the quality and safety of the products of India’s
rapidly growing food and drugs industries by building or renovating food and
drug testing laboratories, providing adequate laboratory equipment, and training
laboratory technicians to use the provided equipment. The project, currently in its
fourth year, is financed by a USD 54 million IDA credit that became effective on
October 17, 2003, and is scheduled to close on June 30, 2008. The Bank included
the FDCBP in the DIR because: (a) the project was ongoing; and (b) it contained a
large civil works component—an area that the Bank has found to be vulnerable to
fraud and corruption in other projects.

Orissa Health Systems Development Project
   The OHSDP was a state-level project that sought to improve the health of the
people of the eastern state of Orissa. At the time of the project’s 1998 launch, Orissa
was considered one of the least-developed states in India: 44 percent of its popu-
lation lived below the poverty line, and it had one of the highest infant mortality
rates in the country. The OHSDP planned to address these issues by constructing or
renovating many of the state’s healthcare facilities, supplying them with additional
medical equipment, and improving the state’s health system policies. The project



                                           7
India DIR (Executive Summary)


                     was financed by a USD 82.1 million International Development Association (IDA)
                     credit that became effective on September 8, 1998, and closed on March 31, 2006.
                     The Bank included the OHSDP in the DIR because: (a) the Bank’s investigation
                     into the RCH project identified it as possibly tainted by fraud and corruption; (b)
                     the DIR sought to include a state-level project in its scope to augment its other
                     national projects; and (c) a successor project had been proposed within the Bank.

                     Second National AIDS Control Project
                        The NACP II, a successor to the Bank’s first National AIDS Control Project,
                     aimed to reduce the spread of HIV infection in India and strengthen the country’s
                     capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS. At the time of the project’s 1999 launch, it was
                     estimated that several million Indians were infected with HIV and the Bank was
                     concerned that, without continued efforts to stem a growing infection rate, India
                     could follow in the footsteps of some of the worst HIV/AIDS-affected countries
                     in Africa. Under NACP II, the AIDS control strategy shifted from raising global
                     awareness to changing behavior through targeted interventions—often conducted
                     by non-governmental organizations (NGOs)—in which high-risk groups were
                     identified and provided with counseling, condoms, and treatment for sexually
                     transmitted infections. The project was financed by a USD 193.7 million IDA
                     credit that became effective in September 11, 1999, and closed on March 31, 2006.
                     The Bank included the NACP II in the DIR because: (a) the Bank’s RCH investiga-
                     tion identified it as at risk of exposure to fraud and corruption; (b) its design and
                     scope were similar to a Kenya HIV/AIDS project that a past DIR found to exhibit
                     indicators of fraud and corruption; (c) it followed a design model that the Bank
                     was replicating in many countries; and (d) it had a successor project (the Third
                     National AIDS Control Project) in the Bank’s project pipeline.

                     Malaria Control Project
                        The MCP sought to assist India’s National Malaria Eradication Program by
                     introducing a more strategic and effective set of mechanisms to control malaria.
                     Malaria causes substantial death, morbidity, and related social and economic
                     losses in India, especially among the rural poor. The MCP’s malaria control efforts
                     included providing malaria prevention mechanisms, such as insecticide-treated
                     bed nets and larvivorous fish, and introducing early detection and treatment strat-
                     egies. The project was financed by a USD 114 million IDA credit that became effec-
                     tive on October 27, 1997, and closed on December 31, 2005. The Bank included
                     the MCP in the DIR because: (a) the Bank’s RCH investigation identified it as pos-

sibly tainted by fraud and corruption; and (b) it had a successor project (the Vector
Borne Disease Control Project) in the Bank’s project pipeline.

Tuberculosis Control Project
   The TCP sought to support India’s National Tuberculosis Control Program. At
the time of the TCP’s 1997 launch, it was estimated that up to half of India’s popula-
tion was infected with tuberculosis, and the Indian Government had just success-
fully piloted its Directly Observed Treatment – Short Course (DOTS) approach
in which the patient is accurately diagnosed using high-quality sputum micros-
copy, assigned a pre-packaged medical treatment pack, and administered directly
observed treatment for six to eight months with strict follow-up, supervision, and
monitoring. The Bank expected DOTS to greatly reduce TB-caused mortality and
disability. The project was financed by a USD 124.8 million IDA credit that became
effective on May 8, 1997, and closed on March 31, 2006. The Bank included the
TCP in the DIR because: (a) the Bank’s RCH investigation identified it as possibly
tainted by fraud and corruption; and (b) it had a successor project (the Second
National Tuberculosis Control Project) in the Bank’s project pipeline.




II.	Summary of Findings
The DIR found indications that fraud and corruption affected all five of the proj-
ects to varying degrees and at varying stages. Indicators occurred most consistently
in decentralized procurement—an area that neither the Bank nor its Borrowers
supervise adequately. The DIR also found that the Bank’s project supervision and
evaluation systems generally failed to identify, convey, and address indicators of
fraud and corruption. However, the DIR did find limited, but positive, indications
of projects with well-functioning anti-corruption controls.

   The DIR’s findings are consistent with the findings of a number of other Bank
investigations and reports, including:

    ■■   The Bank’s 2005 RCH investigation, which found systemic fraud and cor-
         ruption in the RCH project and the risk of similar patterns in other India
         health projects;

    ■■   The 2006 PricewaterhouseCoopers review of the Bank’s New Delhi pro-
         curement hub, which found, among other things: (a) insufficient evalu-

                                ation of project fraud and corruption risks, particularly given the Bank’s
                                delegation of final responsibility to the Borrower; (b) a failure to gather
                                and analyze complaint and other data to identify fraud and corruption
                                schemes; and (c) a general failure to exercise its fiduciary function in a
                                manner that could prevent fraud and corruption in procurement; and

                         ■■     The June 2007 Bank Internal Audit Department (IAD) Report on Key
                                Audit Issues Affecting Trust Funds, which noted failures to comply with
                                Bank procurement rules, Bank inaction on collusion indicators identi-
                                fied in procurement post-reviews, and inadequate auditing of project
                                disbursements.

                        In brief, the DIR’s findings regarding each of the five reviewed projects are as
                     follows:


                     Food and Drug Capacity Building Project
                     The DIR’s review of the FDCBP found:

                         1.	 indicators of corrupt and fraudulent practices in the procurement and
                                implementation of equipment and civil works, such as inconsistent treat-
                                ment of bidders, submission of fraudulent documentation, and inappro-
                                priate rejection of bidders;

                         2.	 widespread deficiencies in the implementation of equipment and civil
                                works, such as payment for incomplete civil works and uninstalled equip-
                                ment; and

                         3.	 weaknesses in the Bank’s identification and handling of these indicators
                                and deficiencies.

                        The DIR examined FDCBP laboratory and office equipment contracts pro-
                     cured by the PSA through ICB and NCB procedures. The DIR found questionable
                     procurement practices, some of which indicate fraud and corruption, in contracts
                     representing 87 percent of the number of pieces and 88 percent of the total value
                     of equipment procured. However, the DIR noted that none of its findings suggest
                     the existence of cartels or collusive behavior between bidders.

                        The DIR found inconsistencies in the administration of the procurement pro-
                     cess in the selection of suppliers, such as in determining whether a specific item
                     met specifications, or in choosing to seek clarifications from some substantially
                     responsive bidders and not others. The DIR also found indicators related to gov-


                                                                10

ernment interference with the procurement process, such as unreasonable delays
in the award of contracts, shifting bidding deadlines and requirements, and nar-
rowly drafted tenders. Procurement officials appeared to have employed favorit-
ism when awarding contracts to bidders that failed to meet performance criteria
while disqualifying other bidders that apparently met, or could have met, the cri-
teria. In addition, the DIR found potentially fraudulent documents submitted by
winning bidders, such as forged performance certificates, that, in some cases, were
corroborated by complaints by other bidders.

   Under the FDCBP, the DIR observed an occasional unusual method in which
bids were evaluated and recommended for contracts. Typically, contract awards
are based on the bid evaluation report (BER) and recommendations of the Bid
Evaluation Committee (BEC) under the auspices of the project’s PSA. Yet, for
at least three tenders of equipment, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(MOHFW) installed a special steering committee comprised of MOHFW officials,
officials from the PSA, and technical experts to review bid submissions and recom-
mend bid awards. The DIR found that the steering committee’s evaluation of bids
frequently differed from that of the BEC and exhibited indicators of non-transpar-
ency, preferential treatment, and other corrupt and inconsistent practices. Further,
the MOHFW always followed the steering committee’s recommendations, repeat-
edly overruling the BEC.

   The DIR found indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices in a third of
the civil works procurements that it reviewed. For example, the DIR noted the
PSA’s unsupported disqualification of a qualified lower cost bidder, as well as the
awarding of contracts to companies that submitted false or non-compliant bidding
documentation.

   Most of the contracts exhibiting indicators of corrupt practices in the DIR’s
procurement review also had implementation deficiencies. The DIR found wide-
spread deficiencies in the delivery, installation, use, training, or maintenance
of equipment at all 15 of the food and drug laboratories and MOHFW regional
offices that it visited. For example, more than half of the 282 pieces of equipment
procured for the visited laboratories were undelivered or uninstalled. The DIR
also found improperly installed equipment, damaged equipment, and the delivery
of unneeded and unused equipment. In addition, the DIR found many instances
where suppliers did not provide the required training and demonstrations or meet
warranty commitments to repair broken or damaged equipment.

India DIR (Executive Summary)


                        The DIR found that substantial payment had been issued for almost half of
                     the contracts where equipment was undelivered, delivered in a damaged state, or
                     delivered with missing parts.

                        Moreover, the DIR found widespread deficiencies in all nine civil works sites
                     visited. Deficiencies included significant electrical, water supply, and infrastructure
                     problems and issues related to water damage, concrete, general construction, poor
                     quality of materials, and general maintenance. Many sites would require additional
                     work to conform with tender requirements. Nonetheless, despite these implemen-
                     tation deficiencies, in some cases the PSA provided contractors with completion
                     certificates that allowed full payment for unfinished or deficient work.

                        The DIR found that the FDCBP’s reports and assessments produced to date do
                     not adequately convey the high rate of procurement and implementation prob-
                     lems and deficiencies afflicting the project. The DIR found that the Bank’s han-
                     dling of such issues thus far has significant shortcomings. To its credit, the Bank
                     identified problems in the administration of the procurement processes in some
                     cases. However, the Bank still gave its No Objection to the award of these con-
                     tracts, even though the problems appear not to have been remedied. Furthermore,
                     the Bank apparently has conducted only one procurement post-review in the four
                     years that the project has been effective. While noting some deficiencies in the
                     implementation of civil works—though not to the extent observed by the DIR—
                     the Bank nonetheless upgraded the project’s implementation performance rating
                     from unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory in its last two aides-mémoire. When
                     Bank officials did identify indicators of fraud and corruption, such as inconsistent
                     administration of procurements that favored certain bidders or patterns of unrea-
                     sonable procurement delays, they did not pursue the issue with sufficient rigor,
                     resulting in the matter remaining unresolved.


                     Orissa Health Systems Development Project
                     The DIR’s review of the OHSDP found that:

                         1.	 the implementation and procurement of the OHSDP’s civil works and
                                equipment components exhibited significant indicators of fraud, includ-
                                ing severe construction deficiencies in buildings that construction super-
                                visors certified as complete and up to specification; and 17 types of equip-
                                ment that, while purportedly in compliance with technical standards, were
                                found noncompliant or hazardous upon basic inspection;



                                                                12

    2.	 there is a risk of fraud and corruption because the project audit reports
        identified several areas of inadequate project financial management and
        financial recordkeeping but did not provide a complete and transparent
        accounting of project expenditures; and

    3.	 the Bank observed some of these problems in its project supervision, but
        its reliance on apparently incorrect Borrower-provided data appears to
        have delayed these observations until the project was nearly closed and it
        was too late to address the problems.

   Implementation of the OHSDP’s civil works and equipment components also
exhibited significant indicators of fraud. For civil works, the DIR, aided by a civil
engineer, visited 55 project hospitals; at 93 percent of them, it observed problems
like uninitiated or incomplete work, severely leaking roofs, crumbling ceilings,
molding walls, and non-functional water, sewage, and/or electrical systems. Four
hospitals were locked shut and entirely unused. Yet the construction management
consultants (CMCs) who supervised the work certified 38 of these hospitals to be
complete to project specifications, and in February 2006 the Orissa Department of
Health and Family Welfare (DOHFW) reported that work at 45 of them was com-
plete. The DIR reviewed the project documents for 21 hospitals and found 10 cases
in which the DIR’s field observations directly contradicted the CMC’s completion
certifications.

   For equipment, the DIR, aided by a biomedical engineer, inspected equipment
at project hospitals and identified 17 types of equipment that violated project
technical specifications, including five types of equipment that were hazardous.
Hazardous equipment included autoclaves (hot steam surgical equipment steril-
izers) that could explode and neonatal equipment that lacked adequate electrical
grounding, potentially exposing babies and their medical staff to electrical shocks.
These units were procured from firms whose bids either omitted required techni-
cal compliance certificates or contained certificates that appeared fraudulent. Yet
ELMARC, the firm responsible for evaluating these bids and inspecting procured
equipment, not only overlooked these problems, but also failed to respond to
equipment quality complaints sent to them by medical officers, and oversupplied
substantial amounts of equipment.

   Consistent with findings of fraud in implementation, the OHSDP’s civil works
and equipment procurements also exhibited indicators of fraud and bid rigging.
In civil works, the DOHFW conducted 12 tenders to hire architects and CMCs to
design, procure, and supervise the works; nine of these tenders exhibited indica-


                                         13
India DIR (Executive Summary)


                     tors of bid rigging. Indicators of fraud and bid rigging in the construction services
                     procurements included very low competition for contracts; the exclusion of low-
                     priced bidders in 25 percent of tenders; and contract prices that exceeded cost esti-
                     mates in 80 percent of tenders. In equipment procurement, ELMARC appeared to
                     have favored certain bidders by overlooking only some firms’ omitted documenta-
                     tion or permitting only certain firms to amend their otherwise losing bids.

                        The DIR’s analysis of the project’s reports and assessments resulted in both pos-
                     itive and negative findings. The Bank’s financial management specialists appear to
                     have been diligent in pursuing problems regarding project audit reports, though
                     these issues remain unresolved. However, none of the OHSDP’s project design doc-
                     uments mentioned fraud and corruption as a project risk or detailed how the Bank
                     would supervise the decentralized project activities. Instead, the Bank followed
                     its stated policy of delegating almost all project monitoring and evaluation to the
                     Borrower, and thus relied on the DOHFW to report project progress accurately.

                        The DIR’s review of the Orissa Auditor General’s OHSDP audit reports iden-
                     tified weaknesses in the project’s financial management and recordkeeping that
                     created a risk of fraud and corruption. The audit reports did not provide a timely,
                     complete, and transparent review of project expenditures—so much so that the
                     Bank is still awaiting audit certification of more than USD 30 million in Bank-
                     reimbursed project expenditures. The audits also stated that the project routinely
                     spent far less than it requested in its budget; its certified civil works expenditures
                     did not match reported civil works activity; and its financial records lacked proper
                     balances, which are an important protection against fraudulent transactions.

                        The DIR’s project implementation findings suggest that the DOHFW either
                     was unaware of the project’s problems or chose not to report them to the Bank.
                     The Bank eventually observed and documented some of the civil works and equip-
                     ment problems that the DIR identified as indicators of underlying fraud. However,
                     because the Bank waited until the project’s final year to conduct extensive field vis-
                     its and verify the quality of reported project outputs, the institution did not learn
                     of these problems until it was too late to remedy them. This indicates a weakness in
                     the Bank’s supervision methodology that, according to project design documents,
                     has not been addressed in subsequent India state health projects. The OHSDP’s
                     overall rating of “moderately satisfactory” also stands in stark contrast to the sig-
                     nificant civil works and equipment problems observed by the DIR. As the Bank’s
                     project supervision team itself wrote, this suggests that the Bank’s project evalua-

tion metrics may place too much emphasis on statistical indicators of development
effect, and too little emphasis on project outputs.


Second National HIV/AIDS Control Project
The DIR’s review of the NACP II found:

    1.	 indicators of corrupt practices in contract awards to NGOs, such as ficti-
        tious NGOs receiving contracts and government officials receiving bribes,
        as well as a lack of meaningful controls for tracking disbursements to
        NGOs;

    2.	 deficiencies in the implementation of test kit and blood bank equip-
        ment contracts, such as poorly performing test kits and non-functioning
        equipment;

    3.	 indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices in the procurement of diag-
        nostic test kits and blood bank equipment—particularly when conducted
        through decentralized procurement—such as similar bid prices and affili-
        ated bidders; and

    4.	 that while the Bank observed and initiated action on some issues subse-
        quently identified by the DIR as indicators of fraud and corruption, its
        observations and actions were not always timely and not classified as pos-
        sible signs of fraud and corruption.

   The DIR found that the NACP II’s selection and oversight of NGOs, which
the Bank relied on as the delivery mechanisms for services, lacked meaningful
financial controls and transparency, thus creating the potential for corrupt prac-
tices. Under NACP II, USD 72.5 million was allocated to service-oriented activi-
ties, such as targeted interventions and workshops, a substantial portion of which
were carried out by NGOs. These funds were typically disbursed in advance by
local-level officials in amounts that were less than USD 20,000. In certain cases,
however, these officials failed to track many of these expenditures, putting the dis-
tribution and use of these funds at significant risk. The DIR received reports from
NGOs that procurement officials demanded and received bribes in exchange for
awarding contracts to NGOs. The DIR found that many NGOs that received proj-
ect contracts were not qualified to perform HIV/AIDS prevention services, and
some did not even exist. Some NGOs also submitted falsified documentation to

                     support the work they were purportedly doing. The DIR’s findings were corrobo-
                     rated by anonymous complaints to the Bank and news reports.

                        The DIR’s examination of the implementation of diagnostic test kit and blood
                     bank equipment contracts revealed a number of problems. Regarding test kits, the
                     DIR found that some of the test kits supplied by particular companies often per-
                     formed poorly by producing erroneous or invalid results, potentially resulting in
                     the further spread of disease or in the wastage of blood. While the test-kit distribu-
                     tion requirements were generally adhered to, the DIR discovered that inspection
                     and cold-storage procedures were not consistently followed, and that some test kits
                     were distributed near their expiration dates. This, along with external factors like
                     substandard facilities, poorly trained staff, and erratic quality assurance practices,
                     could have contributed to the test kit performance problems.

                        Regarding the implementation of blood bank equipment contracts, the DIR
                     found that a number of contractors failed to properly install equipment at blood
                     banks; delivered faulty or non-functioning equipment; and/or failed to service the
                     equipment as required under their contracts. The DIR also observed that, in some
                     instances, NACP II procured what appeared to be superfluous equipment.

                        The DIR’s examination of the NACP II’s ICB procurement of diagnostic test kits
                     and blood bank equipment—which often involved the same firms whose goods
                     exhibited performance problems—revealed a number of indicators of fraudulent
                     and corrupt practices, such as: (a) long delays between the bid opening and con-
                     tract award dates; (b) unusual patterns in prices submitted by bidders; (c) appar-
                     ent avoidance of the Bank’s prior-review process by splitting tenders to fall below
                     prior-review thresholds; (d) low bid submission rates; (e) preferential treatment
                     accorded to certain bidders; and (f) unexplained expenses and possible self-deal-
                     ing by the project PSAs.

                        The DIR also reviewed 217 locally procured contracts, valued at INR 118 mil-
                     lion (USD 2.6 million), and found that 82 percent by number and 88 percent
                     by value contained one or more indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices.
                     These contracts were primarily for the provision of diagnostic test kits, blood bank
                     equipment, and laboratory supplies. In addition to many of the indicators detailed
                     above, the local procurement of diagnostic test kits and blood bank equipment
                     exhibited other indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices, including: (a) simi-
                     larities in the language and presentation of competing bids; (b) separate bidders
                     with the same phone numbers and addresses; (c) the award of contracts to firms
                     that did not submit bids; and (d) substantial recordkeeping deficiencies.


                                                               16

   Early in the project, the Bank acknowledged its inability to gauge NGO per-
formance, but it did not identify the lack of financial controls over NGO disburse-
ments until just prior to the project’s close. To its credit, the Bank has highlighted
financial controls over NGOs as a key area of reform in the NACP II’s successor
project, the Third National AIDS Control Project (NACP III). The Bank appeared
to pay scant attention to the performance and quality of the goods supplied to the
blood banks and testing centers, instead focusing on the number of such facili-
ties being erected. The Bank consistently identified delays in contract awards as a
significant procurement problem, but attributed these delays to insufficient pro-
curement agency capacity and did not appear to consider corrupt practices as a
possible contributing factor.


Malaria Control Project
The DIR’s review of the MCP found:

    1.	 widespread indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices in the award of
        MCP contracts for insecticides (pyrethroids), bed nets, and pharmaceuti-
        cals, such as similar bid prices, submission of fraudulent documents, and
        payments to government officials;

    2.	 indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices—such as rotation of con-
        tract winners, bidders with identical phone numbers, and similarities in
        the text and layout of bids—affecting the award of 73 percent (by volume)
        and 50 percent (by value) of DIR-reviewed contracts procured through
        decentralized procurement; and

    3.	 that the Bank’s project reports and assessments did not fully identify, con-
        vey, or address the widespread indicators of collusion and fraud affecting
        the project.

   The DIR found indicators of widespread corrupt practices in the award of MCP
centrally procured contracts, most notably indicators of bid rigging and collusion.
The indicators were pervasive throughout the project’s major areas of procure-
ment—pyrethroids, bed nets, and pharmaceuticals—and persisted for most of the
years of the project. Nestor Pharmaceuticals Limited (Nestor) and Pure Pharma
Limited (Pure Pharma), two firms recently debarred by the Bank for collusive
practices under the RCH project, were found to exhibit indicators of collusive
behavior under the MCP. The DIR also found indicators of bid rigging, payment
of bribes, and other forms of fraud and corruption in the bidding process and


                                         17
India DIR (Executive Summary)


                     award of contracts, including contracts procured centrally by the project’s PSA and
                     locally by the project’s various district malaria offices. The indicators tend to show
                     that fair and open competition for contracts was adversely harmed and prices, at
                     times, appeared to be inflated.

                        In the procurement of pyrethroids, the largest component of the MCP in terms
                     of dollar value, the DIR found numerous indicators that four firms colluded to
                     divide over 90 percent of the value of the contracts among themselves. The indi-
                     cators were consistent with those previously recognized by the Bank’s Sanctions
                     Board to be indicators of collusive behavior, such as the submission of identical bid
                     prices. There are indicators that suggest that the collusive behavior subverted open
                     competition, resulted in inflated prices, and likely involved individuals within the
                     project’s PSA. Noteworthy is the sudden disappearance of these indicators for the
                     final two pyrethroid tenders, the reasons for which are not entirely clear. The DIR
                     also found indicators that the Government of India’s Central Insecticide Board
                     (CIB) may have engaged in corrupt practices in the granting of licenses to sell
                     pyrethroids in India.

                        Similarly, for the procurement of bed nets, the DIR found that five of the seven
                     suppliers either exhibited indicators of collusive or corrupt behavior or otherwise
                     performed in a manner that adversely affected project implementation. The DIR
                     found indicators that a group of four firms bidding for bed net contracts were
                     interrelated through familial connections and may have colluded (with the help
                     of two other firms) to receive contracts. It also found numerous indicators of poor
                     product quality in the bed nets supplied by the firms.

                        In the procurement of pharmaceuticals, the DIR found indicators suggesting
                     that Nestor and Pure Pharma—as found in the RCH investigation—may have col-
                     luded in order to win the majority of contracts for chloroquine and combi-blister
                     packs.

                        The DIR’s review of contracts procured by two district malaria offices found wide-
                     spread indicators of fraud and corruption affecting the procurement of 73 percent of
                     the volume (50 percent of total value) of those two districts’ 50 largest contracts. The
                     high indicator rate warrants attention because of the large amount of project funds
                     utilized in this manner (approximately 40 percent of the MCP’s total project funds)
                     and the low level of supervision by both the Borrower and the Bank.

                        Finally, the DIR’s review of the project’s reports and assessments found that
                     the Bank and the Borrower did not fully identify, convey, or address the wide-



                                                                18

spread indicators of collusion and fraud affecting the project. Whenever indica-
tors of possible fraud or collusion were identified, it is unclear what, if anything,
was done by the Bank or Borrower to remedy the situation. More significantly, the
Bank’s project supervision systems largely did not detect the probable collusive
rings. While the Bank’s final project evaluation was forthright in belatedly not-
ing project implementation issues, the Bank’s reliance on epidemiological statistics
to evaluate project outcomes meant that the MCP’s overall success rating did not
reflect fully the project’s implementation difficulties, which may have been at least
partially caused by fraud and corruption.


Tuberculosis Control Project
The DIR’s review of the TCP found that:

    1.	 the implementation of pharmaceuticals and equipment purchased under
        the TCP generally demonstrated proper supply, good quality, and few defi-
        ciencies in the project’s supply and distribution chains. However, the DIR
        observed significant indicators of collusion in the ICB procurement of
        pharmaceuticals that went undetected by the Borrower. These indicators
        included identical or nearly identical unit prices, attempted bid rotation,
        and attempted division of the market between two firms. This collusion
        was unsuccessful only because the apparently colluding firms were dereg-
        istered on other grounds and disqualified from the tenders;

    2.	 decentralized procurements revealed widespread indicators of collusion,
        fraud, and corruption, such as strong similarities between competing bids
        language and/or presentation, bidders with identical phone numbers, and
        related bid prices; and

    3.	 the Bank’s project reports and assessments revealed that while the Bank’s
        response to complaints was adequate, its response to the findings in other
        project reports was inadequate.

   The DIR’s review of TCP’s implementation and distribution of pharmaceuti-
cal and equipment purchases in four states and 12 districts—accounting for 40
percent of TCP Bank funds—revealed generally proper supply, good quality, and
few deficiencies in the project’s supply and distribution chains. In contrast, the
DIR uncovered a number of indicators of corrupt practices associated with the
centralized procurement of pharmaceuticals through ICB processes. In particu-
lar, the DIR found strong indicators of collusive behavior between two suppliers,


                                          19
India DIR (Executive Summary)


                     Nestor Pharmaceuticals Limited and Pure Pharma Limited—companies recently
                     debarred by the Bank for collusive practices on another India health sector project
                     ongoing during the same period. Because these collusive practices apparently went
                     undetected and apparently were undertaken by the same players across multiple
                     projects, they signify a risk factor that needs to be monitored closely to ensure pro-
                     gram integrity in the TCP’s successor project and other projects involving pharma-
                     ceutical procurements.

                        Among the numerous indicators found, the DIR discovered indicators that
                     these companies engaged in collusive practices on at least five invitations for bids
                     through the submission of identical unit prices and complementary quantities that
                     would potentially lead to contract splitting or contract award rotation. Although
                     these companies were the lowest evaluated bidders on contracts worth millions
                     of dollars, an unrelated decision by the Government of India to “deregister” these
                     two companies because they provided substandard drugs prevented their schemes
                     from fully manifesting. Nevertheless, had the deregistration not occurred, it is
                     likely these companies would have succeeded in their scheme because the indica-
                     tors of fraud apparently went undetected.

                        In contrast to the centrally procured pharmaceutical and equipment purchases,
                     the DIR’s review of procurement by the state and district tuberculosis offices
                     revealed a high percentage of procurements showing indicators of collusion,
                     fraud, or corruption (i.e., 100 of 143 local shopping contract files, or 70 percent
                     in number and 78 percent in value of the DIR reviewed contracts). Among the
                     dozens of collusive indicators were strong similarities in competing bids’ language
                     and presentation, bidders sharing the same addresses and telephone numbers, unit
                     prices showing a common formula, and indicators of intent to split contract awards
                     among several bidders. Included among the indicators of fraud or corruption were
                     signs of potential document tampering, quotations submitted after the submission
                     deadline, and substantial recordkeeping deficiencies. Procurements conducted
                     under prior review thresholds are particularly susceptible to fraudulent and cor-
                     rupt practices and, while the Bank’s procurement post-review identified a number
                     of indicators of fraud, collusion, or corruption, the DIR found no evidence that
                     the Bank had taken any affirmative action to address the indicators identified or
                     mitigate ongoing risks in this area.

                        The DIR’s analysis of the Bank’s project reports and assessments resulted in
                     both positive and negative findings. On the one hand, the DIR found that the Bank
                     appeared to have responded adequately to specific complaints from firms relat-

ing to TCP procurement and implementation. In general those complaints were
investigated and resolved. On the other hand, while TCP audit reports, procure-
ment post-reviews, financial reviews, and the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) identified indicators of possible fraud, corruption, and collusion, there is no
indication that the Bank acted with rigor to investigate or rectify those problems.

The Objectives and
Methodology of The Detailed
Implementation Review
Risks of Fraud and Corruption in
Bank-Financed Projects
It is well recognized that fraud and corruption conflict with the Bank’s interests as
a development institution.1 Across the globe, development institutions are increas-
ingly recognizing that fraud and corruption, even in minor instances, have serious,
detrimental effects on their projects and on the achievement of their development
objectives.2

     Under the Bank’s lending model, the Borrower is responsible for managing
the implementation of a Bank-financed project. The Bank delegates direct control
over many aspects of contract procurement and implementation to the Borrower
and its agents. This can impose additional risks to Bank funds, as it eliminates the
Bank’s ability to directly and pro-actively manage and control, for example, the
technical evaluation of competing bid proposals, the selection of vendors using
shopping procedures, and the inspection and approval of all delivered goods.

veloping countries, their impact on poverty and growth is particularly devastating. On a daily basis, poor people
around the world cannot access health clinics, schools, or other essential services because their public systems
are unresponsive, or because they themselves cannot or will not pay bribes…improving governance and reduc-

                            These risks are not inconsequential, as the damage inflicted by corrupt and
                       fraudulent practices on a project’s development objectives can be considerable.3
                       Contrary to the Bank’s mission, corrupt government officials and willing suppliers
                       (and sometimes Bank staff) seek self-enrichment, misusing and diverting precious
                       funds meant for project implementation and denying the project the full comple-
                       ment of the very goods and services needed for the fulfillment of its development
                       objectives.


                       The Detailed Implementation Review
                       The Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) is a proactive diagnostic tool devel-
                       oped by the Bank’s Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) in 2001 to evalu-
                       ate Bank-financed projects for indicators of fraudulent and corrupt activities. It
                       utilizes a holistic and flexible approach to identify past actions and activities by
                       project implementation units (or specialized procurement agencies), suppliers and
                       contractors, and others that indicate the potential misuse or diversion of project
                       funds and compromised project outputs.

                            The DIR is performed by a highly specialized team of INT investigators, foren-
                       sic accountants, IT specialists, and analysts, as well as procurement and financial
                       management specialists, lawyers, engineers, and implementation specialists from
                       within the Bank or industry. It may include Bank operational staff from a variety of
                       disciplines, and Bank staff from the relevant Country Office, as needed.

                            Although sharing some similarities in the use of widely-accepted computerized
                       and manual forensic audit and investigative techniques, the DIR is not an inves-
                       tigation that aims to substantiate specific allegations of fraud and corruption for
                       purposes of Bank administrative actions or proceedings. In contrast, the DIR has a
                       broader objective to assess whether a project’s various contracting and implemen-
                       tation processes and activities exhibit indicators, or “red flags,” that the project and
                       its objectives may have been compromised by fraudulent and/or corrupt activities,
                       and to what extent. The nature, patterns, and prevalence of these indicators pro-

                            The World Bank Procurement Guidelines define corrupt and fraudulent practices as: “corrupt practice means
                       the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of any thing of value to influence the action of a public official in the
                       procurement process or in contract execution; and fraudulent practice means a misrepresentation of facts in
                       order to influence a procurement process or the execution of a contract to the detriment of the Borrower, and
                       includes collusive practices among bidders (prior to or after bid submission) designed to establish bid prices
                       at artificial, non-competitive levels and to deprive the Borrower of the benefits of free and open competition.”
                       Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, para. 1.15 (1999). For ease of reference in this
                       Report, the use of the terms “corrupt practices” or “corrupt activities” are each inclusive of the corrupt and
                       fraudulent practices as defined by the Bank’s Guidelines.

vide the basis for remedial action by the country and the Bank. The concept and
use of indicators is discussed in more depth below.

   In addition, the DIR provides a general assessment of the project’s contracting
processes as well as its vulnerabilities to fraud and corruption. It also provides an
assessment of how and to what extent the project’s standard reports, assessments,
and supervisory functions captured and addressed the problems identified by the
DIR. Furthermore, the DIR identifies specific contracts, suppliers, organizations,
and individuals that warrant further investigation by the Bank or the Borrower.


DIR Approach and Methodology
Past DIRs and INT investigations have demonstrated how fraud and corruption can
result in detrimental implementation of project outputs. A Bank-financed project
undergoes careful planning and design in order to determine, in much detail, the
goods, works, and services it needs to fulfill its development and implementation
objectives, whether it is the delivery of medicines, vaccines, spectroscopes, or pub-
lic awareness campaigns or the construction of health clinics in remote villages.
Fraud and corruption, however, divert funds directly away from their intended
purpose, meaning that the project’s intended and planned procurement of goods
and services—the quality, quantity, and overall value of the items—is inherently
compromised. At risk are the benefits to the project’s intended beneficiaries.

   The DIR is based on the premise that damage inflicted by fraud and corruption
on a project’s development and implementation objectives can be considerable, as
its cost is seldom absorbed by its participants. Rather, the actors paying the bribe
or kickback—that is, suppliers of goods, works, or services—seek ways to cover the
cost of fraud and corruption by extracting from the contract additional economic
profits, or margins, over and above what is usually earned under competitive cir-
cumstances. This is accomplished by either raising contract receipts (i.e., inflating
the price of goods) or lowering contract costs. Contract costs generally are low-
ered by reducing product or service quality or short-changing their quantity. Either
method diverts funds from their intended purpose.

   The DIR is a robust combination of in-depth reviews of project documents,
procurement data, financial records, complaints, and other information. It also
employs computerized data mining and analytics, data research, site visits, quality
testing of goods, and interviews. Using widely accepted methodologies, it selects
for its review a sufficient number of tenders, awarded contracts, and field locations

                       in order to render a meaningful conclusion. The DIR looks for any consequential
                       event, document, pattern of activity, object, statement, correlation, or observation—
                       both objective and subjective—that indicates, suggests, or creates a substantially
                       increased risk that fraudulent and corrupt activities have occurred and that project
                       funds have been misused or diverted.4 The DIR terms these criteria as “indicators”
                       of fraudulent and corrupt activities. The DIR’s use of indicators is consistent with
                       that commonly used by national, state, and local law enforcement, as well as spe-
                       cialized audit agencies and the professional fraud control community.5

                            The DIR is conducted on Bank-financed projects believed to be at high risk
                       from fraud and corruption. Generally, projects subject to review are selected
                       in conjunction with the Country Office (CO). Criteria considered for selection
                       include: (1) allegations or findings of fraud and corruption from previous assess-
                       ments, reviews, or investigations; (2) well-advanced implementation of multiple
                       types of goods, works, and/or services; (3) upcoming successor projects that may
                       be exposed to the same high risks; and (4) multiple procurement methodologies
                       including international competitive bidding (ICB), national competitive bidding
                       (NCB), and shopping procedures. These criteria may be adjusted depending on the
                       conditions and needs of the CO and Borrower. Also, other projects not adhering
                       to the criteria may be included as part of the review at the request of the CO or
                       Borrower.

                       DIR Components and Phases
                       The DIR integrates information from multiple information sources in order to
                       best validate and support its findings and to maximize its discovery of patterns,
                       links, schemes, and inconsistencies that may point to fraud and corruption. Fur-
                       thermore, the DIR’s methodology is designed to reveal a variety of indicators at
                       various stages along the contract’s life cycle from bid advertisement to final dis-
                       bursement. For example, the identification of sequentially-numbered bid securi-

                           The threshold for sufficiency may be met either through a single indicator, or through a combination of

ties from different bidders initiates additional computer data analyses to identify
other links or patterns connecting the suspect bidders. Procurement records are
then reviewed to determine whether bidders may have influenced the outcome
of the procurement process through indicators of bid rigging or collusion, or are
operating as a cartel. Site visits are conducted to determine, for example, if imple-
mentation was deficient through the supply of substandard goods or inoperable
equipment. Pricing research and analyses may be conducted to determine if prices
were manipulated.

   Accordingly, as described in Table 1, the DIR is a multi-phased process flex-
ibly designed to adapt to unique project requirements, additional challenges and
changing conditions. It is not confined to a rigid checklist of pre-defined steps and
procedures that may hinder its reviewers from fully exploiting inconspicuous evi-
dence that often exposes the subtle nature and nuances of fraudulent and corrupt
activities and informative indicators. It continually updates its methodology and
approach with lessons learned from each prior DIR.

                       DIR’s Use of Indicators
                       The DIR distinguishes between different types of indicators. The DIR’s portfolio of
                       pre-defined indicators has been categorized into levels of hierarchy based on the
                       indicator’s type and its relative value (or weight) as an indication of fraudulent and
                       corrupt activities. Each level is then sub-divided, as needed, again based on the
                       indicator’s type and evidentiary value.

                             Level One indicators carry the most evidentiary value to the DIR. Empiri-
                       cally, these represent evidence and facts that—if validated—directly demonstrate
                       or indicate that fraudulent and corrupt activities have, in fact, occurred. These
                       indicators are broadly represented by two sub-groups: (1) oral or written admis-


                                                                     28

sions of corrupt or fraudulent practices (e.g., admitting to paying a bribe or being
solicited to do so) by winning, losing, or interested bidders, project officials or
consultants, or Bank staff or consultants; and (2) objective facts demonstrating
that corrupt or fraudulent practices have or very likely have occurred, such as
forged invoices, counterfeit or sub-standard goods, under-delivery of product
quantities, written communications and e-mails, falsified completion certificates,
and cancelled checks.

   Level Two indicators are objective facts that empirically indicate with a high
likelihood the presence of fraudulent and corrupt activities. Indicators at this level
are sub-divided into four groups: (1) indicators of corrupt or fraudulent practices
in a particular contract, such as separate bidders sharing common addresses or
officials, or bidders with sequential or similar bid security serial numbers from the
same bank on or about the same date; (2) objective facts that indicate the presence
of a cartel (collusion among bidders); (3) objective facts or patterns that indicate
bid rigging between a bidder and the Bid Evaluation Committee; and (4) suspi-
cious practices and patterns by the project’s implementation unit or related sup-
port agencies.

   Level Three indicators are facts and evidence that when present represent an
increased risk of possible corrupt or fraudulent practices. Level Three indicators
point to factors that demonstrate increased opportunities for these activities to
have occurred, such as weak controls or failure to follow strict procedures. Gen-
erally, these indicators, unlike Level One and Level Two indicators, do not by
themselves provide strong indications of possible fraudulent and corrupt activi-
ties, but when taken together generally increase the likelihood of fraudulent and
corrupt activities.


Interpretation of DIR Findings
The presence of indicators does not conclusively prove that a contract or proj-
ect has been exposed to corrupt or fraudulent practices. Rather, the presence of
indicators means that observed facts suggest an elevated risk that the contract or
project may have had such exposure. Similarly, the absence of indicators does not
mean that a project or contract has not been exposed to fraud and corruption.
Because fraudulent and corrupt acts are illegal and usually covert, a lack of observ-
able indicators provides no guarantee that they did not occur.

                           In addition, the number of indicators observed should not itself be overly
                       interpreted. An abundance of indicators within or across contracts is an impor-
                       tant finding, as a high number and/or diversity of indicators across multiple con-
                       tracts signals possible wide-spread and systemic breakdowns and problems in
                       contract procurement and implementation. However, all indicators should also
                       be assessed in light of their type, strength, prevalence, and interrelationship with
                       other indicators.

                           Moreover, a DIR generally does not include a full review of all contracts and
                       expenditures of funds under a project; such an undertaking is impractical and unfea-
                       sible when weighing costs and productive value. Instead, it conducts its review on a
                       selection of contracts deemed sufficient and diverse in scope, size, characteristics,
                       procuring body and method, and other criteria to render meaningful findings, con-
                       clusions, observations, and considerations for the project as a whole.

                           The DIR’s findings should be considered holistically—rather than narrowly on
                       just its abundance of indicators—and in the context of the project’s implementation,
                       reports, and assessments. Doing so provides a better and more comprehensive under-
                       standing of the various types of weaknesses, vulnerabilities, fraud, and corruption
                       that may be pervading a project’s processes on the whole. It also allows for the most
                       appropriate policy, design, and system response to systemic indicators of fraudulent
                       and corrupt practices. Equipped with such knowledge, appropriate steps may then be
                       taken by the country office and member country to tighten controls and procedures
                       and reduce the risks of fraudulent and corrupt practices in future projects.

                           Corrective actions, however, should not be directed only at contracts exhibiting
                       indicators. Contracts within a project not outwardly exhibiting indicators may still
                       have been subjected to fraud and corruption, especially if operating in an environ-
                       ment of collusion, weak controls, and systemic mismanagement. Additional inves-
                       tigative steps beyond the DIR should be performed to determine whether other
                       contracts actually were at risk or have been impacted by fraud or corruption.

                           Lastly, a DIR’s findings in relation to all of the contracts within the Bank-
                       financed project under review must be interpreted with appropriate consideration
                       for the project’s numerous qualitative factors, which differ significantly across
                       projects and member countries, including the:

                           1.	 Types and proportion of contracts and procurement methods;
                           2.	 Complexity or simplicity of the contracting process;
                           3.	 Number and size of contracts;



                                                                 30
                                                                        Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


      4.	 Strength of the project’s financial management process and personnel as
            well as internal controls and vulnerabilities to fraud and corruption;
      5.	 Quality of its documentation and record-keeping;
      6.	 Degree of direct involvement of senior government officials in the
            process;
      7.	 Quality and amount of direct supervision by Bank officials, auditors and
            project teams; and
      8.	 Use of any procurement consultants or specialists.
     Careful consideration of these and other important factors is important when
evaluating the specific findings of one or more DIRs. These are also valid reasons
for not statistically extrapolating the results of a DIR across an entire project or the
member country’s entire loan portfolio.

India DIR (Introduction)


                             Despite this economic strength, India suffers from widespread poverty. Recent
                       statistics indicate that India ranks 121st in the world in per capita GDP—USD
                       2,849—and more than 27 percent of India’s population lives below the govern-
                       ment’s poverty line.10 India is also home to 36 percent of the world’s people who
                       live on less than USD 1 per day.11


                       India’s Health Needs
                       India’s poverty causes its people to suffer a disproportionate share of the world’s
                       health problems. India represents 17 percent of the total world population,12 but
                       the World Health Organization estimates that Indians suffered 28 percent of the
                       world’s total years lost to respiratory infections, 24 percent of the years lost to diar-
                       rheal diseases, 21 percent of the years lost to measles, 24 percent of the years lost to
                       nutritional deficiencies, 25 percent of the years lost to tuberculosis, 26 percent of
                       the years lost to tetanus, and 45 percent of the years lost to leprosy.13 In addition, 47
                       percent of India’s children under the age of five are malnourished14 and 2.5 million
                       of its people are living with HIV/AIDS.15

                             Nonetheless, India has achieved some successes in improving its people’s health.
                       Since 1970, India’s average life expectancy has increased by 14 years (to age 63), and
                       since 1950, average fertility and infant mortality have dropped by approximately
                       half.16 However, these successes are creating new challenges because India’s aging
                       population is suffering from a new set of chronic health conditions, such as heart
                       disease (now the most common cause of Indian mortality) to which its health sys-
                       tem must adapt and respond.17 Health system planning is further complicated by

the wide variance in Indian states’ wealth, geography, demographics, and lifestyles,
all of which affect their health needs.18

      Although India’s national health infrastructure is extensive—including over
146,000 sub-centers (for areas of up to 5,000 people), 23,236 Primary Health Cen-
ters (for areas of up to 30,000 people), and 3,346 Community Health Centers (for
areas of up to 120,000 people)—India’s public health spending constitutes only one
percent of its total GDP, placing it below most low-income countries and in the
bottom 20 percent of all countries.19 As a result, 80 percent of India’s spending for
health comes from individuals’ out-of-pocket payments at the point of service.20
The private sector accounts for 93 percent of all hospitals, 64 percent of all hospital
beds, and 80 percent of all doctors nationwide.21 Only five countries—Cambodia,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Georgia, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone—rely on
private health spending more than India.22

      India’s heavy reliance on private health spending causes significant financial
burdens for those who use it. For example, the average patient who enters a hos-
pital spends over 58 percent of his or her annual income on private health servic-
es.23 More than 40 percent of inpatients borrow money to cover medical expenses,
and at least 25 percent of them are forced into poverty by those expenses.24 India’s
reliance on private health spending also creates a “two-track” system that dis-
criminates against the poor by shunting them to inadequately funded public facil-
ities.25 Unfortunately, many of India’s poor disregard this low-quality treatment
and underutilize available services.26 As a result, India’s poorest 20 percent suffer
mortality and malnutrition rates at more than twice those of the wealthiest 20
percent.27

      India’s health system further suffers from large spending and quality discrepan-
cies between states, and between urban and rural areas. States account for between
75 and 90 percent of public health spending, and such spending is substantially

                       lower in poor states. For example, Kerala, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu provide more
                       than twice the per capita health spending of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.28 State
                       funding is also hampered by high salary costs and a failure to get funds to rural
                       areas; these problems contribute to rural infant mortality rates that are 74 percent
                       higher than urban rates.29

                             In short, India faces significant health challenges, and its health system is severely
                       lacking, particularly for the poor. The need for high-quality Bank involvement in
                       the health sector is understandable, and the Bank has increased its response to this
                       need over the past few years.


                       World Bank Lending In The India Health
                       Sector
                       For half a century, health constituted only a tiny fraction of the Bank’s work in
                       India. The Bank’s first work in India was a 1949 railway project, and over the next
                       50 years, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and
                       International Development Association (IDA) financed 302 Indian projects worth
                       a combined USD 33.7 billion.30 Only seven of these projects, however, worth USD
                       402 million, involved health.31 Instead, the overwhelming majority of the Bank’s
                       projects targeted the infrastructure, transport, energy, and agriculture sectors;
                       health represented just two percent of the Bank’s Indian projects, and only 1.1
                       percent of India’s loan commitments.32

                             Beginning in the 1990s, the Bank’s lending strategy for India dramatically
                       changed. Between 1990 and 2000, the Bank approved 22 new health sector proj-
                       ects in India; more than three times as many health projects as in all the years
                       before.33 The Bank’s dollar commitment to India of USD 6.8 billion in IBRD and

IDA loans and credits for those health projects was more than 16 times the total
dollar amount of all previous health projects.34 Since 2001, the Bank has approved
ten additional health projects and authorized supplemental financing for two
more, totaling USD 1.5 billion in new IBRD/IDA loan and credit commitments.35
Overall, since 1990, health has constituted approximately five percent of India’s
new projects and 37 percent of its new Bank financial commitments.36 India is cur-
rently the Bank’s largest Borrower with 75 active projects worth a total IBRD/IDA
commitment of USD 15.2 billion.37

      It appears that the Bank’s focus on Indian health needs will continue for the
foreseeable future. The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India
emphasizes increased health sector activity, primarily through the selective funding
of high-impact pilot projects which provide models for action in multiple states.38
The CAS follows a sector-wide approach that includes projects to improve the pri-
vate market for health, increase public health spending, reform state health systems,
combat communicable diseases, and improve sanitation and clean water supplies.39


Corruption in India
The functioning of the health system in India is largely a matter for its state gov-
ernments. In a conscientious effort of capacity-building, many of the Bank’s new

                       and/or weakest governance and capacity levels.40 This approach is consistent with
                       the Bank’s understanding of the developmental needs of the Indian health system.
                       But by relying on the least well-governed institutions for project implementation,
                       the Bank will likely expose its projects to substantial fraud and corruption risks.

                             Recent studies suggest that corruption is a widespread problem in India and
                       among Indian businesses: India ranks 70th in Transparency International’s index
                       of corruption perceptions; Indian businesses are perceived to be the most likely
                       to pay bribes when working abroad; and in the largest empirical study of corrup-
                       tion in India, 62 percent of survey respondents said that they personally had paid
                       bribes to receive government services.41

                             This problem of corruption extends to India’s health sector. A study by Transpar-
                       ency International India found that government hospitals were the most corrupt
                       basic government service, and that 27 percent of survey respondents—statistically
                       representing about 30 million households—reported paying bribes at government
                       hospitals in exchange for medicines, inpatient admission, and medical consulta-
                       tion and treatment.42 The Indian press has reported that counterfeit drugs also are
                       a widespread problem, and that effective enforcement is lacking.43

                             To its credit, the Government of India has taken many steps to address corrup-
                       tion, paralleling the Bank’s enhanced anticorruption activity. It has passed laws
                       prohibiting corruption and money laundering, has an active Central Vigilance
                       Commission, and is a signatory to both the UN Convention Against Corruption
                       and the Asian Development Bank–Organisation for Economic Co-Operation
                       and Development (ADB-OCED) Anticorruption Initiative for the Asia-Pacific
                       Region.44 Yet despite these efforts, the Bank’s projects are still exposed to corrup-
                       tion risks, as learned firsthand from its recent investigation of a major health sec-
                       tor project in India, as discussed below.

Reproductive And Child Health Project
Investigation
      Between 2000 and 2005, INT received several allegations claiming that a car-
tel of pharmaceutical companies headed by Nestor Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nestor)
and Pure Pharma Ltd. (Pure Pharma) were colluding to secure the award of most
of the pharmaceutical contracts under the Reproductive and Child Health Proj-
ect (RCH), a USD 277 million Bank-financed project.45 The contracts were being
awarded on behalf of the Government of India by two government Procurement
Support Agencies (PSAs)—Hospital Services Consultancy Corporation (India)
Ltd. (HSCC) and Hindustan Latex Ltd. (HLL).46 The cartel allegations raised seri-
ous concerns at the time as HLL and HSCC were active PSAs throughout the Bank’s
health sector portfolio in India.47

      In response, between November 2003 and July 2005, INT undertook four inves-
tigative missions to India, conducting more than 100 interviews with companies
and individuals and reviewing thousands of pages of procurement-related docu-
ments provided mostly by the Government of India.48

      INT’s investigation found that RCH was plagued by systemic fraud and
corruption:

       1.	 Contractors had formed a cartel to defeat Bank procurement proce-
              dures and defraud the Government of India and the Bank. The investi-
              gation found that Nestor and Pure Pharma colluded with other companies
              and paid kickbacks to government officials to win 65 percent (approxi-
              mately USD 50 million) of the total value of kitting and pharmaceutical
              contracts awarded.49 For these practices, the Bank debarred Nestor and
              Pure Pharma in July 2007.50

                              2.	 PSAs had performed poorly and were corrupt. The PSAs were found to
                                    lack adequate capacity, creating an environment susceptible to large-scale
                                    fraud and corruption.51 Furthermore, INT collected evidence that several
                                    officials from HLL and HSCC accepted kickbacks to secure the award
                                    of contracts, favorable inspection reports, and payment of contractors’
                                    invoices.52 INT’s concern over PSA corruption increased further when,
                                    during the investigation, INT received further credible allegations of cor-
                                    ruption against at least two other PSAs managing procurement under
                                    Bank-financed projects in India’s health sector.53

                              3.	 Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) officials were sus-
                                    pected of receiving kickbacks. Several sources related first- and second-
                                    hand accounts of cash being delivered to MOHFW officials under RCH
                                    or other Bank projects, either directly to secure the award of contracts, or
                                    indirectly through PSA officials.54

                              4.	 Contractors under the project provided degraded pharmaceuticals and
                                    under-delivered medical supplies. The investigation uncovered evidence
                                    of under-delivered quantities of medical supplies in several Bank proj-
                                    ects.55 There was also evidence that degraded pharmaceuticals had been
                                    delivered in some instances, compromising project effectiveness and the
                                    health and lives of patients.56 Increasing the risk of extensive degraded
                                    product deliveries was the evidence of Nestor’s problems with quality pro-
                                    duction of some pharmaceuticals in general.57

                              5.	 Corrupt contractors and PSAs continued to be involved in ongoing
                                    Bank-financed projects. Nestor, Pure Pharma and other contractors sus-
                                    pected of being involved in fraud, corruption, and collusion under RCH,
                                    were found to be active in other Bank projects.58 In addition, HSCC and
                                    HLL were the PSAs for a number of other health sector projects.59

       6.	 Problems plaguing RCH also appeared to be present across the Bank’s
             health sector portfolio in India. The investigation found that the collu-
             sive practices of Nestor and Pure Pharma affected other Bank projects. In
             the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) Project (the precursor to
             RCH) financed by an IDA Credit totaling USD 214.5 million, four com-
             panies (including Nestor and Pure Pharma) were found to have colluded
             and paid kickbacks to government officials to win 93 percent (USD 23.4
             million) of the total value of pharmaceutical contracts awarded.60 From
             witnesses interviewed in the RCH investigation and complainants, INT
             obtained credible allegations of fraud and/or corruption involving both
             the PSAs and government officials in four other health sector projects.61

       7.	 RCH’s successor project was not designed to address specific risks of
             fraud and corruption. RCH’s successor project, the Second Reproductive
             Child Health (RCH II) Project was not designed to specifically address
             the risks of the structural deficiencies and systemic fraud and corruption
             revealed in the RCH investigation—in particular, weaknesses in both Bank
             and Government of India procurement, oversight, and supervision.62


Resultant Actions
In anticipation of INT’s final report of investigation and drawing upon INT’s pre-
liminary findings issued in March 2005, SAR and the Government of India devel-
oped a Governance Accountability and Action Plan (GAAP) for the health sector
in India. The GAAP, which applies to “all centrally sponsored health and family
welfare programs supported by the Bank and other pooling partners,” sets forth
stakeholder responsibilities in “ensuring timely delivery of quality commodities at
a competitive price.”63 This was followed by several critical actions after the issu-

pp. 92 and 97.
60	
      Ibid., pp. 12 and 16.

     The four projects were: the Malaria Control Project, the Uttar Pradesh Health Systems Development Project,

lectively represent a commitment of more than USD 478 million in Bank funding. Ibid., pp. 92–95. Three of the
four projects are subjects of this DIR.

ment and Reform Project (KHSDRP).

                       and corruption in other Bank-financed Indian health sector projects.

                             Bank President Wolfowitz ordered lending to India for new health sector proj-
                       ects to be temporarily suspended until risk mitigation measures could be strength-
                       ened. Thereafter, INT provided SAR with a risk assessment of two of the suspended
                       projects. INT also participated in a dialogue with SAR and the Government of
                       India to develop an agreed Action Plan of immediate and medium-term actions.64
                       One of the immediate actions was the agreement for the Bank to conduct a DIR on
                       a selection of Bank-financed projects in India’s health sector.65

                             HLL and HSCC, the PSAs under RCH, suspended two senior procurement
                       officials, pending internal inquiries, and the Government of India referred a num-
                       ber of cases to the Indian Criminal Bureau of Investigation (CBI).66

                             The Bank retained an international accounting and consulting firm to conduct
                       an extensive review of the SAR procurement hub in collaboration with INT and
                       the Bank’s Operations Policy and Country Services Procurement Unit. The review
                       subsequently found, that the hub was not exercising its fiduciary function in a way
                       that would allow the Bank to prevent fraudulent and corrupt activities during the
                       procurement process.67

                             Lastly, in May 2006, the Bank filed notices of debarment against Nestor and Pure
                       Pharma, and debarred the two companies in July 2007 for collusive activities.68

                             The suspension in lending was lifted in August 2006 following implementation
                       of the necessary risk mitigation measures.69

Overview of The India
Detailed Implementation
Review
Selection of Projects
As agreed to with the Government of India, the India DIR conducted an extensive
detailed implementation review of five health sector projects:

    1.	 Food and Drug Capacity Building Project (FDCBP);

    2.	 Orissa Health Systems Development Project (OHSDP);

    3.	 Second National AIDS Control Project (NACP II);

    4.	 Malaria Control Project (MCP); and

    5.	 Tuberculosis Control Project (TCP)

   All five projects addressed some of India’s most pressing and urgent health
issues and needs, making their successful implementation extremely important.
Their objectives and details, and the reasons why the Bank selected them for
review, are as follows:

Food and Drug Capacity Building Project
   The Food and Drug Capacity Building Project (FDCBP) sought to improve
the quality and safety of the products of India’s rapidly-growing food and drugs
industries by building or renovating food and drug testing laboratories, provid-
ing adequate laboratory equipment, and training laboratory technicians to use
the provided equipment. The FDCBP, currently in its fourth year, is financed by
a USD 54 million IDA credit that became effective on October 17, 2003 and is
scheduled to close on June 30, 2008. The Bank included the FDCBP in the DIR
because: (1) the project was ongoing; and (2) it contained a large civil works
component—an area that the Bank has found to be vulnerable to fraud and cor-
ruption in other projects.

India DIR (Introduction)



                       Orissa Health Systems Development Project
                             The Orissa Health Systems Development Project (OHSDP) was a state-level proj-
                       ect that sought to improve the health of the people of the eastern state of Orissa. At
                       the time of the OHSDP’s 1998 launch, Orissa was considered one of the least-devel-
                       oped states in India: 44 percent of its population lived below the poverty line, and it
                       had one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country.70 The OHSDP planned
                       to address these issues by constructing or renovating many of the state’s healthcare
                       facilities, supplying them with additional medical equipment, and improving the
                       state’s health system policies.71 The project was financed by a USD 82.1 million IDA
                       credit that became effective in September 8, 1998 and closed on March 31, 2006.72
                       The Bank included the OHSDP in the DIR because: (1) the Bank’s RCH investiga-
                       tion identified it as possibly tainted by fraud and corruption; (2) the DIR sought to
                       include a state-level project in its scope to augment its other national projects; and
                       (3) a successor project had been proposed within the Bank.

                       Second National AIDS Control Project
                             The Second National AIDS Control Project (NACP II), a successor to the
                       Bank’s first National AIDS Control Project, aimed to reduce the spread of HIV
                       infection in India and strengthen the country’s capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS.
                       At the time of the NACP II’s 1999 launch, it was estimated that several million
                       Indians were infected with HIV and the Bank was concerned that, without con-
                       tinued efforts to stem a growing infection rate, India could follow in the footsteps
                       of some of the worst HIV/AIDS-affected countries in Africa. Under NACP II, the
                       AIDS control strategy shifted from raising global awareness to changing behavior
                       through targeted interventions—often conducted by non-governmental organi-
                       zations (NGOs)—in which high-risk groups were identified and provided with
                       counseling, condoms, and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. The proj-
                       ect was financed by a USD 193.7 million IDA credit that became effective in Sep-
                       tember 11, 1999 and closed on March 31, 2006. The Bank included the NACP II in
                       the DIR because: (1) the Bank’s RCH investigation identified it as at risk of expo-
                       sure to fraud and corruption; (2) its design and scope were similar to a Kenya HIV/
                       AIDS project that a past DIR found to exhibit indicators of fraud and corruption;
                       (3) it followed a design model that the Bank was replicating in many countries;

and (4) it had a successor project (the Third National AIDS Control Project) in the
Bank’s project pipeline.

Malaria Control Project
      The Malaria Control Project (MCP) sought to assist India’s National Malaria
Eradication Program by introducing a more strategic and effective set of mecha-
nisms to control malaria. Malaria causes substantial death, morbidity, and related
social and economic losses in India, especially among the rural poor.73 The MCP’s
malaria control efforts included providing malaria prevention mechanisms, such
as insecticide-treated bed nets and larvivorous fish, and introducing early detec-
tion and treatment strategies.74 The MCP was financed by a USD 114 million IDA
credit that became effective on October 27, 1997 and closed on December 31,
2005.75 The Bank included the MCP in the DIR because: (1) the Bank’s RCH inves-
tigation identified it as possibly tainted by fraud and corruption; and (2) it had a
successor project (the Vector Borne Disease Control Project) in the Bank’s project
pipeline.

Tuberculosis Control Project
      The Tuberculosis Control Project (TCP) sought to support India’s National
Tuberculosis Control Program. At the time of the TCP’s 1997 launch, it was esti-
mated that half of India’s population was infected with tuberculosis,76 and the Gov-
ernment of India had just successfully piloted its Directly Observed Treatment –
Short Course (DOTS) approach in which the patient is accurately diagnosed using
high-quality sputum microscopy, assigned a pre-packaged medical treatment
pack, and administered directly-observed treatment for six to eight months with
strict follow up, supervision, and monitoring. The Bank expected DOTS to greatly
reduce TB-caused mortality and disability. The TCP was financed by a USD 124.8
million IDA credit that became effective on May 8, 1997 and closed on March 31,
2006. The Bank included the TCP in the DIR because: (1) the Bank’s RCH inves-
tigation identified it as possibly tainted by fraud and corruption; and (2) it had a
successor project (the Second National Tuberculosis Control Project) in the Bank’s
project pipeline.

India DIR (Introduction)



                       Funding and Type of Procurement
                       All five projects reviewed for the India DIR were funded by IDA credits. Although
                       some of the projects were part of larger government initiatives that involved fund-
                       ing from bi-lateral and other donors, all five of the DIR projects were exclusively
                       funded by the Bank in conjunction with some partial funding by the Government
                       of India.

                           Funding of the individual projects was facilitated by use of the Bank’s special
                       account mechanism, which provides for an initial advance to the Government of
                       India followed by subsequent replenishments. For the four nationally-sponsored
                       projects, the funds would flow from the Bank’s Special Account established with
                       the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to the MOHFW, and then either to the PSAs for
                       national-based procurement or the states and districts for state-wide and local
                       procurement needs. The amount of funds disbursed was contingent upon state-
                       ment of expediture (SOE) tallies presented by the districts to the states, and the
                       states to the MOHFW project implementation units for reimbursement.

                           The five projects procured goods, works and services utilizing a variety of the
                       Bank’s procurement methods, including international competitive bidding (ICB),
                       national competitive bidding (NCB), shopping, direct contracting and single
                       source selection. The type, size, and number of contracts procured under each
                       project varied with the general and specific characteristics of the projects’ scope
                       and needs.


                       DIR Scope

                       A.	 Expansion of Scope From Previous DIRs
                       The size and effort of the India DIR was unprecedented. Two key factors made the
                       India DIR unique and far more complex in scope and effort than other DIRs and
                       correspondingly required increased staffing, resources, and completion time. First,
                       the India DIR was simply larger in scale and scope than other DIRs. It involved the
                       review of a greater number of contracts and visits to far more field sites across a
                       more expansive and challenging geographical territory than other DIRs. Second,
                       the India DIR’s methodology was expanded to be more holistic in its approach. In
                       contrast to other DIRs, the India DIR incorporated more forensic expertise and
                       techniques, adopted more rigorous validation and quality assurance procedures,
                       and substantially increased the amount of analytical tests and procedures. These



                                                               44
                                                                           Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


steps were taken not only to respond to the Bank’s GAC Strategy and uncover fur-
ther links, patterns, schemes, and inconsistencies that point to harmful fraud and
corruption, but also to increase the value of the DIR’s findings.

B.	 Procurements by Procurement Support Agencies
      Four of the five projects selected—FDCBP, NACP II, MCP, and TCP—were
Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) of the MOHFW that were implemented
through State Societies.77 Each of these projects utilized the services of a Procure-
ment Support Agency (PSA) to manage the procurement of the project’s larger
contracts—e.g., ICBs and NCBs—which were subject to the Bank’s prior review
threshold. The fifth project—OHSDP—was state sponsored.

      The World Bank and the Government of India agreed that the India DIR’s exam-
ination of procurement would encompass: (1) reviewing 100 percent of available
ICB and NCB contracts procured by the PSAs relating to the five projects; (2) col-
lecting data regarding 100 percent of available decentrally-procured contracts in
the three projects that utilized this method of procurement; and (3) reviewing a
selection of those decentrally-procured contracts.

C.	       Procurements By State and District Societies
      Although national-based with centralized procurement capabilities, a great
deal of the implementation activities for the CSS projects—such as administering
medicines or distributing condoms—occurred at the state and district level, caus-
ing considerable project funds to be allocated to the State and District Societies for
the procurement of goods and services in support of these activities. Comprising a
project’s smaller dollar-value contracts, most were procured through national and
local shopping and fell well below the prior-review thresholds. Although small indi-
vidually in monetary terms, in aggregate the total of the funds procured at this level
for three of the four projects was significant relative to total project funds spent.

      The sheer volume of these contracts—estimated at more than 200,000 nation-
wide—and their expansive geographical dispersion prevented a full-scale review of the
totality. Instead, the DIR limited its review of these types of contracts to the contracts
procured within three of the five states selected by the DIR for its review of implemen-
tation activities. The three states were Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Orissa.78

77	
     Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are specific purpose transfers from the Government of India to the
states for the purpose of influencing expenditure in areas which are the states’ constitutional responsibility. Such
schemes are formulated and, to a large extent, financed by the Government of India while the responsibility for
implementation primarily rests with the states.
78	
      The NACP II project team reviewed an additional 14 locally procured contracts in Chhattisgarh.



                                                         45
India DIR (Introduction)


                       D.	Review of Implementation
                             Implementation within the CSS projects covered a wide swath of India’s popu-
                       lation with some projects addressing health needs in every Indian state and union
                       territory. Because visits to all states and districts were not feasible, the DIR system-
                       atically selected five states in which to conduct its review of the projects’ implemen-
                       tation activities: Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh
                       (DIR States). The DIR States were the more active in terms of procurement and
                       implementation activities for the four CSS projects and shared the most overlap
                       across the projects, with suitable geographical representation.

                             As part of its review, the DIR also visited offices, implementation sites, ware-
                       houses, distribution units, hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and civil works sites at
                       the district level within the DIR States. The districts selected for visits were cho-
                       sen based on a variety of criteria including type of volume of goods and services
                       distributed, population of project-affected persons, indicators identified during
                       the procurement review, number and types of complaints received, transportation
                       logistics, and physical safety of the team.

                       E.	 State-Based Project
                             To review implementation, the DIR visited 55 OHSDP-funded hospitals in 23
                       districts, spanning work supervised by all five construction management consul-
                       tants (CMCs), which represented 35 percent of all project sites. To examine procure-
                       ment—which was conducted at the state level by the state’s Project Management Cell
                       and PSAs—the DIR performed a review of all of the 502 OHSDP contracts, worth
                       USD 46.7 million, for which the DIR obtained contract documents.79 The DIR also
                       performed detailed reviews of bid documents, bid evaluation reports, and contracts
                       for all design, architect, and construction management consultant procurements; a
                       selection of 52 civil works contracts (33.5 percent of all civil works contracts) that
                       included all five CMCs; and a selection of 33 equipment contracts for a variety of
                       equipment types that previously had been identified as problematic. The DIR did not
                       review any local contracts related to the OHSDP.


                       Preliminary Phase
                       In September and October 2006, DIR representatives undertook a four-week
                       mission to India and met with the Secretary for Health and Family Welfare, the
                       79	
                           These included 155 civil works contracts worth USD 30.9 million; 183 equipment, instruments, and furnish-

each project’s PSA.80 The meetings were facilitated by a nodal officer from the
MOHFW81 appointed by the Joint Secretary, MOHFW, who also traveled with the
DIR staff to the five states. All the meetings were well-attended and proved essen-

Review Phases
The India DIR was significant in scope and duration. Spanning a period of 14
months from September 2006 to October 2007 and involving the services of more
than 75 professionals, supporting consultants, and staff, its analytical work began
in October 2006 with the request and collection of the contract and procurement-
related documents. Much of the balance of 2006 was spent inputting data and
information from the contract documents into the DIR’s database (DIRDB) and
preparing the data for analysis. The review teams were deployed on a staggered
basis beginning in January 2007 to initiate the detailed procurement review and
conduct preliminary data analytics. Site visits for the review of project implemen-
tation began in March and were completed by mid-May. The concluding months
of the DIR were spent in Washington, DC, finalizing working files, documenting
findings and analyses, and drafting the DIR Report.

A.	 Document Request
      The PSAs were requested to provide procurement-related documents for each
contract they had tendered, including: bidding documents, executed contracts, bid
evaluation reports and copies of the winning and losing bids.82 For the contracts

    The India DIR TOR initially called for the supporting procurement file documentation for all contracts
procured under a project, including the contracts procured by the state societies and districts using shopping or
direct source methods. Because of the large volume of contracts procured by the states and districts—estimated

                       procured by the state and district societies from the five DIR States, the PSAs were
                       requested to provide a full list of contract awards in an electronic format with related
                       detailed information. Related supporting documentation on selected samples of
                       these contracts would be gathered and reviewed during the DIR’s site visits.

                           The primary purpose of the September 2006 mission was to ensure that all
                       of the projects would be able to complete (1) lists of all contracts that had been
                       awarded, and (2) the collection of the supporting documentation for all ICB and
                       the larger NCB and contracts, within the agreed time frame and in a format accept-
                       able to the DIR.

                           The visits to the various state, district, and local offices involved in each of the
                       projects confirmed that the supporting documentation for each of the contracts
                       was available, albeit storage of the documentation varied enormously. While the
                       DIR was promised that the documents would be properly collated, documented,
                       and forwarded to its facility in Delhi, complications arose. For example, the DIR
                       representatives were informed that documentation seen at the PIU in Bhubaneswar
                       (shown in the photos below) would take seven days to collate, which appeared an
                       unlikely task as the documents related to more than one project.

B.	 The DIR Facility
   The WBOD provided the DIR with dedicated, refurbished office space in Delhi
within which to conduct its various reviews and analyses, store documents and
undertake data input. The Country Office also provided the DIR one full-time
administrative staff and driver. The DIR equipped the facility with 14 computer
workstations, along with printers, a fax machine, and a photocopier. The facility had
extensive storage capabilities and a 24-hour on-site security presence. Throughout
the time that the DIR was present in Delhi, the WBOD provided excellent support
and responded to all requirements.

                       C.	 Document Collection, Scanning, and Printing
                           Overall, the collection of documents from the PSAs and OHSDP PIU was an
                       extensive and problematic undertaking fraught with delays. Originally, the DIR
                       intended to retain the procurement-related documents through the duration of the
                       DIR, and return them to the PSAs at its conclusion. However, the PSAs’ insistence
                       that the documents be returned immediately after the data input phase required
                       the documents to be scanned prior to returning them. While this allowed the DIR
                       to retain a complete set of documents, it was a mammoth undertaking as the PSAs
                       insisted that the documents be returned in the same state as received, meaning
                       many of the bound documents, including books, had to be broken apart, scanned,
                       and then re-bound. As a result some of the DIR support staff were diverted away

from data entry to undertake the tasks of scanning, printing, and rebinding, which
had the inevitable result of slowing down the data entry phase.

      This delay was further exacerbated by the difficulties encountered with the offi-
cials of OHSDP. After OHSDP officials agreed in September 2006 to deliver the
requested documentation to the facility in Delhi, in mid-October they refused to do
so, citing concerns about the records’ security and the need to have the documents
available for an upcoming audit. Several weeks of negotiations at Joint Secretary
level failed to resolve the issue, and in late November 2006 the DIR was compelled
to send a team of people along with scanners and workstations to Orissa to scan
more than 300,000 documents over a three-week period. Many of the OHSDP
papers were in very poor condition, with pages and/or entire documents missing.

D.	 Contract and Procurement Data Input
      Up to 50 fields of relevant key pieces of information from the approximate 885
procurement files83 provided by the PSAs—such as supplier names, contract values,
procurement method, and bid evaluation results—were input into the DIR’s comput-
erized database (DIRDB), which was completed by February 2007. Data pertaining
to 835 ICB and NCB contracts representing 1152 companies and 1836 individuals
were entered. PIUs within the DIR States provided up to 13 data fields of information
on more than 14,000 contracts, which were imported electronically directly into the
DIRDB. To ensure the integrity of the data inputting and importation, the DIRDB
underwent extensive quality assurance and data standardization.

      Various detailed and summary lists of relevant data and information from the
contract files were printed and provided to the DIR teams to assist in the procure-
ment review.

E.	 Data Analytics
      The DIR has developed a standard battery of computer data analyses that it exe-
cutes on the contract data entered into the DIRDB. Currently numbering 75, the
quantity and robustness of the analytical procedures increases with each DIR, as
new analytics are developed and the number of data fields collected is expanded.

      An initial iteration of analytics by forensic computer and accounting special-
ists is performed on the population of data within the DIRDB in order to identify
contracts with preliminary indicators of fraud and corruption, such as common
links between bidders or indications of bid winner rotation. Typically, the results

                       are used in determining which contracts—selected as a purposeful sample from
                       the entire population—are to be considered for a manual in-depth review. For the
                       India DIR, however, this step was negated by the decision to target an in-depth
                       review on all ICB and NCB contracts procured by the PSAs under the national
                       projects and a large number of contracts procured by the OHSDP PIU. Indicators
                       identified from the initial round of data analysis and other useful information and
                       results were provided to the DIR teams for their procurement review. Additional
                       data analytics were devised and conducted as needed throughout the DIR based
                       on the ongoing findings of the DIR teams and the indicators’ interrelationship
                       with other data.

                       F.	     DIR Project Review Teams
                             Each DIR project was staffed with a dedicated team of two to five investigators,
                       analysts, and subject matter experts. The teams were supported by a core team of
                       senior managers who led the DIR project and oversaw and ensured the delivery
                       of planning, logistical and administrative support to the teams. The teams were
                       also supported by experienced forensic data analysts and forensic accountants and
                       received IT support and services from both INT and WBOD.

                       G.	 Review of Procurement and Contracting
                             In January 2007, the DIR project teams began the review of all 835 ICB and NCB
                       contracts for indicators of fraud and corruption, as well as collusive activity in con-
                       tract procurement. This review consisted of analysis of contract and procurement
                       packages and the events and activities of the bidding and award stages. The indi-
                       vidual project reviews generally lasted three to four weeks and examined, as was
                       available, awarded contracts, bid evaluation reports (BERs), winning and losing
                       bids, and correspondence between the Bid Evaluation Committee (BEC) and the
                       bidders, as well as related documentation. The DIR also collected data regarding
                       approximately 14,000 decentrally-procured contracts and analyzed selections of
                       these contracts—chosen by project, district, and value—for indicators of fraud and
                       corruption. The teams documented their findings in working case memos (WCM)
                       and, where appropriate, updated the DIRDB with new information. The findings
                       played a key role in determining what sites and districts to visit during the imple-
                       mentation review.

                       H.	 Review of Financial Management and Audit Reports
                             The DIR utilized financial management (FM) specialists and forensic accoun-
                       tants to examine documentation and FM processes within the PSAs and OHSDP


                                                                  52

PIU to identify weaknesses in the control environment as well as discrepancies
between formally codified procedures and daily execution. The DIR examined spe-
cific transactions related to the contracts exhibiting certain indicators from either
the procurement or financial management reviews; interviewed management of
the implementing organizations; and reviewed financial reports, audit reports, and
project financial management reports.

I.	     Review of Implementation and Supply Chains
      The DIR undertook site visits related to all five projects to physically verify
the status and/or results of implementation, particularly in relation to civil works
contracts, and review implementation-related documentation. In the process, the
teams inspected dozens of sites and hundreds of pieces of equipment, examined
stocks of pharmaceuticals and other project goods, and took thousands of photo-
graphs and several hours of video. These reviews ranged in duration from three
to six weeks depending upon the project, and required a huge logistical effort by
support staff at the DIR facility as well as the travel desks both in Washington, DC,
and WBOD. For general safety concerns and due to ongoing Naxalite rebel activ-
ity in certain areas, the DIR project team visiting remote sites in Orissa retained a
security detail. The last team left India in mid-May 2007.

             Capacity Building
                 Project

Overview
Project Objective
As India’s food and drug industry expands and ever larger numbers of India’s poor
begin to consume its products, concerns have arisen regarding the safety and qual-
ity of food and drugs in the country. The Food and Drugs Capacity Building Proj-
ect (FDCBP) is a nationwide project that aims to improve the quality and safety of
food and drugs in India by strengthening the regulatory framework and incorpo-
rating components of consumer education and public-private partnerships.1

     The need for the FDCBP is timely, given that the food and drug industry in
India is large and growing. The pharmaceuticals industry ranks as the world’s third
largest in terms of volume and is expanding at over 10 percent annually.2 While the
Government of India has succeeded in realizing its policy objectives of ensuring
the availability of reasonably priced drugs and promoting the growth of a vibrant
domestic industry, the objective of ensuring uniform quality still needs to be effec-
tively addressed. The capacity of states’ drug testing facilities have differed—of the
19 drug testing laboratories functioning in 35 states and union territories before
the FDCBP began, only seven had the ability to perform a full range of tests.3 Insuf-
ficient consumer awareness and weak enforcement of existing regulations also con-
tribute to the negative public health effects of poor drugs.4

                          With respect to food quality, there is increasing concern in India about unsafe
                    foods and their effect on the health of the population. Though a majority of the
                    Indian population continues to depend on the small and informal sectors, such as
                    food street vendors, the growth of urbanization has meant that increasing numbers
                    of Indians are consuming processed food products, both domestic and import-
                    ed.5 While there are regulations for ensuring food safety in India, enforcement is
                    weak and methods outdated.6 The World Health Organization estimates that in
                    low-income countries about three-fourths of all episodes of diarrhea are caused
                    by unsafe water and poor sanitation, with the remaining one-fourth attributable
                    mostly to food-borne infections.7 Food-testing laboratories in India have tradi-
                    tionally not had sufficient capacity to perform analysis to respond to current needs
                    or to meet future growth. For example, the majority of state laboratories have been
                    able to perform only basic analysis and have not been able to perform comprehen-
                    sive testing, including analyzing samples for microbiological contaminants.8 The
                    FDCBP aims to address these public health problems.

                          Not only does consumer protection from unsafe and poor-quality foods and
                    drugs serve public health interests generally, but improved regulation and safety
                    also increase confidence in Indian products, making them more competitive inter-
                    nationally, thereby supporting exports in global markets.9

                          The FDCBP is an ongoing five-year project that began in October 2003 and is
                    scheduled to conclude on June 30, 2008. In funding the project, the Bank plans to
                    disburse a total of USD 54.03 million.10


                    Summary of Findings
                    The DIR’s review of the FDCBP found:

                           1.	 indicators of corrupt and fraudulent practices in the procurement and
                                  implementation of equipment and civil works, such as inconsistent treat-
                                  ment of bidders, submission of fraudulent documentation, and inappro-
                                  priate rejection of bidders;

    2.	 widespread deficiencies in the implementation of equipment and civil
        works, such as payment for incomplete civil works and uninstalled equip-
        ment; and

    3.	 weaknesses in the Bank’s identification and handling of these indicators
        and deficiencies.

   The DIR examined FDCBP laboratory and office equipment contracts procured
by the procurement support agency (PSA) through international competitive bid-
ding (ICB) and national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. The DIR found
questionable procurement practices, some of which indicate fraud and corruption,
in contracts representing 87 percent of the number of pieces and 88 percent of the
total value of equipment procured. However, the DIR noted that none of its find-
ings suggest the existence of cartels or collusive behavior between bidders.

   The DIR found inconsistencies in the administration of the procurement pro-
cess in the selection of suppliers, such as in determining whether a specific item
met specifications or in choosing to seek clarifications from some substantially
responsive bidders and not others. The DIR also found indicators related to gov-
ernment interference with the procurement process such as unreasonable delays
in the award of contracts, shifting bidding deadlines and requirements, and nar-
rowly drafted tenders. Procurement officials appeared to have employed favorit-
ism when awarding contracts to bidders that failed to meet performance criteria
while disqualifying other bidders that apparently met, or could have met, the cri-
teria. In addition, the DIR found potentially fraudulent documents submitted by
winning bidders, such as forged performance certificates, that, in some cases, were
corroborated by complaints by other bidders.

   Under the FDCBP, the DIR observed an unusual method in which bids were
evaluated and recommended for contracts. Typically, contract awards are based on
the bid evaluation report (BER) and recommendations of the Bid Evaluation Com-
mittee (BEC) under the auspices of the project’s PSA. Yet, for at least three tenders
of equipment, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) installed a
special steering committee composed of MOHFW officials, officials from the PSA,
and technical experts to review bid submissions and recommend bid awards. The
DIR found that the steering committee’s evaluation of bids frequently differed from
that of the BEC and exhibited indicators of non-transparency, preferential treat-
ment, and other corrupt and inconsistent practices. Further, the MOHFW always
followed the committee’s recommendations, repeatedly overruling the BEC.

                       The DIR found indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices in a third of the civil
                    works procurements that it reviewed. For example, the DIR noted the PSA’s unsup-
                    ported disqualification of a qualified lower cost bidder, as well as the awarding of con-
                    tracts to companies that submitted false or non-compliant bidding documentation.

                       Most of the contracts exhibiting indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices in
                    the DIR’s procurement review also had implementation deficiencies. The DIR found
                    widespread deficiencies in the delivery, installation, use, training, or maintenance
                    of equipment at all 15 of the food and drug laboratories and MOHFW regional
                    offices that it visited. For example, more than half of the 282 pieces of equipment
                    procured for the visited laboratories were undelivered or uninstalled. The DIR also
                    found improperly installed equipment, damaged equipment, and the delivery of
                    unneeded and unused equipment. In addition, the DIR found many instances in
                    which suppliers did not provide the required training and demonstrations or meet
                    warranty commitments to repair broken or damaged equipment.

                       The DIR found that substantial payment had been issued for almost half of
                    the contracts where equipment was undelivered, delivered in a damaged state, or
                    delivered with missing parts.

                       Moreover, the DIR found widespread deficiencies in all nine civil works sites
                    visited. Deficiencies included significant electrical, water supply, and infrastructure
                    problems and issues related to water damage, concrete, general construction, poor
                    quality of materials, and general maintenance. Many sites would require additional
                    work to conform with tender requirements. Nonetheless, despite these implemen-
                    tation deficiencies, in some cases the PSA provided contractors with completion
                    certificates that allowed full payment for unfinished or deficient work.

                       The DIR found that the FDCBP’s reports and assessments produced to date do
                    not adequately convey the high rate of procurement and implementation problems
                    and deficiencies afflicting the project. The DIR found that the Bank’s handling of such
                    issues thus far has significant shortcomings. To its credit, the Bank identified prob-
                    lems in the administration of the procurement processes in some cases. However,
                    the Bank still gave its no-objection to the award of these contracts, even though the
                    problems appear not to have been remedied. Furthermore, the Bank apparently has
                    conducted only one procurement post-review in the four years that the project has
                    been effective. While noting some deficiencies in the implementation of civil works—
                    though not to the extent observed by the DIR—the Bank nonetheless upgraded the
                    project’s implementation performance rating from unsatisfactory to moderately sat-
                    isfactory in its last two aides-mémoire. When Bank officials did identify indicators

of fraud and corruption, such as inconsistent administration of procurements that
favored certain bidders, or patterns of unreasonable procurement delays, they did not
pursue the issue with sufficient rigor, resulting in the matter remaining unresolved.




Project Background
Components
The FDCBP consists of three components. The first component, policy develop-
ment, program coordination, and monitoring, was budgeted at USD 7 million.11
This component includes studies and policy reviews to underpin the formulation
of policy and institutional reforms by developing options for reform in such areas
as food and drug administration, information collection for health problems asso-
ciated with food and drug quality and use, and financing of food and drug agen-
cies.12 This component also includes the establishment and operation of a central
program coordination unit (PCU) at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(MOHFW), the improvement of central physical facilities for food and drug over-
sight, a monitoring program that conducts household surveys to assess public per-
ceptions and knowledge about the quality and safety of foods and drugs, and the
organization of independent audits of public and private laboratories.13

      The second component of the FDCBP, the food quality and safety component,
was allocated the most funding—USD 44.35 million.14 The focus of activities under
this component is to strengthen the government’s oversight and regulatory capacity
for food safety at the central and state levels, to educate consumers on matters related
to food safety, and to upgrade related skills in the private sector.15 The component
aims to build awareness among consumers, manufacturers, retailers, and street food
vendors of issues concerning food safety and to train 2,000 inspectors and 500 ana-
lysts in public sector laboratories, 1,000 staff from the private sector, and 20 umbrella
consumer organizations in food quality and safety issues.16 The component also

                    seeks to develop and disseminate Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point standards,
                    an internationally accepted scientific method of quality assurance.17

                          In order to address infrastructure gaps that hamper timely and comprehensive
                    testing of food samples, the food quality and safety component also focuses on the
                    construction and equipping of 10 central government laboratories; the renovation,
                    upgrading, and equipping of 11 central government laboratories and public health
                    offices; the construction and equipping of nine state laboratories; and the renova-
                    tion and upgrading of six state laboratories.18 Specifically, the project finances civil
                    works, furniture, equipment, laboratory supplies, and incremental operating and
                    maintenance costs in these locations, with the aim of ensuring that laboratories
                    adopt minimum quality standards in testing.19

                          The third component of the FDCBP, the drug quality and safety component,
                    is funded with USD 21.65 million.20 The focus of activities in this component is
                    to strengthen the government’s oversight and regulatory capacity for drug safety
                    at the central and state levels, to educate consumers on matters related to drug
                    safety, and to upgrade related skills in the private sector.21 This component aims
                    to build awareness among consumers, small manufacturers, and retailers in issues
                    concerning drug safety, with the objective of encouraging consumers to adopt
                    quality and safety as criteria in making choices on drugs and retail outlets.22 The
                    component also seeks to update pharmaceutical standards and to train about 625
                    regulatory staff and 2,000 industry personnel in “good manufacturing practices
                    and good laboratory practices.”23

                          Under national drug policy, the central government laboratories function as
                    appellate authorities and have the responsibility to test imported drugs and blood
                    products.24 Thus, the FDCBP has included in the third component the construction
                    and equipping of one central government laboratory and the renovation and equip-
                    ping of one existing central government laboratory to reduce backlog and enhance
                    the range of tests.25 At the state level the testing of drug samples has been limited
                    because of the absence of sophisticated instruments, lack of trained analysts, short-

threefold (from about 36,000 to 100,000) over the project period, this component
plans to finance civil works, furniture, equipment, laboratory supplies, and incre-
mental operating and maintenance costs to construct and equip five new state drug
testing laboratories and renovate and equip 12 existing state laboratories.26


Implementation Structure

A.	 Procurement Arrangements
      The MOHFW is responsible for procurement arrangements under the FDCBP,
in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines and procedures.27 Most of
the procurements are overseen at the central government level by a PSA.28 The
MOHFW selected Hospital Services Consultancy Corporation India Limited
(HSCC) on a single source basis as the PSA to procure all civil works, goods,
equipment, and furniture.29 Small value items are procured at the state levels by
the various laboratories.30

      At the time of the India DIR, HSCC had conducted 18 tenders and awarded
77 contracts to supply equipment to laboratories under the FDCBP.31 The equip-
ment has been procured for 65 food laboratories and 24 drug laboratories located
nationwide with food and drug testing capabilities.32 The project has also con-
ducted 10 tenders and awarded 33 contracts for civil works.33

      A PCU is responsible for procuring services for various activities under the
FDCBP. These procurements serve to staff the central and state laboratories; train-
ing and workshops; information, education, and communication projects; the
management information system; and other consultancy services.34

                    B.	 Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
                          The FDCBP has a financial management system that is designed to account
                    for and report the project’s resources and expenditures.35 The PCU, where over 75
                    percent of the project expenditures are incurred, is staffed with personnel who have
                    been exposed to Bank-financed projects in the health and family welfare divisions.36
                    A financial management system has been developed for the project, and a finance
                    manual, focusing on financial reporting and monitoring, has been prepared.37

                          For the procurements made by HSCC, the MOHFW advances funds directly
                    to HSCC.38 HSCC certifies the invoices and bills after payment and forwards them
                    to the finance and accounting section of the PCU for settlement/liquidation of the
                    advance.39 The annual budget is based on the annual work program at the central
                    PCU and the requirements of the participating states with respect to their specific
                    annual work plans.40


                    Project Reports and Assessments
                    Equipment contracts valued at more than USD 300,000 and civil works contracts
                    valued at more than USD 500,000 are subject to the Bank’s prior-review prior to
                    contract award.41 The Bank also conducts periodic post-procurement reviews of
                    contract awards under the prior-review threshold to validate adherence to the
                    Bank’s procurement guidelines.42

                          The project incorporates formal supervision missions to review project imple-
                    mentation.43 Mission teams include task team leaders with experience in public
                    health program operations in developing countries, financial management spe-
                    cialists who review the project’s adherence to fiduciary requirements, procurement
                    specialists, and technical experts such as biomedical engineers and architects.44

has conducted six such missions.


Costs and Time
The FDCBP became effective on October 17, 2003,46 and is financed with a USD 54
million International Development Association credit.47 The project is currently in
its fourth year, and the planned closing date is June 30, 2008.48




The DIR’s Approach to the
FDCBP
The FDCBP was selected for the India DIR for two primary reasons. The FDCBP
is an ongoing project, unlike the other projects selected for the DIR. Second, the
FDCBP involves both equipment and civil works components, which allows the
DIR to diversify the types of projects under its review.

      The DIR’s review of the FDCBP examined the MOHFW’s procurement and
implementation of laboratory and office equipment; the MOHFW’s procurement
and implementation of civil works, such as construction, renovation, and expan-
sion of food and drug laboratories; and the project’s formal reports and assess-
ments. Focusing on the project’s high-risk areas, the DIR maximized its ability to
identify indicators of corrupt schemes and fraudulent practices that could signifi-
cantly affect the FDCBP’s outcomes.


Procurement of Equipment Contracts
      The DIR reviewed the procurement of laboratory and office equipment under
the FDCBP for indicators of corrupt and fraudulent practices. The DIR reviewed
documentation requested from and provided by HSCC, as well as relevant docu-
mentation obtained from the Bank’s Integrated Records and Information Service

                    lyzed documentation across tenders to detect wider patterns of indicators.

                          The DIR requested from HSCC documentation for the procurement processes
                    of all equipment under the project. HSCC provided documentation for 16 equip-
                    ment tenders, representing 64 equipment contracts. During the DIR’s onsite visits
                    to laboratories and offices, and after reviewing the project’s equipment consignees
                    list, the DIR learned that the MOHFW had conducted two additional tenders for
                    the procurement of equipment under the FDCBP, involving the award of 13 addi-
                    tional equipment contracts.49 HSCC did not provide the DIR with any procure-
                    ment documentation for these additional 13 contracts.

                          Procurement documentation reviewed by the DIR included invitations to bid
                    (ITBs), bid evaluation reports (BERs), bids, contract award agreements, and cor-
                    respondence from the Bank, the MOHFW, and HSCC officials.

                          HSCC did not provide the DIR with a complete set of documents, limiting the
                    DIR’s review. For example, HSCC did not provide several ITBs, a fundamental
                    document in the procurement process. HSCC also did not provide several bids. In
                    some cases, pages were missing from the BERs. Consequently, in cases where the
                    ITB was missing, the DIR had difficulty verifying the accuracy of BER assertions
                    regarding the responsiveness of certain bidders. In other cases, the DIR detected
                    indicators of fraud and corruption in the procurement of specific equipment but
                    was unable to confirm whether the contract was awarded due to missing docu-
                    mentation.50 The DIR notes that a lack of complete information not only disre-
                    gards the letter and spirit of the IDA credit agreement, but prevents effective proj-
                    ect auditing and raises concerns regarding the accuracy and transparency of the
                    bid evaluation process. 51

                          Nonetheless, despite problems with missing documentation, the DIR was able
                    to conduct a thorough review of the documents received relating to equipment
                    tenders administered under the FDCBP. The DIR selected for review 38 of the 64
                    equipment contracts awarded. The selection of contracts was based on equipment
                    value, with the higher valued contracts chosen over ones with negligible values.

The 38 contracts were awarded in 10 of the 16 equipment tenders, which included
six awarded through ICB procedures and four NCB procedures.52

      The 38 contracts reviewed constituted 59 percent of the 64 contracts for which
the DIR was provided documentation and 49 percent of the total 77 equipment con-
tracts in the FDCBP. On the basis of value, the 38 contracts represent 78 percent of
equipment contracts awarded for which the DIR was provided documentation.53


Implementation of Equipment Contracts
The DIR reviewed the implementation of equipment by conducting field visits
to food and drug laboratories and offices that had received equipment from the
winning contractors to review the condition of the equipment. The DIR’s review
covered laboratories and offices within all five of the DIR states—Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, and Karnataka—and constituted a visit to
every laboratory and office that had received equipment under the FDCBP, a total
of 15 food and drug laboratories and two offices:

                       The DIR conducted its site visits of these locations between March 15 and April
                    12, 2007. The site inspection team consisted of the DIR’s senior investigators and a
                    local consultant for administrative support. A civil engineer accompanied the team
                    to four laboratories to inspect the civil works and some of the equipment.

                       Although the DIR’s review focused on five states, laboratory and office equip-
                    ment has been provided to most Indian states under the FDCBP. The equipment
                    that the DIR inspected at the 15 laboratories and two offices represents 19 percent
                    of the total value of equipment from the 64 contracts for which HSCC provided
                    documentation. The DIR’s inspection focused only on delivered and unpacked
                    equipment. It was unable to inspect equipment still packed in its box due to the
                    project requirement that equipment had to be unpacked in front of the supplier’s
                    engineers, who were not present during the DIR.

                       The DIR also requested and received information from HSCC on the payment
                    status for contracts under the DIR’s review.

Procurement of Civil Works Contracts
The DIR reviewed the procurement of civil works by reviewing documentation
requested from and provided by HSCC which comprised documentation for all
10 civil works tenders, representing 33 civil works contracts. The documentation
included ITBs, BERs, bids, and contract award agreements. The documentation was
generally complete, except for an occasional missing bid from a losing bidder.

   Out of the 33 civil works contracts, the DIR analyzed the following nine con-
tracts for civil works projects in the five DIR states:

Uttar Pradesh
    ■■   Renovation of Central Indian Pharmacopoeia Laboratory, Ghaziabad,
         Uttar Pradesh (CIPL Ghaziabad)

                          The total value of these nine projects (USD 5.0 million) represents 42 percent of
                    the total value of civil works budgeted under the FDCBP (USD 12.1 million).54


                    Implementation of Civil Works
                    The DIR reviewed the implementation of civil works by conducting visits to nine
                    civil works sites, which represent all but one of the civil works sites in the five
                    DIR states. The nine sites also correspond to the nine civil works procurements
                    reviewed by the DIR.

                          The DIR conducted its site visits between March 15 and April 12, 2007. The site
                    inspection team consisted of senior investigators and a local consultant for admin-
                    istrative support. A civil engineer accompanied the team to four of the nine civil
                    works sites to assess the condition of the structures and their construction. For his
                    review of the other five sites not visited, the civil engineer reviewed detailed photos
                    of the structures taken by the inspection team.


                    Complaints
                    The DIR retrieved complaints related to the FDCBP retrieved from the Bank’s IRIS
                    database. The DIR also reviewed complaints received by the World Bank Office
                    Delhi.


                    Project Reports and Assessments
                    The DIR analyzed the project’s reports and assessments by reviewing the
                    Bank’s prior-procurement reviews, a post-procurement review report, and aides-
                    mémoire.55 The DIR reviewed all prior-reviews conducted for equipment and civil
                    works procurements. The DIR was able to locate documentation related to only one
                    post-procurement review.56 The DIR reviewed six FDCBP aides-mémoire.57

Findings
The DIR observed numerous and varied problems in its review of equipment and
civil works procurement under the FDCBP, indicating the presence of fraud and
corruption. In addition, the DIR found significant deficiencies in the implementa-
tion of the equipment and civil works procured under the FDCBP. While only a
full investigation can establish a causal link between the procurement issues and
implementation deficiencies identified by the DIR, the DIR nonetheless notes that
there appears to be a correlation between widespread indicators of favored bidders
in procurement and deficiencies in implementation.

   The DIR also found that procurement officials ineffectively performed their
roles when administering problematic procurements; issuing payments to suppli-
ers for equipment not delivered or for defective equipment; supervising deficient
civil works; and issuing completion certificates for projects not completed. Simi-
larly, Bank project reports and assessments did not identify the widespread nature
of these issues.


Equipment Procurement
In its review of the procurement of equipment under the FDCBP, the DIR detected
a high percentage of problematic procurements indicating that some bidders were
favored over others and suggesting fraud and corruption in the procurement pro-
cess. Of the 38 equipment contracts reviewed, 29 contracts (76 percent) contained
indicators that bidders were favored through problematic procurement processes
(Figure 1). These procurement issues may be the result only of ineffective perfor-
mance by procurement officials in fulfilling their responsibilities. However, there
are indicators of deliberate efforts by procurement officials to favor certain bidders
over others.

      Notably, none of the DIR’s findings suggest the existence of collusive behaviors
or cartels. Suppliers winning contracts varied greatly, and no suspicious patterns in
the award of contracts across tenders were detected. Moreover, the submission of
complaints by bidders against one another supports the conclusion that they were
not collaborating to manipulate the equipment procurement process.58

      The MOHFW installed a “steering committee” to review bid submissions. in
addition to the activity of the steering committee, the DIR noted other issues that
highlight, at a minimum, deficiencies in procurement and might also indicate fraud
and corruption. These findings can generally be classified into four categories:
(1) inconsistent administration of the procurement process in selecting suppliers;
(2) interference with procurement process and procedures; (3) findings with respect
to certain suppliers that were unsupported by the suppliers’ bids; and (4) contract
awards to suppliers that had submitted seemingly fraudulent documents.

      The DIR also found that a high percentage of bidding companies were dis-
qualified in most of the tenders, which can be an additional indicator of corrupt
practices. However, this is tempered by the fact that FDCBP equipment procure-
ments involved highly specialized equipment that several companies, including
many local Indian companies, were not qualified to provide. Thus, the DIR does
not promote this finding as an indicator of corrupt practices on its own.

A.	 The Steering Committee
      Under the FDCBP, HSCC was the project’s PSA which, pursuant to the project
appraisal document (PAD), was to manage the procurement of all civil works, goods,
equipment, furniture, and other items.59 In the project’s procurement process, the
MOHFW normally bases its contract awards on the recommendations of the BEC,
a body that functions under the auspices of the PSA and provides its findings in the
BER. However, in at least three of the tenders in the FDCBP, the MOHFW established
a special committee—the steering committee, now called the Integrated Purchase
Committee—that participated in the procurement process as well, by offering its own
second set of recommendations on bidder responsiveness.

                          1.	 The DIR’s Limited Understanding of the Steering Committee

                          The DIR’s understanding of the precise role of the steering committee and the
                    extent to which that committee participated in the procurement processes is lim-
                    ited, due to the absence of complete documentation describing the steering com-
                    mittee’s work. Based on available documentation, the DIR has learned that the
                    steering committee participated to some extent in at least three tenders: HSCC/
                    PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003,60 HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1D/2003,61 and
                    HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1/2004.62 The DIR has seen no evidence that the
                    steering committee participated in additional tenders, though the possibility of
                    such participation cannot be ruled out.

                          The DIR received information on the steering committee from a letter written
                    by the MOHFW to the Bank in 2004.63 The letter stated that the steering commit-
                    tee’s role in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003 was to examine HSCC’s
                    BER. The letter explained that the steering committee was assisted by two sub-
                    committees, a committee of technical members, and a committee of commercial
                    members. These subcommittees were responsible for determining whether the
                    BER’s technical and commercial findings regarding the bids were accurate.64 The
                    steering committee then reported to the MOHFW on the technical and commer-
                    cial responsiveness of the bidders upon which the MOHFW would make its final
                    decisions on the award of contracts.

                          2.	 The DIR’s Observations Regarding the Steering Committee’s
                          Tendency to Overrule the BER

                          The steering committee’s findings as to bidder responsiveness often differed
                    from the findings in the BER. Furthermore, the MOHFW always based its award
                    of contract on the steering committee’s findings and not the findings in the BER.
                    The fact that the steering committee did not explain the reasoning behind many of
                    these decisions in its minutes and letters raises questions as to the transparency of
                    the procurement process.

      In the tender for which the DIR has the most information on the steering com-
mittee’s role, tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, the DIR determined
that the steering committee overruled the BER in the procurement processes for
10 of the 15 items, or 67 percent of the time.65 Given the lack of relevant documen-
tation, the DIR has been unable to calculate similar data for other tenders in which
the steering committee participated.

      In many instances the steering committee overruled the BER without provid-
ing an explanation for its decision. For example, for the procurement of a High
Performance Liquid Chromatograph in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-
1A/2003, the steering committee overruled the BER recommendation when it
disqualified Perkin Elmer Instruments, a lower bidder that the BER had declared
responsive, and recommended the award of contract to Waters India, a higher bid-
der.66 Accepting the steering committee’s recommendation, the MOHFW awarded
the contract to Waters India.67

      In that procurement, the BER reported the bids of Perkin Elmer Instruments and
Waters India to be technically and commercially responsive.68 The remaining five
bids were declared to be non-responsive.69 The BER recommended the lowest eval-
uated responsive bidder, Perkin Elmer Instruments, for the award of the contract.70
The steering committee then reviewed the bids. Although the BER had reported
Perkin Elmer Instruments to be in compliance with the technical specifications,71
the steering committee’s technical members declared the company to be technically
non-responsive.72 Instead, the steering committee declared the bid of Waters India
to be responsive and approved it for the contract.73

      By declaring Waters India to be responsive while disqualifying Perkin Elmer
Instruments, the steering committee failed to recognize Waters India’s technical
noncompliance. The DIR’s review of the technical evaluation documents reveals
that Waters India did not comply with at least eight parameters.74 Out of these
eight, the Bank itself noted six deviations and requested that the MOHFW clarify

                    Waters India’s bid before awarding the contract.75 The DIR notes that Waters India
                    was asked to clarify but that it did not, and was awarded the contract anyway.76
                    Thus, the steering committee overruled the BER on questionable grounds.

                          The DIR also notes that the Bank hired an independent technical expert con-
                    sultant from the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, who in 2004
                    reviewed findings related to technical specifications in the FDCBP’s equipment
                    procurement process.77 The DIR is unaware of the extent of the consultant’s review
                    but understands that the consultant reviewed the same tender, HSCC/PUR/
                    CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, and e‑mailed his findings to the Bank’s procurement
                    staff.78

                          Although the consultant acknowledges that HSCC did not provide him with
                    all documentation regarding this tender, the consultant also questions the role of
                    the steering committee based on the review he conducted: “What is the point of
                    having HSCC as a procurement agent being paid to do the commercial and techni-
                    cal evaluations (on behalf of MOHFW) if MOHFW has its own parallel system in
                    place repeating the same work?”79 The consultant’s opinions support the concerns
                    that the DIR raises with respect to the steering committee’s role.

                          It is not clear whether or not Bank officials took action based on the consul-
                    tant’s observations regarding the lack of need for a steering committee. The docu-
                    mentation that the DIR has reviewed does not reveal that the Bank has made any
                    follow-up efforts regarding the expert consultant’s important observations.

                          3.	 The Steering Committee’s Questionable Findings

                          In addition to the DIR’s observation that the steering committee often over-
                    ruled the BER in a non-transparent way, the DIR found two specific examples of
                    conclusions made by the steering committee that more strongly suggest its ten-
                    dency to favor one bidder over another.

                       The Steering Committee Reached Inconsistent Findings with Respect to
                    Two Bidders Whose Levels of Bid Responsiveness Were Similar, Disqualify-
                    ing One Bidder While Recommending the Contract to the Other. For the pro-
                    curement of an HPLC isocratic system with 10 columns, two integrators, and one
                    degassor in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, the steering committee

reached a conclusion that differed from the BER’s recommendation in a way that
favored a higher bidder, Waters India, over a lower bidder, Indtech Analytical,
even though both bidders’ proposals had similar discrepancies with the required
tender criteria.80

      The BER had reported the bids of Thermo Finnigan, Indtech Analytical, and
Waters India to be technically and commercially responsive.81 It declared the
remaining six bids to be non-responsive.82 The BER recommended the lowest eval-
uated responsive bidder, Thermo Finnigan, for the award of contract.83

      The steering committee’s technical members then examined the BER and
reported that Thermo Finnigan’s bid was technically non-responsive with respect
to five criteria and that Waters India and Indtech Analytical substantially complied
with the technical specifications.84 For Indtech Analytical the technical members
stated that the bid was “substantially responsive except for multi-wavelength option
and fuses, loops, tubes, spanners and syringes not mentioned.”85 For Waters India the
technical members stated that the bid was “substantially complying to the require-
ment except that there is a provision for dual-wavelength as against requirement
of multi-wavelength operation besides quoted for one number of Hamilton micro-
liter syringe as against requirement of two.”86 The steering committee’s technical
members thus overruled the BER’s recommendation in finding Thermo Finnigan
to be non-responsive and also found that Waters India and Indtech Analytical were
in substantial compliance with the bid requirements despite minor discrepancies
between their bids and the required technical criteria.

      The steering committee held detailed discussions four days later on the techni-
cal members’ observations.87 According to the steering committee’s minutes, the
technical members changed their assessment of Indtech Analytical’s bid in their
meeting. Although the technical members had approved the company’s techni-
cal specifications as substantially responsive four days earlier, they now concluded
that the company’s bid could be disregarded because it did not meet an important
parameter—the company had offered to supply only nine syringes instead of the

                    required 11.88 Based on the technical members’ comments, the steering committee
                    chose not to seek clarification from Indtech Analytical on its minor deviations and
                    declared the company to be non-responsive.89

                          The steering committee did not provide any explanation for why it disqualified
                    Indtech Analytical based on such a minor discrepancy in its bid while at the same
                    time recommending the award of the contract to Waters India, another company
                    with a similar minor discrepancy.90 In contrast to its treatment of Indtech Ana-
                    lytical, the steering committee chose to seek clarification from Waters India on its
                    issues of wavelength type and number of syringes.91 Waters India clarified its speci-
                    fications, and the steering committee approved Waters India for the award of the
                    contract.92 The fact that the steering committee chose to seek clarifications from
                    Waters India, a higher bidder by approximately USD 35,000, and not from Indtech
                    Analytical supports the unusual nature of the steering committee’s findings.

                          Based on documentation in the record, it appears that the steering committee’s
                    change in assessment of Indtech Analytical from substantially responsive to non-
                    responsive might be due to pressure placed on the technical members to take a
                    new position. Supporting this theory is a complaint from International Engineers
                    discussing the procurement process for this tender in general.93 The complainant
                    alleges problems with HSCC and the steering committee, claiming, among other
                    things, that Dr. S. K. Talwar, the head of the technical committee, was forced to
                    withdraw award recommendations for certain bidders because of pressure from
                    the Chief General Manager (Procurement), HSCC, Mr. M. P. Gupta.94 Although
                    only a full investigation can establish the merits of this allegation, the complaint
                    does corroborate the suspicious nature of the technical members’ change in find-
                    ings. It is unclear from the documentation reviewed whether the Bank took any
                    follow-up action on this complaint.

                        The Steering Committee Overruled the BER Even When the Same Individu-
                    als Served on Both the BEC and the Steering Committee. For the procurement
                    of Microwave Digestion Units in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1D/2003,
                    the BER declared bidder CEM Corporation to be non-responsive, and the steering
                    committee reversed this decision and awarded the contract to the company. Note-

worthy was the fact that two of the individuals serving on both the BEC and the
steering committee reversed, while sitting on the steering committee, their previous
conclusions on CEM Corporation’s responsiveness as participants of the BEC.

       While serving as technical experts on the BEC, Dr. S. K. Talwar and
Mr. D. S. Rawat examined the technical specifications submitted by the bidders
and expressed concerns associated with CEM Corporation’s bid: “M/s CEM Cor-
poration, USA has quoted for Mars 5 model. It is observed that there are two cata-
logues attached with the bid for the same model but with different specifications.
The bidder has included in their quotation the specified word by word as included
in the tender. Though, they are not corroborated by the catalogues attached there-
with. However, the maximum pressure as included in the catalogue is 800 PSI as
against the requirement of 1450 PSI in the control vessel.”95 Based on this finding,
the BER reported the bid of CEM Corporation to be technically non-responsive.96
It also reported the bids of Milestone Microwave Laboratory Systems and Perkin
Elmer Instruments to be technically and commercially responsive, recommend-
ing that the contract be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, Mile-
stone Microwave Laboratory System.97

       The steering committee then considered the technical experts’ assessment and
rejected the BER recommendation.98 The steering committee approved CEM Cor-
poration for the contract award.99 Addressing the contradictions in CEM Corpo-
ration’s bid that had been identified by the BEC’s technical experts, the steering
committee chose to rely on the document that the company had signed in its sub-
mission.100 To support this approach, the steering committee referred to a meeting
where it had been presented with similar evidence and where it had decided that
“since the catalogue is not signed by the firm the assessment [sic] be made on the
basis of the offer submitted by the firm, which is duly signed.”101 To address the
fact that CEM Corporation’s quotation in its signed document reflected “word by
word” the tender specifications, which is unusual in a highly technical procure-
ment, the steering committee stated that it had instructed HSCC to seek clarifica-
tions from the firm regarding the accuracy of its quotation, that HSCC had sought
clarifications, and that the company had confirmed that its offered model fully met

                    all the criteria.102 The DIR has not been made aware of evidence that clarifications
                    were actually sought and provided. Based on the steering committee’s analysis, the
                    MOHFW awarded the contract to CEM Corporation.103

                           The DIR found that technical experts Dr. Talwar and Mr. Rawat, in addition to
                    serving as members of the BEC, also served as members of the steering commit-
                    tee for this procurement.104 Thus, these same technical experts, who had initially
                    declared CEM Corporation as technically non-responsive, now signed the steer-
                    ing committee minutes endorsing the steering committee’s decision to award the
                    contract to CEM Corporation.105 While only a full investigation can determine
                    whether HSCC indeed received clarifications from CEM Corporation regarding
                    the accuracy of its bid submission assertions, which would arguably justify the
                    technical experts’ change in findings, the fact that neither the steering committee
                    nor HSCC included such important clarification documents in the bid materials is
                    an indicator of suspicious behavior in this procurement process.

                           Corroborating the unusual nature of the conflicting decisions by the technical
                    experts, the DIR notes that International Engineers, a company that claimed not
                    to participate in the tenders out of concern for the integrity of the procurement
                    process, submitted complaints regarding the participation of Dr. Talwar, one of
                    the technical experts.106 The complaints allege that Dr. Talwar had provided dis-
                    senting views in other procurement processes and that these views were generally
                    ignored by the MOHFW.107 In one complaint International Engineers alleged that
                    Dr. Talwar had withdrawn his recommendation from one procurement in writing
                    and that the MOHFW wrongly failed to take notice of this withdrawal.108 The com-
                    plaint cited this irregularity as one example of “manipulations” and “hoodwink-
                    ing” in the procurement process.109 A second complaint submitted by the same
                    company urged the authorities to reevaluate this procurement process and stated:
                    “We are confident that after a fresh comparison is done the manipulation would
                    emerge to strongly support the reason of withdrawal of recommendations by Dr.
                    Talwar.”110 The fact that International Engineers did not attempt to participate in

the procurement processes adds an element of merit to its allegations—unlike
other complainants, this company was not a bidder that submitted a complaint
after it had already lost a bidding round.

       The DIR notes that the signature block of Dr. Talwar in the steering committee
minutes for this tender contains two signatures. Alongside one of his signatures
Dr. Talwar wrote “Refer to my note dt-15/3/04.”111 The DIR has not been provided
with, or reviewed, Dr. Talwar’s note of March 15, 2004, and the exact nature of this
note is unknown. However, that Dr. Talwar reached contradictory findings with
respect to the responsiveness of CEM Corporation, that complaints were submit-
ted alleging that the MOHFW ignored Dr. Talwar’s dissents in other procurements,
and that Dr. Talwar’s signature appears to be qualified are indicators that Dr. Tal-
war’s endorsement of the steering committee’s findings might not be voluntary.

       Based on these examples of irregularities in the equipment procurement pro-
cess related to the role of the steering committee, it appears that certain bidders
have been favored in the award of contracts.

B.	Other Indicators of Preferential Treatment of Suppliers
       In addition to the participation of a steering committee that often overruled the
BER recommendations, the DIR identified numerous other indicators of fraud and
corruption where certain suppliers received preferential treatment. These varied
indicators can generally be classified into four categories: (1) inconsistent adminis-
tration of the procurement process in selecting suppliers; (2) interference with pro-
curement processes and procedures; (3) findings with respect to certain suppliers
that were unsupported by the suppliers’ bids; and (4) contract awards to suppliers
that had submitted seemingly fraudulent documents.

       1.	 Inconsistent Administration of the Procurement Process

       The DIR’s review of equipment procurement under the FDCBP revealed that
HSCC and the MOHFW’s steering committee often administered the procurement
process inconsistently with respect to different suppliers. For example, the DIR
identified situations where HSCC sought clarification from one bidder that was
in substantial compliance with the required specifications and not from another
lower bidder that was also in substantial compliance with the required specifica-
tions, recommending the higher bidder for the contract. In other instances HSCC
and/or the steering committee reached inconsistent findings as to whether a spe-
cific item met the MOHFW’s specification requirements.

                       HSCC Made Inconsistent Requests for Clarifications from Substantially
                    Responsive Bidders within the Same Procurement. Pursuant to Bank guidelines,
                    HSCC has the discretion to seek clarifications from bidders in order to seek addi-
                    tional information and determine whether the bidders’ proposals to supply equip-
                    ment meet the specifications required by the MOHFW. Bank guideline 2.45 states
                    that “the Borrower shall ask bidders for clarification needed to evaluate their bids.”112
                    In order for the clarification to be proper, the bid must already be substantially
                    responsive. Bidders with major deviations are automatically disqualified.113

                           In the procurement of equipment under the FDCBP, HSCC and/or the steering
                    committee at times sought clarifications from substantially responsive bidders but
                    did so in an inconsistent manner, which had the effect of favoring some bidders
                    that had the opportunity to bring their proposals into compliance and disfavoring
                    other bidders that were not afforded such an opportunity. Particularly egregious
                    examples of this inconsistent administration of the procurement process were
                    instances where HSCC and/or the steering committee inconsistently sought clari-
                    fications within the same procurement process for the same item.

                           For example, for the procurement of an HPLC isocratic system with 10 columns,
                    two integrators, and one degassor in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003,
                    though two bidders had minor deficiencies in their bids, the steering committee
                    chose to seek clarifications from Waters India, a higher bidder, and not from Indtech
                    Analytical, a lower bidder.114 As discussed in the previous section on the steering
                    committee, for this procurement the BER reported the bids of Thermo Finnigan,
                    Indtech Analytical, and Waters India to be technically and commercially responsive
                    and recommended the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, Thermo Finnigan, for
                    the award of contract. 115 The steering committee’s technical members then over-
                    ruled the BER’s recommendation in finding that Thermo Finnigan’s bid was tech-
                    nically non-responsive and that Waters India and Indtech Analytical substantially
                    complied with the technical specifications despite minor discrepancies between
                    their bids and the required technical criteria.116

                           Based on the technical members’ comments, the steering committee chose not
                    to seek clarification from Indtech Analytical and declared the company to be non-

responsive.117 With respect to Waters India the steering committee chose to seek
clarification for the deficiencies identified by the technical members.118 Waters
India submitted a letter clarifying that its specifications were in compliance with
the tender.119 Based on this clarification the steering committee approved the
award of the contract to Waters India. Thus, the steering committee appears to
have applied inconsistent standards in its assessment of two substantially respon-
sive bidders, choosing to seek clarification for Waters India and recommending
that Waters India receive the award, while not seeking clarification for Indtech
Analytical, the lower bidder.

   HSCC Reached Inconsistent Findings as to Whether a Specific Item Met
Specification Requirements. In several instances HSCC determined that a specific
item model did not meet the required specifications and, in another tender requir-
ing the same specifications, determined that the exact same model of equipment
did meet the specifications. The model in each instance, though offered in a later
year, was the exact same product as the model offered in the earlier tender. Such
inconsistency could be attributed to the fact that HSCC was simply not perform-
ing its responsibilities effectively, but is, at a minimum, unusual and questionable.

       For example, while the BER found that Shimadzu Asia Pacific’s model 2010
was technically non-responsive under a 2003 tender for a gas chromatograph mass
spectrophotometer, the same model was declared technically responsive in a 2004
tender.120 The tender technical specifications for this item under both tenders were
exactly the same.121 Two of the three technical experts, Dr. S. K. Handa and D. S.
Rawat, who assessed the technical specifications for one tender had also assessed
the technical specifications of this item in the other tender.122 The inconsistency
calls into question one of the experts’ assessments of model 2010.123

       The DIR also detected inconsistent findings with respect to the same item of
equipment in the procurement of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a
hydride generator mercury vapor generator (AAS) in a 2003 tender and a 2005 ten-

                    non-responsive in the 2003 tender and technically responsive in the 2005 tender.125
                    In the 2005 tender for this item Thermo Electron Corporation was also declared
                    the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.126 All technical specifications required for
                    this item in the 2003 tender were identical to the technical specifications required
                    for this item in the 2005 tender.127 In both tenders Thermo Electron Corporation
                    submitted bids to supply the exact same model.128 Such inconsistent findings sug-
                    gest favoritism in the procurement process.

                           The DIR also identified similar inconsistent treatment for the procurement of
                    a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer in a 2003 tender and a
                    2004 tender.129 In both tenders the technical criteria required for the FT-IR spec-
                    trophotometer was identical.130 For both tenders Perkin Elmer Instruments quoted
                    the same model.131 The BER’s technical evaluation statement in the 2004 tender
                    was prepared by Dr. Handa, Mr. Rawat, and Dr. G. N. Singh.132 Except for Dr.
                    Singh, the other two technical experts also served as the steering committee’s tech-
                    nical members in the 2003 tender for this item.133 Despite the similarities of the
                    procurement of this item in both tenders, Perkin Elmer Instruments was declared
                    technically non-responsive in the 2003 tender and technically responsive in the
                    2004 tender, raising questions as to the consistency of the process.134

                           In the 2003 and 2004 tenders for the FT-IR spectrophotometer, the technical

tender for this item Perkin Elmer Instruments and Shimadzu’s products were both
declared technically non-responsive because the technical information about the
products in the supporting product literature did not comply with the technical
parameters of the tender.135 However, in the 2004 tender for this item the techni-
cal experts found these same companies’ products to be technically compliant by
relying only on the technical specifications that the companies provided in their
compliance statements. In the 2004 tender the technical experts did not choose to
consider any supporting literature to ensure that the companies’ compliance state-
ments were accurate.136

       In the procurement of a micro array in a 2004 tender, the steering committee’s
technical members also relied only on DSS Imagetech’s compliance statement in
finding that several technical parameters were met.137 The DIR reviewed the bid-
der’s corresponding catalogue and found that a number of the required criteria in
the procurement were in fact not met by the bidder, despite the bidder’s claims of
compliance in its compliance statement.138 In a 2003 tender for this item requir-
ing the same technical specifications and involving two BEC members that were
technical members in the 2004 tender, DSS Imagetech had submitted a bid for
the exact same item model.139 In that tender the BER and the steering committee
concluded that the model was technically non-responsive with respect to several
parameters, including the ones that the DIR had found were not met in the 2004
tender.140 Had the technical members consulted the company’s catalogue in the
2004 tender, as they had done in the earlier tender, they would likely have con-
cluded that DSS Imagetech was technically non-responsive. Instead, the steering
committee recommended DSS Imagetech for the award in the 2004 tender, and the
MOHFW awarded the contract to the company.141

       On January 11, 2006, and February 8, 2006, Perkin Elmer India wrote letters
to the MOHFW, copying HSCC and the Bank.142 In its letters Perkin Elmer India
alleged that the bid of DSS Imagetech had major deviations, corroborating the

                    issues that the DIR has detected. The Bank forwarded Perkin Elmer India’s let-
                    ters to the MOHFW and HSCC on January 30, 2006, and February 27, 2006, and
                    requested that the MOHFW take necessary action.143 The MOHFW awarded the
                    contract to DSS Imagetech, despite the complaints filed by Perkin Elmer India and
                    despite the Bank’s request for necessary action.144 The DIR was unable to deter-
                    mine whether the Bank has followed up on the two complaints submitted by Per-
                    kin Elmer India.

                           2.	 Interference with the Procurement Processes and Procedures

                           The DIR discovered that in several instances of equipment procurement under
                    the FDCBP, the MOHFW and HSCC interfered with the standard procurement
                    processes and procedures in ways that appeared to favor some bidders over others.

                       Procurement Officials Allowed Unreasonable Delays in the Award of Con-
                    tracts. Bank guidelines 2.56 and 2.58 state that the borrower shall complete its
                    evaluation of bids and award the contracts within the initial period of bid validity
                    so that extensions are not necessary.145 Bank guideline 2.56 further states that exten-
                    sions of bid validity, if justified by exceptional circumstances, shall be requested in
                    writing from all bidders before the expiration date.146 Despite these requirements,
                    the DIR found that the MOHFW and HSCC took exceptionally long periods of
                    time to evaluate bids and award contracts to selected suppliers.

                           The DIR recognizes that long delays in the procurement process might be
                    attributable to many different factors. Isolated delays could be due to communica-
                    tion difficulties with bidders, transportation complications for procurement offi-
                    cials, or technical complexities for certain items. However, considerable patterns
                    of long delays that repeatedly occurred over a significant period of time may be
                    an indicator of possible corruption in the procurement process. Repeated delays
                    provide procurement officials and bidders with time to devise and implement cor-
                    ruption schemes if the officials and bidders are prone to such actions. Such delays
                    have occurred repeatedly under the FDCBP, meriting closer attention.

                           For example, in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/NCB-1C/2003, there was a
                    time difference of almost two years between the bid opening date and the con-
                    tract award dates.147 In tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, HSCC sub-

mitted the BER to the MOHFW, and for all contracts in the tender, an average
of almost a year passed before the steering committee concluded its review and
the MOHFW signed the contracts with the winning bidders.148 In tender HSCC/
PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1B/2003, HSCC did not submit the BER until five and a half
months after it opened and began evaluating the bids.149 For one item in that ­
                                                                              tender
the contract was awarded about 10 months after the bids were submitted and five
months after the BER was issued.150 For two items in that tender the contracts
were awarded approximately two years after the bids were submitted and almost
one and a half years after the BER was issued.151 The DIR did not see any evidence
that the MOHFW was justified in delaying the award of contracts in any of these
tenders or that procurement officials requested in writing that bidders agree to an
extension, pursuant to Bank guidelines.

   Procurement Officials Changed the Bidding Deadlines and Requirements
after the Procurement Process Had Begun. In tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/
ICB-1A/2003, HSCC changed the bid submission deadline and the required tech-
nical specifications after the bidding process had already begun. HSCC extended
the bid submission deadline from December 17, 2003, to January 14, 2004.152 Then
on January 8, 2004, HSCC wrote to all prospective bidders with information that
the technical specifications for eight items had been amended.153 The change in
technical specifications just six days prior to the submission of bids raises the con-
cern that the amendment was done to favor certain bidders by tailoring required
specifications to the specifications of certain bidders’ products. The Bank raised
similar concerns with respect to the narrowness of the altered specifications:
“However, we are a little uneasy that the . . . specification might not have been suf-
ficiently generic to ensure fair competition – see for example conformity of certain
design features of the Anchrom instrument with the technical specifications in
the bid document viz, S. Nos. A7, D3, D9, D12, D13. The last one, D13, is more
precise than coincidence might explain.”154 Despite this expression of concern, the

                    Bank did not object to the award of the contract to Anchrom Enterprises.155 Cor-
                    roborating this indicator, the DIR has also reviewed a complaint alleging that this
                    procurement process was drawn in a manner to favor predetermined companies
                    or brands of products.156 The DIR was unable to determine whether the Bank has
                    followed up on this complaint.

                       Procurement Officials Changed the Item Categories in the Middle of the
                    Procurement Process. The MOHFW also altered two procurement processes for
                    two separate items, a UV-Vis spectrophotometer for food safety and a UV-Vis
                    spectrophotometer for the quality control of drugs, by combining the two procure-
                    ments into one procurement process after the processes had already begun and
                    after bids had already been reviewed. The DIR found no justifiable basis for the
                    alteration, and the change favored one bidder, Perkin Elmer Instruments, which
                    would have otherwise been disqualified.157

                           In that tender the BEC had evaluated the bids for the UV-Vis spectrophotom-
                    eter for food safety and had concluded that only Shimadzu Asia Pacific, GBC Sci-
                    entific Equipment, and Hitachi Hi-Technologies were technically and commercially
                    responsive.158 The BER had declared that the bid of Perkin Elmer Instruments was
                    technically non-responsive.159 The BER’s comparative statement on technical evalua-
                    tion noted Perkin Elmer Instruments’ deviations.160 The BER recommended the low-
                    est evaluated responsive bidder, Shimadzu Asia Pacific, for the award of contract.161

                           For the second item, the UV-Vis spectrophotometer for the quality control of
                    drugs, the BER had reported that only Perkin Elmer Instruments and Shimadzu
                    Asia Pacific were technically and commercially responsive.162 Although Perkin
                    Elmer Instruments was the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, the BER declared
                    that Perkin Elmer Instruments did not meet the post-qualification criteria requir-
                    ing sales of the item in the last three years—the post-qualification statement
                    reports that Perkin Elmer Instruments submitted proof of sales only for the years
                    1999–2000 and therefore did not satisfy the criteria.163 On the basis of this infor-

mation, the BER recommended the next lowest evaluated responsive bidder, Shi-
madzu Asia Pacific, for the contract.164

       Despite the BER’s recommendation to award both contracts to Shimadzu
Asia Pacific, the MOHFW did not do so. Instead, the MOHFW chose to combine
the contracts and award only one contract to Perkin Elmer Instruments.165 The
MOHFW stated in a letter to the Bank that “since the specification of the equip-
ment at S. No. 14 and 15 required for Food and Drug Labs [which were the two
UV-Vis spectrophotometer items at issue] are the same, the Committee decided to
procure the equipment from the lowest bidder of the two items.”166 The DIR has
determined that contrary to what is stated in the MOHFW’s letter, significant dif-
ferences exist between the technical specifications of the two items.167

       Despite the fact that the BER had disqualified Perkin Elmer Instruments for
each of the two items, the MOHFW awarded the contract to Perkin Elmer Instru-
ments without an explanation.168 The DIR reviewed the bid submissions of Per-
kin Elmer Instruments and agreed with the BER’s conclusions that the company’s
specifications did not comply with the specifications required for the UV-Vis spec-
trophotometer for food safety169 and that the company’s performance statement
did not satisfy the post-qualification criteria for the UV-Vis spectrophotometer for
the quality control of drugs.170 The MOHFW’s decision to override the seemingly
valid evaluation in the BER is an indicator that Perkin Elmer Instruments was
favored in the procurement process. The DIR has seen no evidence that the Bank
objected to the MOHFW’s questionable decisions.

   Procurement Officials Appear to Have Narrowly Drafted a Tender to Favor
a Certain Bidder. Provision 2.19 of the Bank guidelines states: “Standards and
technical specifications quoted in bidding documents shall promote the broadest
possible competition, while assuring the critical performance or other require-
ments for the goods and/or works under procurement.”171 However, in some cases
the narrowness of the specifications appeared to stifle competition rather than
promote it.

                           For example, for the procurement of a rotary vacuum evaporator in tender
                    HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-2/2004, the BER reported that the bids of York Sci-
                    entific Industries and Goel Scientific Glass Works were technically and commer-
                    cially responsive.172 The BER declared the bids of the remaining four bidders to be
                    non-responsive.173 Based on the BER’s recommendation, the MOHFW awarded the
                    contract to York Scientific Industries, the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.174

                           York Scientific Industries had submitted a leaflet with its bid that contained a
                    list of its item’s technical specifications.175 The DIR compared the specifications in
                    the leaflet against the required specifications in the tender document and found
                    the two sets of specifications to be almost identical.176 For example, the tender doc-
                    ument required and the company’s leaflet provided that the product have a speed
                    range that was 20 rpm to 180 rpm and that the temperature control range be ambi-
                    ent temperature +5 degrees Celsius to +90 degrees Celsius.177 Copies of the tender
                    specifications and the company’s leaflet are in Figure 3, showing the unusually
                    identical nature of how the technical specifications were described.

       The similarities in specifications suggest that HSCC’s technical committee,
the body that authored the technical specifications, directly copied the specifica-
tions listed on York Scientific Industries’ pre-produced leaflet. If so, York Scientific
Industries was given an improper advantage over other bidders in the procure-
ment process.

       3.	 Unsupported Findings in the Procurement Process

       The DIR detected several instances in the bid evaluation process where pro-
curement officials reached findings unsupported by the documents in the under­
lying bids. Such findings suggest that certain bidders were favored in the process.

   Procurement Officials Selected Some Bidders for Contracts Even Though the
Bidders Did Not Comply with the Procurement’s Post-qualification ­  Criteria,
Thereby Failing to Demonstrate Capacity to Perform. In tender HSCC/PUR/
CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, the tender document stated that “the bidder shall fur-
nish the information on past supplies and their satisfactory performance in the
pro forma given under Section VIII.”178 The tender document further stated that
“bidders shall invariably furnish documentary evidence (Client’s Certificates) in
support of the satisfactory supply of the equipment as specified above.”179 But the
procurement officials ignored these criteria and recommended some bidders for
the contract even though they had not submitted performance statements or per-
formance certificates. For example, for the procurement of an AAS, GBC Scientific
Equipment did not submit any performance certificates. Nonetheless, the steering
committee approved the company for the contract award.180 For the procurement
of a nuclear magnetic resonance in the tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1D,
Bruker BioSpin did not submit any performance certificates and was awarded the
contract.181

       This practice seems particularly suspicious in light of the fact that Mr. Usmani
and Mr. Suri, two of the BEC members under tenders HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/
ICB-IA/2003 and HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1D, disqualified some bidders in
other tenders for not submitting performance statements and/or performance
certificates, apparently without seeking clarification, even though the BEC had

                    declared these bidders to be the lowest evaluated responsive bidders.182 At the same
                    time, the BEC members sought clarification on post-qualification criteria from
                    higher bidders and recommended the higher bidders for the contracts after they
                    clarified their bid submissions.183

                       Procurement Officials Disqualified Some Bidders on Post-qualification
                    Grounds Even Though It Appeared That the Bidders Met, or Could Have Met,
                    the Post-qualification Criteria. For example, in the procurement processes for
                    four of the five items in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/NCB-1C/2003, a lower
                    evaluated bidder, though technically and commercially responsive, was disquali-
                    fied for not complying with the post-qualification criteria, and the BER instead
                    recommended that Yorco Sales be awarded the contract for all four items. The
                    contracts were approved by the MOHFW. The DIR’s review of the procurement
                    documents in these cases suggests that the lower bidders did in fact meet, or could
                    have met, the post-qualification criteria in each case.

                           For the first item, a sterilizer horizontal autoclave, the BER reported Yorco Sales
                    and Enkay Enterprises to be technically and commercially responsive.184 HSCC
                    then disqualified Enkay Enterprises, whose bid price was lower than that of Yorco
                    Sales, for not meeting the post-qualification criteria. The BER reported that Enkay
                    Enterprises had not complied with post-qualification parameter 1.a., requiring
                    that the bidder prove that it had supplied at least 80 percent of the quantity in the
                    last three years and that it had been in continuous business of manufacturing the
                    specified products, as well as post-qualification parameter 3.iv., requiring that the
                    bidder submit client certificates in support of the satisfactory supply of the equip-
                    ment.185 The BER reported that procurement officials sought clarifications from
                    Enkay Enterprises to confirm whether the company could submit purchase orders

and client certificates establishing its capacity to perform but that the company did
not respond: “Order Copies & respective client certificates were asked from M/s
Yorco Sales Pvt. Ltd., M/s Enkay Enterprises & M/s S.M. Scientific Instruments
Pvt. Ltd, only M/s Yorco Sales Pvt. Ltd. responded.”186

       The DIR contacted the administrator of Enkay Enterprises, Mr. Varun Kumar,
on August 14, 2007, to confirm if procurement officials indeed sought clarifica-
tions from the company. Mr. Kumar stated that HSCC never contacted the com-
pany for any clarification. Mr. Kumar further asserted that in his opinion HSCC
generally made its decisions on the award of contracts first and then conformed its
procurement analysis to those decisions.187

       The DIR reviewed Enkay Enterprises’ bid and found indicators that in fact the
company did comply with post-qualification parameter 1.a. The company’s perfor-
mance statement shows that it supplied 10 items on November 25, 2002, to Hitech
Engineering Enterprises, an amount that exceeded the 80 percent threshold within
the last three years.188 This information also demonstrates that the company was
in the continuous business of manufacturing the specified product. With respect
to post-qualification parameter 3.iv., Enkay Enterprises claims in its performance
statement that had the company been asked to provide client certificates show-
ing the satisfactory supply of the equipment, it could have done so for its sales to
Hitech Engineering Enterprises.189

       Thus, procurement officials disqualified the lower bidder for the contract on
questionable grounds regarding the post-qualification criteria, and procurement
officials asserted that clarifications were sought from the disqualified bidder when
the DIR’s research suggests that this was not the case.

       In the same tender HSCC similarly disqualified another company, S. M. Sci-
entific, on similar post-qualification grounds in the procurement of three other
items, a hot air oven, an oven universal, and a vacuum oven with vacuum pump.190
In each case HSCC claimed that clarifications had been sought from the company
and that the company did not respond to the requests.191 The DIR has not con-
firmed whether this assertion is accurate or not. As a result of the disqualifications,

                    the MOHFW awarded the contracts instead to Yorco Sales, a higher bidder, in all
                    three cases.192

                           In the case of the hot air oven, the DIR reviewed the bid submitted by the dis-
                    qualified bidder S.M. Scientific,193 and the documents appear to contradict the
                    BER’s conclusion that the post-qualification criteria were not met. The company’s
                    performance statement shows that it supplied more than 80 percent of the quantity
                    of the product in the previous three years—the required percentage in the bidding
                    document to demonstrate capacity to perform.194 A review of the company’s bid also
                    suggests that HSCC could easily have confirmed that the information regarding
                    prior sales in the company’s performance statements was correct: the performance
                    statements included the names and addresses of the company’s clients and the order
                    numbers and delivery dates for the sales.195 This information also demonstrates that
                    the company was in the continuous business of manufacturing the specified prod-
                    uct. Apparently, despite these facts HSCC did not choose to seek such clarification
                    to determine whether the lower bidder complied with the procurement require-
                    ments. S. M. Scientific’s deemed failure to fully comply with all post-qualification
                    criteria is also unusual, given that the company had successfully bid on five other
                    items in other tenders and was awarded the contracts.196

                           Thus, HSCC’s disqualification of two companies with lower bid prices than
                    Yorco Sales on post-qualification grounds when the companies’ bids could have
                    been clarified calls into question the procurement process to favor Yorco Sales.

                      Procurement Officials Awarded Contracts to Some Bidders Even Though
                    There Was a Substantial Lack of Thoroughness to Their Bid Packages. For
                    example, for the procurement of a dissolution apparatus with auto samplers in ten-
                    der HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1B/2003, the BER recommended Electrolab, the
                    lowest evaluated responsive bidder, for the contract, and the MOHFW awarded
                    the contract to the company.197 The DIR reviewed the bid submitted by Electrolab,
                    and the review shows that the documentation included in the company’s bid is

limited and lacks detail, compared with the bids that are regularly submitted in
FDCBP procurement processes.198 For example, while bids usually include hun-
dreds of pages,199 Electrolab’s bid was only 14 pages.200 Although the BER reports
that the company was asked to furnish additional documents to supplement its
bid,201 the DIR has seen no evidence that Electrolab has done so. This is a potential
indicator of flaws in the procurement process.

   Procurement Officials Reached Findings as to Whether or Not a Bidder’s
Item Met Required Specifications That Were Unsupported by the Bidder’s
Underlying Documentation. In some cases bidders were disqualified for not
complying with specification requirements even though their specifications were
in compliance, with the effect of favoring other bidders. For example, for the pro-
curement of a high-pressure liquid chromatograph mass spectrophotometer in
tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, the lowest bidder, Shimadzu, was
disqualified for technical non-compliance, even though the company claimed in
its compliance statement to have satisfied all technical criteria and the DIR’s review
reveals that the company was in compliance with at least two of the parameters
that were found to be not met.202 Parameter 12 required the bidder’s product to
include a workstation with “32 bit Windows NT based with built-in capability for
auto start up and shut down, self diagnostic, auto tuning and peek [sic] monitoring
facility.”203 The BER concluded that for this parameter Shimadzu did not provide
any information showing that its product met this requirement.204 However, the
DIR’s review of Shimadzu’s bid reveals that the company did in fact demonstrate
that its product met these requirements.205 Parameter 23 required that the prod-
uct’s column oven have an ambient range from –15 degrees Celsius to –60 degrees
Celsius.206 The BER mistakenly reported that Shimadzu’s product had a range of
4–80 degrees Celsius when it was actually –15 degrees Celsius to –60 degrees Cel-
sius.207 However, in Shimadzu’s compliance statement the bidder provided tech-

                    nical information demonstrating that it did comply with all eight parameters.208
                    Thus, the disqualification of Shimadzu, the lowest bidder, was questionable and
                    merits attention.

                       In Some Cases, Procurement Officials Found a Bidder to Be Technically
                    Responsive and Recommended It for the Contract and the MOHFW Endorsed
                    the Finding and Awarded the Contract to the Company Even Though the Bid-
                    der Had Not Provided Supporting Information for Several Technical Parame-
                    ters. For example, for the procurement of an ion chromatograph in tender HSCC/
                    PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, Indtech Analytical, a higher bidder that did not
                    comply with all technical criteria, was awarded the contract over the lowest bid-
                    der, Waters India, whose technical compliance was also unclear. The BER declared
                    that only Indtech Analytical was technically and commercially responsive, recom-
                    mending it for the contract, and declared Waters India to be non-responsive on
                    two technical parameters.209 However, the DIR’s review of the BER’s comparison
                    statement on the technical evaluation of the bids reveals that Indtech Analytical
                    had not provided any information for eight parameters and had provided informa-
                    tion for five product specifications that did not meet their respective parameters.210
                    The BER noted these many deviations but chose to ignore them in recommending
                    Indtech Analytical for the contract.

                           In contrast to the 13 parameter deviations that the BER found for Indtech Ana-
                    lytical, the BER noted only two technical parameter deviations for Waters India,
                    the lowest bidder.211 Rather than seek clarifications from Waters India for these
                    two parameters, the BER declared that Waters India was non-responsive.212 The
                    MOHFW endorsed the BER’s recommendation to award the contract to Indtech
                    Analytical.213 Thus, Indtech Analytical, a higher bidder, appears to have been
                    favored in the procurement process.

the basis of winning bids. In some cases, complaints corroborate the questionable
nature of these documents.

   Performance Certificates Submitted by Winning Bidders Appear to Be
Forged. For example, in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/2005/ICB/A, Elico, the
winning bidder, submitted a performance certificate issued by Uttaranchal Scien-
tifics and Chemicals (Uttaranchal) as part of its bid.214 The owner of Uttaranchal
later submitted a complaint to HSCC on June 3, 2006, alleging that the perfor-
mance certificate submitted by Elico in Uttaranchal’s name was “totally fraud and
entirely fabricated.”215 The owner further alleged that “there was not a si[n]gle
order on behalf of our company for spectroflourimeter [sic] in our entire business
with Elico.”216 On November 13, 2006, Parveen Prakash, a representative of Marsha
Enterprises, also submitted a complaint letter to HSCC alleging that Elico had pro-
vided false performance certificates, including one from Uttaranchal Scientifics
and Chemicals.217 Given that Marsha Enterprises was not a bidder in this procure-
ment, it is unclear why its representative submitted a complaint. In his complaint,
Mr. Prakash alleged that Elico had submitted performance certificates from end
users that were neither laboratories nor manufacturers of food and drug items.218

       On January 5, 2007, the MOHFW responded to Mr. Prakash, stating that
Uttaranchal had confirmed in letters dated July 12 and September 7, 2006, that the
company had indeed received equipment from Elico.219 The MOHFW also stated
its belief that “the hand written letter dated 03.06.2006 from M/s Uttaranchal Sci-
entific and Chemicals containing an opposite view to the above two separate let-
ters is [sic] appeared to be malicious and unauthenticated.”220 Thus, the MOHFW
expressed disagreement with Mr. Prakash’s complaint and alleged that it had
received evidence contradicting Mr. Prakash’s allegations.

       The DIR’s review of equipment procurement under the FDCBP reveals that
Elico submitted performance certificates issued by Uttaranchal in two other ten-
ders as well, one in 2003 and one in 2005.221 The DIR reviewed two of these three
performance certificates allegedly provided by Uttaranchal and the complaint that

                    Uttaranchal sent to HSCC. The review of the certificates shows that they contain
                    suspicious features, such as varying signatures for Uttaranchal’s proprietor.222

                           The DIR has not received or reviewed the July and September 2006 letters from
                    Uttaranchal that the MOHFW purportedly received, allegedly confirming that the
                    company received equipment from Elico. However, the DIR reviewed Elico’s bid
                    in other tenders and found that many of the performance certificates submitted
                    by the company appear to be fraudulent.223 Most of the Elico performance cer-
                    tificates in a later tender, purportedly from different companies, carried the exact
                    same heading and were issued within five days of each other.224 Several certificates
                    were issued on plain paper and have the same font and text.225 Given that Elico
                    was awarded three equipment contracts under the FDCBP,226 it appears that pro-
                    curement officials might have awarded contracts based on fraudulent documents
                    submitted by the company.

                           The DIR also detected seemingly fraudulent performance certificates in the
                    procurement of a UV-Vis spectrophotometer in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/
                    ICB-2/2004. In that procurement, the BER concluded that nine of the 11 bids were
                    technically and commercially responsive and recommended the lowest evaluated
                    responsive bidder, Systronics, for the contract.227 The MOHFW awarded the con-
                    tract to Systronics.228 The DIR reviewed the performance certificates submitted by
                    Systronics in its bid. At least eight of those certificates were handwritten and con-
                    tained similar styles of handwriting, indicating that they may have been prepared
                    by the same one or two people even though they purportedly came from different
                    companies.229 Some of the handwritten certificates do not have dates, and others
                    are dated in the same month, January 2005.230 These factors indicate that at least
                    some of the performance certificates may have been fabricated. Three examples are
                    provided in Figure 4.

                           Chemito Technologies also submitted multiple performance certificates, pur-

                    procurement, most of which use similar wording.231 The certificates in question

                    issued on plain paper, and have unreadable signature blocks that make it difficult to

       The questionable nature of Chemito Technologies’ performance certificates is
further underscored when compared with the performance certificates that the
company submitted for two other items, a gas liquid chromatograph and an HPLC
system (gradient), in a 2005 tender.236 Unlike the questionable performance cer-
tificates that the company produced, the performance certificates for these other
items appear more authentic. They include dates, are written on company letter-
head, include evidence of being faxed, provide company addresses and telephone
numbers, and have unique signatures.237 Based on a review of Chemito’s documen-
tation, indicators of fraud exist in some of these procurement processes.

                           Documentation that had been found to be fraudulent also appeared in the pro-
                    curement of air conditioners in a 2005 tender. In that procurement, the MOHFW
                    awarded the contract to Videocon International despite the fact that HSCC had
                    found the company’s similar performance certificates to be fraudulent in an early
                    tender.238

                           Videocon International had submitted a bid for the same item in 2003.239 In the
                    2003 tender, the company included in its bid a performance certificate claiming
                    that 308 air conditioners had been supplied to U. P. Health Systems Development
                    Project, Lucknow (UPHSDP).240 HSCC forwarded a copy of the performance cer-
                    tificate to UPHSDP to confirm that the sale occurred.241 UPHSDP responded that
                    the performance certificate submitted by Videocon International from UPHSDP
                    had never been issued by the agency and that the signature on the performance
                    certificate was not from anyone working in its office.242 Based on this information,
                    the BER in the 2003 tender did not recommend the award of contract to Videocon
                    International, which would otherwise have won the contract.243

                           In the 2005 tender, Videocon International once again submitted a perfor-
                    mance certificate reflecting that it had supplied 308 air conditioners to UPHSDP
                    and listed the same information in its performance statement as it had listed in
                    the 2003 tender.244 The DIR compared the UPHSDP performance certificate that

                    was submitted in the 2005 tender and determined that the two certificates appear
                    mostly identical.245 They differ only in that (1) the date in the 2003 certificate is
                    typed while the same date in the certificate of the 2005 tender is handwritten,
                    and (2) the 2003 certificate has no annex while the certificate in the 2005 tender
                    includes an annex listing the quantity and price of the goods allegedly provided.246
                    One individual, Mr. S. A. Usmani, was a BEC member in both tenders. Unlike
                    in the 2003 tender, HSCC did not seek any clarification in the 2005 tender, and

the MOHFW awarded the contract to Videocon International.247 The fact that the
contract was awarded based on a performance certificate whose similar version
had been declared fraudulent by at least one of the same BEC members in an ear-
lier tender is an indicator of fraud and corruption in the equipment procurement
process.

       Specifications Claimed by Winning Bidders Appear to Be Fraudulent. In one ten-
der, a bidder was awarded a contract even though its specification claims appear
to be fraudulent. In the procurement of a UV-Vis spectrophotometer in tender
HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-2/2004, Systronics claimed that its item’s specifica-
tions matched exactly the tender’s required specifications. 248 The BER concluded
that nine of the 11 bids were technically and commercially responsive and rec-
ommended Systronics, the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, for the contract.249
The MOHFW awarded the contract to Systronics.250 The DIR reviewed Systronics’
bid and cross-checked the company’s technical specifications against the tender
specifications.251 The DIR found the documents to be almost identical. For exam-
ple, both documents list a specific wavelength range of “190–900nm, at least”; a
wavelength accuracy of “+/– 0.5 or better”; and a photometric accuracy of “+/–
0.001 Abs in range 0 to 0.5 or 0 to 200.0 percent T.”252 A copy of the company’s bid
specifications and the tender specifications is provided in Figure 7 for comparison,
showing the unusually identical nature of the two lists.

                       Unlike in earlier findings where it appeared that procurement officials had cop-
                    ied specifications from a company’s leaflet, in this case it appears that Systronics
                    copied the technical specifications from the tender document and submitted the
                    same in its bid, since the company has no accompanying literature that supports
                    the specifications. It is unclear whether the BEC members sought any clarification
                    from Systronics on its technical specifications before declaring the company tech-
                    nically responsive. Such unlikely identical specifications, without accompanying
                    literature to confirm the specifications, indicate the potential for corruption in the
                    procurement process.

C.	Disqualification of Lower Cost Bidders
Not only did the DIR detect indicators of fraud and corruption in the equipment
procurement process that resulted in preferential treatment of some bidders,
but the preferential treatment also often led to the disqualification of lower cost
bidders, resulting in significantly higher cost contracts for the equipment. Some
examples of the higher cost contracts are provided below.

       When the steering committee overruled the BER’s recommendation to award
the contract for an HPLC to Perkin Elmer Instruments in tender HSCC/PUR/
CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003 and recommended instead the awarding of the contract
to Waters India, the MOHFW accepted the steering committee’s recommendation
and paid approximately USD 30,000 more for the contract than it would have paid
to Perkin Elmer Instruments.253

       For the procurement of an HPLC (isocratic system) with 10 columns, two
integrators, and one degassor, in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003,
the steering committee overruled the BER’s recommendation by recommending
Waters India over Indtech Analytical, seeking clarifications from Waters India and
not from Indtech Analytical, though both were substantially responsive.254 Had
Indtech Analytical been allowed to clarify its bid and successfully done so, it most
likely would have been awarded the contract, saving approximately USD 30,000.

       For the procurement of a spectrophotofluorometer in tender HSCC/PUR/
CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, the DIR has seen no evidence that the contract has yet
been awarded, but the procurement evaluation process has already occurred. In
that process, the steering committee overruled the BER’s findings.255 The BER had
found that the technical specifications of the lower bidder, Elico, were substan-
tially responsive, but the steering committee concluded that Elico was technically
non-responsive and recommended Hitachi, a higher bidder, for the contract.256 If
the contract is awarded to Hitachi instead of Elico, the MOHFW will pay approxi-
mately USD 212,000 more for the contract than if Elico is awarded the contract.

       For the procurement of a gas chromatograph mass spectrophotometer in ten-
der HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-2/2004, the DIR has seen no evidence that the

                    contract for the item has yet been awarded. However, the procurement process
                    has occurred.257 The DIR’s review of the procurement process reveals that Perkin
                    Elmer India was favored. The lowest bidder, Varian India, was found to be techni-
                    cally non-responsive based on information in the company’s catalogue, despite
                    the fact that Varian India claimed in its bid to be in compliance with the required
                    technical parameters.258 The reliance of the BEC members on Varian India’s cata-
                    logue alone and the decision of the BEC members not to seek clarification from the
                    company are inconsistent with the actions of the BEC members in other tenders.259
                    Had HSCC sought clarification and had Varian India successfully clarified its bid,
                    the MOHFW would have been in a position to save about USD 60,000.

                           Finally, in four of the five items in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/NCB-
                    1C/2003, a lower evaluated bidder, though deemed by the BEC members to be
                    technically and commercially responsive, was disqualified for not complying with
                    the post-qualification criteria on questionable grounds.260 All four contracts were
                    instead awarded to Yorco Sales.261 By awarding the contracts to the lower bidders,
                    the MOHFW would have saved a total of about USD 24,000.


                    Equipment Implementation
                    The DIR evaluated the implementation of equipment under the FDCBP by mak-
                    ing onsite visits to inspect 15 laboratories, reviewing relevant consignee lists, and
                    speaking to laboratory personnel. In its review, the DIR detected a high amount of
                    implementation shortcomings with respect to delivery, installation, use, and main-
                    tenance of equipment under the project.

                           The types of equipment implementation deficiencies detected by the DIR var-
                    ied widely: some equipment had not been delivered, had been delivered late, had
                    not been installed, had been installed improperly, had been delivered in damaged
                    condition, or had been oversupplied. In addition, some suppliers did not provide

A.	 General Equipment Implementation Deficiencies
The DIR has generated overview data showing the extensive nature of the FDCBP
equipment implementation deficiencies at the 15 laboratories visited. The DIR
bases its demonstrative data on such findings as non-delivery, non-installation,
and warranty and maintenance issues. For example, the DIR found that at the time
of the DIR’s March–April 2007 laboratory visits, more than half the equipment
procured for the laboratories had not been delivered or installed, even though the
majority of contracts had been awarded two to three years earlier. Sixteen contrac-
tors were responsible for the equipment that had not been delivered. Twelve con-
tractors were responsible for the equipment that had not been installed. Labora-
tory officials informed the DIR that due to such implementation deficiencies they
were often unable to meet their testing obligations.

   Of the 282 pieces of equipment procured under the FDCBP for the laborato-
ries that the DIR visited, 69 had not been delivered (24 percent) and 75 had been
delivered but not installed (27 percent). Table 1 and Figure 8 provide an overview
of this equipment and a breakdown of the equipment by location.

   1.	 Problems with Other Equipment Procured under the FDCBP for
   Which the DIR Has Received No Documentation

   While inspecting the laboratories in those states that the MOHFW allowed the
DIR to visit, the DIR discovered that the MOHFW had procured other equipment
under the FDCBP for which the DIR has not received any procurement docu-
mentation from HSCC. The DIR learned that the MOHFW procured 21 addi-
tional pieces of equipment through 13 additional contracts. The DIR analyzed the
implementation deficiencies related to these 21 pieces of equipment. Table 2 and
Figure 10 demonstrate that delivery and installation problems affected 90 percent
of these 21 pieces of equipment. The DIR was not provided documentation that
would allow it to ascertain the values of these contracts.

                    this equipment was higher (90 percent) than the corresponding rate for equipment for which the DIR

   Table 1 reflects the fact that delivery and installation problems existed at 14 of
the 15 sites visited. The one site where the DIR did not detect delivery and installa-
tion problems, CFL Mysore, experienced another implementation problem: some
equipment was delivered to the CFL Mysore laboratory one year late with missing
parts. Thus, the DIR detected some degree of deficiency in equipment implemen-
tation at every laboratory that it visited. Specific types of deficiencies, in addition
to non-delivery and non-installation, are described below.

   2.	 Oversupply

   Eight of the 15 laboratories reported problems with oversupply of equip-
ment under the FDCBP. During the DIR’s site inspections, laboratory officials
informed the DIR that the MOHFW and HSCC did not consult their laboratories
before procuring laboratory equipment. Four laboratories, CIPL Ghaziabad, PHL
Meerut, CFL Mysore, and PHL Bangalore, reported that without consultation the
MOHFW decided on its own what equipment to procure for them.

   One result of this lack of coordination was that many laboratories received
equipment that had limited or no use because of staffing shortages, deficiencies in
staff expertise, lack of available space, and/or lack of required work product given
the testing requirements of each laboratory. For example, the Assistant Director
of PHL Meerut informed the DIR that over his objection, 27 pieces of equipment
were delivered to the laboratory. The Assistant Director said that when the equip-
ment arrived, he initially refused to take possession of it but relented after receiv-
ing pressure from senior food and drug officers at FDTL Lucknow. Similarly, the
Superintendent of SDL Bangalore stated that Perkin Elmer Instruments had deliv-
ered a gas chromatograph worth USD 22,855 that was not in use because the labo-
ratory had already procured one with state funds.

   In its site visits, the DIR often found extra equipment lying unpacked in storage,
sometimes in unsanitary conditions. For example, at PHL Meerut, 12 machines,
collectively worth USD  70,549, remained packed and stored in conditions that
were likely to lead to damage given the extreme humidity within the store room.
A senior analyst at PHL Bhubaneswar informed the DIR that the laboratory had
received nine pieces of equipment, worth USD 15,493, for which the laboratory
had no use. This equipment was also still packed in storage unused.

   3.	 Lack of Demonstration and Training in Use of Equipment

   The contract agreements for the supply of laboratory equipment incorporate,
by reference to provisions in the tender documents, an obligation for the con-

                    tractor to install and demonstrate proper use of the equipment to the laboratory
                    staff.262

                           During visits to the laboratories, the DIR found that much of the equipment
                    was not being used as intended. Analysts in five laboratories stated that they had
                    not received proper demonstrations on how to operate the equipment or training
                    on testing samples at the time of installation. For example, at FDTL Lucknow, the
                    staff informed the DIR that Orbit Technologies supplied a digital polarimeter to
                    the laboratory and that Yorco Sales supplied two units of a disintegration apparatus
                    to the laboratory but that the companies provided no demonstration or training.
                    The staff added that a chemist was needed to teach how to test samples with this
                    sophisticated equipment and that such a person was not available. The Director of
                    PHL Bangalore stated that the analysts in her laboratory frequently complained to
                    her that they faced difficulties in testing samples because the equipment was dif-
                    ficult to understand. In some laboratories, analysts refused to switch on the equip-
                    ment for the DIR, explaining that they did not know how to operate it. In other
                    laboratories, such as PHL Thane, when the DIR requested that the analysts give a
                    demonstration, the analysts tried but could not. Many analysts stated that because
                    they were often not properly trained, there was a possibility that the results of the
                    sample testing could be incorrect.

                           4.	 Problems with Warranty and Maintenance Commitments

                           The DIR detected deficiencies regarding the warranty and annual maintenance
                    commitments made by companies in their equipment supply contracts. Based on
                    discussions with laboratory staff, the DIR concluded that most staff were unaware
                    that contract agreements required suppliers to provide free maintenance services
                    during a warranty period. In cases where laboratory staff had attempted to exercise
                    the warranty, suppliers often had not repaired the equipment.

                           For example, the MOHFW awarded Yorco Sales a contract on May 11, 2006, to
                    supply 18 rotary vacuum evaporators under the FDCBP.263 The company delivered
                    two units to PHL Thane, but the laboratory staff informed the DIR that they could
                    not use the equipment because the company did not supply all the required parts.
                    Despite several requests from the laboratory staff, Yorco Sales still had not deliv-
                    ered the missing parts.


                    262	
                        All HSCC tender documents, under General Conditions of Contract (GCC) clause 13, state that contractors
                    shall provide “training of the Purchaser’s personnel, at the supplier’s plant and/or on-site, in assembly, start-up,
                    operation, maintenance, and/or repair of the supplied Goods.”

       The MOHFW awarded S. M. Scientific Instruments a contract on May 30, 2006,
to supply five double distillation water plants with conductivity meters.264 The com-
pany delivered two units to SDL Bangalore, and one of the units was damaged dur-
ing shipment. The laboratory staff informed the DIR that they had requested that
S. M. Scientific Instruments replace the damaged unit but received no response
from the company.

       The MOHFW awarded Elico a contract on May 14, 2006, to supply 17 flame
photometers.265 The company delivered two units to FDTL Lucknow, and the
laboratory staff reported that both units were installed incorrectly and were giv-
ing incorrect readings. Despite the laboratory’s several requests, Elico had not yet
replaced or fixed the equipment.

B.	 Specific Equipment Implementation Deficiencies
    Corresponding to Equipment Contracts Reviewed
In its visits to 15 laboratories, the DIR detected implementation deficiencies that
correspond to specific contracts that the DIR examined in its equipment procure-
ment review. Out of the 29 contracts for which the DIR found possible fraud or
corruption, 20 of the contracts (69 percent) had corresponding implementation
problems. The DIR recognizes that only a full investigation can establish a causal
link between the procurement issues and implementation shortcomings identified
for these contracts. Nonetheless, the high proportion of contracts with indicators
of favored bidders that experienced corresponding deficiencies in implementation
suggests a possible correlation. In the DIR’s experience, flawed procurement pro-
cesses often lead to the selection of bidders that are ill-equipped to perform the
contracts awarded. Examples of possible instances are provided below.

       1.	 Implementation Problems Occurred with Respect to Suppliers 		
       Whose Compliance with Post-qualification Criteria in the Procurement
       Process Was Questionable

       The DIR detected implementation deficiencies linked to the procurement of
an AAS in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003. In that procurement, the
MOHFW awarded the contract to GBC Scientific Equipment,266 despite indicators
that the supplier did not meet post-qualification criteria and complaints corrobo-

                    rating this finding.267 Under the contract agreement, the company was required to
                    deliver the equipment within four months of the February 8, 2005, contract date.268
                    However, the company did not deliver and install the equipment for PHL Thane
                    until November 10, 2005—more than nine months after the agreement. In addi-
                    tion, PHL Thane informed the DIR that the AAS equipment arrived with dam-
                    aged graphite tubes. The laboratory stated that the tubes were necessary to operate
                    the machine and that, given this damage, the equipment was of limited use. PHL
                    Meerut informed the DIR that GBC Scientific Equipment delivered the AAS equip-
                    ment on July 14, 2005, but that as of the DIR’s March 16, 2007, visit, the equipment
                    had not yet been installed. Similarly, the SDTRL Bhubaneswar informed the DIR
                    that GBC Scientific Equipment had not yet installed the AAS equipment in its
                    laboratory. In these two cases, the equipment remained unpacked in storage.

                           Implementation deficiencies were also connected to the procurement of a UV-
                    Vis spectrophotometer in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-2/2004, where Sys-
                    tronics, the winning bidder, had established post-qualification criteria by submit-
                    ting performance certificates that seemed fraudulent.269 The DIR’s review revealed
                    implementation deficiencies connected to this procurement. For example, FDTL
                    Lucknow reported that Systronics delivered the equipment on October 27, 2006,
                    but that the equipment malfunctioned during the installation and demonstration
                    provided by the company’s engineer. Although the company promised to fix the
                    defect, it had not done so as of the DIR’s visit on March 20, 2007. According to the
                    laboratory, this equipment is critical to its operations. Systronics failed to install
                    the UV-Vis spectrophotometer at CIPL Ghaziabad despite the laboratory’s sev-
                    eral written requests for the company to do so. The DIR found the equipment still
                    packed in storage. Another laboratory that the DIR visited, SDTRL Bhubaneswar,
                    reported that the equipment was delivered and installed almost six months after
                    the contract date and that the equipment had malfunctioned and was not in use.
                    The laboratory stated that Systronics had not responded to multiple requests to
                    repair the equipment, despite the fact that the warranty period in the contract
                    agreement was still active.

       2.	 Some Companies Whose Products’ Parameter Specifications
       Were Unusually Identical to the Tender Document Specifications Also
       Were Deficient in Implementing Their Contracts

       In the procurement of UV-Vis spectrophotometer in tender HSCC/PUR/
CBP(F&D)/ICB-2/2004, a comparison of the bid of Systronics, the winning bid-
der, with the specifications required by the tender reveals that the two sets of speci-
fications were almost identical. This unusual finding and the fact that Systronics
did not submit supporting literature for its equipment specifications suggest that
the specifications listed in its bid were simply copied from the tender document
and did not represent the company’s actual product.270 As described above, the
company exhibited numerous deficiencies in supplying the equipment under the
contract: the company delivered some defective equipment under the contract,
and the company did not repair some of the equipment pursuant to the warranty
terms. Such types of implementation issues suggest that possibly the actual speci-
fications of Systronics’ product, if different from those reported in the company’s
bid submission, were not sufficient to meet laboratory demands.

       Similarly, the DIR detected implementation problems connected to the pro-
curement of a rotary vacuum evaporator in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-
2/2004. The DIR found indicators that HSCC had narrowly drafted the required
item specifications to specifically match those of York Scientific Industries’ prod-
uct. The tender document contained technical specifications that suspiciously
were almost identical to those listed in the company’s product leaflet.271 Although
HSCC awarded the contract to York Scientific Industries on December 29, 2005,
the company had not supplied or installed the equipment at several laboratories
as of the DIR’s visit on March 20, 2007.272 For example, FDTL Lucknow reported
that the company had not delivered a unit of this item, though the contract obliged
the company to do so within four months of the December 2005 contract. As of
the DIR’s visit on April 3, 2007, to SDTRL Bhubaneswar, York Scientific Industries
had not delivered the equipment to that laboratory, despite the same contractual
obligation. The company delivered the equipment to PHL Pune on January 12,
2007. But despite the laboratory’s repeated requests, the company did not install
the equipment.

                           3.	 The DIR Detected Implementation Problems Corresponding to
                           the Procurement Processes Where the Steering Committee Made
                           Questionable Findings in Overruling the BER and Recommending
                           Another Bidder for the Contract

                           The DIR found numerous delivery and installation problems in CEM Corpora-
                    tion’s supply of microwave digestion units. As discussed, in the procurement of this
                    equipment in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1D/2003, the BER declared the
                    company to be technically non-responsive,273 and the steering committee reversed
                    this decision.274 The MOHFW awarded the contract to CEM Corporation.275 For
                    example, despite CEM Corporation’s contractual obligation to deliver two micro-
                    wave digestion units to PHL Meerut within four months of the contract of July
                    26, 2004, the company delivered only one unit approximately 10 months after the
                    contract. The company did not install the unit until approximately six months after
                    that and even then installed the equipment in a location that had no electrical
                    outlet. Thus, as of the DIR’s visit of March 16, 2007, the equipment was still not
                    in use. As of the DIR’s visit, the company had not yet delivered the second unit,
                    approximately two and a half years after the contract required delivery. The DIR
                    also found that at FDTL Lucknow, CEM Corporation did not deliver the micro-
                    wave digestion unit until February 24, 2005, almost seven months after the con-
                    tract date of July 26, 2004. The company did not install the unit until September
                    6, 2005, approximately seven months after delivery. Moreover, CEM Corporation
                    installed the unit in a temporary location due to ongoing construction work at
                    the site. The laboratory reported that after the construction had been completed,
                    CEM Corporation has ignored its repeated requests to move and install the unit at
                    a permanent location. The DIR found similar delivery and installation delays with
                    respect to CEM Corporation at PHL Bangalore and PHL Bhubaneswar.

                           The DIR also identified questionable findings by the steering committee in
                    overruling the BER in the procurement of an HPLC isocratic system with 10 col-
                    umns, two integrators, and one degassor in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-
                    1A/2003. As described earlier, though the BER had found both Waters India and
                    Indtech Analytical to be responsive, the steering committee noted that the bids of
                    both companies had minor deficiencies and sought clarifications only from Waters

India, the higher bidder.276 The DIR discovered implementation deficiencies linked
to this procurement at the laboratories it visited. One laboratory, SDCL Mumbai,
reported that Waters India delivered an HPLC isocratic system that had no col-
umn heater. Without this part, the laboratory was unable to use the equipment.
As of the DIR’s site visit on March 26, 2007, the company had not yet delivered the
missing part, despite the laboratory’s request.

       4.	 Yorco Sales Was Remiss in Fulfilling Contracts It Won through
       Procurement Processes That the DIR Found to Be Tainted

       As described earlier, for the procurements of a sterilizer horizontal autoclave, a
hot air oven, an oven universal, and a vacuum oven with vacuum pump in tender
HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/NCB-1C/2003, a lower evaluated bidder, though techni-
cally and commercially responsive, was disqualified on a questionable basis for not
complying with the post-qualification criteria. Yorco Sales was instead awarded
the contract in each case.277

       The DIR detected implementation deficiencies connected to these four procure-
ments. For example, though Yorco Sales delivered a sterilizer horizontal autoclave
to FDTL Lucknow on May 17, 2006, the company had not yet installed the equip-
ment as of the DIR’s visit on March 20, 2007. The equipment was still packed and
waiting in storage. The laboratory also reported that in addition to this item, Yorco
Sales supplied it with seven other pieces of equipment, but rather than send an
engineer to install the equipment, the company sent an electrician. The laboratory
staff explained that the electrician had no knowledge of the equipment’s operating
procedures and was unable to provide any training or demonstration of the equip-
ment, as was required in the contract agreement. The laboratory also noted that
other equipment supplied and installed by Yorco Sales was not working properly.
The laboratory has made repeated requests to Yorco Sales to remedy these prob-
lems, but the company has not yet done so. Five pieces of equipment from Yorco
Sales remained packed in storage. The staff at SDTRL Bhubaneswar made similar
reports with respect to Yorco Sales’ deliveries to their laboratory.

       Other laboratories reported implementation problems with the hot air oven.
PHL Meerut and PHL Bangalore reported that Yorco Sales delivered several units
of the equipment on April 7, 2006, and on June 12, 2006, respectively, but that it
still has not installed the equipment. In these cases, the DIR found that the units

                    were still packed and stored in their boxes. PHL Bangalore added that the equip-
                    ment delivered by the company was damaged. Although PHL Bangalore repeat-
                    edly submitted requests to Yorco Sales over a nine-month period to replace the
                    damaged units and although the units were still under warranty, the company had
                    not done so as of the DIR’s visit on April 10, 2007. The DIR’s inspection of the
                    equipment suggests that poor packaging was the reason for the damage.

                           The DIR’s site visits also reveal implementation deficiencies connected to the
                    procurement of the oven universal. Yorco Sales delivered the oven universal to
                    FDTL Lucknow, but the equipment had not yet been installed as of the DIR’s visit
                    on March 20, 2007.278 The equipment was still packed and waiting in storage. The
                    laboratory informed the DIR that despite its repeated requests, the company had
                    not yet installed the equipment. PHL Bangalore reported that Yorco Sales delivered
                    three units on June 12, 2006, but had not yet installed them. This laboratory added
                    that the equipment delivered by the company was damaged. Although the labora-
                    tory repeatedly submitted requests to Yorco Sales over a nine-month period for the
                    damaged units to be replaced and although the units were still under warranty, the
                    company had not done so as of the DIR’s visit on April 10, 2007.

                           With respect to the supply of the vacuum oven with vacuum pump, the DIR’s
                    review also revealed implementation deficiencies connected to this procurement
                    at the laboratories it visited. For example, PHL Meerut, FDTL Lucknow, PHL Ban-
                    galore, and PHL Bhubaneswar all reported that Yorco Sales delivered the equip-
                    ment but that the company had not yet installed the equipment as of the DIR’s
                    visits over March 16–April 10, 2007. The DIR found all the equipment still packed
                    and waiting in storage.

                    C.	 Payment for Equipment
                    HSCC provided the DIR with information on the payment status of some of the
                    equipment for which the DIR discovered procurement and implementation prob-
                    lems.279 The DIR found that, out of the 17 contracts reviewed by the DIR with both
                    procurement and implementation issues, eight had already received between 84
                    and 100 percent of payment. Lingering implementation problems for these con-
                    tracts, including non-delivery, missing parts, and the delivery of damaged equip-
                    ment, call such payments into question. In all, out of the contracts reviewed that

                         The date of delivery of this equipment is not known because it did not appear on HSCC’s consignees list and
                    the laboratory did not provide it.

had procurement and implementation problems, 47 percent had nonetheless
received substantial payment.280

       For example, despite the fact that GBC Scientific Equipment had delivered
damaged AAS equipment to PHL Thane, HSCC reported that it had already paid
USD 1.25 million of the total contract value of USD 1.37 million.281

       Despite the fact that Shimadzu Asia Pacific had not delivered a gas liquid chro-
matograph to PHL Pune, HSCC reported that it had already paid USD 996,893 of
the total contract value of USD 1.17 million.282

       Despite the fact that Perkin Elmer had delivered a gas chromatograph with
six columns with missing parts to SDCL Aurangabad, HSCC reported that it had
already paid USD 141,786 of the total contract value of USD 183,840.283

       Thus, the DIR found several examples of companies that had already received
payment for equipment, despite implementation deficiencies.


Civil Works Procurement and
Implementation
In its review of the civil works component of the FDCBP, the DIR observed vari-
ous problems in both procurement and implementation. The DIR has identified
specific examples of deficiencies in the procurement process, though only a full
investigation of the civil works procurement process, including interviews with
losing bidders and procurement officials, will reveal whether these issues flow from
underlying fraud or corruption. In addition, the DIR found widespread implemen-
tation deficiencies at the sites it visited. The fact that procurement officials and, in
one case, a laboratory issued some completion certificates and that the officials
did not address such problems in their supervisory roles demonstrates ineffective
administration of the implementation process for civil works.

A.	 Civil Works Procurement
The DIR reviewed the procurement processes for nine of the civil works projects
under the FDCBP. The DIR identified indicators of favoritism in three of these
procurements.

                           In the award of the contract for the expansion of the SDL Bangalore facility,
                    the BEC members failed to disqualify Rohit Kumar Das Construction (RKDC),
                    the winning bidder, even though the company provided false information in its
                    bid submission. The tender documents in this procurement contained a form that
                    required bidders to declare whether they had also submitted bids for other civil
                    works contracts that were under consideration by FDCBP procurement officials.284
                    In its bid submission, RKDC declared that it had not.285 The DIR found that contra-
                    dicting this declaration, RKDC had submitted a separate bid for the renovation of
                    the SDL Bhubaneswar facility, which was still under consideration at the time.286

                           RKDC made the same type of false declaration in a second procurement. In
                    its bid for the construction of the SFDL Goa facility, RKDC was declared the low-
                    est evaluated responsive bidder.287 In its bid for this project, the company again
                    provided a form that falsely declared that it had not submitted bids for any other
                    procurement.288 This procurement occurred within the same time period as the
                    other procurements for which RKDC submitted bids.289

                           Two BEC members, S. Mukhopadhayay and C. P. Singh, participated in all three
                    procurements for which RKDC submitted its bids.290 Given that the procurements
                    occurred within weeks of each other, the DIR would have expected the BEC mem-
                    bers to recognize RKDC’s false declaration. The tender document states that “even
                    though the bidders meet the qualifying criteria, they are subject to be disqualified
                    if they have made misleading or false representations in the forms, statements and
                    attachments submitted in proof of the qualification requirements.”291 However,
                    rather than disqualify RKDC pursuant to this guideline, the BEC recommended
                    RKDC for the award of the contract in two of the procurements, and the MOHFW
                    awarded both contracts to the company.292 That the BEC recommended RKDC for
                    two of the contracts and that the MOHFW awarded the contracts to the company
                    despite the company’s false declaration suggest that procurement officials favored
                    the company in the procurement process.

       The DIR identified another potential problem with RKDC’s bid for the expan-
sion of the SDL Bangalore facility. RKDC was required to submit a bank guaran-
tee demonstrating sufficient credit.293 The bank guarantee that RKDC submitted
appears to be suspicious. First, the bank guarantee was not submitted as part of its
bid, but was submitted by fax dated January 2005, almost three months after the
date of the bid submission.294 Second, the bank guarantee was almost identical to
the bank guarantee that had been submitted for the construction of the State Food
and Drug Laboratory Goa.295 Both bank guarantees have the exact same signature
and date.296 Even though the bank guarantee for SDL Bangalore was apparently
signed in November 2004, it was not faxed until three months later. RKDC’s bid
for the construction of the State Food and Drug Laboratory Goa was reviewed by
the same procurement officials as the bid for the SDL Bangalore.297 Pursuant to
tender document requirement, RKDC gave HSCC authorization to confirm the
authenticity of the guarantee with the bank; however, it does not appear that the
procurement officials did so.298 Despite the questionable nature of the SDL Banga-
lore bank guarantee, the MOHFW awarded the contract to RKDC.299

       The DIR identified another civil works procurement issue that also suggests
efforts by procurement officials to favor one bidder over another. For the procure-
ment of the construction of the CFL Ghaziabad facility in tender HSCC/IFB/139/
CBP/FRSL/PM/BUII/04, the BER did not seek clarification from a lower bidder,
even though documents suggest that the bidder met some of the criteria in ques-
tion and would have been able to meet the other criteria in question if allowed to
clarify its submission. In that procurement, the BEC disqualified Devan Chand, a
lower bidder that had met all technical and commercial criteria, for not complying
with the post-qualification criteria.300 The BER reported that the company failed
to satisfy the requirement that bidders have a financial turnover of at least INR 70
million (USD 1.6 million301) in any two years.302 The BER also stated that the com-

                    pany failed to report its ability to obtain INR 9 million (USD 200 thousand) in
                    credit in a format that was required by the procurement process.303

                           The DIR reviewed Devan Chand’s bid and determined that the company did
                    in fact submit a turnover statement that clearly stated that it repeatedly had a
                    financial turnover exceeding the required amount.304 The statement reported turn-
                    over of INR 81.5 million (USD 1.8 million) in 2000 to 2001, of INR 82.6 million
                    (USD 1.8 million) in 2002 to 2003, and of INR 81.6 million (USD 1.8 million) in
                    2003 to 2004.305 The company also submitted documents that supported its turn-
                    over statement.306 With respect to the second criterion in question, the company
                    submitted a document that demonstrated its ability to obtain the required amount
                    of credit from a bank: a letter written from Canara Bank to HSCC, entitled “Sol-
                    vency Certificate,” which described the company as a trustworthy, respectable cli-
                    ent that could be trusted for an amount of INR 9 million (USD 200 thousand).307
                    The BEC correctly noted that this letter did not specifically provide the company
                    with a credit of INR 9 million (USD 200 thousand),308 but the letter suggests that
                    the company might have been able to obtain such a guarantee had it been asked
                    to clarify its bid submission. However, the BEC did not seek any clarification from
                    Devan Chand and instead recommended Winner Constructions, a higher bidder,
                    for the contract.309 The MOHFW awarded the contract to Winner Constructions.310
                    Thus, at the very least procurement officials appear to have performed their roles
                    ineffectively by disqualifying the lower bidder on incorrect grounds. The disquali-
                    fication could also reflect that the procurement officials deliberately and corruptly
                    favored a higher bidder.

                    B.	 Civil Works Implementation
                    With respect to implementation deficiencies associated with the civil works com-
                    ponent of the FDCBP, the DIR found widespread problems at the sites it visited.
                    Every civil works site that the DIR visited was affected to some considerable degree
                    by implementation problems. The DIR categorized the types of civil works defi-
                    ciencies into various categories, described in Table 3.

   The categories are described below.

   1.	 Electrical Problems

   The DIR found that two of the nine facilities that were inspected, though
already constructed, remained unoccupied because they were not yet connected to
utilities, including power service. For example, though construction work for CFL
Ghaziabad was completed in November 2005, the building was still unoccupied at
the time of the DIR’s visit on March 15, 2007, because of power and water supply
problems.

   In addition, the DIR found problems associated with the electrical systems that
had been installed at six of the nine laboratories that it visited. After inspecting the
site, the DIR’s civil engineer reported:

             Electrical switches and outlets and lighting and plumbing
             fittings were of poor quality and had, in many cases, been
             carelessly installed. It was clear that both the design and
             installation of the electrical system were haphazard and
             had not been properly planned and supervised. Junction
             boxes were scattered in an arbitrary fashion over the ceil-
             ings, and there were several locations where wiring had to
             be surface mounted, because no provision had been made
             in the design for concealed wiring in conduits, which
             should be the norm for a newly constructed building.

   Electrical switches, outlets, and lighting fixtures were also misaligned. The DIR
detected similar problems at the new construction site at SFL Gorakhpur, which
in addition had exposed wiring for fans and lights. Although the FDL Mumbai
site was still under construction when the DIR visited, electrical problems were
already apparent. The contractor had installed a number of electrical connection
boxes haphazardly on the walls and ceilings with no apparent planning or design
(see Photo Gallery 1, pages 139–142, for images showing electrical problems).

   2.	 Water Supply and Infrastructure Problems

   The DIR found water supply and infrastructure problems at three of the nine
sites it visited. As previously described, CFL Ghaziabad was completed in Novem-
ber 2005 but was still unoccupied at the time of the DIR’s March 2007 visit because
it lacked water and power supplies. At CFL Ghaziabad, SFL Gorakhpur, and SFDL
Raipur, plumbing work, especially on waste pipes, was below standard. Plumbing
was made of cheap, flexible plastic tubing rather than properly fitted with rigid

                    pipes and U-traps (see Photo Gallery 2, pages 143–146, for images showing supply
                    and infrastructure problems).

                       3.	 Cement Render and Other Cement Problems

                       Three civil works sites had cement problems. The DIR found that the cement
                    render at FDL Mumbai and SDL Bangalore was of poor quality and inadequately
                    applied to the walls. The render’s adhesion to the structural concrete was poor and
                    it slumped in places, forming settlement cracks. In some places, large areas of ren-
                    der had broken away from the underlying concrete, especially where the contrac-
                    tor had placed electrical conduits and connection boxes on the ceilings and beams.
                    Some of the render could be broken off the wall by hand. The DIR’s civil engineer
                    reported that this was probably due to “too much water” in the render and “not
                    enough cement in the mix.” Many of these areas required extensive repair work. At
                    SFDL Raipur, the DIR detected substantial cracks in the infill brickwork because
                    of insufficient cement in the mortar binding the bricks together (see Photo Gallery
                    3, pages 147–148, for images showing cement problems).

                       4.	 Water Damage and Mold Problems

                       Various water damage problems appeared at five of the nine civil works sites that
                    the DIR visited. For example, at SFDL Raipur’s new construction, the DIR found
                    damp patches on the ceiling of the upper floor, indicating that the roof leaked and
                    had not been properly waterproofed. The DIR’s civil engineer also found that at the
                    renovation project at SDTRL Bhubaneswar, “there was clearly no effort made to
                    clean off or neutralize the mold that had already formed on the building because of
                    absorbent render applied years ago.” As a result, the mold had grown through the
                    new paint, drastically affecting the building’s appearance. At SFL Gorakhpur’s new
                    facility, the DIR’s civil engineer noted cracking in the roof waterproofing, which
                    “may be the cause of the damp penetration inside the building, which was noted
                    in several locations.” At CFL Ghaziabad’s new facility, numerous cracks and a wall
                    that leaned open several centimeters meant that water damage had occurred inside
                    (see Photo Gallery 4, pages 149–152, for images showing water damage and mold
                    problems).

                       5.	 Concrete Problems

                       The DIR found problems with concrete at four of the nine sites visited. For
                    example, at the renovation of SDTRL Bhubaneswar, the DIR found that the exter-
                    nal concrete plinth was starting to break up, possibly due to inadequate cement
                    in the concrete. At the expansion project at SDL Bangalore, the concrete lintels

                                                                        Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


over the door openings exhibited signs of “honeycombing,” indicating significant
vibrations after pouring. Careless workmanship in the casting of the concrete was
also apparent at this site: a wooden block was found embedded in the concrete of
a column, and a piece of formwork was found cast into a ground beam (see Photo
Gallery 5, pages 153–154, for images showing concrete problems).

       6.	 General Construction Issues

       The DIR found general construction problems at six of the nine sites visited. At
SDL Bangalore, the contractor RKDC had begun construction on the laboratory
expansion in May 2005 but had completely stopped in November 2006 and aban-
doned the site. An HSCC consultant who was on site informed the DIR that the
contractor had not responded to several written requests from HSCC to re‑start the
work. The consultant said that based on his conversations with RKDC, it appeared
that the company did not take into account the fact that construction material
in Bangalore was far more expensive than material in Bhubaneswar, where the
company was also operating, when the company submitted its bid for the project.
The consultant thought that RKDC did not have the funds to complete the proj-
ect, despite providing information in its bid that it was financially sound and had
the necessary funds.311 The laboratory staff at SDTRL Bhubaneswar, the site of the
other civil works contract awarded to RKDC, reported similar implementation
issues regarding this company.

       Significant construction problems also existed at SDTRL Bhubaneswar, even
though the contractor claimed to have finished construction in October 2005. For
example, the DIR’s civil engineer reported that “the ceramic wall tiling applied
to walls and around workbenches has been particularly badly applied. Wall sur-
faces are wavy and uneven, the edges of the workbenches are rough and have large
amounts of excess cement hanging down, and the finish at edges is poor.” Parts of
the laboratory’s ceiling were also warping and coming apart.

       At SFL Gorakhpur’s new construction site, the contractor purportedly com-
pleted the construction work in November 2006, but the final construction did not
match the construction plans. The plans included an approach drive and a turning
circle in front of the building, but these were never built. Instead, the area in front
of the building is still an orchard of mango trees.

       The DIR also found construction design deficiencies at SDL Bangalore’s new
construction site. Bathrooms were so small that doors could not open once the

                    toilet bowl had been fitted. Because of inadequate adhesive, tiles in the bathrooms,
                    laboratories, and corridors were separating from the walls and in immediate dan-
                    ger of falling off.

                       At CFL Ghaziabad, some of the suspended ceiling was collapsing due to poor
                    installation (see Photo Gallery 6, pages 155–158, for images showing general con-
                    struction problems).

                       7.	 Additional Work Required

                       The DIR determined that at four of the nine sites visited, additional work was
                    needed to bring the projects into conformity with the tender requirements. For
                    example, at SDTRL Bhubaneswar, the laboratory staff stated that the contractor
                    had left the construction of the microbiology lab incomplete. The DIR’s civil engi-
                    neer corroborated this information: “Several doors that should have been fitted or
                    renewed were not done. The instrument room lacks two doors. The microbiology
                    lab lacks some doors and an airlock.” The laboratory director informed the DIR
                    that he had issued a complaint to the MOHFW and HSCC officials regarding the
                    incomplete work and that these officials informed him that the completion of the
                    work would be handled through another civil works tender in the future. At CFL
                    Ghaziabad, the DIR discovered that one of the main structural columns of the
                    main building had moved outwards by several centimeters. Additional work was
                    needed in order to make that building structurally sound (see Photo Gallery 7,
                    pages 159–162, for images showing problems that require additional work).

                       8.	 General Maintenance Issues

                       Two of the nine civil works sites that the DIR visited suffered from a lack of
                    general maintenance. The new CFL Ghaziabad facility was completed in Novem-
                    ber 2005 but had never been used due to the lack of utility service. As a result,
                    the location had fallen into disrepair. The DIR’s civil engineer reported that “as
                    a result of being left unoccupied for 16 months, the building was showing many
                    signs of deterioration and neglect, with thick layers of dust everywhere, festoons of
                    cobwebs, and the messy results of being inhabited by a flock of pigeons.” The new
                    facility at SFL Gorakhpur had been unoccupied since November 2006 because the
                    building had no power supply and was showing similar signs of deterioration and
                    neglect (see Photo Gallery 8 , pages 163–164, for images showing general mainte-
                    nance problems).

       9.	 Poor Quality of Materials

       The DIR found that companies used poor-quality materials at seven of the nine
sites visited. At CFL Ghaziabad, FDTL Lucknow, and SFDL Raipur, the aluminum
windows were below standard and in many instances did not fit properly into their
frames, leaving areas of daylight around them. None of the windows had sealing
strips inserted into their grooves, creating noticeable airflow when the windows
were closed. These laboratories were also equipped with low-quality lighting and
plumbing fixtures. At SFL Gorakhpur, the DIR found that the architraves around
window and door frames were of poor quality as well and that little had been done
to seal around the frames (see Photo Gallery 9, pages 165–168, for images showing
problems with the use of poor-quality materials).

C.	Issuance of Completion Certificates
The DIR found that despite these widespread implementation deficiencies, HSCC
and one laboratory issued completion certificates for three of the civil works
projects that the DIR reviewed.312 Completion certificates are issued when civil
works projects are concluded to certify that the works have been carried out as per
required specifications and have been completed satisfactorily within the specified
time schedule.313 The completion certificates are signed either by HSCC on behalf
of the MOHFW or by the laboratory officials. When the certificates are signed by
the laboratory officials, they are forwarded to HSCC. After a completion certificate
is issued, the contractor can receive full payment for the work.

       HSCC issued a completion certificate for the new construction of SFDL
Raipur.314 The fact that the civil work was certified as complete contradicts the
DIR’s findings. For this site, the DIR noted problems associated with six of the dif-
ferent problem areas described above. DIR investigators noted that from a superfi-
cial point of view, the new facility appeared to be in acceptable condition. But their
more careful inspection revealed problems associated with plumbing, cement,
mold, leakage, concrete, and quality of materials. As a result, it appears that the
procurement officials who oversee the certificate process ineffectively performed
their roles in supervising the quality of work under the FDCBP.

                        At SDTRL Bhubaneswar, the controller informed the DIR that the laboratory
                    had issued a completion certificate, despite the fact that the contractor abandoned
                    the project before the work was done. The contractor had left the construction in
                    the microbiology room incomplete and the other work performed was of poor
                    quality, as noted above. The controller explained that HSCC’s supervising official
                    never visited the work site while the construction was going on, which resulted in
                    the poor-quality work. The controller informed the DIR that the contractor was
                    able to get the laboratory’s approval for the completion certificate by arranging it
                    “in connivance” with a junior staff member at the laboratory. The controller added
                    that the laboratory had initiated its own internal review to identify improper activ-
                    ity by its staff. The DIR reviewed the certificate in question and concluded that the
                    certificate appears to be fraudulent. When compared with other certificates, the
                    SDTRL Bhubaneswar certificate does not appear to be in the official format, lacks
                    signature blocks, and has parts that are handwritten.315

                        Figure 13 shows in Example 1 the completion certificate issued by HSCC for
                    the SFDL Raipur and in Example 2 the apparently fraudulent completion certifi-
                    cate issued for the SDTRL Bhubaneswar.

                    Project Reports and Assessments
                    The DIR examined the FDCBP’s project reports and assessments. These reports con-
                    sisted of prior-reviews that the Bank conducted of the contract procurement process
                    before giving its no-objection authorization and one post-review that was conducted
                    to assess procurement issues. Bank officials have also drafted six relevant aides-mé-
                    moire based on their supervision missions. Because FDCBP is on-going, the amount
                    of supervision documentation available for the DIR’s review was limited.316

                           The DIR’s review revealed that the project reports and assessments to date inad-
                    equately detected and reported the widespread nature of procurement deficiencies
                    in the equipment and civil works procurement processes. In the instances where
                    the Bank did recognize such issues, there was no evidence to indicate it had dili-
                    gently attempted to correct the problems observed. Although the Bank noted some
                    civil works implementation issues, it still upgraded the project’s implementation
                    performance rating from unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory in its two most
                    recent aides-mémoire.

                    A.	 Prior-Reviews
                    The MOHFW was required to seek the Bank’s prior-review and no-objection before
                    awarding contracts in equipment procurements that exceeded USD 300,000 and
                    civil works contracts that exceeded USD 500,000.317 The DIR reviewed all equip-
                    ment contracts and two civil works contracts where the Bank conducted a prior-
                    review. In each of these cases, the Bank provided its no objection. In many of these
                    instances, the Bank overlooked indicators of fraud and corruption identified by
                    the DIR. When the Bank did identify such issues, there was no evidence to indicate
                    it had addressed and corrected these issues prior to giving its no-objection.

CBP(F&D)/ICB-1D/2003, the Bank also did not note indicators of corruption in
its prior-review. As described earlier, the DIR found that two individuals that had
served on both the BEC and the steering committee reversed their conclusions
reached while on the BEC when sitting on the SC with respect to the responsive-
ness of a company’s bid to the required specifications.321 Documents reviewed by
the DIR reveal that the Bank did not question the steering committee’s recommen-
dation to award the contract to CEM Corporation and gave its no-objection.322

       In the procurement for the construction of the CFL Ghaziabad facility in ten-
der HSCC/IFB/139/CBP/FRSL/PM/BUII/04, the BER failed to seek clarification
on post-qualification criteria from Devan Chand, a lower bidder that had met all
technical and commercial criteria, and disqualified the bidder, even though the bid-
                                                                   qualification
der’s bid documents suggested that the bidder met some of the post-­
criteria in question and would have been able to meet the other criteria in question
if allowed to clarify its submission.323 Despite these issues in the procurement pro-
cess, the Bank conducted a prior-review and gave its no-objection to the awarding
of the contract to the higher bidder, Winner Constructions.324

       In tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003 for the procurement of a high-

                    resulted in the disqualification of the lowest bidder, Shimadzu, even though docu-
                    ments suggest that Shimadzu would have successfully clarified its specifications, if
                    allowed to do so.325 The steering committee allowed a higher bidder, Thermo Finni-
                    gan, to clarify its submission.326 The Bank conducted a prior-review for the procure-
                    ment of this item. In a letter to the MOHFW on November 19, 2004, the Bank stated
                    that “based on our analysis (column 1) of the information tabulated by HSCC in the
                    selection of its evaluation report sent, it appears to us that none of the bids can be
                    considered to be fully technically responsive. However, several of the non-complying
                    criteria are relatively minor deviations, and others lack information or a full compli-
                    ance statement that the bidder was obliged to provide. The latter can be addressed by
                    asking for clarifications.”327 The MOHFW responded on December 13, 2004.328 In its
                    response, the MOHFW provided clarification information only for Thermo Finni-
                    gan, not for any other company, including Shimadzu, the lowest bidder.329 Based
                    on documentation reviewed, the DIR is not aware whether the MOHFW requested
                    clarifications from all companies, as per the Bank’s suggestion. The Bank gave its no-
                    objection on January 13, 2005, to the awarding of the contract to Thermo Finnigan.330
                    The MOHFW awarded the contract to Thermo Finnigan on March 4, 2005.331 The
                    DIR saw no indication that the Bank followed up on its instructions to the MOHFW
                    to seek clarification from Shimadzu as well as from Thermo Finnigan.

                           For the procurement of an HPLC isocratic system with 10 columns, two inte-
                    grators, and one degassor in tender HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, the
                    Bank also identified issues in the procurement but appears not to have followed
                    through in addressing its concerns. As discussed earlier, in that procurement, the
                    steering committee reached a conclusion that differed from the BER’s recommen-
                    dation in a way that favored a higher bidder, Waters India, over a lower bidder,
                    Indtech Analytical.332 In its prior-review of the contract, the Bank informed the
                    MOHFW on November 19, 2004, that before the Bank could give its no-objection,
                    the MOHFW needed to seek clarification from Indtech Analytical to confirm that
                    it was non-responsive.333 The Bank also identified areas of non-compliance for

Waters India and said that the MOHFW “may obtain clarification on the points
of non-compliance [for Waters India] as noted.”334 Again, on January 13, 2005, the
Bank wrote to the MOHFW highlighting that the MOHFW “has not, as requested,
provided any additional explanation of its reason for classifying the bid from M/s
Indtech Analytic as ‘technically non-responsive.’ ”335 In that letter, the Bank also
again commented on the Waters India submission, stating that Waters India’s clari-
fication did not serve to clarify non-compliance issues raised by the Bank.336

       After that, the MOHFW replied to the Bank in a letter dated February 4, 2005,
in which it responded that since the steering committee had concluded that Indtech
Analytical was technically non-responsive, the MOHFW had decided not to seek
clarification, despite the Bank’s instructions.337 With respect to Waters India, the
MOHFW relied on the clarification that Waters India had initially submitted as
evidence of compliance, which in fact did not answer the Bank’s concerns.338

       The Bank gave its no-objection on May 13, 2005, despite the fact that its con-
cerns had not been addressed.339 The MOHFW awarded the contract to Waters
India on June 7, 2005.340 Thus, it appears that the Bank did not follow through on
its initial concerns regarding the treatment of Indtech Analytic and Waters India
in the procurement process.

B.	 Post-Reviews
The FDCBP PAD provides that “in addition to a review of the independent self-
audit reports called for in this project, Bank staff will also conduct post-award
reviews during supervision missions.”341 The aides-mémoire show that at least six
supervision missions have been conducted under the FDCBP. However, the DIR
has found only one post-review conducted in the four years of the FDCBP, pre-
pared by the Bank’s procurement consultant over June 19–23, 2006.342

       The one post-review covered the contracts awarded by the MOHFW during
the period from April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2005.343 According to the procurement
post-review report, the Bank’s consultant reviewed eight civil works contracts, five

                    of which the DIR also reviewed, and 10 equipment contracts, four of which the
                    DIR also reviewed.344

                           As part of the procurement review, the consultant looked at ITBs, bidding doc-
                    uments, BERs, award of contract recommendations, conclusion of contracts, and
                    processing time of procurement to, among other things, “determine whether the
                    procurement procedure outline[d] in the procurement guidelines and loan/credit
                    agreement are followed.”345 Although the review was also meant to “highlight any
                    evidence that indicates fraudulent and corrupt practice in project implementation
                    that should be considered for further investigation,” the consultant reported that he
                    did not conduct an implementation review because of time restraints because of long
                    travel distances and the fact that Bank officials had not provided consignee lists.346
                    With respect to travel distances, the DIR notes that CIPL Ghaziabad, one of the sites
                    under review, was located only 30 minutes from the consultant’s work location.

                           In his post-review of the procurement process, the Bank consultant did not
                    report on certain procurement issues that might be indications of corruption. For
                    example, for the procurement of a gas chromatograph with six columns in ten-
                    der HSCC/PUR/CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, the MOHFW had overruled the BER’s
                    recommendation and awarded the contract to Perkin Elmer Instruments, even
                    though the company had not met all post-qualification criteria. A letter from the
                    MOHFW to the Bank stated that the steering committee participated in the pro-
                    curement process,347 though the DIR has not been made aware of any documenta-
                    tion supporting this fact. In the letter, the MOHFW did not indicate why it over-
                    ruled the BER recommendation and awarded the contract to Perkin Elmer Instru-
                    ments when the company was not fully compliant with all criteria. The MOHFW
                    awarded the contract to Perkin Elmer Instruments on October 29, 2004.348

                           The contract’s post-review concluded that all Bank standards had been fol-
                    lowed in the procurement.349 Thus, the Bank appears to have overlooked the fact
                    that Perkin Elmer Instruments did not satisfy all post-qualification criteria, as had
                    been reported in the BER.

       Similarly, for the procurement of an ion chromatograph in tender HSCC/PUR/
CBP(F&D)/ICB-1A/2003, the Bank’s consultant did not report any procurement
problems. In that procurement, Indtech Analytical, a higher bidder that did not
comply with all technical criteria, was awarded the contract over the lowest bidder,
Waters India, whose technical compliance was also unclear. The BER declared that
only Indtech Analytical was technically and commercially responsive, recommend-
ing it for the contract, and declared Waters India to be non-responsive with respect
to two technical parameters.350 However, the DIR’s review of the BER’s comparison
statement on technical evaluation of bids reveals that Indtech Analytical did not pro-
vide any information for eight parameters and provided information for five product
specifications that did not meet their respective parameters.351 The BER noted these
13 deviations but chose to ignore them in recommending Indtech Analytical for the
contract. In contrast, the BER disqualified the lowest bidder, Waters India, for its two
technical deviations without attempting to seek clarifications.352

       The post-review for the procurement of this item concluded that all Bank stan-
dards had been followed.353

C.	 Aides-Mémoire
The DIR reviewed six aides-mémoire of the Bank’s supervisory missions for the
FDCBP.354 Consistent with the DIR’s findings, the aides-mémoire reported long
delays associated with the procurement processes. The second aide-mémoire for
the mission that took place from November 18 to December 1, 2004, downgraded
the project’s performance rating for procurement from satisfactory to unsatis-
factory, citing poor progress in procuring equipment.355 The third aide-mémoire
also rated equipment procurement to be unsatisfactory for similar reasons, rec-
ommending that the MOHFW “urgently” address the fact that it “[i]t often takes
over six months to decide on the bids after [they] have been opened.”356 The report
added that “such delays are undermining implementation” and stated that labora-
tory effectiveness would improve once equipment was procured.357

                           The report signaled that the performance rating would change to satisfactory
                    when contracts for all procurement planned for the first two years were awarded
                    and when a full-time coordinator for the PCU was selected.358 The performance
                    rating for implementation of procurement was unsatisfactory in the February
                    2006 midterm review, again for reasons of delay.359 In the fifth aide-mémoire, Bank
                    officials upgraded the equipment performance rating for procurement from unsat-
                    isfactory to satisfactory, reporting that “equipment procurement has significantly
                    improved and equipment deliveries have begun.”360

                           With respect to equipment implementation, the first aide-mémoire identified
                    one of the several issues that the DIR detected related to maintenance: “Concern
                    was expressed by several States that reliable maintenance is often difficult to ensure
                    when equipment is procured centrally and not through State procedures.”361 Later
                    aides-mémoire also reported instances of delayed installation, non-supply of essen-
                    tial parts, and malfunction.362 However, these reports underreported the extent to
                    which problems with equipment implementation occurred.

                           For example, in the fifth and sixth aides-mémoire, Bank officials also detected
                    problems related to civil works implementation, such as utility problems, mainte-
                    nance problems, and major delays due to stopped construction.363 Despite high-
                    lighting these issues, the most recent aide-mémoire stated that “reportedly the
                    quality of works in the completed laboratories varies from fair to good; there is
                    a scope for improvement.”364 Nonetheless, despite identifying some problems, the
                    fifth and sixth aides-mémoire gave the FDCBP a moderately satisfactory perfor-
                    mance rating for implementation progress.365 Based on this, it appears that the
                    extent of civil works implementation problems as represented in the report does
                    not reflect the extent of the problems that the DIR found affecting the condition
                    of the civil works.

Overview
Project Objective
The eastern state of Orissa is one of the most impoverished states in the country. In
1998, more than 44 percent of its 31.66 million people lived below the national pov-
erty line, and they were subject to recurrent cyclones, floods, and droughts.1 Such
poverty and disaster created significant health problems: a disproportionately high
disease burden and the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the country.2
The Government of Orissa was attempting to address these problems through fis-
cal and health sector policy reform, but this work had only just begun.3

     The World Bank’s 1997 Country Assistance Strategy for India planned to use
many of the Bank’s projects to support Indian states—including the poorer states
with the worst social indicators—that were committed to change and undertaking
comprehensive economic reforms.4 The Country Assistance Strategy also empha-
sized health-care as a focus of the Bank’s poverty alleviation work, including “a
major and rapidly growing program of [International Bank of Reconstruction and
Development] / [International Development Association (IDA)] assistance to the
health sector to … above all improve health systems and institution building in

                         The Orissa Health Systems Development Project (OHSDP)—funded largely
                    by a USD 76.4 million IDA Interim Trust Fund credit—aimed to assist the Gov-
                    ernment of Orissa in improving its health resource policies and the quality and
                    coverage of the state health system.7 The project sought to achieve these goals by:
                    (1) improving the quantity and quality of the state’s health services delivery at the
                    community and secondary levels; and (2) strengthening the management capacity
                    of the state’s health system.8 The OHSDP targeted the secondary healthcare level,
                    with a special focus on safe motherhood and child survival, to complement other
                    IDA projects focusing on primary healthcare in Orissa.9


                    Summary of Findings
                    The DIR of the OHSDP found that:

                          1.	 the implementation and procurement of the OHSDP’s civil works and
                                 equipment components exhibited significant indicators of fraud, includ-
                                 ing severe construction deficiencies in buildings that construction super-
                                 visors certified as complete and up to specification; and 17 types of equip-
                                 ment that, while purportedly in compliance with technical standards, were
                                 found noncompliant or hazardous upon basic inspection;

                          2.	 there is a risk of fraud and corruption because the project audit reports
                                 identified several areas of inadequate project financial management and
                                 financial recordkeeping but did not provide a complete and transparent
                                 accounting of project expenditures; and

                          3.	 the Bank observed some of these problems in its project supervision, but
                                 its reliance on apparently incorrect Borrower-provided data appears to
                                 have delayed these observations until the project was nearly closed and it
                                 was too late to address the problems.

   Implementation of the OHSDP’s civil works and equipment components also
exhibited significant indicators of fraud. For civil works, the DIR, aided by a civil
engineer, visited 55 project hospitals; at 93 percent of them, it observed problems
like uninitiated or incomplete work, severely leaking roofs, crumbling ceilings,
molding walls, and non-functional water, sewage, and/or electrical systems. Four
hospitals were locked shut and entirely unused. Yet the construction management
consultants (CMCs) who supervised the work certified 38 of these hospitals to be
complete to project specifications, and in February 2006 the Orissa Department of
Health and Family Welfare (DOHFW) reported that work at 45 of them was com-
plete. The DIR reviewed the project documents for 21 hospitals and found 10 cases
in which the DIR’s field observations directly contradicted the CMC’s completion
certifications.

   For equipment, the DIR, aided by a biomedical engineer, inspected equipment
at project hospitals and identified 17 types of equipment that violated project
technical specifications, including five types of equipment that were hazardous.
Hazardous equipment included autoclaves (hot steam surgical equipment steril-
izers) that could explode and neonatal equipment that lacked adequate electrical
grounding, potentially exposing babies and their medical staff to electrical shocks.
These units were procured from firms whose bids either omitted required techni-
cal compliance certificates or contained certificates that appeared fraudulent. Yet
ELMARC, the firm responsible for evaluating these bids and inspecting procured
equipment, not only overlooked these problems, but also failed to respond to
equipment quality complaints sent to them by medical officers, and oversupplied
substantial amounts of equipment.

   Consistent with findings of fraud in implementation, the OHSDP’s civil works
and equipment procurements also exhibited indicators of fraud and bid rigging.
In civil works, the DOHFW conducted 12 tenders to hire architects and CMCs to
design, procure, and supervise the works; nine of these tenders exhibited indica-
tors of bid rigging. Indicators of fraud and bid rigging in the construction services
procurements included very low competition for contracts; the exclusion of low-
priced bidders in 25 percent of tenders; and contract prices that exceeded cost esti-
mates in 80 percent of tenders. In equipment procurement, ELMARC appeared to
have favored certain bidders by overlooking only some firms’ omitted documenta-
tion or permitting only certain firms to amend their otherwise losing bids.

   The DIR’s analysis of the project’s reports and assessments resulted in both pos-
itive and negative findings. The Bank’s financial management specialists appear to



                                        169
India DIR (OHSDP)


                    have been diligent in pursuing problems regarding project audit reports, though
                    these issues remain unresolved. However, none of the OHSDP’s project design
                    documents mentioned fraud and corruption as a project risk or detailed how the
                    Bank would supervise the decentralized project activities. Instead, the Bank fol-
                    lowed its stated policy of delegating almost all project monitoring and evalua-
                    tion to the Borrower, and thus relied on the DOHFW to report project progress
                    accurately.

                       The DIR’s review of the Orissa Auditor General’s OHSDP audit reports iden-
                    tified weaknesses in the project’s financial management and record keeping that
                    create a risk of fraud and corruption. The audit reports did not provide a timely,
                    complete, and transparent review of project expenditures—so much so that the
                    Bank is still awaiting audit certification of more than USD 30 million in Bank-
                    reimbursed project expenditures. The audits also state that the project routinely
                    spent far less than it requested in its budget; its certified civil works expenditures
                    do not match reported civil works activity; and its financial records lacked proper
                    balances, which are an important protection against fraudulent transactions.

                       The DIR’s project implementation findings suggest that the DOHFW either
                    was unaware of the project’s problems or chose not to report them to the Bank.
                    The Bank eventually observed and documented some of the civil works and equip-
                    ment problems that the DIR identified as indicators of underlying fraud. However,
                    because the Bank waited until the project’s final year to conduct extensive field vis-
                    its and verify the quality of reported project outputs, the institution did not learn
                    of these problems until it was too late to remedy them. This indicates a weakness in
                    the Bank’s supervision methodology that, according to project design documents,
                    has not been addressed in subsequent Indian state health projects. The OHSDP’s
                    overall rating of “moderately satisfactory” also stands in stark contrast to the sig-
                    nificant civil works and equipment problems observed by the DIR. As the Bank’s
                    project supervision team itself wrote, this suggests that the Bank’s project evalua-
                    tion metrics may place too much emphasis on statistical indicators of development
                    effect, and too little emphasis on project outputs.

Project Background

Project Design

A.	 Components
The OHSDP was composed of three components: (1) management development
and institutional strengthening; (2) improving service quality, access, and effec-
tiveness at the secondary level; and (3) improving access to basic health services
at the community level. The project’s largest component was improving service
quality, access, and effectiveness at the secondary level, comprising 46.5 percent
of project expenditures (USD 44.8 million).10 To implement this component, the
OHSDP funded the following: (1) the renovation of 32 District Headquarters Hos-
pitals (DHHs), 20 Sub-Divisional Hospitals (SDHs), and 19 Area Hospitals (AHs);
(2) the provision of new equipment for these hospitals; and (3) the improvement
of their managerial and support capacity.11

      The project’s second-largest component was improving access to basic health
services at the community level, which comprised 24 percent of project expen-
ditures (USD 23.1 million).12 Similar to the project’s secondary-level component,
implementation of the community-level component included the following: (1)
the renovation of 37 existing Community Health Centers (CHCs); (2) the expan-
sion of 48 primary health centers into larger CHCs; (3) the provision of new equip-
ment for these centers; (4) the promotion of health services in tribal areas; and (5)
the improvement of referral mechanisms between the various levels of the health
system.13

      These two components combined constituted 70.5 percent of actual project
expenditures.14 Their civil works elements comprised 39 percent of project expen-
ditures (USD 37.3 million), while hospital equipment, instruments, and furnish-
ings (EIF) accounted for 15 percent of project expenditures (USD 14.8 million).15

                          The project’s final component, management development and institutional
                    strengthening, comprised 4.5 percent of project expenditures (USD 4.3 million).16
                    It involved: (1) enhancing Orissa’s healthcare planning, management, and imple-
                    mentation capacity; and (2) strengthening the state’s hospital management sys-
                    tem and major communicable disease surveillance capacity.17 In addition to these
                    three components, the Bank reallocated approximately USD 24 million of OHSDP
                    funds to the Bank’s Indian National Polio Eradication Project.18

                    B.	 Implementation Structure
                          1.	 Project Management

                          The OHSDP was administered by a Project Management Cell (PMC), which
                    was located within Orissa’s Department of Health and Family Welfare (DOHFW)
                    and led by a Project Director.19 The PMC was responsible for routine project man-
                    agement and administration, including conducting procurement (either directly
                    or through hired agents), maintaining flow of funds and project accounts, moni-
                    toring progress, and preparing progress reports.20 To accomplish these tasks,
                    the PMC contained a five-person health unit to plan, implement, and monitor
                    health-related activities; a three-person engineering unit to manage construction
                    and maintenance; a five-person finance unit to manage project accounting; and
                    administrative staff.21

                          The PMC also supervised 30 Zilla Swasthya Samiti (district health commit-
                    tees), which were run by each district’s Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO).
                    The Zilla Swasthya Samiti oversaw the day-to-day operation of hospitals in the
                    district, including the approval of the handover of new or renovated hospitals.22

                          2.	 Procurement of Civil Works and EIF

                          Although the PMC was responsible for all OHSDP procurement activities, both
                    the DOHFW and the Bank recognized that “the PMC [did] not have the capacity to
                    undertake all civil works and EIF procurement on its own.”23 As a result, the PMC

hired Procurement Support Agencies (PSAs) to help it conduct project-related
procurement.24 To give the project a rolling start, the DOHFW hired two PSAs on
a sole-source basis for the project’s first year: the Orissa Industrial Infrastructure
Development Corporation (IDCO) was hired as the civil works PSA because it had
past Bank-project experience, while ELMARC Limited was hired as the EIF PSA
because it had experience in equipment management.25 After the first year, the
PSA contracts were to be opened to competitive bidding.26

      Because the project’s civil works component comprised many small, low-cost
construction and renovation projects, the Bank expected that most contracts would
be awarded by national competitive bidding (NCB), with between 2 percent and 5
percent procured by simpler national procurement procedures such as direct con-
tracting or comparison of three firms’ price quotations.27 None of the civil works
procurement would be conducted pursuant to international competitive bidding
(ICB), and no more than 29 percent of the civil works budget—20 contracts cost-
ing an estimated USD 11.8 million (INR 460 million)—was expected to be subject
to Bank prior-review.28 This minimized the Bank’s review of these procurements.
Similarly, EIF procurement—which was timed to correspond to completed civil
works—would be conducted by ICB only in cases of the bulk purchase of large and
more expensive equipment, such as x-ray machines and ultrasound scanners.29
Procurement of equipment costing less than USD  200,000 would be conducted
by NCB, with 15 percent of equipment procurement expected to be conducted by
simpler procurement methods.30

      The Bank planned to perform prior-review on all ICB contracts; the first two
NCB goods and works contracts; subsequent goods contracts over USD 200,000;
subsequent works contracts over USD 300,000; and consultancy contracts equal to
or exceeding USD 100,000 for firms or USD 50,000 for individuals.31

                          3.	 Implementation of Civil Works and EIF

                          The OHSDP’s implementation mechanics varied by project component. For
                    civil works, the PMC’s small engineering unit hired consultants to perform most
                    of the engineering and design work because the DOHFW lacked experience in
                    implementing such a large and complex project.32 The civil works PSAs were
                    responsible for supervising construction and as a result were called construction
                    management consultants (CMCs).

                          For EIF, the DOHFW relied on ELMARC—a state-owned enterprise that spe-
                    cialized in maintenance of professional electronic equipment—to conduct procure-
                    ment, distribution, and warranty and after-sale service.33 According to the Proj-
                    ect Implementation Plan (PIP), ELMARC was responsible for finalizing technical
                    specifications and preparing bid documents; conducting technical and commercial
                    evaluations of possible suppliers; managing tenders and purchase orders; inspect-
                    ing equipment prior to delivery to the hospitals; and supervising and certifying the
                    suppliers’ installation of the equipment.34 Because the DOHFW lacked the resources
                    necessary to repair and maintain medical equipment, ELMARC also was supposed
                    to be responsible for one-time repairs and post-warranty maintenance for procured
                    equipment.35 The only exception to this general repair obligation was that sophisti-
                    cated equipment, such as ultrasound scanners and x-ray machines, would be repaired
                    by their supplier.36

                    C.	Risks, Mitigating Measures, and Controls
                          At the time of project approval, the Bank felt that the Government of Orissa’s
                    limited management, planning, and coordination capacity—combined with the
                    state’s strained finances and unproven ability to improve its governance—posed a
                    substantial risk to the OHSDP’s success.37 Drawing on past project experience in
                    the Indian health sector, the Bank’s Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified
                    three substantial risks to the OHSDP’s success: (1) inadequate flow of funds, insuf-
                    ficient budgetary allocations, and the availability of drugs, medicine, and other
                    inputs; (2) delays in implementation because of slow procurement and recruit-
                    ment of staff; and (3) the state’s poor overall financial status.38 The Bank did not

identify fraud and corruption as risks to the project, nor did it state specific plans
for monitoring the OHSDP’s decentralized activities.

      The Bank planned to mitigate identified risks in two ways. First, the project
design incorporated PMC capacity-building elements, including: (1) giving the
PMC greater authority over project implementation; (2) establishing a computer-
ized financial management system and feedback system for project management;
(3) requiring the Government of Orissa to provide an adequate budget allocation
for both the project and the health sector; and (4) using consultants to implement
almost all of the project’s civil works and EIF activities.39

      Second, the project contained a number of controls, implemented primarily by
the PMC, to monitor the project’s progress. The PMC bore primary responsibility
for project supervision, and its monitoring was to focus on project outputs, such
as building construction, equipment provision, maintenance, staffing, quality of
services, and training.40 The PIP anticipated that the PMC would conduct three
project impact evaluations:

       ■■    An initial baseline survey;

       ■■    A mid-term review focusing on improvement in service quality and quan-
             tity, the program’s impact on the primary healthcare system, and health-
             care usage and satisfaction rates; and

       ■■    A final review focusing on the achievement of project objectives, the com-
             pletion of scheduled actions, areas in need of further work, and the proj-
             ect’s future prospects.41

      The OHSDP Credit Agreement and Project Agreement placed further respon-
sibility on the Government of Orissa and, by implication, on the PMC. The Credit
Agreement required the Government of Orissa to implement the project accord-
ing to the PIP and to maintain project records, facilitate Bank inspections of the
project, and provide regular project reports to the Bank, including a final report
after project completion.42 The Project Agreement also required the PMC and the
Government of Orissa to:

                          In contrast, the Bank’s project preparation documents did not detail the Bank’s
                    supervision activities. The Bank’s Implementation Completion Report (ICR) stated
                    that the Bank’s project supervision included regular supervision missions, pro-
                    curement post-reviews, and surveys of the use of project outputs and the impact of
                    various project measures.44

                    D.	 Costs and Time
                          The Bank expected the OHSDP to cost USD 90.7 million, of which 84 percent
                    (USD 76.4 million) would be provided by the Bank and 16 percent (USD 14.3 mil-
                    lion) by the Borrower.45 In actuality, the project cost USD 96.3 million, of which
                    the Bank provided 88 percent (USD 84.5 million) and the Borrower 12 percent
                    (USD  11.8 million).46 These figures include the reallocation of approximately
                    USD 24 million to the National Polio Eradication Project on April 1, 2004. Accord-
                    ing to the ICR, at project closure the project had disbursed a total of USD 72.58
                    million.47

                          The OHSDP was scheduled to last five-and-a-half years, but it was given two
                    12-month extensions and closed on March 31, 2006.48 In total, the Bank spent
                    USD 569,200 on project supervision, including travel and consultant costs.49 This
                    supervision proved challenging, because the OHSDP faced many difficulties over
                    its seven-and-a-half-year life.

Project Implementation
Many of the DIR’s findings—including indicators of fraud affecting the quality of
both civil works and medical equipment—were observed by the Bank’s project
supervision missions. Despite these observations, the Bank rated the project’s out-
come “moderately satisfactory.”

      After a very slow start during its first three-and-a-half years, project spend-
ing and implementation accelerated through the two extensions to project clo-
sure. This acceleration created problems in project performance, but the PMC—
for uncertain reasons—did not report them to the Bank. The Bank’s supervision
missions eventually identified some of these problems, but they did so only in the
project’s final year, when it was too late to correct them.

A.	 Natural Disasters Hampered Initial Project Implementation
      The OHSDP became effective on September 8, 1998. Slightly more than one
year later, a series of natural disasters caused severe project delays.50 In mid-Oc-
tober 1999, a cyclone with 135 mile-per-hour winds (217 km/h) made landfall in
the Orissa district of Ganjam and killed more than 150 people.51 Ten days later, an
even stronger super-cyclone with winds over 160 miles per hour (250 km/h, the
equivalent of a category 5 hurricane) made landfall in the Orissa district of Jag-
atsinghpur and killed more than 10,000 people.52 Less than two years after these
storms, persistent heavy rainfall between July and September 2001 caused Orissa
to experience its worst flooding in 50 years.53

      These storms diverted state resources from the OHSDP and caused the state
government commitment to the OHSDP to waiver.54 The government’s project
management compounded these difficulties. In early 2000, the Government of
Orissa brought in a new project official who was hostile to the program and tried
to dismiss the Project Director.55 In an effort to prevent this, the Bank: (1) gave

                    the project a satisfactory rating, despite slow progress that otherwise would merit
                    a lower rating; and (2) threatened to declare misprocurement, despite lacking a
                    legal basis for doing so, in an effort to direct the Principal Secretary’s attention to
                    the project.56 These efforts proved successful, and in 2001 the problematic official
                    was replaced.57 The Bank also increased the “intensity of its supervision” to address
                    procurement, funding, and financial management issues.58

                    B.	 Project Status at Mid-Term
                          Because of the problems plaguing the project’s early years, the OHSDP had
                    made little progress at the time of its 2002 mid-term review. After three-and-a-half
                    years, the project had disbursed only 16 percent of its funds, and USD 59.5 million
                    remained undisbursed.59 The Bank’s mid-term review stated that “implementation
                    has been considerably slower than expected,” and that “limited institutional capac-
                    ity in the [PMC] has contributed to delays,” particularly regarding the first 22 civil
                    works projects.60 In a letter to the Government of Orissa accompanying its Mid-
                    Term Review Aide-Mémoire, the Bank stated that “expeditious action” was needed
                    to ensure that the project would be completed in time.61 Yet despite these issues,
                    the mid-term review concluded that implementation had been “satisfactory over-
                    all,” save for a three-month period between December 1999 and March 2000.62

                          The mid-term review expressed guarded hope for the project’s future, noting
                    that implementation progress “ha[d] picked up considerably since July 2001.”63 The
                    PMC reported that civil works progress was slow—16 hospitals were complete, 131
                    renovations begun, and 10 not yet started—but it had restructured its efforts and
                    hired five CMCs in an attempt to speed completion.64 EIF activity was delayed
                    because it was coordinated with completed civil works, but the PMC stated that it
                    had: (1) performed initial procurement for 76 hospitals; (2) finalized procurement
                    plans for the other hospitals; and (3) rescheduled those procurements to match the
                    revised civil works schedule.65

      The Bank noted, however, that the PMC needed additional funding and staff—
particularly in its engineering unit—for its plans to succeed.66 The Bank also expressed
concern that the PMC was paying insufficient attention to maintaining equipment,
training staff in the use of equipment, and training PMC staff to use the project’s
electronic financial management system.67 These concerns would recur.

C.	 Continued Implementation Delays
      By May 2003—just nine months before project closure—the OHSDP’s spend-
ing was still extremely low. It had disbursed only 25 percent of its credit, and the
Bank found its disbursement rate “to be low and unsatisfactory.”68 Despite this lack
of spending, the PMC reported progress: in civil works, 68 hospitals were com-
plete, 86 other renovations had begun, and contracts were issued for the remaining
three hospitals; in EIF, INR 605 million in procurement was planned for the next
10 months.69 The Bank rated implementation progress satisfactory, but this rating
relied entirely on PMC reports: the Bank’s May 2003 Aide-Mémoire stated that “no
physical verification of the assets created out of the proceeds of the credit has been
done [to] date, but a proposal has been made to carry out such verification in FY
2003–04.”70 The PMC also reported that its computerized financial management
system failed because of poor consultant performance and a lack of staff capacity;
future reports were done in a simplified manual manner.71

      The OHSDP’s implementation delays led the Government of Orissa to request
a project extension.72 The Bank conditioned its consideration of the request on the
achievement, by September 2003, of a set of project benchmarks that included: (1)
maintaining a consistent, adequate, and timely flow of funds; (2) awarding all con-
tracts for procurement of goods and EIF by November 30, 2003; (3) conducting
workshops with informal service providers in two districts; and (4) fully staffing
the PMC.73

this scale—moderately satisfactory and moderately unsatisfactory—between satisfactory and unsatisfactory.

                          The project failed to meet most of these benchmarks.74 In its October 2003
                    review, the Bank lowered the project’s implementation rating to unsatisfactory
                    because:

                                   ed.75 As a result, total project disbursements stood at 26.5 percent, which
                                   the Bank rated unsatisfactory and flagged as a problem.76

                           ■■      The PMC allowed the contracts for three CMCs—MECON, the Orissa
                                   Construction Corporation Limited (OCCL), and the Senior Consultants
                                   Advising Group (SCAG)—to lapse.77 MECON and SCAG withdrew from
                                   the project on September 30, 2003, while OCCL gave notice that it would
                                   withdraw on October 31, 2003.78 The small PMC engineering unit assumed
                                   their responsibilities.79

                           ■■      The PMC remained inadequately staffed, project training activities were
                                   delayed, and equipment repair in 14 districts was incomplete.80

                          Despite all these difficulties and the project’s unsatisfactory implementation
                    rating, the Bank rated as satisfactory the project’s achievement of its development
                    objectives because “although the project has been able to put in place relatively
                    modest improvements, the unmet need in the state is so great that the project has
                    had great developmental impact.”81

                    D.	 The First Extension
                          In December 2003, an internal Bank memorandum generated as part of an
                    Indian health sector portfolio performance review recommended that, given
                    the project’s partially unsatisfactory rating and low disbursement rate, the Bank
                    should refuse to extend the OHSDP and close it as scheduled.82 The Bank reit-

erated this position in its meetings with the Government of India, arguing that
“current performance does not support possibility of extension,” but it agreed to a
January 2004 review to resolve the issue.83 The DIR received no records regarding
this review or any other indication that it occurred.

      On February 9, 2004—two months before scheduled project closure—the Gov-
ernment of India formally requested a two-year extension of the OHSDP.84 The
OHSDP had been a problem project since October 2003, its implementation prog-
ress was unsatisfactory, and it had five project risk flags—financial management,
financial performance, slow disbursement, management problems, and procure-
ment problems.85 The most recent project audit was overdue, and only 33 percent
of the project credit had been disbursed.86 Project implementation had improved,
but the Bank’s task team worried that the Government of Orissa “appears to lack
commitment towards supporting implementation and capacity strengthening
needed to restructure and fully utilize the project funds. … Based on the status of
progress to date, the task team is not confident that the state government has suffi-
cient and necessary commitment to implement the project even if it is extended.”87
An upcoming election in Orissa would further delay any project restructuring.88

      Despite these challenges, the task team favored attempting to finish the Bank’s
work in Orissa because the state government could not finish incomplete works
with its own funds.89 The task team recommended extending the project for
nine months—to complete ongoing works and finance awarded contracts—and
transferring the project’s approximately USD 24 million in savings to the Indian
National Polio Eradication Project (NPEP).90 The Bank formally proposed a one-
year extension to finish project activities in exchange for the project’s meeting a set
of conditions. The DOFHW agreed and the extension was approved on March 31,
2004.91 On April 1, 2004, the Bank transferred USD 24 million to the NPEP.92

                    E.	 Reported Performance Improvements
                           After the extension, the PMC consistently reported improvements in project
                    performance. In May 2004, the Bank lifted project risk flags regarding financial
                    management, financial performance, and project management because the PMC
                    delivered an overdue audit report and reported improvements in project spend-
                    ing, flow of funds, and the completion of planned project activities.93 The PMC
                    also informed the Bank that it had made progress in civil works, completing 118
                    hospitals and handing 75 over to local CDMOs.94

                           The Bank’s May 2004 project supervision review expressed concern with the
                    implementation of other project components and continued to rate the project’s
                    implementation progress as unsatisfactory.95 Despite PMC commitments to the
                    contrary, procurement was lagging severely: INR 86 million (USD 1.9 million) in
                    drug contracts and INR 222 million (USD 4.9 million) in EIF contracts had been
                    awaiting award since December 2003.96 These delays were caused by a state gov-
                    ernment decision to freeze project implementation in late 2003 pending the Bank’s
                    project extension decision.97

                           The PMC, however, continued to report improved performance. In September
                    2004, the Bank upgraded the OHSDP’s implementation progress rating to satis-
                    factory because the pace of civil works had “increased substantially”—the PMC
                    reported that 123 hospitals were complete; 94 hospitals were handed over; the
                    CMC’s contracts were extended; and a long-term maintenance and repair plan
                    had been drafted.98 EIF procurement remained delayed—149 NCB and local shop-
                    ping contracts worth INR 190 million (USD 4.2 million) awaited award—but by
                    mid-November 2004 the PMC reported awarding 125 NCB and local shopping
                    contracts worth INR 238 million (USD 5.3 million).99

                           In December 2004, the Bank rated all project elements as satisfactory and lifted
                    all project problem flags.100 The PMC reported that all but 29 project hospitals had
                    been completed and that bottlenecks regarding electrical and water connections

were mostly resolved.101 December 2004 also marked the first time that the Bank
noted problems with the quality of the civil works.102 In its Aide-Mémoire, the Bank
stated that several of the hospitals it visited had been completed for more than a
year before but were not operational because of a lack of electricity or water.103 One
hospital, which the contractor claimed could be completed by the end of January
2005, likely could not be finished on time.104 The task team realized that this fore-
warned of a potentially significant problem: “If facilities are not fully built by the
end-of-project date, there will be great difficulties in completing them later on.
The mission reiterated that the Bank would reimburse only those activities and
services completed before project closure. There are certainly other facilities, not
visited, which also have these problems. They must be addressed urgently.”105

F.	        The Second Extension
       On February 4, 2005—two months before the end of the first extension—
the Government of India formally requested a second one-year extension of the
OHSDP to complete the project’s planned work.106 The request enclosed a letter
from the OHSDP Project Director that detailed the project’s planned spending
for the extension year, but not its implementation plans.107 Expected expenses
included INR 309.5 million for “procurement of EIF for project and non-project
hospitals”; the inclusion of non-project hospitals may extend beyond the proj-
ect’s scope.108 Based on the PMC’s reports of project progress, the opportunity
for the OHSDP to finish its work, and the extension period’s opportunity “for
IDA’s continued engagement with Orissa,” the Bank approved the extension on
March 28, 2005.109

                    G.	 Site Reviews and Implementation Quality Concerns
                           In mid-2005, after six years and two project extensions, the Bank began to visit
                    and report on project sites extensively. The problems it found led it to downgrade
                    the OHSDP’s implementation progress rating to moderately unsatisfactory.110

                           The PMC reported that the OHSDP’s civil works were mostly complete, with all
                    but 19 hospitals complete; transformers installed in all but 133 hospitals and con-
                    nected to the power grid in all but 72 hospitals; and water supply provided in all
                    but 98 hospitals.111 It also claimed to have a plan for long-term civil works mainte-
                    nance.112 The Bank, however, found that OHSDP-funded hospitals and equipment
                    often had not been commissioned or were improperly cared for.113 In June and July
                    2005, Bank architectural consultant Rakesh Sahni visited 10 hospitals and found
                    numerous problems, including that all 10 hospitals lacked installed and function-
                    ing generators and transformers; nine hospitals lacked functioning water sup-
                    plies; five hospitals’ civil works were incomplete; three hospitals lacked complete
                    installation of doors, windows, and tiles; and one hospital had deficient structural
                    cement and concrete.114 Sahni concluded that the status of four hospitals—DHH
                    Angul, DHH Bhadrak, CHC-I Chandabali, and SDH Nilgiri—was so poor that
                    the PMC should rescind their contracts because the work could not be completed
                    before project closure.115

                           Similarly, the PMC reported that EIF implementation largely was finished, with
                    equipment training planned and outstanding procurement of drugs and EIF either
                    completed or under way.116 The PMC did, however, admit that maintenance was
                    insufficient because, while it had prepared a maintenance and equipment manual,
                    it lacked funds to perform actual maintenance work.117

                           In contrast to the PMC’s statements of progress, Dr. David Porter, the Bank’s
                    biomedical engineering consultant, visited Bhubaneswar’s capital hospital and
                    Sakhopal’s Area Hospital and identified more than a dozen equipment problems
                    at the two hospitals, including the non-use of an x-ray machine, defibrillator, and
                    ventilator; unresolved technical problems preventing the use of a heart stress test-

ing device; improper installation of operating lamps and the electrical cable for an
air conditioner; the installation and handover of a radiology machine without any
performance or safety testing; and extremely poor cleaning and maintenance of an
incubator, a radiant warmer, and a phototherapy unit.118 Dr. Porter also noted that—
contrary to the PIP, Project Agreement, and Credit Agreement—the PMC had failed
to make ELMARC contractually responsible for equipment maintenance.119

       The Bank’s December 2005 supervision mission retained the project’s mod-
erately unsatisfactory implementation rating.120 The PMC stated that it would
complete 10 of the remaining civil works but three would not be complete until
after project closure and two—CHC-I Chandabali and SDH Nilagiri—would be
cancelled.121 The PMC reported progress in water and power supply as well: it
stated that water was supplied at 122 hospitals and transformers were installed in
133 hospitals, 113 of which were connected to the power grid.122

       The PMC also reported that EIF procurement was almost complete and that
ELMARC had conducted a physical verification of equipment installation at 121
OHSDP-funded hospitals.123 ELMARC’s interim findings identified failures of
equipment installation and use at some sites, but the Bank expressed

                    March 2006, in its final project review before closure, the Bank raised the project’s
                    implementation progress and financial management ratings to moderately satis-
                    factory.126 This increase from moderately unsatisfactory was not caused by recent
                    performance improvements; rather, the Bank raised the ratings because of “the
                    remarkable progress on implementation during the last three years, and based on
                    the assessment of the overall project[.]”127

                           The PMC reported continuing progress on civil works, with only seven hos-
                    pitals still incomplete.128 No progress was made on transformer installation, and
                    equipment was not installed in hospitals without adequate power or water.129 The
                    PMC also reported that EIF procurement was complete; however, the Bank also
                    reported the findings of an equipment survey that it conducted between January
                    and February 2006: equipment that was operational amounted to only 40 percent
                    of the total economic value of equipment, and 15 percent of major equipment
                    (worth 4.4 percent of total equipment costs) was below acceptable quality levels.130
                    The Bank further noted that the project still had not made progress in developing
                    an equipment maintenance plan.131 The OHSDP closed on March 31, 2006.132

                    H.	 Project Evaluation
                           On balance, the Bank’s evaluation considered the project troubled but ultimately
                    successful. The Bank’s ICR rated the OHSDP’s project outcome as moderately sat-
                    isfactory because, in the Bank’s judgment, the project’s indicators—which tracked
                    health and health-care usage statistics, budget allocations, passage of new policies,
                    and medical facility staffing rates—performed positively.133 The ICR’s project out-
                    come evaluation did not weigh heavily the project’s civil works and EIF outputs.
                    However, their problems contributed to its assessment of a moderate overall risk
                    to the sustainability of the OHSDP’s development outcomes.134

       The Bank reported civil works implementation to be successful: the ICR stated,
based on PMC reports, that all hospitals had been physically completed (save
two under litigation), with five finished after project closure using government
funds.135 While completion of electricity connections and water supply was ongo-
ing at some hospitals, the project reportedly provided transformers to all medical
centers to provide an “uninterrupted” power supply.136 The project provided 20
percent more bed space than the 3,007 beds planned in the PIP, and new labor
rooms and operation theaters were constructed in 140 hospitals and renovated in
the remainder.137 A Bank review indicated that only about 10 percent of the works
were below “acceptable” condition, as determined by “a superficial assessment of
the status of floors, walls, fabric, roofing, woodwork, windows, paintwork, etc.”138

       The ICR also noted the EIF problems observed in the PMC’s equipment survey,
adding that warranties had expired for approximately 22 percent of the procured
EIF goods.139 Despite the failure of the computerized financial management sys-
tem, the ICR rated financial management to be satisfactory because accounts were
still maintained and manually generated reports were submitted monthly.140

       The ICR attributed delays in the OHSDP’s civil works progress to initial delays
by IDCO and the PMC’s insufficient staffing and oversight capacity.141 It concluded
that the project’s EIF problems were caused primarily by delays in EIF procure-
ment, which in turn resulted from delays in civil works completion.142 But as
detailed below, the DIR found indicators that the PMC’s reported civil works and
EIF accomplishments were overstated and that the civil works and EIF problems
noted by the Bank’s supervision missions involved indicators of fraud.

                        The DIR’s Approach to the
                        OHSDP
                        The DIR reviewed the OHSDP because, during the Department of Institutional
                        Integrity’s (INT) investigation into the Bank’s Reproductive and Child Health Proj-
                        ect, a firm admitted paying INR 500,000 (USD 11,000) to the Orissa State Minister
                        of Health and other ministry officials to facilitate the payment of INR 2.5 million
                        (USD 55,500) in non-Bank-funded invoices.143 In addition, the Bank had received
                        four complaints alleging collusion and corrupt practices by OHSDP bidders and
                        PSA officials.144 Including the OHSDP in the DIR also brought a state-specific proj-
                        ect within the DIR’s scope; this is significant because state-specific projects are an
                        increasingly significant feature of the Bank’s lending to India and its health sector.

                             Pursuant to its risk-driven methodology, the DIR selected areas to review based
                        on an analysis of the project’s fiduciary and development risks. By focusing on
                        high-risk areas, the DIR maximized its ability to identify indicators of fraudulent
                        or corrupt schemes that could significantly affect the project’s outcomes. The DIR’s
                        risk analysis and areas of focus are detailed in Table 1.

       After identifying these areas of focus, the DIR conducted distinct reviews of
implementation and procurement for civil works and equipment.

A.	 Implementation
       To review project implementation, the DIR conducted site visits to a selection
of OHSDP-funded hospitals, emphasizing: (1) hospitals of different sizes; (2) hos-
pitals in diverse geographic areas, including tribal areas; (3) remote hospitals; and
(4) hospitals that the Bank had not visited in its supervision missions. The DIR
also intentionally revisited some hospitals seen by Bank supervision missions to
determine whether previously identified problems had been remedied.

       In total, the DIR visited 55 OHSDP-funded hospitals in 23 districts, representing
35 percent of all project sites.145 These visits included 59 percent of all renovated Dis-
trict Headquarter Hospitals (DHHs; 19 of 32), 53 percent of all renovated Area Hos-
pitals (AHs; 10 of 19), and approximately 25 percent of all renovated Sub Divisional
Hospitals (SDHs; 5 of 20) and Community Health Centers (CHCs; 21 of 85).

       The DIR visited sites whose civil works were managed by each of the CMCs,
including:

        ■■    48 percent of the hospitals managed by OCCL (11 of 23);

        ■■    45 percent of the hospitals managed by IDCO (23 of 51);

        ■■    31 percent of the hospitals managed by K.K. Agrawal (10 of 32);

        ■■    27 percent of the hospitals managed by SCAG (8 of 29); and

        ■■    9 percent of the hospitals managed by MECON (2 of 22).146

                       At each hospital, the DIR met with the most senior medical official present to
                    obtain their comments regarding the state of the hospital, its equipment, and the
                    OHSDP’s outcomes. This included discussions regarding hospital staffing, patient
                    and medical procedure volume, civil works and equipment issues, and the medical
                    officials’ impressions of the project and the CMC in charge of the work at their hos-
                    pital. The DIR also reviewed any written complaints in the medical official’s pos-
                    session. After this meeting, the DIR—accompanied by medical officials—toured
                    the site and observed its condition. These site visits focused on issues expected to
                    be high risks in Orissa, such as water leakage and construction material quality, as
                    well as issues given high priority in the project, such as biomedical waste manage-
                    ment and the provision of adequate power and water supplies.

                       As part of its site visits, the DIR inspected equipment present in the hospi-
                    tals, focusing on equipment in the operating theaters, delivery suites, laboratories,
                    x-ray facilities, and storage rooms. Equipment was examined to determine whether
                    it met the bid documents’ technical specifications; had been installed properly;
                    and was in use. The DIR paid particular attention to equipment that the hospitals’
                    medical officials identified as problematic. The DIR was unable to examine some
                    equipment because it was kept in locked storage.

                       The DIR retained two expert consultants—a civil engineer and a biomedical
                    engineer—to assist with these site visits and provide their professional opinions
                    regarding the condition of the hospitals and their equipment.

                       Prior to conducting its field visits, the DIR obtained the OHSDP acting Proj-
                    ect Director’s written authorization to visit the project hospitals of its choice. The
                    Project Director promised to have the OHSDP’s junior engineer accompany the
                    DIR on its site reviews and to provide two vehicles and drivers to transport the
                    DIR review staff. Unfortunately, the vehicles were not delivered (the DIR hired
                    local cars instead), and the OHSDP junior engineer participated only in the first
                    day’s hospital visits because, after receiving significant verbal criticism from the
                    doctors at DHH Dhenkanal and SDH Kamakhyanagar, he told the DIR that he was
                    a volunteer and preferred to not participate in future visits.

B.	 Contract Procurement
       The DIR performed a review of all of the 502 OHSDP contracts, worth USD 46.7
million, for which the DIR obtained contract documents.147 The DIR performed
detailed reviews of bid documents, bid evaluation reports, and contracts for:

       ■■   All design, architect, and CMC consultant procurements;

       ■■   A selection of 52 civil works contracts (33.5 percent of all civil works con-
            tracts) that included all five CMCs and 25 contracts on which the DIR had
            conducted implementation reviews;148 and

       ■■   33 equipment contracts for a variety of equipment types that had been
            identified: (1) in complaints; (2) in ELMARC’s 2006 equipment survey as
            exhibiting quality issues; or (3) as exhibiting fraud and corruption indica-
            tors by the DIR’s broader contract data analysis.

       For these selected contracts, the DIR integrated its review of contract docu-
ments with its analytical reviews of contract data. In order to detect patterns indi-
cating possible fraud or corruption, the DIR analyzed this information both within
each tender and across tenders. The DIR did not review any local contracts related
to the OHSDP.

       The DIR’s review of OHSDP procurement was frustrated by delays in obtaining
OHSDP contract documents and compiling their data for analysis. In late Sep-
tember 2006, the Government of Orissa agreed to send all OHSDP contract docu-
ments to the DIR’s New Delhi facility. A month later, however, the government
reversed its position and refused to: (1) send original documents to New Delhi
because of an ongoing audit and delivery logistics concerns; or (2) provide the
DIR with photocopies because of the number of contracts involved. After a week
of negotiations, in early November the Government of Orissa agreed to permit the
DIR to scan all of the documents in Orissa using DIR staff and equipment. The
DIR scanned the contract documents in December and completed data entry in
February 2007—two months later than the other DIR projects.




147	
    These included 155 civil works contracts worth USD 30.9 million, 183 EIF contracts worth USD 12.1
million, and 147 drugs contracts worth USD 3.6 million. The U.S. Dollar value is calculated using the market
exchange rate on the date of the contract.
148	
    The targeted review included 57 percent of IDCO’s contracts (28 of 49); 27 percent of SCAG’s contracts
(eight of 29); 22 percent of K.K. Agrawal and OCCL’s contracts (seven of 32 and five of 23, respectively); and 18
percent of MECON’s contracts (four of 22).

                    C.	 Project Reports and Assessments
                           The DIR reviewed the Government of Orissa-generated OHSDP project audit
                    reports from the 2002 project mid-term to 2006, as well as a supplemental audit
                    report for 1999–2003. To date, the Bank has not received the OHSDP supplemen-
                    tal project audit reconciling previously uncertified expenditures.149

                           The DIR also reviewed the OHSDP’s design, supervision, and evaluation docu-
                    ments. These included the PAD, PIP, Aides-Mémoire, Project Status Reports, Imple-
                    mentation Status Reports, the ICR, available procurement post-review reports,
                    and available project audit correspondence. The DIR analyzed these materials
                    to understand how the Bank assessed fraud and corruption risks in the project’s
                    design and to determine whether the indicators of fraud and corruption identified
                    by the DIR were captured and addressed by the Bank’s supervision systems.




                    Findings

                    Civil Works
                    The DIR’s review of the OHSDP’s civil works component found numerous indi-
                    cators of fraud in its implementation and procurement. In implementation, the
                    DIR observed significant civil works problems at 93 percent of the hospitals that
                    it visited. Of these 55 hospitals, 54 had construction problems in their newly built
                    or renovated portions; all 55 exhibited signs of water damage that caused mold
                    and sometimes structural damage; 51 had problems with their electrical systems;
                    33 had problems with their water supply; 38 had problems with their sewage and
                    drainage systems; and four were locked shut and entirely unused. To evaluate
                    whether these implementation problems were indicators of fraudulent practices,
                    the DIR reviewed the PMC’s project documents regarding the 21 hospitals exhibit-
                    ing the most severe civil works problems. In almost half these cases, the documents
                    included CMC certifications that the hospital’s civil works—which the DIR found
                    seriously deficient—were complete and up to specification. These inconsistencies
                    are a strong indicator of fraudulent practices, and their frequency suggests that

some of the problems observed at other hospitals may be indicators of fraudulent
practices as well.

       In procurement, five of the DOHFW’s seven design consultant procurements
exhibited indicators that the DOHFW manipulated bidders’ technical evalua-
tions to determine tender results and/or create the appearance of competition.
Four of the DOHFW’s five CMC procurements exhibited similar indicators that
the DOHFW manipulated bidders’ technical evaluations to shape tender results.
Moreover, the CMC-conducted contractor procurements were marked by four
indicators of fraud and bid rigging: (1) extremely low competition; (2) the frequent
disqualification of low bidders, which resulted in 25 percent of contracts not being
awarded to the lowest bidder; (3) contract prices that exceeded cost estimates in
80 percent of tenders; and (4) multiple contractors that repeatedly subcontracted
their work without PMC approval.

A.	 Indicators of Fraud in Civil Works Implementation
       The DIR visited 55 hospitals that were physically upgraded by the OHSDP. In
February 2006, the PMC informed the Bank that the civil works at 92 percent of
all project hospitals—and 82 percent of the hospitals visited by the DIR (45 of
55)—were complete.150 At 69 percent of the hospitals visited by the DIR (38 of
55), the CMCs had certified in writing that the civil works had been completed
in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.151 However, contrary to
these representations and certifications, at 93 percent of the hospitals that it visited
(51 of 55), the DIR observed significant civil works deficiencies—such as work not
started or finished, crumbling ceilings, molding walls, and frequently failing elec-
trical systems—that suggested that the civil works were either incomplete or not
performed to required specifications.152

       In addition, four of the sites visited by the DIR were locked shut and unused,
and an additional 12 sites had extensions or other portions that were locked shut
and unused. The reasons for this non-use varied from incomplete work that was
not handed over to the medical officer for use, to the local medical officer’s refusal

    See, e.g., Handing Over Report of OHSDP Work, DHH Angul (Oct. 31, 2006) (certifying that work was
“completed and handed over … and that there have been no material deviation[s] from the sanctioned plan and
specification other than those sanctioned by competent authority”).
152	
    The four hospitals where the DIR did not observe severe civil works problems were Capital Hospital in Bhu-
baneswar, DHH Jharsuguda, CHC-II Loisinga, and CHC-I Sohella. The DIR was unable to view all of the civil
works performed at Capital Hospital, and its assessment of the state of the hospital’s civil works is based solely on
those works that were observed.

                    to accept what he considered to be substandard work, to a lack of functional water
                    and power, to insufficient numbers of hospital staff. But in all 16 of these cases, the
                    locked and unused spaces were stocked with EIF and other medical supplies.

                        There are many possible reasons for these civil works implementation failures,
                    including a lack of local capacity or poor contractor performance. Further, the
                    completion certificates signed by the CMCs sometimes stated that only portions of
                    the planned works were complete. To evaluate whether the implementation prob-
                    lems observed by the DIR could be considered indicators of underlying fraud, the
                    DIR examined construction records for the 21 hospitals exhibiting the most seri-
                    ous implementation problems. These hospitals spanned all five CMCs, and the
                    DIR’s document review found that 10 of them exhibited strong indications of fraud
                    by at least the CMCs (the documentation for the remaining hospitals was incon-
                    clusive on this issue). Therefore, at least some of the many problems observed at
                    the visited hospitals are indicators of fraud.

                        1.	 The CMCs and the DIR’s Review of Their Work

                        Five CMCs worked on the OHSDP: K.K. Agrawal & Associates (K.K. Agrawal);
                    MECON Ltd. (MECON); the Orissa Construction Corporation, Ltd. (OCCL);
                    the Orissa Industrial Development Corporation (IDCO); and Senior Consul-
                    tants Advising Group (SCAG). Their civil works implementation responsibilities
                    included:

                         ■■   Monitoring and supervising construction activities;

                         ■■   Ensuring the quality of work and materials, which included daily checks
                              of the strength of concrete and the composition of cement mortar and
                              render;

                         ■■   Providing physical and financial progress reports to the PMC;

                         ■■   Certifying the completion of the works, which included inspecting the
                              works and any needed remedial works; and

                         ■■   Certifying contractors’ interim and final bills and recommending their
                              payment.153

                        The DIR’s review of civil works encompassed 55 hospitals supervised by all
                    five CMCs in 24 different districts, on which the OHSDP spent INR 1.48 billion
                    (USD 33 million).

       2.	 The DIR Observed Widespread Civil Works Problems

       The civil works problems observed by the DIR fall into seven categories: (1)
construction and renovation problems; (2) water damage; (3) electrical problems;
(4) water supply, drainage, and sewerage problems; (5) locked and unused facili-
ties; (6) medical waste and containment problems; and (7) hospital maintenance
problems.154 Details regarding their frequency and severity are presented below.

       Construction and Renovation Problems. Of the 55 sites the DIR visited, 98 per-
cent (54 of 55) exhibited problems with new construction and 93 percent (51 of 55)
exhibited problems with renovations. Problems with fixtures, such as windows,
doors, and their frames, were identified at 62 percent of the visited hospitals (34
of 55), while problems with cement render (or plaster) and concrete quality were
found at 71 percent of the visited hospitals (39 of 55).

       Many of these hospitals were built several years before the DIR’s visit, and the
DIR expected them to exhibit some deterioration because of the extreme heat and
rain that occurs in Orissa. However, a civil engineer assisting the DIR stated that
the observed deterioration was so great that relatively new buildings appeared to
be over 30 years old, thus suggesting underlying construction problems. The engi-
neer further estimated that the poor-quality materials and work observed may
shorten the useful lives of these buildings by as much as 50–75 percent. In total,
the OHSDP spent approximately USD 13.1 million on the construction and reno-
vation of these sites.

       The following are examples of the types of construction and renovation prob-
lems observed by the DIR:

        ■■    At SDH Athgarh, the steel windows, window frames, window grates, and
              door frames were rusting. The civil engineer assisting the DIR concluded
              that such rusting indicates the contractor’s failure to follow project techni-
              cal specifications by protecting the metal window-work with three coats
              of paint, in addition to one coat of antirust paint.155 (See Photograph 1 on
              page 277.)

        ■■    At AH Baramba, the DIR observed construction equipment, supplies, and
              debris littering the area around the old hospital premises. Medical officials
              informed the DIR that the contractor abandoned its renovation work in

154	
    Eight contractors worked on more than one hospital visited by the DIR. The DIR reviewed the problems
identified at these hospitals to determine whether these eight contractors exhibited particular patterns of prob-
lems, but no such patterns existed in this group of contractors.

                                  tal. (See Photograph 2 on page 277.)

                            ■■    At AH Bolagarh, many walls exhibited cracks and discoloration indica-
                                  tive of water damage and mold. Joints between the old and new buildings
                                  appeared improperly sealed and exhibited signs of water leakage. The oper-
                                  ating theater was locked and unused, and the cement render on the walls
                                  in the operating theater and labor suite was cracking and crumbled easily
                                  upon contact. A concrete ramp wide enough to accommodate a motor
                                  vehicle had been constructed to the roof for no clear purpose. Project doc-
                                  umentation suggests that the OHSDP never fully funded the expansion of
                                  the hospital to accommodate 30 beds; rather, an expansion of the wards
                                  for 10 beds was to be funded by another source—BMS—and, when this
                                  funding did not materialize, the extra space was not provided.156

                            ■■    At SDH Kuchinda, some hallways and rooms in the new building exten-
                                  sion had cracks in the walls that were long, deep, and appeared to be caus-
                                  ing render to fall out in large pieces. The new operating theater had not
                                  been completed and was unused. Similarly, some ceilings in the new sec-
                                  tion of the hospital remained unfinished, and the exposed steel rebar was
                                  rusting. Construction debris, including a rusting concrete mixer, was left
                                  on the site. (See Photograph 3 on page 278.)

                            ■■    At AH Nimapara, medical officials told the DIR that the building leaked
                                  severely during the monsoon season. The DIR also observed large cracks
                                  in the cement render near the front of the hospital. According to the civil
                                  engineer assisting the DIR, these cracks—which formed at the inter-
                                  face between the wall brickwork and the concrete support columns and
                                  beams—are caused by excessive shrinkage of the brickwork. The project
                                  specifications provided that: (1) prior to installation, the bricks used in the
                                  hospitals were to be soaked in water for six hours; (2) mortar of a specific
                                  cement-to-sand ratio was to be used; and (3) brickwork was to be cured
                                  by spraying walls with water three times a day for 10 days and then twice a
                                  day for three weeks.157 The engineer stated that the cracks observed by the

            DIR likely were caused by contractors who ignored these specifications to
            save costs; as a result, their bricks absorbed water from the surrounding
            mortar, the brickwork shrank, and the walls cracked.

       ■■   At CHC Soro, the upper walls and ceilings of the new building exhibited
            water damage from leaks, but the old building—which officials stated was
            built in 1947—had no similar problems. In addition, renovations to the
            health center’s old diarrhea ward were not performed. Despite being sur-
            rounded on three sides by in-use portions of the health center, it sat filled
            with EIF waste and appeared to be slowly decaying. (See Photograph 4 on
            page 278. For a further example of observed construction problems, see
            Photograph 5 on page 279.)

       Water Damage. The DIR observed water damage at all of the 55 hospitals that
it visited. This water damage ranged from visible mold on the interior and exterior
of walls and on ceilings to cement rendering falling from walls because dampness
penetrated beneath it.158

       The following are examples of the types of water damage problems observed
by the DIR:

       ■■   At CHC-II Garposh, the DIR observed very large cracks in the walls and
            pillars throughout the hospital that appear to have been caused by water
            penetrating the concrete. (See Photograph 6 on page 279.)

       ■■   At AH Kesinga and CHC-II Ullunda, the civil engineer assisting the DIR
            observed that the concrete and cement rendering used at the hospital
            likely included too little cement and/or was not cured long enough—both
            practices violate project technical specifications and are used by contrac-
            tors to cut costs.159 As a result, walls and ceilings were cracking, and tiles
            were falling off of the newly constructed walls. The engineer observed that
            some of the concrete was so weak—for example, near the surface water
            drain—that large pieces could be cut away with a pocket knife. (See Pho-
            tographs 7 and 8 on page 280.)

       ■■   At CHC-II Pottangi, the hospital’s exterior walls—and several interior
            walls—exhibited significant amounts of discoloration from mold. Medical

    Because these hospitals mostly were in use, the DIR did not take concrete samples for laboratory testing.
This would, however, be done as part of any follow-up investigations.
159	
    Concrete and cement render are composed of a combination of cement, water, and aggregate like rock, sand,
or gravel. The concrete mix was supposed to contain one part cement, three parts sand, and six parts aggregate,
and was supposed to be cured for seven days. See, e.g., Baragarh Bill of Quantities, item 94.

                             officials also informed the DIR that the protective canopy over the open
                             sides of a downward-sloping walkway between the outpatient unit and
                             the patient wards and operating theater was too small; as a result, during
                             the monsoon season rain fell onto the walkway, flowed into the outpatient
                             unit and operating theater, and flooded them.

                        ■■   At SDH Talcher, medical officials informed the DIR that the roofs of both
                             the new building and renovated parts of the old building leaked signifi-
                             cantly. The DIR observed discoloration from water damage and mold on
                             these buildings’ ceilings and walls. The civil engineer assisting the DIR
                             stated that these roof leaks were caused by contractors’ failure to use the
                             specified type of concrete and waterproofing methods in order to save
                             costs. (For a further example of observed water damage, see Photograph 9
                             on page 281.)

                       Electrical Problems. The DIR observed problems with the electrical systems at
                    93 percent of the hospitals that it visited (51 of 55), though the severity of the
                    problems varied among them. Problems with diesel generators were identified at
                    71 percent of the hospitals visited (39 of 55): generators were not supplied to two
                    hospitals and were delivered but not installed at 37 other hospitals. Similarly, the
                    DIR found that the transformer was not installed in 11 hospitals and was not sup-
                    plied to two other hospitals.

                       The following are examples of the types of electrical problems observed by
                    the DIR:

                        ■■   At CHC-II Kanpur, CHC-II Rairakhol, and CHC-II Charmal, the gen-
                             erator was not installed. Medical officials informed the DIR that during
                             the hospitals’ frequent power outages they treated patients and delivered
                             babies by lamplight.

                        ■■   At SDH Kamakhyanagar, the hospital did not receive a generator, and
                             while its transformer was properly installed and connected to the electri-
                             cal grid, it was not connected to the hospital. Instead, the transformer pro-
                             vided power to neighboring houses. The hospital went without electricity.

                        ■■   At CHC-I Loisinga, power was connected and building wiring appeared
                             generally well installed. However, the DIR noted that some fixtures were
                             missing, and medical officials stated that the power supply was unreliable
                             and, as a result, the operating theater often could not be used.




                                                             198
                                                                          Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


       ■■   At AH Podagada, medical officials informed the DIR that power was
            connected and working reasonably well. However, some fuse boxes were
            uncovered, and the power supplied was not three-phase power and could
            not power some OHSDP-provided equipment. The DIR observed that the
            hospital’s wiring was well executed but that it lacked a generator. (See Pho-
            tograph 10 on page 281 .)

       ■■   At DHH Sundargarh, some internal wiring appeared improvised and pos-
            sibly dangerous. In addition, main power lines were not placed in trenches
            and instead lay bare on the ground. Correspondence from the district’s
            junior engineer stated that this was “dangerous for human life, cow, dogs,
            and all animals who are roaming inside campus … at any moment a fatal
            electrical accident will happen.”160 (The DIR observed a similar situation
            at CHC-II Charmal.) Medical officials also told the DIR that the hospital’s
            three-phase electrical power was either non-functional or defective. As a
            result, they could not use the hospital’s maternity ward and the room was
            kept locked. (See Photograph 11 on page 282.)

       ■■   At AH Umarkote, the hospital’s entire electrical system was renovated, but
            medical officials told the DIR that they routinely experience low-voltage
            issues that prevent them from using their medical equipment. The DIR
            observed many uninstalled electrical items, such as wires hanging from
            the ceiling and fixtures sitting uninstalled. Some electrical boxes were
            blackened by smoke, indicating that faulty wiring had caused them to
            overheat. The hospital received a generator, but it sat unconnected in a
            storage room. (For further examples of observed electrical problems, see
            Photographs 12 and 13 on pages 282–283.)

       Water Supply, Drainage, and Sewerage Problems. The DIR observed water sup-
ply problems at 60 percent of the hospitals that it visited (33 of 55) and drainage
issues at 69 percent of the hospitals that it visited (38 of 55). The DIR also observed
sewerage issues at 69 percent of the hospitals visited (38 of 55), though at nine
of these hospitals the only observed problem was that ventilation pipes did not
extend two meters above the roof level, as required under Indian standards and
project specifications.161 Drainage and sewerage issues were often a contributing
factor to the water damage uniformly observed at the hospitals.

                       The following are examples of the types of water supply, drainage, and sewerage
                    problems observed by the DIR:

                       ■■   CHC-I Banapur had no functioning toilets, and the new bathrooms con-
                            structed adjacent to the patient wards did not have toilets, fixtures, or
                            plumbing. The hospital’s septic tanks were not covered.

                       ■■   At DHH Dhenkanal, there were no working sinks in the new hospital
                            building and no water in the wards. The hospital obtained much of its
                            water from a hand-powered pump in the front courtyard. However, sev-
                            eral newly installed toilets that did receive water leaked severely. The new
                            water tank was not covered, and the hospital’s exterior drainage system
                            was not completed. Medical staff also informed the DIR that this exterior
                            system did not drain properly, and the DIR observed that it was used as
                            a toilet and waste disposal area, which attracted roaming livestock and
                            mosquitoes. (See Photograph 14 on page 283.)

                       ■■   At AH Jajpur Road, the exterior water drainage system was designed to
                            connect with the road’s drainage system. However, the road was higher
                            than the hospital, and medical officials told the DIR that as a result water
                            from the road drainage often flooded the hospital.

                       ■■   At SDH Jeypore, some of the bathrooms appeared to lack running water,
                            and those rooms’ sinks and toilets did not have fixtures or plumbing
                            attached to them. Problems with the hospital’s sewage system caused sew-
                            age to pool in ponds around the building, to overflow several toilets, and
                            to spill out into the nearby hallways. This created a stench that perme-
                            ated the hospital. In addition, several other toilets were leaking water from
                            their bases. (See Photograph 15 on page 284.)

                       ■■   At CHC-I Mathili, the DIR observed that new water tanks had been installed.
                            Medical officials informed the DIR that the health center’s water supply was
                            generally satisfactory, but the bathroom in one of the wards lacked running
                            water and, as a result, patients had to go outside to defecate.

                       ■■   At DHH Puri, medical officials told the DIR that the new hospital’s sewage
                            system never functioned. As a result, sewage backed up into and around
                            the hospital, and whole wards were flooded with sewage and locked. Med-
                            ical officials stated that they were moving patients from the new, flooded
                            hospital building to the old building to avoid the smell and health risks

              associated with the sewage. (See Photograph 16 on page 284. For a further
              example of observed drainage problems, see Photograph 17 on page 285.)

       Locked and Unused Facilities. In its supervision mission documents, the Bank
emphasized that the non-use of project facilities and equipment “is a serious mat-
ter for us.”162 The DIR observed that at four locations, whole hospitals built with
OHSDP funds were locked shut and remained unused. These hospitals, which
were not among the two cancelled by the PMC, were:

        ■■    DHH Berhampur;

        ■■    DHH Khurda;

        ■■    CHC-II Bjijpur; and

        ■■    CHC-II Majhapada.

       The DIR also observed that at 12 hospitals portions of the buildings were locked
and unused. For example, at DHH Sundargarh, a large new maternity wing was not
completed and sits locked and unused. Similarly, at DHH Baragarh, the OHSDP-
funded operating theater suite was not used. The DIR could view it only through a
window in its locked door. (See Photographs 18–21 on pages 285–287.)

       Medical Waste Containment and Disposal Problems. The DIR observed prob-
lems with the construction and use of medical waste containment areas at 74 per-
cent of the hospitals that it visited (41 of 55). The waste containment areas at two
hospitals had not been constructed, while staff at other hospitals reported that they
were not trained in the use of these areas. These failures are not strictly the result of
fraud and corruption, but they indicate an implementation failure that may ham-
per the sustainability of the project’s development goals. They also are consistent
with concerns about waste management implementation that the Bank raised in
its supervision mission reports.163

       The following are examples of the types of waste disposal problems observed
by the DIR:

        ■■    At DHH Jajpur, the waste containment area pits were not constructed
              fully, and the waste area’s concrete pad and walkways were crumbling
              underfoot, suggesting that they had been constructed with poor-quality
              concrete. The area lacked a functioning water supply, the metal cover on

                             the sharps pit was rusting, and the building built to house the waste auto-
                             clave and shredder appeared to have not been used. Further, hospital staff
                             had piled used syringes and needles outside or on the sills of the windows
                             in the female ward.

                        ■■   At CHC-II Kanpur, medical staff appeared to be using the waste manage-
                             ment area properly, though it lacked running water and an access road for
                             trolleys of waste. (Medical officials stated that they carried waste to the site
                             in buckets.)

                        ■■   At CHC-II Manamunda, medical officials were depositing waste into an
                             open well rather than the completed waste containment area. The civil
                             engineer assisting the DIR expressed concern that this practice could pol-
                             lute the local water supply. (See Photograph 22 on page 287.)

                        ■■   At DHH Puri, medical officials stated that the waste containment area was
                             no longer used because it was built immediately next to previously exist-
                             ing homes and the people who lived there complained when it first was
                             used.

                        ■■   At AH Umarkote, medical waste was scattered around the hospital
                             grounds. The DIR saw animals from the village rooting through the
                             waste for food and barefoot children playing near piles of used bandages
                             and syringes. (See Photographs 23 and 24 on page 288. For a further
                             example of observed medical waste disposal problems, see Photograph
                             25 on page 289.)

                       Maintenance Problems. While not an indicator of fraud and corruption, the DIR
                    observed issues—often serious ones—related to facilities maintenance at almost
                    every site it visited. Examples of poor maintenance included mattresses and bed-
                    ding that were ripped and soiled, rain water drains that were clogged with waste,
                    bathroom stalls that overflowed with human refuse, and holes in ceilings that were
                    never repaired.

                       Project documents indicate that despite Bank awareness of the importance of
                    facilities maintenance, the OHSDP funded only a portion of the needed mainte-

The resulting lack of maintenance has caused accelerated deterioration of the hospi-
tals that may compromise the sustainability of the project’s development goals.

       From the outset, the Bank acknowledged that maintenance of the OHSDP’s
renovated hospitals was critical to the project’s long-term success.164 As a result,
the Project Agreement required the Government of Orissa to maintain the staff,
authority, and funding necessary to ensure that both the civil works and new
medical equipment were properly maintained.165 The PMC’s engineering unit, in
collaboration with project consultants and CDMOs, was responsible for develop-
ing hospital maintenance manuals and training local staff.166 But the PMC did not
allocate any funds specifically for hospital or equipment maintenance.

       The PMC developed a long-term hospital maintenance plan in 2004, but it
never implemented the plan.167 The PMC attributed this failure to a lack of funds,
claiming that the project’s maintenance funds were included in the USD 24 mil-
lion reallocated to the National Polio Eradication Project.168 Consistent with this
claim, the Bank itself identified savings in maintenance expenses as a source of the
USD 24 million in OHSDP savings, and in September 2005 the OHSDP Project
Director requested a reallocation of USD 25 million back to the project for use in
hospital maintenance, among other things.169 The Bank denied this request, and
maintenance was later cited as contributing to a “moderate risk” that the OHSDP’s
development outcomes would not be sustained.170 The DIR’s implementation find-
ings confirm the significance of this risk and underscore the importance of main-
tenance in civil works projects.

B.	An In-Depth Review of Civil Works Documents Revealed
   That Implementation Failures May Be Indicators of Fraud
       The DIR reviewed documents produced during the civil works activities at 21
OHSDP-funded hospitals and compared them with its site visit observations. In
almost half of these hospitals (10 of 21) the DIR observed significant civil works
problems when the documents contained certifications that works were completed

                    tency between the DIR’s findings and the certification and payment records indi-
                    cates that the supervising CMC may have committed fraud by either certifying
                    incomplete works as complete or authorizing payment for deficient works. The
                    details of these 10 cases are as follows:

                           1.	 DHH Angul

                           On April 23, 2002, IDCO signed a contract with the Orissa Small Industries
                    Corporation Ltd. (OSIC) to construct 1,970 square meters of new construction and
                    perform other repair and renovation work at DHH Angul.171 The work was sup-
                    posed to be completed by April 24, 2003, but OSIC’s work at the site was delayed so
                    significantly that in 2005—two years after the work was supposed to be complete—
                    the PMC threatened OSIC with invocation of contractual remedies.172

                           In January 2006, the PMC wrote to OSIC and stated that “there has been very
                    little progress in the last two years” and “[a]t this rate of progress, OPEC [OSIC’s
                    subcontractor] may not be able to complete even one unit before 31.03.06.”173 The
                    PMC reiterated these same concerns in a letter of February 17, 2006, suggesting
                    that work at the site still had not progressed.174

                           Yet on October 11, 2006, IDCO certified that the work on the site was “com-
                    pleted and handed over … and that there have been no material deviation[s] from
                    the sanctioned plan and specification other than those sanctioned by competent
                    authority.”175 Thus, after almost three years of delays, IDCO reported that OSIC
                    had finished its civil works activities in eight months.

                           According to the building details sheets accompanying this certification, the
                    completed hospital had:

       The certification noted that some areas leaked during the monsoon season and
stated that IDCO would remedy the defects.177 The handover documents also noted
that the value of the work had decreased from INR 13.5 million (USD 299,500) to
INR 10.5 million (USD 233,000), though the documents did not explain why.178

       The DIR visited DHH Angul on April 4, 2007—approximately six months after
the hospital’s handover. Despite IDCO’s certification of the works’ completion to
specifications, the DIR observed the following civil works problems at the hospital:

       The newly extended major operating theater had cracks in its walls, large areas
of mold on its ceiling, and one wall was left as bare brick rather than covered with
render and tile. Hospital corridors also had cracks, some of which appeared to be
long, deep, and causing pieces of render to fall out of the wall. (See Photograph 26
on page 289.)

       Walls and ceilings in the newly extended hospital ward exhibited discoloration
indicative of water damage. Some walls and ceilings had large patches of mold on
them. (See Photographs 27 and 28 on page 290.)

        ■■    Sewage from the ward bathrooms was overflowing into the hallways, sug-
              gesting improper connection of the new bathrooms to the sewage sys-
              tem. Several of the bathroom stall fixtures were either visually not solidly
              affixed to the wall or not installed at all. Uninstalled sinks were piled on
              the bathroom floor. (See Photograph 29 on page 291.)

        ■■    The majority of the electrical boxes in the renovated wing were open,
              unattached to the walls, and contained tangled wiring. The site’s generator
              was installed and working but was not housed in the generator building.
              Instead, a hospital worker was using that building as a residence.

        ■■    The OHSDP provided a water drainage system for the new hospital build-
              ing but not the old one.179 As a result, the old hospital building still flooded
              during heavy rains. The CDMO stated that this flooding could be up to
              knee high in depth.

       The significant inconsistency between IDCO’s completion certification and the
DIR’s site visit observations is an indicator that IDCO’s certification was fraudulent.

                           On July 22, 2001, K.K. Agrawal signed a contract with Sri Baishnab Charan
                    Patra (SBC Patra) to construct 612 square meters of new hospital buildings, con-
                    struct 114 square meters of residential quarters, and renovate parts of the health
                    center, including its electrical systems.180 The work was supposed to be completed
                    by May 19, 2002.181 The hospital’s civil works were slightly delayed: in a letter of
                    December 5, 2002, K.K. Agrawal noted that work was delayed and instructed the
                    contractor to complete the work by December 15.182

                           On March 15, 2004, K.K. Agrawal certified that the civil works at the hospi-
                    tal—which had “been carried out in accordance with the specifications, draw-
                    ings & relevant I.S. Code and as per terms and conditions specified in Contract/
                    Agreement”—had been completed on October 23, 2002, and taken over by the
                    Medical Officer in Charge on January 20, 2003.183 In a letter of July 4, 2003, the hos-
                    pital’s Chief Medical Officer also stated that the works were complete, satisfactory,
                    and had been used by the hospital since January 2003.184 The only site variations
                    noted in the documents are repairs of unanticipated pre-project site problems,
                    such as faulty plumbing and a non-functional transformer. 185 Documents indicate
                    that as of January 2006, SBC Patra was paid INR 6.4 million (USD 142,000), or 92
                    percent of its contract value.186

                           K.K. Agrawal’s October 2002 completion certification is inconsistent with its
                    own December 2002 correspondence stating that works were not complete. Fur-
                    ther, both K.K. Agrawal and the Chief Medical Officer’s statements that the works
                    were satisfactory and up to specification are inconsistent with subsequent project
                    correspondence indicating problems at the hospital:

                            ■■    In a January 2005 letter, K.K. Agrawal instructed SBC Patra to repair faulty

              this problem and a defective tube well that caused frequent disruption to
              the hospital’s water supply.188

        ■■    In June 2005, a joint K.K. Agrawal–PMC inspection identified a number
              of problems at the hospital, including cracks, water leakage, and water
              damage in the operating theaters and labor room; a lack of a proper drain-
              age system, including missing rainwater pipes; and electrical problems.189
              As of September 2005, these problems remained unrepaired.190

       The DIR visited CHC-I Balipatna on April 15, 2007—approximately five years
after the civil works at the hospital were certified complete. Contrary to K.K.
Agrawal’s certification, the DIR observed civil works problems at the hospital that
were consistent with those identified in project correspondence. They included the
following:

        ■■    The ceilings of the new operating theater and labor and delivery suite
              leaked so badly that the resulting water damage had caused portions of
              the ceiling to fall in large pieces onto the new operating tables and delivery
              beds. Local medical officials stated that they had ceased using the suite
              because they feared that the ceiling was going to collapse. (See Photo-
              graphs 30 and 31 on pages 291–292.)

        ■■    The sheet metal roofs over the stairwell and some laboratory space had
              visible gaps and holes that allowed rainwater to enter the building directly.
              These leaks appeared to have caused patches of water damage and mold
              in many locations in the stairwell and nearby hallways. The rainwater also
              fell on, among other things, an OHSDP-funded x-ray machine. (See Pho-
              tograph 32 on page 292.)

        ■■    The exterior of the renovated building appeared water-damaged and dis-
              colored by mold.

        ■■    The staff quarters renovations appeared incomplete and lacked running
              water. The exterior walls of the quarters exhibited large cracks extending
              along their entire height. (See Photograph 33 on page 293.)

                           On October 11, 2002, MECON signed a contract with Mahendra Swain (Swain)
                    to construct 2,876 square meters of new hospital space and renovate portions of
                    the old hospital building, including its electrical systems.191 The work was sup-
                    posed to be completed on January 10, 2004, but because of payment problems and
                    a lack of detailed site drawings the PMC extended Swain’s deadline to June 30,
                    2005.192 MECON’s site supervision was also considered inadequate, and project
                    documents suggest that the PMC replaced MECON with K.K. Agrawal in 2005.193

                           Swain’s work on the hospital was criticized frequently. For example:

                            ■■    In June 2003, the PMC identified the firm as one of 13 contractors that had
                                  “deliberately caused time overruns and abandoned work sites” by “offload-

                            ■■    In late August 2003, a joint PMC–World Bank inspection reported that
                                  almost no work had been performed at the site between January and June
                                  2003 and that the contractor was using defective concrete.195 The same
                                  implementation problems were observed in December 2003.196

              PMC instructed Swain to hire additional staff and procure additional
              materials in order to expedite its progress.198

        ■■    On March 29, 2006, K.K. Agrawal told the PMC that there were defects
              in Swain’s construction and electrical work and recommended withhold-
              ing INR 800,000 (USD 17,800) until they were corrected.199 But in a letter
              of March 31, 2006, K.K. Agrawal repeated Swain’s claim that the defects
              were completed, “except for the PH work not done because of the inability
              to charge the transformer.”200 The letter does not state that K.K. Agrawal
              inspected and approved these last-day repairs.

       On March 31, 2006—the day the OHSDP closed—K.K. Agrawal and the hos-
pital’s Chief Medical Officer signed a completion certificate stating that “the work
has been completed in accordance to approved plan and specifications and handed
over to the Medical Officer in-charge[.]”201 The certificate contained no exceptions
to its statement of completion and noted no defects in the civil works. No docu-
ment states that the scope of the civil works was modified, and no document indi-
cates how much Swain was paid for its work, though its contract’s stated value was
INR 24.9 million (USD 554,000).202

       The March 31, 2006, completion certificate is inconsistent with K.K. Agrawal’s
March 31 letter that stated that some works were not complete because the hos-
pital’s transformer was not “charged,” i.e., connected to the power grid. It also is
inconsistent with a letter from Swain dated June 19, 2006—three months after the
completion certificate was signed—informing the PMC that the operating theater
was complete and ready for inspection.203

       During its site visit, Bhadrak medical officials told the DIR that the construc-
tion actually was handed over in February 2007, though no documentation con-
firms this statement.

       The DIR visited DHH Bhadrak on April 24, 2007—approximately one year after
the civil works at the hospital were certified as complete. Contrary to this certifica-
tion, the DIR observed the following civil works problems at the hospital:

                            ■■    Medical officials told the DIR that the hospital’s renovated second floor
                                  leaked when it rained. Consistent with this statement, the DIR observed
                                  multiple cracks and areas of wall discoloration indicative of water damage.
                                  (See Photograph 34 on page 293.)

                            ■■    Medical officials stated that the hospital’s new septic tanks were too small
                                  for its volume of patients. Consistent with this statement, the DIR observed
                                  two or three washrooms that were overflowing with backlogged sewage.
                                  (See Photograph 35 on page 294.)

                            ■■    The contractor did not connect running water to the ground floor, so the
                                  medical officials moved the maternity ward to the first floor. Medical offi-
                                  cials stated that they experienced great difficulty transporting pregnant
                                  women and women in labor up a flight of stairs to the relocated ward. See
                                  (Photograph 36 on page 294.)

                            ■■    The cable connecting the hospital’s new generator frayed shortly after
                                  installation, leaving the hospital reliant on older backup generators. In
                                  addition, one of the OHSDP-supplied external electrical switchboxes was
                                  poorly connected to the hospital’s electrical cables, leaving bare wire con-
                                  nections exposed to weather. (See Photograph 37 on page 295.)

                           The significant inconsistencies between K.K. Agrawal’s completion certifica-
                    tion, subsequent project correspondence, and the DIR’s site visit observations are
                    an indicator that K.K. Agrawal’s certification was fraudulent.

                           On May 21, 2003, IDCO signed a contract with Sri Pramod Kumar Rath (Rath)
                    to construct and renovate 1,440 square meters of the hospital and medical offi-
                    cials’ quarters, including their electrical systems.204 The work was supposed to be
                    completed on April 6, 2004, but delays at the site began almost immediately and
                    persisted for years.205

                           On May 23, 2002, IDCO informed the PMC that the design consultant had not
                    yet provided drawings for the site.206 On July 29, 2003, IDCO wrote to Rath and
                    observed that it still had not yet begun work on the hospital.207 In November 2003,
                    the PMC terminated Rath’s contract because no work had been done in six-and-

a-half months, but IDCO cancelled the rescission when Rath attributed its slow
progress to payment delays on its four other OHSDP contracts and recommitted,
in writing, to completing its work.208 After continued delays in 2004 and 2005, on
June 26, 2005, the PMC notified Rath that its contract could be terminated because
the firm had billed only 14 percent of the contract’s value and its works were 16
months overdue.209 The PMC did not, however, resort to this termination.

       In February 2006, Deogarh elected officials informed the DOHFW that the
civil works at Deogarh were still progressing very slowly and that no one appeared
to be actively supervising Rath’s progress.210 But on July 14, 2006, IDCO submitted
Rath’s final bill to the PMC and recommended its payment, subject to deductions
for deviations.211 On August 31, 2006—one year after the PMC’s second termina-
tion threat and two years after the civil works were due to be complete—Rath and
the Assistant District Medical Officer (ADMO) signed a handover check slip rep-
resenting that all civil works were “complete per stated plans.”212 The slip did not
include any exceptions or note any deficiencies, and documents do not state how
much Rath was paid for its work. The documents produced to the DIR did not
contain a completion certificate signed by IDCO.

       The DIR visited DHH Deogarh on April 27, 2007—approximately eight months
after the works were reported complete. Despite Rath’s representation, the DIR
observed the following civil works problems at the hospital:

        ■■    Construction of the new warehouse and kitchen block was not started.

        ■■    Renovations to the labor and delivery rooms had not been completed and
              they lacked flooring, tiling on the walls, and windows and doors. The ren-
              ovated x-ray room also had not been completed. (See Photograph 38 on

                            ■■    The walls and ceilings in the renovated wards appeared unrepaired and
                                  unpainted, and these wards’ doors and windows had not been replaced.
                                  Some walls also exhibited large cracks. (See Photograph 39 on page 296.)

                            ■■    The stairwell leading to the roof exhibited discoloration indicating water
                                  damage and mold. The roof itself appeared to have large gaps that were

                                  not connected to the hospital’s water supply system, and medical officials
                                  stated that the water system had not been upgraded. (See Photograph 41

                    unit, a kitchen, a minor operating theater unit, a blood bank, and staff quarters.213
                    The work was supposed to be completed by December 11, 2003.214 Extensive proj-

Project Director stating that the medical officials’ residences had been completed,
had been approved by local officials, and would be handed over within a week,
pending some additional minor repairs.216 Documents produced to the DIR do not
state how much Mohanty was paid for its work on this hospital.

       The DIR visited DHH Jagatsinghpur on April 12, 2007—approximately one-
and-a-half years after most of the work was certified complete and approximately
eight months after OCCL reported that the medical officials’ residences were com-
plete. During its visit, the CDMO told the DIR that the public works department
had not accepted the works at the hospital because they failed to meet its stan-
dards. Contrary to OCCL’s certifications and reports, the DIR observed the follow-
ing civil works problems at the hospital:

        ■■     The newly constructed building exhibited large cracks throughout its
               structure that appeared in the same location on every floor. (See Photo-
               graph 42 on page 297.)

        ■■     Renovations in the old building appeared to have been abandoned before
               completion. (See Photograph 43 on page 298.)

        ■■     The cement rendering was soft, porous, and broke easily—for example,
               when walked on harshly. (See Photograph 44 on page 298.)

        ■■     The new buildings’ window frames were rusting, and several had lost their
               handles. Medical officials stated that they often used bandages to keep
               windows closed. Newly provided steel door frames were rusting as well.
               (See Photograph 45 on page 299.)

        ■■     In the new four-story administration building, a shaft was built for an ele-

                           6.	 DHH Koraput

                           On June 26, 2002, SCAG signed a contract with R.V.R. Projects Pvt. Ltd. (R.V.R.
                    Projects) to perform new construction and renovation work at DHH Koraput.217
                    The work was supposed to be completed on December 27, 2003, but work was
                    delayed for a number of reasons, including fear of attack from Naxalite groups.218
                    On March 31, 2004—three months after the scheduled completion date—R.V.R.
                    Projects, SCAG, and the ADMO signed hospital handover documents that cer-
                    tified the civil works as complete.219 SCAG also signed a completion certificate
                    stating that the work had “been completed in accordance to approved plan and
                    specification[.] … There has been no major deviation from the original sanctioned
                    plan and specification other than approved by Competent [sic] authority…. The
                    civil works (Civil + PH + Elect.) and services are fit for functioning and structur-
                    ally safe and sound.”220

                           In a letter attached to these documents, SCAG stated that the completed work
                    was performed on the patient ward, the labor and operating theater unit, the out-
                    patient unit, the morgue, the generator, the garage, and the quarters for medical
                    officials.221 This work included renovations to the hospital’s electrical systems.222
                    The completion certificate stated that there were no shortfalls or defects in the civil
                    works.223 The DIR did not obtain documentation confirming how much R.V.R.
                    Projects was paid for its work on the hospital, but its contract’s value was INR 38.4
                    million (USD 853,000).224

                           The project documents demonstrate that problems at the hospital appeared
                    soon after its reported completion. On April 30, 2005—one year after the hospital
                    was certified complete—the Public Works Department inspected the hospital and

noted a number of problems, including leaking expansion joints, doors detach-
ing from door frames, leaking roofs, and the lack of a wall around the hospital
grounds.225

       The DIR visited DHH Koraput on March 28, 2007—approximately three years
after the hospital was certified complete and two years after the Public Works
Department’s inspection. Despite SCAG’s certification that the hospital was com-
pleted to specification, the DIR observed the following civil works problems:

       ■■   The new building was constructed in discrete sections without effective
            sealing between them, leaving gaps as wide as four inches and cracks
            between sections of the building. Medical officials stated that as a result,
            water leaks through the gaps and floods the hospital, particularly its low-
            lying areas. The civil engineer assisting the DIR stated that this was the
            result of poor design, poor performance by the contractor, and poor super-
            vision by SCAG. (As noted in the Public Works Department’s inspection,
            the joints between hospital buildings also were not treated or sealed.) (See
            Photographs 47 and 48 on page 300.)

       ■■   Walls throughout the renovated hospital exhibited cracks and discolor-
            ation indicative of water damage and mold. In the operating theater scrub
            room, mold was growing on the walls and causing the paint to peel away.
            The ceilings on the upper floor also exhibited many areas of water damage
            and mold. (See Photograph 49 on page 301.)

       ■■   The civil engineer assisting the DIR observed that vinyl sheet flooring in
            the operating theater had not been adhered to the floor properly. As a
            result, the sheets were shrinking and exposing gaps of bare concrete that
            should not appear in a “clean” room like an operating theater. (See Photo-
            graph 50 on page 301.)

       ■■   Many of the doors in the new buildings were so heavy that they were rip-
            ping the screws out of their hinges and falling off their frames. Many steel
            window frames and hinges were rusting or broken.

       ■■   The buildings’ exterior walls exhibited many areas of discoloration from
            mold, particularly in areas around the hospital’s toilets. The civil engineer
            assisting the DIR stated that this occurred because the cement render
            either did not contain the specified proportions of cement and sand or was

                                   not cured properly. This made it porous and allowed water to be absorbed
                                   and develop mold.

                            ■■     The backup generator was installed, but medical officials stated that they—
                                   not the contractor—had installed it and that it was not connected to the
                                   hospital.

                           The significant inconsistencies between SCAG’s completion certification and
                    the DIR’s site visit observations are an indicator that SCAG’s certification was

                           7.	 DHH Malkangiri

                           On June 11, 2001, SCAG signed a contract with Sri A. Bala Rama Raju (Raju)
                    to perform new construction, one-time repairs, and renovations at DHH Malkan-
                    giri.226 The work was supposed to be complete on September 12, 2003.227 The work
                    was slightly delayed, and on February 25, 2004, SCAG and the ADMO signed a
                    completion certificate stating that the work had “been completed in accordance to
                    approved plan and specification[.] … There has been no major deviation from the
                    original sanctioned plan and specification other than approved by Competent [sic]
                    authority…. The civil works (Civil + PH + Elect.) and services are fit for function-
                    ing and structurally safe and sound.”228 The certificate noted only “minor defects
                    in [the] completed building,” and SCAG and Raju certified that they had been
                    addressed.229 The certificate does not detail the scope of work it embraces, but it
                    does mention, inter alia, electrical work, roof work, flooring, doors and windows,
                    painting, water supply and sewage work, and work on the patient wards, medical
                    officer residences, and blood bank.230

                           SCAG and the ADMO also signed two additional completion certificates—
                    dated May 5, 2005, and November 13, 2005—that certified that the hospital’s
                    inside premises and electrical works were complete.231 These certificates noted that
                    the hospital’s civil works included renovations to the hospital building, staff quar-
                    ters, water supply system, and sewage system.232 No documents produced to the
                    DIR suggest that the scope of the contractor’s work changed, and the DIR lacks

was INR 19.5 million (USD 434,000).233

       Despite SCAG’s certification that Raju’s work was performed to specification,
within a month of the first certification medical officials began to complain about
the quality of the civil works. In June 2004, the CDMO wrote to the OHSDP Proj-
ect Director to complain:

                   After the recent rain there is heavy leakage of rain water
                   in the O.P.D. [outpatient unit] and indoor including the
                   minor O.T. [operating theater]. During the rain there was
                   flooding and soiling in the O.P.D., Store room, Minor
                   O.T. and doctor’s duty room. All the corridors are also
                   heavily flooded. Similarly, in the Staff Quarters there are
                   a lot of defects in the fixing of windows & doors, leaking
                   of roofs, etc.234

       In August 2004, the ADMO complained about leaks affecting the operating
theater, corridors, store room, infectious patient ward, outpatient building, new
laboratory building, new generator room, and x-ray building.235

       The DIR visited DHH Malkangiri on March 30, 2007—three years after SCAG
first stated that the civil works at the hospital were complete. In contrast to SCAG’s
three certifications of completion, the DIR observed the following civil works
problems at the hospital:

        ■■   The walls in the renovated patient wards exhibited discoloration sug-
             gesting water damage and mold. The roof of the operating theater leaked
             because the roof ’s drainage pipes were clogged with leaves. (Medical
             officials insisted that there was no labor available to clear the leaves.) In
             addition, the hospital exhibited many cracks and faulty joints between the
             new and old buildings that medical officials stated leaked heavily when it
             rained. (See Photographs 51 and 52 on page 302.)

        ■■   As at DHH Koraput, the renovated hospital’s exterior walls exhibited many
             areas of discoloration from mold, particularly in areas around the hospi-
             tal’s toilets. The civil engineer assisting the DIR stated that this occurred
             because the cement render either did not contain the specified propor-

                                   and allowed water to be absorbed and develop mold. (See Photograph 53

                            ■■     Many new steel windows and window catches were rusting or broken.
                                   Many of the doors in the new buildings were so heavy that they were rip-

                            ■■     As at DHH Koraput, the new vinyl sheet flooring in the operating the-
                                   ater and delivery room had not been adhered to the floor properly. As a
                                   result, the sheets shrank and exposed gaps of bare concrete that should not
                                   appear in such “clean” rooms.

                            ■■     While power was connected and reportedly reliable, the new generator
                                   had not been installed.

                           The significant inconsistencies between SCAG’s completion certification and
                    the DIR’s site visit observations are an indicator that SCAG’s certifications were
                    fraudulent.

                           On May 7, 2001, OCCL signed a contract with Reliance Construction (Relcon)
                    to construct 983 square meters of hospital space and 114 square meters of new
                    quarters for medical officials, and to perform other repair and renovation works at
                    AH Narasinghpur.236 The work was supposed to be complete on March 6, 2002, but
                    because of delays caused by another party working on part of the hospital, OCCL
                    extended Relcon’s completion date to May 30, 2003.237

                           On May 14, 2003, Relcon and the hospital’s Medical Officer in Charge—but
                    not OCCL—signed a standard completion certificate stating that work had “been
                    completed in accordance to approved plan and specification[.] … There has been

documents stating how much Relcon was paid for its work, but its contract’s value
was INR 8.5 million (USD 189,000).240

       On May 15, 2003, Relcon, OCCL, and the Medical Officer in Charge also signed
a set of hospital handover documents.241 The documents state that “the building
[was] completed as per the approved plan,” and detail work done in: the inpatient
unit’s wards and toilets; the outpatient unit’s wards and toilets; the operating the-
ater; the new staff quarters; and an external sewage system.242

       The DIR visited AH Narasinghpur on April 13, 2007—approximately four years
after the hospital’s reported completion. The DIR found that the hospital was in
fairly good condition compared with many other OHSDP-funded hospitals. But
contrary to Relcon’s and OCCL’s certifications, the DIR still observed the following
civil works problems at the hospital:

        ■■     The exterior cement render exhibited large cracks and frequent discolor-
               ation indicative of water damage and mold. The DIR’s observations at this
               site are consistent with problems at other hospitals that the civil engineer
               assisting the DIR attributed to poor-quality render. (See Photographs 55
               and 56 on page 304.)

        ■■     There were large cracks and discoloration suggesting water leakage at the
               joints between the old and new hospital buildings.

        ■■     Many new steel doorframes were rusting. (See Photograph 57 on page
               305.)

        ■■     Tiles were not installed in the patient ward, leaving the walls exhibiting
               bare concrete. (See Photograph 58 on page 305.)

        ■■     The CDMO stated that the hospital experienced problems with its sewage
               drainage system. Consistent with this observation, the DIR observed that
               the toilets in the patient wards were flooded with sewage.

       The inconsistencies between Relcon’s certification that civil works were com-
pleted to specification; OCCL’s report that the works were completed according to
plan; and the DIR’s site visit observations are less frequent than at other OHSDP-
funded hospitals. However, the inconsistencies still exist, and thus remain an indi-
cator that Relcon and OCCL’s statements were fraudulent.

                           9.	 DHH Sonepur

                           On June 25, 2002, K.K. Agrawal signed a contract with M.K. Mohanty to per-
                    form new construction, repairs, and renovations at DHH Sonepur.243 The works
                    included renovations to the female ward, general ward, casualty unit, mortuary, an
                    extension to the outpatient unit and minor operating theater, an extension to the
                    administration building, and quarters for medical officers.244 They were supposed
                    to be completed by September 25, 2003.245

                           Project correspondence indicates that work on the hospital was delayed for a
                    number of site-specific reasons, such as onsite physical obstructions.246 On Decem-
                    ber 27, 2005, K.K. Agrawal and the ADMO signed a completion certificate stating
                    that the civil works had been completed on February 23, 2005, “in accordance to
                    approved plan and specification[.] … There has been no major deviation from
                    the original sanctioned plan and specification other than approved by Competent
                    [sic] authority…. The civil works (Civil + PH + Elect.) and services are fit for func-
                    tioning and structurally safe and sound.”247 The certificate states that there are no
                    shortfalls or defects in the work.248 No documents indicated that the scope of work
                    had changed, and an October 22, 2005, reconciliation statement states that M.K.
                    Mohanty was paid INR 21.6 million (USD 480,000) for its work.249

                           The DIR visited DHH Sonepur on April 3, 2007—approximately two years after
                    civil works were reported complete. Despite K.K. Agrawal’s completion certifica-
                    tion, the DIR observed the following civil works problems at the hospital:

                            ■■     Building joints were covered with loose metal sheeting. The civil engineer
                                   assisting the DIR stated that this risks substantial leaks at the joints.

                            ■■     Medical officials stated that the ceiling in the operating theater and many
                                   other rooms leaked when it rained. The DIR observed discoloration indic-
                                   ative of mold on the walls in the renovated patient wards. (See Photograph

        ■■   As at DHH Koraput and DHH Malkangiri, the hospital’s exterior walls
             exhibited many areas of discoloration from mold, particularly in areas
             around the hospital’s toilets. The civil engineer assisting the DIR attributed
             this to poor-quality cement render and/or improper curing.

        ■■   The toilets in the renovated wards were flooded and locked. This may be
             the result of the hospital’s sewage system, which appeared to discharge
             onto the ground through pipes not connected to a septic system.

        ■■   Many window frames were rusted, and the operating theater door’s hinge
             had separated from its frame. (See Photograph 60 on page 306.)

        ■■   A backup generator was supplied but not installed, and in some loca-
             tions electrical wiring dangled loosely against hospital walls. The DIR
             observed electrical boxes that were blackened by smoke, indicating that
             faulty wiring had caused them to overheat. (See Photographs 61 and 62
             on page  307.)

       The conditions observed at DHH Sonepur were not as bad as other DIR-visited
hospitals, but the hospital was completed more recently and exhibited the begin-
nings of many problems that appeared more severely at other locations. K.K.
Agrawal’s certification of works completion appears inconsistent with the DIR’s
site visit observations, indicating that K.K. Agrawal’s certification was fraudulent.

       10.	 DHH Sambalpur

       On March 27, 2002, IDCO signed a contract with Shyamalal Agarwal (Shya-
malal) to construct approximately 1,213 meters of new space and five new medical
officer residential quarters at the hospital, as well as to perform repair and renova-
tion work that included improving the hospital’s electrical systems.250

       In a January 2004 internal letter, IDCO’s Sambalpur divisional head informed
IDCO’s chief construction manager that with the exception of some repair work
and the transformer and generator rooms, Shyamalal had completed its work at
Sambalpur.251 On June 25, IDCO wrote to the PMC and requested the release of
Shyamalal’s security deposit because “almost all the buildings viz – H-type quarters,
E-type quarters, D-type quarters, ward block, central store, physiotherapy & skin
ward, have been completed and handed over to C.D.M.O. Sambalpur.”252 Enclosed

                    that the works were complete “as per the plan and estimates.”253

                           The accuracy of this certification was contested almost immediately. On July 24,
                    2004, the CDMO held a public meeting and press conference in which he alleged
                    that most of the hospital’s roof was leaking, that IDCO had ceased its renovation
                    work before it was finished, and that IDCO had left several hospital bathrooms
                    incomplete.254 (It is unclear why the CDMO signed the handover check slip if
                    he had these concerns about the state of the civil works.) In June 2005, the PMC
                    conducted a civil works inspection and concluded that IDCO had lied about the
                    hospital’s completion:

                                       It is a complete misnomer on the part of IDCO to report
                                       that the work of DHH Sambalpur has been completed
                                       in accordance with BOQ provision. The work on vari-
                                       ous sector[s] is yet to be completed. Repair & Renovation

                                       the custody of the contractor but reported to have been
                                       complete and handed over.255

                           The PMC identified defects in staircase drainage, electrical installations, plumb-
                    ing work, sewage tanks, ICU and blood bank sewage connections, antistatic floor-
                    ing installation, and other matters.256 It also stated that the main operating theater,
                    minor operating theater, dental unit, mortuary, “DG” and eclampsia rooms, and
                    pathology unit were not handed over and that some were still under construction
                    or renovation.257

                           On November 9, 2005, the PMC rescinded Shyamalal’s contract and refused to
                    pay the firm’s final invoice because, among other things:

                            ■■     The required repairs and renovations had not been completed, for exam-

        ■■     The contractor had dismantled the intensive care unit and blood bank
               sewage disposal systems but had not reconnected them to the sewage sys-
               tem installed for the new ward.

        ■■     The septic tanks installed by the contractor were sized for 20 users each,
               rather than the 50 users specified by the project.

        ■■     The plumbing work was inadequate.

        ■■     The transformer was improperly installed, and its platform was con-
               structed in a low-lying area that collected rainwater and thus needed to be
               backfilled and raised.

        ■■     Several main electrical panels had not been installed, and the underground
               cabling to connect them to the electricity supply had not been laid.

        ■■     The firm had failed to extend its bank guarantee beyond July 30, 2004,
               which was a “fundamental breach of contract.”258

       The PMC concluded that the contractor had misrepresented the works’ sta-
tus “only to get your retention money refunded. This amounts to fraudulent
practice.”259

       IDCO had certified many of the contractor’s earlier invoices for payment, and
on this basis the PMC had paid for much of the work that it found to be incom-
plete.260 In a letter to IDCO sent on November 11, 2005, the PMC concluded that
given the works’ incompleteness, IDCO’s issuance of a completion certificate and
recommendation to release Shyamalal’s security deposit was “a criminal miscon-
duct on the part of the concerned GM, IDCO, Sambalpur.”261

       Despite all these significant identified problems and indicators of fraud, in Feb-
ruary 2006 the PMC reported to the Bank that the civil works at DHH Sambalpur
were complete as of May 3, 2003.262

                       The DIR visited DHH Sambalpur on April 2, 2007—approximately three years
                    after IDCO certified the work to be complete and two years after the PMC’s inspec-
                    tion concluded that the certification was false. The DIR observed that many of the civil
                    works problems identified by the PMC in 2005 persisted, including the following:

                        ■■   The operating theater was locked and unused, and medical officials told
                             the DIR that it had never been completed and handed over for their use.
                             Renovations of other portions of the hospital also were never completed.
                             (See Photograph 63 on page 308.)

                        ■■   The walls and ceilings of the new patient ward were cracked so severely
                             that at one location in the male ward, the DIR observed sunlight shining
                             through from the other side of the wall. Further, many of the corridors in
                             this ward and other renovated spaces exhibited discoloration indicative of
                             water damage and mold.

                        ■■   The joints between the old building and new ward were poorly sealed and
                             exhibited signs of water damage. Medical officials told the DIR that dur-
                             ing monsoon season, these joints and other ceilings leaked severely. (See
                             Photograph 64 on page 308.)

                        ■■   The new units’ toilets were not connected to any septic system. Instead,
                             the sewage flowed out of pipes and poured onto the ground near the new
                             patient ward. Many of these bathrooms also lacked running water, and the
                             DIR observed several sinks without connections to drains. (See Photo-
                             graph 65 on page 309.)

                        ■■   The diesel generator building had been constructed, but the OHSDP-
                             provided generator was uninstalled and unused, and some hospital wiring
                             appeared unrepaired. (See Photograph 66 on page 309.)

                       The civil works problems observed by the DIR are consistent with those
                    observed by the PMC in 2005 and are inconsistent with IDCO’s 2004 certifica-
                    tion of the works’ completion. This is an indicator that IDCO’s certification was
                    fraudulent. The DIR’s observations are also inconsistent with the PMC’s February
                    2006 claim that the works were complete. Because project correspondence clearly
                    indicates that the PMC was aware of the civil works problems at the site, these
                    inconsistencies are indicators that the PMC’s February 2006 report of Sambalpur’s
                    completion may have been fraudulent as well.

C.	Indications That the PMC’s Status Reports Were
    Inaccurate
       Under the Credit Agreement and the PIP, the Government of Orissa was respon-
sible for monitoring the OHSDP’s progress and providing periodic status reports
to the Bank.263 This task was fulfilled by the PMC, and the Bank relied extensively
on PMC data in its supervision mission reports and ICR.264

       The DIR’s site visits, however, frequently found civil works implementation
problems that were inconsistent with the PMC’s status reports. For example, in
February 2006 the PMC reported that CHC-II Balipatna, DHH Jagatsinghpur,
DHH Koraput, DHH Malkangiri, DHH Sambalpur, and DHH Sonepur were all
complete.265 Yet these six hospitals were among the 10 that the DIR identified as
exhibiting strong indicators of fraud because of their civil works deficiencies. As
detailed above, the PMC even certified DHH Sambalpur as complete when project
documents show that the PMC was accusing the contractor and CMC of fraud
because they reported the hospital complete when it was not.

       In total, the PMC reported that 82 percent of the DIR-visited hospitals were
complete, while the DIR observed civil works problems that suggest the opposite
conclusion at 90 percent of these hospitals.266 These inconsistencies indicate that
the PMC’s status reports were inaccurate.

D.	Indicators of Fraud in the PMC’s Procurement of Civil
    Works Consultants
       Because the PMC lacked the capacity to manage the OHSDP’s 156 civil works
projects itself, the DOHFW—the ministry in which the PMC was located—hired
consultants to design and engineer the hospital renovations and hired CMCs to
procure and supervise the services of construction contractors.267 The DIR found
indicators of fraudulent manipulation of procurement results—including favoring
certain bidders and awarding contracts to possibly unqualified firms—in both of
these sets of procurements.

                           1.	 Design and Engineering Consultant Procurement

                           The PMC hired seven firms to design and engineer its civil works plans by let-
                    ting seven contract packages for work on different groups of OHSDP-funded hos-
                    pitals.268 The DOHFW advertised the packages, and 85 firms submitted expressions
                    of interest that stated their qualifications. The DOHFW rated 18 firms as having
                    the requisite qualifications and experience, and from these 18 firms it developed
                    shortlists for each of the contract packages. The DOHFW then sent Requests for
                    Proposals to the short-listed firms and evaluated submitted bids using a quality-
                    and cost-based selection (QCBS) method that considered both technical merit (as
                    subjectively evaluated against a set of benchmark criteria) and price. A firm’s pro-
                    posal had to receive a technical evaluation score of at least 75 points (of 100 pos-
                    sible) to be considered responsive. Proposals that cleared this threshold were given
                    an overall score, with 80 percent weight given to the technical evaluation score and
                    20 percent given to the financial score (price). The firm with the highest total score
                    won the contract.

                           The DIR found indicators suggesting that the DOHFW fraudulently manipu-
                    lated the results of tenders to award contracts to favored firms or to create the
                    appearance of a competitive process. These indicators, standing alone, are insuf-
                    ficient to prove conclusively that the DOHFW manipulated tender results. How-
                    ever, they do suggest possible problems that merit further investigation.

                           Indicators That the DOHFW Manipulated Procurements to Award Contracts
                    to Favored Firms. In two contract packages, the DOHFW’s technical evaluations
                    scored one firm as a clear winner and two other firms barely above the 75-point
                    minimum threshold for technical responsiveness:

                           ■■   In Package One, the DOHFW gave Dalal Consultants and Engineers, Ltd.
                                a technical score of 83.96—the third-highest score received by any firm—
                                but gave Architects and Planners a score of 75.17 and Shankar Consultants
                                a score of 75.04. Architects and Planners and Shankar Consultants’ bids
                                qualified by only 0.17 and 0.04 points, respectively.

                           ■■   In Package Three, the DOHFW gave STUP Consultant a technical score
                                of 84.54—the second-highest score received by any firm—but gave Tata
                                Consulting Engineers a score of 75.48 and Mathur and Kapre Associates
                    268	
                        The DIR requested that the PMC provide it with complete copies of all OHSDP procurement documents.
                    The PMC failed to do so, and the documents that it did provide often were incomplete, untitled, disorganized,
                    and unpaginated. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted, the following OHSDP design consultant and CMC
                    procurement analyses are based on PMC procurement documents for which document-specific citation is
                    impossible.



                                                                          226
                                                      Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


         a score of exactly 75. Thus Tata’s proposal qualified by only 0.48 points,
         and Mathur and Kapre’s bid met the minimum requirement exactly. The
         technical scoring sheets for Package Three also exhibited a large number
         of erasures and corrections, which are indicators that the scores may have
         been manipulated.

   The high scores assigned to the winning firm, and the scoring of two firms
as barely responsive, indicates that the DOHFW may have favored the winning
firm and then manipulated the losing firms’ scores to ensure that their bids were
responsive, thereby creating the appearance of genuine competition.

   Indicators That the DOHFW Manipulated Procurements to Create the Appear-
ance of Competition. In two other contract packages that lacked a clear winner,
proposals were scored at or just above the 75-point minimum technical respon-
siveness threshold:

    ■■   In Package Four, all three responsive proposals barely cleared the thresh-
         old: the DOHFW gave Haven Consultants a score of 75.68, Aarvee Associ-
         ates a score of 75.24, and Team Consulting a score of 75.17.

    ■■   In Package Seven, the DOHFW gave two firms—SMEC International and
         Deccan Architects—technical scores just above 76 and gave Decoarch—
         the third and final responsive firm—a score of exactly 75. The technical
         scoring sheets for Package Seven also exhibited a large number of erasures
         and corrections.

   The scoring of all three firms just above the minimum threshold or the third
responsive firm at exactly the minimum threshold indicates that the DOHFW may
have fraudulently manipulated the firms’ scores in order to award the contract and/
or score three firms as responsive. Such manipulation could result in an unquali-
fied firm receiving the contract.

   Further Indicators That the DOHFW Manipulated Firms’ Technical Evaluations.
In addition to the above, the DIR found two other indicators that the DOHFW
may have fraudulently manipulated firms’ technical evaluations to shape the out-
come of tenders. First, a comparison of repeat proposers’ technical evaluation
scores across tenders revealed that, controlling for bidder errors, the DOHFW
gave widely varying technical evaluation scores to the same firm, even though it
was evaluating highly similar qualifications in both cases. The DOHFW gave:

    ■■   Decoarch a score of 81.02 on Package Two, but a score of 75 on Package
         Seven;


                                        227
India DIR (OHSDP)


                            ■■   Ed Cil Consultants a score of 59.34 on Package Four, but a score of 76.32
                                 on Package Six;

                            ■■   Ghose, Bose and Associates a score of 63.13 on Package Four, but a score
                                 of 77.44 on Package Five;

                            ■■   SMEC International a score of 80.82 on Package Six, but a score of 76.37
                                 on Package Seven; and

                            ■■   Team Consulting a score of 75.17 on Package Four, but a score of 84.44 on
                                 Package Six.

                           These differences contrast with Haven Associates, which received consistent
                    technical evaluation scores in Packages Four (75.68) and Five (74.64). Such large
                    differences for mostly repeat proposals indicate that technical scores may have
                    been raised or lowered to fraudulently affect tender outcomes.

                           Second, in two cases short-listed firms with significant professional experience
                    nonetheless submitted proposals with obvious errors:

                            ■■   In Package Two, the DOHFW gave Aarvee Associates zeros in its evalu-
                                 ation of some of its staff qualifications—likely because the curricula vitae
                                 included in its proposal were unsigned. In contrast, the same firm submit-
                                 ted a responsive bid on Package Four.

                            ■■   In Package Three, the DOHFW reported that Madhya Pradesh Laghu
                                 Udyog Nigam Ltd. failed to sign the CVs included in its proposal and that
                                 Architects and Associates submitted a completely blank proposal.

                           These may have been genuine mistakes, but their obviousness raises questions
                    regarding how an experienced firm could have made them.

                           2.	 CMC Procurement

                           To give the OHSDP a rolling start, the DOHFW hired IDCO to assist with
                    the design, procurement, and implementation of the first 22 civil works projects
                    because it had worked on World Bank projects in the past.269 IDCO, however,
                    appears to have been in financial difficulty around the time of this sole-sourcing:
                    according to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, in fiscal year 1999–
                    2000 IDCO lost INR 149.47 million (USD 3.3 million) and had accumulated a net
                    loss of INR 319.54 million (USD 7.1 million).270

       The PMC planned to open PSA contracts to competitive bidding in 1999, but
this actually occurred in 2001 as part of a broader effort to expedite slow civil
works progress.271 The DOHFW hired five CMCs by letting five contract packages
regarding different groups of OHSDP-funded hospitals. As with its design consul-
tants, the DOHFW first advertised the packages, and 52 firms submitted expres-
sions of interest that stated their qualifications. From these 52 firms, the DOHFW
short-listed six firms for each contract and sent them Requests for Proposals. The
DOHFW evaluated submitted bids using a Fixed Budget Selection (FBS) process in
which bidders submitted their technical and financial proposals, within a specified
budget range, in separate envelopes. The DOHFW first opened the technical pro-
posals and evaluated them on a 100-point scale, with a 75-point minimum thresh-
old for responsiveness. After this evaluation, the DOHFW opened the financial
proposals of responsive firms and disqualified any firms above the stated budget.
The firm within the financial budget that received the highest technical evaluation
score won the contract.

       In four of these five tenders, the DIR found indicators suggesting manipulation
of the tenders’ outcomes:

        ■■   In Package One, only two of the six short-listed firms submitted proposals,
             and the DOHFW found only OCCL’s proposal to be responsive. OCCL’s
             technical evaluation score was 76.133—just 1.133 points above the respon-
             siveness threshold—and the DIR noted a large number of erasures and cor-
             rections on its technical evaluation scoring sheets. Further, the DOHFW
             gave the other competing firm—Dynamic Project—a technical evaluation
             score of 51.97. While the PMC did not provide the DIR with the documents
             needed to compare the firm’s expression-of-interest and tender submissions,
             this low score appears at odds with the DOHFW’s decision to short-list the
             firm based on its experience and technical qualifications.

        ■■   In Package Two, the DOHFW found only one firm, K.K. Agrawal and
             Associates, to have submitted a responsive proposal. The DOHFW gave
             K.K. Agrawal a technical evaluation score of 77.59—only slightly above
             the 75-point responsiveness threshold—and the DIR noted a large num-
             ber of erasures and corrections on the DOHFW’s K.K. Agrawal technical
             evaluation scoring sheets.

India DIR (OHSDP)


                            ■■    In Package Four, the DOHFW found two firms—MECON Ltd. and Orissa
                                  Bridge and Construction Corporation Ltd.—to have submitted responsive
                                  proposals, with technical evaluation scores of 75.60 and 75.10, respec-
                                  tively. Both firms cleared the technical responsiveness threshold by less
                                  than a point. The DOHFW found the proposals of two other firms—Gh-
                                  erzi Eastern Ltd. and Swain and Associates Ltd.—to be non-responsive
                                  for insufficient experience, despite shortlisting the firms because they sup-
                                  posedly had good experience and qualifications. (As before, the PMC did
                                  not provide the DIR with the documents needed to compare the firm’s
                                  expression-of-interest and tender submissions.) Further, the DOHFW
                                  was inconsistent in applying its criticism to evaluation scores: it stated that
                                  both Swain and Associates and Orissa Bridge and Construction lacked
                                  statewide project and World Bank experience, but it found Swain’s bid
                                  unresponsive and Orissa Bridge and Construction’s bid responsive. The
                                  DOHFW eventually awarded the contract to MECON.

                            ■■    In Package Five, the DOHFW awarded IDCO a new contract despite: (1)
                                  IDCO receiving a lower technical score than Kirloskar Consultants Ltd.;
                                  and (2) noting that, “as a sole source consultant, IDCO could not orga-
                                  nize its team properly for design and implementation of 22 hospitals under
                                  OHSDP for which the benchmarks could not be achieved.”272 Given the FBS
                                  process used for this tender, it is likely that IDCO won the contract because
                                  Kirloskar’s proposal exceeded the contract’s budget limit, but the PMC did

                           As with the OHSDP design consultant tenders, these indicators alone are insuf-
                    ficient to conclude that the DOHFW fraudulently manipulated tender results.
                    However, the winning firms’ marginally responsive technical evaluation scores
                    suggest that favored and potentially unqualified firms may have received contracts
                    to serve as CMCs—a possibility underscored by the indicators of widespread fraud
                    in the implementation of the OHSDP’s civil works activities.

                        Contractor Procurement
                           The five CMCs conducted the procurement and supervision of all OHSDP civil
                    works contractors.273 Their procurement responsibilities included finalizing bid

documents and issuing bid invitations, opening and evaluating bids, recommend-
ing contract awards, and arranging for contract signature after OHSDP tender
committee approval.274

       The DIR reviewed their procurements and found four indicators of bid rigging
and fraud: (1) the contracts exhibited very low levels of competition, with only 190
firms competing for 155 contracts; (2) the CMCs frequently found low-price bid-
ders to have submitted non-responsive bids, resulting in 25 percent of all contracts
not being awarded to the lowest bidder; (3) winning contract prices exceeded the
CMCs’ cost estimates in 80 percent of the procurements; and (4) 13 firms subcon-
tracted 27 contracts without PMC approval. In addition, the DIR found that the
PMC failed to maintain complete procurement records, in apparent violation of
the OHSDP Credit Agreement.

       In total, the OHSDP issued 13 invitations for bids on 36 packages of contracts
that were managed by the five CMCs. These packages resulted in the award of
155 individual contracts. The DIR reviewed data from these contract tenders as a
whole, by CMC, by district, by package, and by contractor. The DIR also performed
an in-depth review of the procurement documents for a selection of eight contract
packages that resulted in 52 individual contracts. The DIR selection covered 34
percent of all OHSDP contracts and included all five CMCs (Table 2).

       As a result of this review, the DIR found the following.

       1.	 Competition for OHSDP Tenders Was Low

       Across all OHSDP tenders, 190 firms competed for 155 contracts. Such a low
level of competition may have been caused by the procuring authority deterring

       See, e.g., IDCO General Contract, appx. A(1)(v).


                                                              231

                    other firms from competing, and/or fraudulently excluding those that did compete,
                    in order to favor a certain bidder. Most OHSDP civil works contracts attracted
                    between only one and three bidders (Figure 1).

                    Figure 1. Distribution of Contracts by Number of Bidders




                       Contracts with few bidders were not distributed evenly among the CMCs. Low
                    competition was more prominent in tenders conducted by K.K. Agrawal, 44 per-
                    cent of which had only one or two bidders, and SCAG, 34 percent of which had
                    only one or two bidders (Figure 2).

Note: Percentages are the share of contracts with only one or two bidders out of all the contracts
awarded by the CMC.


       Contracts with few bidders also were more common in some districts than oth-
ers. In 10 of Orissa’s 30 districts, more than 40 percent of the district’s OHSDP
tenders attracted only one or two bidders (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Distribution of Contracts with One or Two Bidders, by
District




       In addition, the DIR observed that certain firms were exceptionally success-
ful in winning the contracts for which they bid. Eighteen firms bid only once and
won the contract for which they bid; 44 percent of these cases occurred in IDCO
procurements. Similarly, three firms competing on SCAG tenders and three firms
competing on K.K. Agrawal tenders won all the contracts for which they bid.275

       The low level of OHSDP contract competition, the more frequent occurrence of
low competition in tenders administered by certain CMCs or in certain districts,
and certain firms’ ability to win every contract for which they bid are indicators
of bid rigging and fraud. Consistent with such a scheme, the DIR also found that
lower-priced bidders were often disqualified from tenders for submitting non-re-
sponsive bids.
275	
    The three SCAG bidders won 11 contracts between them, while the three K.K. Agrawal bidders won six
contracts between them. The SCAG bidders were BSES Ltd. (six contracts), SYN Developers Pvt. Ltd. (three
contracts), and Bamabasi Panda (two contracts). The K.K. Agrawal bidders were Rajbir Prasad Aggarwal, M.K.
Mohanty, and K.K. & Sons, each of which won two contracts.

                       2.	 The CMCs Frequently Found Low-Price Bids to Be
                       Non-Responsive

                       In six of the eight packages that it reviewed, the DIR found repeated cases in
                    which the CMC declared the bid of a lower-priced bidder to be non-responsive
                    and eliminated it from the tender. Twenty-five percent of all OHSDP civil works
                    contracts were not awarded to the lowest bidder. The CMCs may have disqualified
                    some of these bids for legitimate reasons, but the frequency of the disqualifica-
                    tions—particularly given the low levels of OHSDP contract competition—is an
                    indicator that some disqualifications may have been made on pretextual grounds
                    in order to favor a higher-priced bidder. In total, the OHSDP would have saved
                    INR 26.9 million (USD 598,000) if it had awarded all these contracts to the lowest-
                    price bidder.

                       While all five CMCs disqualified lowest-priced bidders, some CMCs did so
                    more frequently than others. IDCO was the most likely to disqualify a lower bid-
                    der, followed by SCAG and K.K. Agrawal (Figure 4).

   The disqualification of lower-cost bidders was more common in certain districts
than others. In nine districts, lower-priced bidders were found non-responsive in
50 percent or more of all contracts put to tender. Figure 5 details this trend.

Figure 5. Contracts With and Without Lower-Bidder Rejections, by
District




The result of these disqualifications was that the firms providing OHSDP tender
competition were excluded from tenders. Unlike the 88 firms that bid on only
one OHSDP contract, 75 percent (30 of 39) of the disqualified lower bidders were
repeat bidders that competed for three or more contracts (Figure 6).

                    Evaluated Bidders Competed




                           The high frequency of low-price-bidder disqualifications and the tendency for
                    this to occur more frequently with some CMCs and in some districts are indicators
                    of bid rigging and fraud. Not all facts suggest bid rigging: the three firms that won
                    the most OHSDP contracts—BSES Ltd. (six contracts), Pramod Kumar Rath (five
                    contracts), and the Orissa Small Industries Corporation (OSIC, five contracts)—
                    were among the lower bidders disqualified in other tenders. However, this fact
                    does not eliminate the possibility of favoritism within individual tenders or the
                    overall pattern of low-bidder disqualification. Consistent with this indicator, the
                    DIR found that OHSDP civil works contracts frequently exceeded the cost esti-
                    mates generated by the CMCs’ engineers.

                           3.	 Contract Prices Often Exceeded the CMC Engineers’ Cost
                           Estimates

                           Eighty percent of the OHSDP civil works contracts were awarded at prices that
                    exceeded their cost estimates.276 This high frequency of unexpectedly high contract
                    prices is an indicator of bid rigging and fraud affecting the procurement process.
                    The distribution of contracts over their cost estimates is provided in Figure 7.




                    276	
                           This occurred in 124 contracts out of 155.



                                                                        236

Figure 7. Distribution of Contracts Exceeding Their Cost Estimate, by
Size of Overrun




   Contracts with high prices usually resulted from tenders with low levels of
competition. Contracts that exceeded their cost estimate by 15 percent or more
were most common in tenders with three bidders or fewer (Figure 8).

Figure 8. Distribution of Contracts Exceeding Their Cost Estimate
and Other Contracts, by Number of Bidders




   Some CMCs were also more likely to award high-price contracts than others,
further suggesting bid rigging. While all of the CMCs’ average contract prices
exceeded their cost estimates, SCAG’s contracts were significantly more expensive

                    than the norm: they averaged 16 percent above estimate, equating to an INR 1.1
                    million (USD  25,000) price increase on each contract. By comparison, the firm
                    with the next highest average, K.K. Agrawal, awarded contracts at an average of 11
                    percent above estimate.

                       The extent to which contract prices exceeded cost estimates varied by district
                    as well. Figure 10 illustrates by district the average percentage by which contract
                    prices exceeded their cost estimates.

   In addition, the DIR found that even within the same district, the CMCs dif-
fered significantly in how much their contract prices exceeded their cost estimates.
For example, IDCO, K.K. Agrawal, and OCCL all conducted tenders in the district
of Bolangir. But while K.K. Agrawal’s contract prices were only 4.8 percent over
estimate, OCCL’s prices were 9.6 percent over estimate, and IDCO’s prices were
19.4 percent over estimate. Similar variations existed between IDCO and SCAG
in the districts of Malkangiri and Gajapati. Figure 11 details this pattern in seven
districts.

                           OHSDP procurement documents also note significant variations between the
                    cost estimates and contractors’ bid prices for specific items listed in each contract’s
                    bill of quantities. In India, item prices that vary more than 40 percent from the cost
                    estimate are called “unbalanced items,” and bidders are required to provide addi-
                    tional performance security to address the risks associated with them.277 The DIR
                    observed several cases of unbalanced items and inconsistent treatment of bidders
                    in its contract documents selection:

                            ■■    In a 2000 SCAG-administered tender, the DIR found that three of the six
                                  contracts were awarded to firms whose bids contained unbalanced items.
                                  SCAG also requested inconsistent bid security amounts from bidders,
                                  which may indicate favoritism: it required Gyanendra Nath Das to provide
                                  a two percent security for unbalanced items comprising 11 percent of its
                                  CHC-II Kanpur bid cost, but it required Reliance Construction to a provide
                                  a 10 percent security for unbalanced items comprising 14 percent of its AH
                                  Narasinghpur bid cost. In a third case, SCAG did not require G.K. Singh to
                                  provide any additional security for its CHC-II Derabish bid despite having
                                  unbalanced items that comprised 7.6 percent of its bid cost.

        ■■    In a 2000 K.K. Agrawal–administered procurement, the DIR identified
              unbalanced items comprising contracts’ civil works, public health works,
              and electrical works components. For example, Dilip Construction’s bid
              for work on CHC-II Mahipur priced certain civil works items 55 percent
              below the cost estimate, certain public health works items 50 percent below
              the cost estimate, and certain electrical works items 65 percent below the
              cost estimate.278 Yet despite these item prices being below estimate, Dilip’s
              overall bid price was 31.8 percent above estimate.279

        ■■    In a 2000 IDCO-administered procurement, the DIR identified unbal-
              anced items in 11 of the 13 contracts put to tender. The DIR also noted that
              in a 2001 IDCO-administered tender two contractors’ winning bids stated
              a total bid price and individual line item prices that were nearly identical
              to the cost estimate.

              First, K.K. Mohanty’s bid for a contract on CHC-II Mudrajore was only
              0.03 percent lower than the cost estimate, and 87 percent of its bill-of-
              quantity item bid prices were either exactly the same as the cost estimate
              or rounded up or down from the cost estimate.280 Table 3 provides exam-

                    prices were either exactly the same as the cost estimate or rounded up or down
                    from the cost estimate.281 Table 4 provides examples of these items.

                           These similarities suggest that K.K. Mohanty and H.K. Pradhan obtained a
                    copy of the confidential cost estimate and may indicate IDCO favoritism toward
                    these firms.



                       DIR Contract ID No. 1167732022. The cost estimate was INR 4,819,836, while H.K. Pradhan’s bid price was
                    281	

                    INR 4,829,951—a difference of only INR 10,115.

       The DIR thus found frequent and large discrepancies across the OHSDP civil
works contracts’ cost estimates, as well as prices that: (1) correlated with low bid-
der competition; and (2) varied by CMC, both across and within districts. The
large discrepancies between cost estimates and contract prices could have been
caused by poor-quality estimates, outdated estimates, or significant changes in the
market prices for relevant commodities. However, the frequency and scale of the
differences—and the appearance and inconsistent treatment of numerous unbal-
anced items in the OHSDP bid documents—make these differences an indicator
of bid rigging and fraud.

       4.	 Several Contractors Subcontracted Their Work Without PMC
       Approval

       In June 2003, the PMC issued a letter identifying 13 contractors that had
subcontracted their work to other firms without PMC approval.282 The DIR also
identified several of these subcontracting cases in its review of hospital-related
correspondence. Between them, these contractors had awarded 27 unauthorized
subcontracts for work on hospitals managed by four CMCs (Table 5).

       This subcontracting is an indicator of attempted fraud by the contractors upon
the project and may have contributed to the low competition on OHSDP tenders
by providing an alternative way for less-qualified firms to obtain project-funded
work. The subcontracting is also an indicator of CMC-contractor collusion because,
though the CMCs were responsible for supervising this work, the DIR obtained no
documents indicating that they acted to stop this unauthorized subcontracting.
Accordingly, these 27 unauthorized subcontracts merit further investigation.

                           5.	 The PMC Failed to Produce or Retain Complete Procurement
                           Documentation

                           The PMC purported to provide the DIR with full and complete copies of all
                    its OHSDP procurement documentation. Yet the DIR’s review of its selection of
                    contract documents found that in six of the eight contract packages reviewed, doc-
                    uments were missing, incomplete, or illegible. Missing documents included bid
                    devaluation reports, bid documents, and large portions of bid documents. In two
                    packages—OHSDP (November 12, 2000) and SCAG (November 9, 2000)—the
                    DIR found that the PMC had not retained the bid documents of any losing bid-
                    ders, and the bid evaluation reports’ bills of quantities were missing pages.

                           The Credit Agreement required the Government of India to “ensure that all
                    records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts, and other documents) evidenc-
                    ing … expenditures are retained until at least one year after the [Bank] has received
                    the audit report for the Fiscal Year in which the last withdrawal from the Interim
                    Fund Credit Account was made” and to “enable the [Bank’s] representatives to
                    examine such records.”283 The PMC’s failure to retain or produce these core pro-
                    curement documents raises serious concerns regarding the accuracy and transpar-
                    ency of the bid evaluation process, prevents effective project audit, and may violate
                    the Government of India’s obligations under the OHSDP Credit Agreement.

                           The OHSDP’s civil works component exhibited indicators of fraud in its imple-
                    mentation and bid rigging and fraud in its procurement. The DIR identified simi-
                    lar indicators in the project’s equipment component.


                    Equipment, Instruments, and Furnishings
                    In addition to improving the buildings at 156 Orissa hospitals, the OHSDP also
                    provided new medical equipment, instruments, and furnishings (EIF) to those
                    hospitals to improve their patient treatment capacity. The DIR found indicators
                    of fraud and corruption in the procurement and provision of these EIF items that
                    in turn may have adversely affected their installation, performance, and repair.
                    The DIR’s most significant finding was that suppliers frequently provided equip-
                    ment that was substandard and/or potentially hazardous; that these firms’ bids
                    often contained fraudulent technical compliance certificates (or lacked such cer-
                    tificates altogether); and that ELMARC’s failure to identify any of these issues in
                    its bid evaluations and EIF inspections suggests its complicity in these apparent
                    283

frauds. Consistent with this finding, the DIR also observed that equipment was
non-functional when delivered or not installed properly, despite supposedly being
inspected by ELMARC; that equipment was oversupplied or provided to hospitals
that lacked the staff or training to use it; that ELMARC and the project suppliers
did not respond to equipment quality complaints; and that ELMARC’s EIF pro-
curements exhibited indicators of bid rigging.

       As the next section details, the DIR also found that the success of the OHSDP’s
equipment components was at risk from the very beginning because of equipment
maintenance gaps and ELMARC’s financial troubles.

A.	 ELMARC Was Highly in Debt at the Time of Its First
    Contract, and Its Contracts Gave It No Responsibility for
    Maintenance
       To review the OHSDP’s EIF implementation, the DIR first researched ELMARC’s
corporate background and the terms of its OHSDP contracts. The DIR found that
ELMARC was highly in debt at the time of its first contract and that its contracts
failed to include equipment maintenance responsibility, as was required by the PIP
and the OHSDP Project and Credit Agreements.

       In 1997, the DOHFW proposed sole-sourcing the management of the OHS-
DP’s EIF component to ELMARC, a state-owned enterprise established in 1991
to provide maintenance services to users of professional electronic equipment.284
To justify ELMARC’s sole-sourcing, the DOHFW noted the firm’s technical skill,
its past experience in the state health sector, the efficiency and project owner-
ship benefits of using a local firm with government connections, and the lack of
a viable alternative choice.285 The DOHFW indirectly acknowledged ELMARC’s
capacity limitations by recommending an effort “to strengthen ELMARC in terms
of infrastructure and training to address in a cost-effective manner the issue of
maintenance on a permanent basis.”286 But it did not mention ELMARC’s financial
status. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, in fiscal year
1996–1997 ELMARC was, but for its government support, effectively insolvent: it
lost INR 8.1 million (USD 180,000) and had accumulated net losses of INR 12.38
million (USD 275,000) that exceeded its total paid-in capital of INR 10.1 million

                    (USD 226,000).287 While this fact does not indicate fraud or corruption, it appears
                    to have gone previously unnoticed by the Bank and raises questions regarding
                    ELMARC’s capacity to fulfill its contractual obligations.

                           On March 22, 1999, the DOHFW awarded ELMARC a consulting contract to
                    implement the OHSDP’s EIF components.288 ELMARC’s contract was extended
                    four times, to a final date of September 30, 2006.289 ELMARC’s responsibilities also
                    expanded over time: its initial contract required it not only to conduct equipment
                    procurement—including drafting equipment specifications and soliciting and
                    evaluating bids—but also to inspect procured equipment, maintain accounts for
                    winning bidders, and provide progress reports to the PMC.290 ELMARC’s August
                    3, 2001, contract extension made it responsible for monitoring and responding to
                    post-procurement issues such as equipment installation and training.291 ELMARC’s
                    final extension further expanded its duties to include “ensur[ing] installation of
                    the balance equipment procured by this project for the project hospitals”; verifying
                    installation; and recommending final payment to suppliers.292

                           However, all of ELMARC’s contracts were deficient in one important respect:
                    they did not make ELMARC responsible for EIF maintenance. Under the PIP,
                    ELMARC was to be responsible for the “one-time repair of defective equip-
                    ment, instruments and furniture in the hospitals selected to receive World Bank
                    inputs,”293 and for “extend[ing] maintenance support for new equipment to be
                    procured under this project beyond the warranty period.”294 ELMARC’s contract,
                    however, made the hospitals’ medical officers responsible for EIF maintenance.295
                    (These medical officers, in turn, informed the DIR that they did not know who to
                    contact to obtain repairs or warranty-based service—a problem exacerbated by the
                    closure of the PMC and rumors that ELMARC itself would close.) The PMC’s fail-
                    ure to make ELMARC responsible for maintenance violated the PIP and as a result

B.	 Indicators of Fraud and Corruption in EIF Implementation
       The DIR identified six indicators suggesting that ELMARC and its suppliers
engaged in fraud and corruption in the implementation of the OHSDP’s EIF
components.

       1.	 Suppliers Provided, and ELMARC Accepted, EIF Items that Were
       Technically Non-Compliant and Accompanied by Fraudulent or Non-
       Existent Technical Compliance Certificates

       During its visits to OHSDP-funded hospitals, the DIR inspected units of
ELMARC-procured EIF items and found that many were non-compliant with the
bidding documents’ stated technical specifications. In some cases, the equipment
posed a danger to human health and safety. The DIR also found that ELMARC
had awarded contracts for this non-compliant equipment to firms whose bids: (1)
lacked the required certifications of technical compliance; (2) contained certifica-
tions that appeared on their faces to be fraudulent; or (3) contained documents
that bidders fraudulently represented to be “certifications” when in fact they did
not certify compliance with any standard.

       ELMARC’s failure to adequately review the certifications included with suppli-
ers’ bids and its failure to conduct adequate EIF inspections may have been caused
solely by a lack of capacity or poor performance. However, the high frequency
and obviousness of these problems suggests that ELMARC may have conspired
with its suppliers to fraudulently certify non-compliant or dangerous equipment
as meeting project specifications. The OHSDP’s EIF implementation failures are
therefore an indicator of fraud and corruption meriting further investigation. The
DIR’s detailed findings follow.

       The DIR Identified OHSDP-Procured EIF Items That Were Non-Compliant with
Technical Specifications or Hazardous. The DIR identified 17 different types of
OHSDP-procured EIF that did not comply with the technical specifications stated
in the OHSDP bid documents and/or were hazardous to the medical staff and
patients using it.

                           A biomedical engineer assisting the DIR identified the following 12 types of
                    equipment as not complying with bid document specifications because of faulty
                    design, poor-quality materials or fabrication, systemically poor installation, and/or
                    a failure to provide required test and compliance certifications (which are safeguards
                    to ensure good manufacturing and product safety). In the engineer’s opinion, these
                    defects originate in the supplier’s design, manufacturing, and quality-assurance
                    processes and therefore are likely endemic throughout the firm’s production:297

       In addition, the engineer identified five items of equipment that not only vio-
lated applicable specifications but also were potentially dangerous to the health and
safety of patients and medical staff.299 As with other non-compliant equipment, in
the engineer’s opinion these defects originate in the supplier’s design, manufac-
turing, and quality-assurance processes and therefore likely occur throughout the
firm’s production:

                             contain an adequate electrical grounding protection system and under
                             certain circumstances could expose patients and caretakers to a risk of
                             electrical shock. (see Photograph 81 on page 317).

                       Four of these pieces of equipment are of particular concern. Narayan Indus-
                    tries’ and Variety Vyapaar’s autoclaves—machines that use high-pressure steam to
                    sterilize their contents—had welded seams on their inner chambers that exhibited
                    corrosion. When the autoclave is in operation, the inner chamber contains the
                    high-pressure steam. If this seam were to fail, the pressure from the steam could
                    cause the autoclave to explode, endangering the safety of anyone nearby.

                       Compounding this risk, the biomedical engineer noted that of a group of 72
                    procured units, ELMARC could produce only two certificates stating that the
                    autoclaves had been pressure tested. Further, these certificates provided only the
                    manufacturer’s assertion that the test results were compliant with relevant stan-
                    dards. They did not describe the tests performed or the test results themselves. In
                    the engineer’s opinion, the autoclaves are sufficiently hazardous that the hospitals
                    that received them should be advised to stop using them until the supplier has pro-
                    vided either copies of unit-specific test certificates or performed pressure-safety
                    tests on units for which certificates cannot be produced.

                       In addition, the engineer observed that the baby incubators, radiant baby
                    warmers, and infant phototherapy units provided by Delta Medical Appliances
                    and Ravi Enterprises (which stocked Delta Medical equipment) all lacked proper
                    electrical grounding systems. As a result, in the event of common system faults
                    such as electrical insulation breakdowns or component failures, the equipment’s
                    external metal chassis could conduct live current and shock any baby or caregiver
                    who contacts those sections of the machine. The engineer also noted that Delta
                    Medical’s radiant baby warmers contained ceramic-sheathed heating elements
                    that frequently broke down because of a design weakness. In some cases, the DIR
                    observed that medical staff chose to suspend light bulbs from these defective
                    machines as a substitute warmer for the babies. The World Health Organization

       ELMARC Awarded EIF Contracts to Firms that Failed to Supply Required Techni-
cal Certifications or Provided Certifications That Appear Fraudulent. To determine
whether the OHSDP’s technically non-compliant EIF items were caused by fraud,
the DIR reviewed a selection of the bid documents from firms that supplied this
equipment. The DIR found that these bids frequently did not include certifications
of technical compliance or, in the alternative, provided certifications that appeared
to be fraudulent. ELMARC’s failure to identify and address these obvious prob-
lems suggests that it may have been a party to the suppliers’ fraudulent schemes.

       The DIR identified three types of technical certification document failures.
First, some firms failed to provide certifications and test results with their bid
documentation.

       ■■   Yorco Sales’ bid for an autoclave contract included only a sales brochure
            that provided illustrations and technical details regarding its models. The
            bid contained no independent verification that Yorco Sales’ product com-
            plied with ELMARC’s stated technical specifications, and its statement of
            technical details was identical to the technical specifications published in
            the bid documents. Despite this lack of required documentation, ELMARC
            awarded the contract to Yorco Sales.

       ■■   Super Cardiac Breaths’ bid to supply two-body mortuaries included only
            a sales brochure describing its products and their technical specifica-
            tions. This brochure’s statement of the mortuaries’ technical specifica-
            tions appeared to have been copied from the bidding documents’ techni-
            cal specifications: it was phrased in an identical manner and contained
            almost exactly the same content. Yet despite these indicators of fraud and
            the lack of independent certification of the mortuaries’ specifications,
            ELMARC awarded the contract to Super Cardiac Breaths. The biomedi-
            cal engineer assisting the DIR found that these mortuaries did not con-
            tain inner and outer stainless steel construction and thus did not meet
            required specifications.

gists that he interviewed “intensely disliked” the machines because they felt that the technology was obsolete and
possibly dangerous.

                                they lacked required testing certification.

                           Second, some firms submitted certifications that appeared fraudulent on their
                    face.

                           ■■   Yorco Sales’ bid for a contract to supply water distillation units included
                                two documents that both purported to be ISO 9001:2000 certifications
                                issued by the British Standards Institution (BSI). The documents were for-
                                matted differently, but they stated the same certification number and date.
                                This casts doubt on their legitimacy. Further, neither the BSI’s website,
                                which lists certified firms, nor Yorco Sales’ own website state that Yorco
                                Sales is ISO 9001:2000 certified. The biomedical engineer assisting the DIR
                                found that these water distillation units did not comply with the project’s
                                technical specifications because they lacked required testing certification.

                           ■■   Vishala Industries’ bid for a contract for bedside lockers and grouting
                                chairs included documents purporting to be ISO 9001:2000 accreditations
                                from DLIQ, the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand.
                                The “certificates” were for different products, but they: (1) shared the same
                                registration certificate number; (2) stated that they were issued from the
                                same office on the same day; and (3) were formatted very differently from
                                one another. These inconsistencies cast doubt on their legitimacy, and the
                                biomedical engineer assisting the DIR found that the lockers and chairs
                                failed to meet the project’s technical specifications.

        provided a document that purported to be an ISO 9001:2000 certification
        from ABS Texas. ABS Texas’ website, which lists accredited firms, shows
        no record of Super Cardiac Breath’s accreditation. Similarly, in a successful
        bid to supply stainless steel stools, Equipment de Chandigarh produced a
        document claiming to be a “certificate of approval” from QMS Certifica-
        tions Services. QMS Certifications Services’ website, which lists accredited
        firms, does not list Equipment de Chandigarh as accredited, and the bio-
        medical engineer assisting the DIR found that these stools did not meet
        the project’s technical specifications.

   Third, some firms submitted documents that purported to be certifications but
were not.

   ■■   Carewell Medical Systems’ bid for a hydraulic operating theater table con-
        tract included a document entitled a “calibration certificate,” but the cer-
        tificate did not regard calibration at all: it discussed only the unit’s physical
        dimensions as confirmed by a measuring tape. Despite this obvious flaw
        in the bid documentation, ELMARC awarded Carewell the contract. The

                                  the bid documents’ specifications.

                            ■■    ELMARC also had received complaints in January 2004 that Surgicoin was
                                  affiliated with Naresh Grover, a businessman reprimanded by the Bank in
                                  October 2003 for engaging in fraudulent practices.302

                            ■■    Delta Medical Appliances’ bids for contracts to supply infant photother-
                                  apy units, baby incubators, and radiant baby warmers included “certifi-
                                  cates” that purported to demonstrate the equipment’s compliance with
                                  IEC 60601 and Indian national standards. However, both documents only
                                  explained the applicable standards; they did not state that Delta’s equip-
                                  ment complied with them. Despite these obvious documentary flaws,
                                  ELMARC awarded these contracts to Delta Medical. As noted previously,
                                  the biomedical engineer assisting the DIR found that all three types of
                                  equipment were defective to an extent that potentially could endanger the
                                  infants and medical staff who use them.

                           The DIR identified all these issues solely by visually inspecting bid documents
                    and performing basic internet searches. Yet the DIR obtained no information sug-
                    gesting that ELMARC identified these issues. This failure and the frequency with
                    which these apparent frauds occurred are indicators of ELMARC’s possible par-
                    ticipation in fraud on the project.

                           2.	 Suppliers Frequently Provided Non-Functional Equipment

                           At 12 hospitals, medical officials informed the DIR that some OHSDP-provided
                    equipment was non-functional upon delivery. As with non-compliant and danger-
                    ous equipment, ELMARC’s failure to properly inspect these units may have been
                    caused by a lack of capacity of poor performance, but the problem’s high frequency
                    rate makes it an indicator of fraud and corruption.

                           The most frequently non-functional unit of procured equipment was Surgicoin’s
                    operating theater lights, which the DIR found to be partially or completely non-
                    functional—as a result of damage, poor installation, or non-durable components
                    like light bulbs that rapidly burnt out—in 65 percent of the hospitals it visited.303

                           Other examples of the provision of non-functional equipment include the
                    following:

                    303	
                           Such non-functionality was observed in 36 of the 55 DIR-visited hospitals.

        ■■   At DHH Malkangiri, the x-ray machines were missing power cables and
             the delivery table was broken when delivered.

        ■■   At AH Kesinga, the fetal monitors were broken when delivered.

        ■■   At DHH Sundargarh, the bacteriological incubators were broken when
             delivered.

        ■■   At CHC-I Banapur, DHH Dhenkanal, and DHH Rayagada, the baby incu-
             bators were non-functional upon delivery.

       Medical officers stated that they accepted the non-functional equipment for
varying reasons. Medical officers at DHH Koraput told the DIR that they believed
they had no choice but to accept the delivered equipment. Medical officers at
DHH Malkangiri told the DIR that they accepted non-functional equipment on
the promise—never fulfilled—that the equipment would be repaired quickly. And
medical officers at DHH Sundargarh stated that they accepted non-functional
equipment both because they were promised repairs within a week (which did not
occur) and because they felt they had to accept the equipment as delivered.

       3.	 Equipment Often Was Not Installed Properly

       Under its contract extension of August 3, 2001, ELMARC was responsible
for monitoring and responding to installation issues. This obligation was later
expanded to include ensuring and verifying equipment installation.304 Yet despite
this contractual responsibility, at 43 hospitals the DIR observed equipment that
was installed poorly or not at all. EIF installation problems were noted in the
Bank’s December 2005 supervision mission Aide-Mémoire, but the DIR’s observa-
tions suggest that nothing was done to resolve the issue.305 The widespread EIF
installation failures observed by the DIR are an indicator of fraud and corrup-
tion because, while they may be explained by poor capacity, poor performance, or
external factors, they are consistent with the possibility that ELMARC was more
interested in procuring equipment—and thus collecting fees and/or kickback pay-
ments from suppliers—than in ensuring that the procured equipment was used for
its intended purposes.

       The DIR’s observations of poor installation or non-installation of OHSDP-pro-
cured equipment included the following:

                        ■■   At DHH Malkangiri, a bacteriological incubator’s power cables and plugs
                             were not grounded.

                        ■■   At CHC-I Sohella, the autoclave was not properly grounded, and because
                             the power rating of the electrical supply circuit was too low, the entire hos-
                             pital’s electrical system tripped and shut down if the autoclave was used.

                        ■■   Air conditioning units were improperly installed at CHC-I Balipatna,
                             CHC-II Bangurigaon, CHC-I Banapur, AH Baramba, DHH Dhenkanal,

                             Soro. (See Photograph 82 on page 317.)

                        ■■   X-ray machines were installed inadequately (i.e., in a manner inhibiting
                             their operation) or not at all in CHC-I Banapur, AH Bolagarh, CHC-II
                             Rairakhol, DHH Sambalpur, and DHH Sundargarh.

                       The DIR also witnessed the tangible effect that this equipment non-installation
                    has on the OHSDP’s development goal of improving health services in Orissa.
                    At AH Bolagarh, the DIR met a 70-year-old woman who had fallen and injured
                    her hip the prior day. Because the hospital’s x-ray machine was not installed, the
                    local surgeon had to send her to a private x-ray facility 20 kilometers away over
                    rough roads. She and her son made the trip by auto-rickshaw and returned with
                    the x-ray film for the surgeon to diagnose. The surgeon informed her that she had
                    made the trip—which she described as agonizing—by traveling on a fractured hip.
                    (For further examples of uninstalled equipment, see Photographs 83–85 on page
                    318–319.)

                       4.	 Equipment Was Oversupplied

                       In 25 hospitals, the DIR observed that EIF items procured under the OHSDP
                    were provided in volumes that appeared much larger than the hospitals’ needs.
                    This observation is consistent with the findings of earlier OHSDP reviews, includ-
                    ing the Government of Orissa’s 2005 audit report, which noted procurement of EIF




                                                             256
                                                                        Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


items in excess of project plans totaling INR 125.3 million (USD 2.8 million); and
the 2006 Joint Survey of Status of Project Equipment, which noted oversupply of
phototherapy units, executive chairs, and steel cupboards.306 It is possible that such
oversupply resulted from poor needs estimation by ELMARC and the PMC. How-
ever, the volume and value of the oversupplied goods are so large that they suggest
that ELMARC may have intentionally procured excess EIF, which is an indicator
of fraud and corruption.

       As a result of this oversupply, much of the procured EIF items observed by the
DIR were in storage. For example, the DIR observed 22 sites in which furnish-
ings—such as executive chairs, executive tables, floor-mounted grouting chairs,
and stainless steel stools—were left in storage. Oversupply was not limited to fur-
niture: in half the hospitals it visited, the DIR observed baby incubators unused
or in storage.307 Further, at some hospitals the oversupply was so great that the
staff stored excess EIF items in areas designated for patient treatment, thus directly
impeding the project’s development goal of promoting the treatment of a higher
number of patients. In AH Podagada and CHC-II Majhapada, excess executive
chairs were stored in wards that otherwise would be used for patients, while in
DHH Nabarangpur, two excess desks were stored in the operating theater. (See
Photographs 86–88 on pages 319–320.)

       The Government of Orissa’s 2005 audit report identified Surgicoin as the firm
most frequently involved in oversupply. It supplied 1,486 extra suction appara-
tuses, 10 extra surgical diathermies, 24 extra operating theater lights, 249 extra
delivery tables, and 1,478 extra diagnostic sets for a total price of INR 9.52 million
(USD 212,000).308

       5.	 The Hospitals Lacked Personnel with the Skills or Training to
       Operate Provided Equipment

       ELMARC’s August 3, 2001, contract extension required it to monitor and
respond to issues regarding equipment training.309 Despite this requirement, at 16
different hospitals medical officers informed the DIR that equipment had been

                    provided without adequate training and as a result was not used.310 In some hospi-
                    tals procured equipment was still in its packaging, indicating that the supplier had
                    not given even a basic demonstration on its use. This lack of training was noted
                    as an issue in the Bank’s December 2005 supervision mission Aide-Mémoire and
                    the 2006 Joint Survey of Status of Project Equipment, but the DIR did not find any
                    indication that ELMARC had taken steps to address it.311

                           Similarly, at nine hospitals staff told the DIR that equipment was unused
                    because the hospital lacked personnel qualified to utilize it in their work.312 The
                    most prominent example was a lack of laboratory technicians to operate pH meters,
                    spectrophotometers, and flame photometers, as well as a lack of technicians to
                    operate electro-physiotherapy units and cystoscopes. Like the lack of equipment
                    training, the Bank noted the disjunction between the state’s medical staff resources
                    and equipment procurement levels in its project supervision reports, but the issue
                    was never resolved.313

                           Viewed in isolation, neither of these issues is an indicator of fraud and cor-
                    ruption because both can be explained by a lack of capacity in Orissa and a lack
                    of diligence by ELMARC and its suppliers. However, when viewed in the light of
                    ELMARC’s apparently poor equipment inspection, poor installation supervision,
                    and oversupply of EIF, these issues further suggest that ELMARC may have pro-
                    cured goods principally for the sake of procuring them, which is an indicator of
                    fraud and corruption.

   6.	 ELMARC and Its Suppliers Did Not Respond to Equipment Quality
   Complaints

   Finally, the DIR learned that at least eight medical officials had complained
to the PMC and/or ELMARC and its suppliers about EIF-related problems but
received no response. For example, medical officials told the DIR that:

    ■■   At DHH Jharsuguda, ELMARC never responded to requests to repair
         non-functional baby incubators.

    ■■   At DHH Nawarangpur, an autoclave had to be repaired locally because the
         supplier did not respond to repair requests.

    ■■   At DHH Malkangiri, suppliers did not respond to requests to repair an
         autoclave and ultrasound machine (the latter had required three repairs
         before the supplier refused to do additional repair work, despite its still-
         valid warranty). A supplier of a malfunctioning microscope also told a
         Malkangiri medical officer that the officer could not expect to receive a
         functioning microscope for the price that had been paid.

    ■■   At DHH Dhenkanal, DHH Puri, CHC-I Sohella, and DHH Sundargarh,
         Surgicoin never replied to complaints regarding non-functional operating
         theater lights.

   As with lack of personnel and training, there are many possible reasons why
these firms did not respond to medical officers’ complaints. But such non-respon-
siveness is consistent with the possibility that ELMARC was profiting from the
OHSDP through fraud and corruption rather than high service quality.

   The DIR identified six indicators that ELMARC and its suppliers may have
engaged in fraud and corruption in the implementation of the OHSDP’s EIF com-
ponents. As detailed below, the DIR also found indicators of fraud and corruption in
EIF procurement that are consistent with those identified in EIF implementation.

C.	Indicators of Fraud and Corruption in EIF Procurement
   ELMARC conducted EIF procurement in five phases between 1999 and 2006.
In total, the firm awarded 183 contracts worth approximately INR  547 million

                    (USD 12.1 million)—more contracts in number and value than any other OHSDP
                    PSA or CMC.314 Most of this procurement occurred in just one year: in 2004,
                    ELMARC awarded approximately 100 contracts (54 percent of its total) worth
                    INR 350 million (USD 7.8 million; 64 percent of its total) to provide EIF for a large
                    group of hospitals whose delayed civil works were all nearing completion.315

                           The DIR reviewed the bid documents for 33 EIF contracts that regarded a range
                    of equipment types. The DIR selected these contracts because they had been iden-
                    tified as potentially problematic by complaints, the 2006 Joint Survey of Status of
                    Project Equipment, or the DIR’s indicator-driven contract data searches. In addi-
                    tion to the technical certificate fraud and oversupply problems detailed above, the
                    DIR’s document reviews identified three other indicators of fraud and corruption
                    tainting these procurements.

                           1.	 ELMARC Treated Bidders Inconsistently

                           ELMARC awarded contracts to 84 different firms, but 12 firms received 58 per-
                    cent of these contracts (by value). The DIR’s review of documents regarding some
                    of these firms’ procurements found that ELMARC treated their bids more favor-
                    ably than those of other firms, indicating bid rigging.

                           For example, Vishala Industrial Craft was the fifth-most-successful bidder
                    for ELMARC-awarded contracts, receiving six contracts worth INR 24.4 million
                    (USD 538,000).316 In a tender for a contract to supply conference tables, ELMARC
                    initially found Vishala’s bid to be non-responsive because the firm’s test certificates
                    lacked required information. Two other bidders, Samar Steel Industries and Rial
                    Systems, were disqualified for similar omissions. But ELMARC permitted Vishala
                    alone to supplement its bid with additional information and, because of this sup-
                    plementation, Vishala won the contract.

                           Similarly, Royal Safe Company was the fourth-most-successful bidder for
                    ELMARC-awarded contracts, receiving four contracts worth INR  28.8 million
                    (USD 638,000). In each of these tenders, ELMARC awarded Royal Safe furniture
                    contracts despite initially declaring its bids non-responsive.317

       The DIR found indications that PMC and ELMARC officials gave preferential
treatment to other firms as well. For example, Variety Vayapar bid for a contract for
autoclaves and failed to provide full supporting documentation.318 Based on this
failure, ELMARC initially found the firm’s bid non-responsive, but the Bid Evalu-
ation Report states that this decision was overturned by other members of the Bid
Evaluation Committee and Variety Vyapaar won the contract. Similarly, ELMARC
awarded Equipement de Chandigarh a contract to supply stainless steel stools
despite the fact that: (1) Equipement de Chandigarh’s bid omitted required prod-
uct conformity reports; and (2) two other firms submitted lower priced bids.319

       Consistent with the DIR’s EIF implementation and procurement findings, at
least 11 firms complained about bid rigging and corruption in ELMARC’s EIF
procurements. These complaints included the following:

        ■■    A confidential witness informed the DIR that a relative of an OHSDP offi-
              cial involved in equipment procurement won contracts to provide furni-
              ture to the OHSDP.

        ■■    Three firms submitted complaints regarding Narayan Industries’ contract
              to provide autoclaves. First, a September 27, 2003, complaint alleged that
              Narayan had bribed ELMARC and OHSDP officials to pass its substandard
              equipment through inspection.320 Second, a January 27, 2004, complaint
              from Hospital Equipment Corporation alleged that Narayan and Variety
              Vayapar submitted forged performance certificates so that their autoclaves
              could pass inspection, and that ELMARC provided them with other bidders’
              prices and an opportunity to amend their already submitted bids.321 Third, an
              April 7, 2004, complaint from Indian Instruments alleged that Narayan paid
              a 20 percent bribe for an autoclave contract, provided forged performance
              certificates, failed to produce pressure test certificates, and used poor-quality
              steel in its autoclaves.322 These complaints’ allegations are consistent with the
              biomedical engineer’s observations that Narayan and Variety’s autoclaves
              suffered from dangerous manufacturing and design defects.

                            ■■    A September 20, 2004, complaint from Hintek International alleged that
                                  ELMARC was accepting fake performance and test reports.323 This is con-
                                  sistent with the DIR’s findings.

                            ■■    A November 18, 2004, complaint from Vinar Systems alleged, among
                                  other things, that ELMARC awarded Vishala Industries and Royal Safe
                                  Company furniture contracts in exchange for a bribe and that Vishala and
                                  Royal Safe’s bids lacked performance certificates.324

                            ■■    A November 27, 2004, complaint from Samar Steel Industries alleged that
                                  ELMARC’s Deputy General Manager of Procurement and OHSDP offi-
                                  cials accepted bribes from non-responsive bidders—including Vishala
                                  Industrial Craft—in exchange for accepting forged documentation and
                                  ensuring that substandard goods passed inspection.325

                           The DIR cannot conclude that these complaints’ allegations are accurate
                    because determining their legitimacy would require a full investigation into the
                    facts of each complaint. However, the complaints are consistent with the DIR’s own
                    findings regarding project procurement and implementation and thus serve as a
                    further indicator of fraud and corruption affecting the OHSDP.

                           2.	 ELMARC Added Accessories to Equipment Contracts, and Thus
                           Increased Their Value, After the Contracts Were Awarded

                           ELMARC’s OHSDP contract provided that, “[t]he requirement of consum-
                    ables, accessories and spares necessary … and the [sic] estimating the cost of the
                    consumables, accessories and spares will be made at the time of preparing the
                    specifications of the equipment.”326 Despite this provision, ELMARC approved the
                    addition of accessories to four Delta Medical Appliances contracts for the supply
                    of phototherapy units, emergency resuscitation kits, baby incubators, and radiant
                    baby warmers.327 These accessories increased Delta’s contract values by more than
                    INR 5 million (USD 111,000), and the DIR found no indication that any other firm
                    received a similar opportunity to add accessories to a contract. Further, the DIR’s

                    Delta was declared the contract winner but before Delta had signed the contract.

field visits suggested that Delta did not supply all the accessories that were added
to its contracts.

       Thus, ELMARC uniquely approved a significant increase to the value of four
Delta Medical contracts, appears to have received little compliant EIF items in
return, and did so in a manner that violated the provisions of its own consulting
contract. This could be the result of poor performance, but given the numerous
other indicators that ELMARC engaged in fraud and corruption, these unusual
contract value increases are another indicator of fraud.

       3.	 Other ELMARC Actions Suggested Participation in Procurement
       Fraud

       Two other incidents further suggest that ELMARC may have participated in pro-
curement fraud in conjunction with some of its suppliers. First, in February 2004
the West Bengal DOHFW sent ELMARC a letter warning the firm that Surgicoin’s
operation theater lights had “major defects,” including that its bulbs frequently
fused.328 ELMARC also was copied on a January 2004 complaint alleging that
Surgicoin was linked to Naresh Grover, an Indian businessman whom the Bank
had sanctioned in October 2003 for fraudulent practices.329 Despite these warnings,
on July 15, 2004, ELMARC awarded Surgicoin an INR 5.4 million (USD 120,000)
contract for operating theater lights. ELMARC therefore appears to have awarded
a contract to a firm that it knew would provide a poor-quality product.

       Second, in May 2005 the PMC tasked ELMARC with reviewing the provision,
installation, and use of equipment supplied under the OHSDP. The Bank’s Decem-
ber 2005 supervision mission Aide-Mémoire expressed “serious reservations”
about the report’s accuracy, and the Chief Medical Officers at DHH Nawarangpur
and DHH Koraput told the DIR that ELMARC’s review consisted only of an inven-
tory of the equipment stock at their hospitals.330 In addition, Dr. David Porter, who
participated in the review on behalf of the Bank, informed the DIR that during the
2006 Joint Equipment Survey, ELMARC engineers admitted to him that senior
ELMARC management had instructed them to falsify information in order to
provide a more positive view of the project’s progress.331

331	
    The Joint Equipment Survey focused on equipment provision and usage statistics and presumed that
ELMARC conducted proper equipment inspections and compliance certificate reviews. In contrast, the DIR in-
dependently examined a selection of equipment in great detail, including deconstructing items of equipment to
determine their compliance with project technical specifications. The DIR therefore identified some of the same
issues as the Joint Equipment Survey, but also noted many issues not identified by the survey.

                           The acceptance of substandard, dangerous, and non-functional equipment,
                    combined with false certifications, oversupply, frequent installation failures, and a
                    lack of responsiveness to multiple complaints suggest a collusive fraudulent scheme
                    between ELMARC and various suppliers. While some of the problems observed
                    might be the result of a lack of capacity, there are many indicators that ELMARC
                    was more concerned with preferential treatment of favored contractors than with
                    procuring high-quality equipment and ensuring its effective use.


                    Project Audit Reports
                    Under the OHSDP, when the Government of India received funds from the Bank,
                    it deposited them into a special account in the national treasury and then dis-
                    bursed some of its own funds to the Government of Orissa as a national budget
                    item for “additional central assistance, on standard terms and conditions.”332 The
                    DOHFW requested funds for the project as part of its annual budget and, upon the
                    budget’s approval, the Government of Orissa allocated a credit to a set of project
                    accounts in the state treasury—including a personal ledger account (PLA)—from
                    which the DOHFW could make project-related payments.333 When the project
                    actually expended funds, it submitted Statements of Expenditure to the Govern-
                    ment of India, which in turn withdrew Bank funds from its special account and
                    requested replenishment from the Bank. The DOHFW’s annual expenditures were
                    examined by the Orissa Accountant General which, pursuant to standard state
                    accounting practice, certified (to the extent possible) each year’s expenditures as
                    accurately reported and used for project purposes.334

                           The DIR’s review of the Auditor General’s audit reports identified a number
                    of project financial management and financial recordkeeping issues: (1) the proj-
                    ect’s audits did not provide a full and transparent accounting of project expen-
                    ditures; (2) the project’s budget allocations repeatedly greatly exceeded its actual
                    expenditures; (3) the project’s certified civil works spending is inconsistent with
                    the PMC’s reported civil works activity; and (4) project financial records suffered
                    from accounting inadequacies. These issues create risks of fraud and corruption.

A.	 State Auditing Techniques Did Not Provide a Timely,
    Transparent, and Complete Overview of Project
    Expenditures
       Pursuant to standard practice in Orissa, each year’s audit analyzed and certified
only funds allocated and spent in that year. Annual audits did not examine previ-
ous years’ unspent allocations or the project’s total account balances. As the audi-
tors themselves noted, the absence of such an overall financial picture facilitates
fraudulent transactions.335 The Bank attempted to remedy this lack of information
through supplemental audits of previously uncertified funds, but these also failed
to account for all project funds. For example, a 1999–2003 supplemental audit
reviewed INR 843.0 million (USD 18.7 million) in previously uncertified expen-
ditures but could certify only 42 percent of them; INR 492.5 million (USD 10.9
million) in expenditures remained uncertified.336

       Because of these methodological limits, to date the Bank has not obtained
information sufficient to determine whether the PMC used project funds solely
for their intended purposes. The Bank’s Financial Management unit has noted
an INR 1,233,900,000 (USD 30.84 million) gap between the project expenditures
reimbursed by the Bank and the amount of expenditures certified by the Auditor
General; much of this gap stems from the expenditure of PLA allocations that were
reported unspent during the year of their allocation and then never revisited in
subsequent audits.337 The Bank has requested a supplemental audit on these issues
and stated that it will seek a refund for any unaudited or uncertified reimburse-
ments.338 However, the insufficient transparency of project accounts creates a risk
of fraud and corruption, and this lack of transparency was accompanied by other
project financial management problems.

B.	 The Project’s Requested Budget Allocations Often Far
    Exceeded Its Actual Expenditures
       The Orissa Accountant General’s audit reports state that the PMC frequently
requested funding allocations far larger than the sums it actually expended. In
some years, the auditors reported that the PMC disbursed little or no money at all

                    on equipment and civil works. These discrepancies raise questions regarding the
                    PMC’s financial management practices.

                            ■■     Between 1999 and 2003, a supplemental audit certified expenditure of
                                   INR 830.0 million (USD 18.4 million) for civil works—80 percent of the
                                   PMC’s civil works PLA allocations—and INR 289.6 million (USD 6.4 mil-
                                   lion) for equipment, furniture, and medicine—62 percent of such alloca-
                                   tions.339 INR 360.4 million (USD 8 million) in PLA allocations were not
                                   spent.340

                            ■■     In its 2002–2003 project audit, the Accountant General certified only 42 per-
                                   cent of allocated project funds—INR 216.3 million (USD 4.8 million)—as
                                   expended, with INR 272.6 million (USD 6 million) reported unspent.341 In
                                   addition, the government certified only 40 percent of allocated civil works
                                   funds—INR 177.8 million (USD 3.9 million)—as spent, and EIF spending
                                   was not discussed in the audit.342

                            ■■     In its 2003–2004 project audit, the Accountant General certified only
                                   5 percent of allocated project funds—INR 35.3 million (USD 784,000)—as
                                   expended.343 None of the INR 497.7 million (USD 11 million) allocated for
                                   civil works was spent, and only 9 percent of allocated equipment funds—
                                   INR 10.5 million (USD 234,000)—was spent.344 Further, only INR 9,110
                                   (USD 200) was spent on equipment maintenance, which was 9 percent of
                                   the project’s INR 100,000 (USD 2,200) allocations for the work.345

               66 percent of its equipment funding allocation.347 INR  85.9 million
               (USD 1.9 million) in equipment allocations went unspent.348

       The Accountant General’s 2005–2006 project audit report revealed that the
project used some of its unspent allocations during its final year: the project spent
99 percent of its civil works allocation (INR 160,080,734 (USD 3.6 million)) and
343 percent of its medicine, equipment, and furniture allocation (INR 218,520,222
(USD 4.8 million)).349 However, the Auditor General stated that the PMC’s practice
of requesting and receiving far larger allocations than the project needed—and
then leaving unspent allocated credits in project accounts—is a violation of state
government policy but was done for years with “the concurrence of the Finance
Department of the State Government.”350

C.	 Certified Expenditures Do Not Correspond to Reported
    Civil Works Activity
       OHSDP contractors were paid in installments made upon either the submission
of certified monthly payment certificates or the achievement of certain construc-
tion and renovation benchmarks.351 Project expenditure on civil works should,
therefore, roughly follow project civil works progress. However, the OHSDP audit
reports’ expenditure statements are inconsistent with the project’s stated civil
works activity levels: spending was highest when little work was done and lowest
when work was most active.

       Between 1999 and 2003 the audit reports certified that the project expended
USD 18.4 million for civil works, but this time period was marked by substantial
project delays: only 16 sites were completed by the 2002 mid-term project review,
and only 63 were completed by the Bank’s May 2003 project supervision mission.352
Conversely, between May 2003 and July 2005, the PMC reported the completion
of 74 additional hospitals, but the Orissa Auditor General certified that the PMC
disbursed only USD 3.9 million for civil works between 2002 and 2003 and noth-

                    ing between 2003 and 2005.353 This pattern shifted in the project’s final year, dur-
                    ing which the PMC spent 99 percent of its civil works allocation (INR 160,080,734
                    (USD 3.6 million)).354 However, no audit reports detail any PMC spending of pre-
                    viously allocated but unspent funds, leaving previous discrepancies unresolved.
                    The disjunction between certified PMC expenditures and PMC activity reports
                    indicates either that the activity reports overstated actual project activity, or that
                    the audit reports’ expenditure statements failed to capture substantial amounts of
                    PMC spending, which creates a risk of inappropriate expenditures.

                    D.	 Audits Identified Additional Financial Record-Keeping
                        Issues
                           Over the course of the OHSDP, the government’s audits identified other finan-
                    cial record-keeping discrepancies that create a risk of fraud and corruption. These
                    included the following:

                            ■■     Between 1999 and 2003, the project did not maintain monthly or annual
                                   closing balances in its cash books, nor did it reconcile those books with
                                   treasury records.355 The government auditors stated that this situation was
                                   “fraught with risk of fraudulent withdrawals remaining undetected.”356

                            ■■     In 2003–2004, the auditors noted a continued lack of balances in project
                                   accounts and concluded that this had facilitated the diversion of unspent
                                   Bank funds: “Such a situation helped the Project Authorities for unau-
                                   thorized expenditure without sanction of the Government by diverting
                                   the unspent balances towards some other purposes, which is irregular.
                                   Moreover, such a situation is fraught with risk of fraudulent withdraw-
                                   als remaining undetected.”357 The project subsequently balanced its 2003–
                                   2004 records, but no documents indicate that this issue was addressed for
                                   years before 2003.358

                            ■■     In 2004–2005, the auditors noted an 8 percent discrepancy, totaling
                                   INR 38.5 million (USD 855,000), between the project’s allocation records
                                   and the Accountant General’s allocation records.359 This issue recurred in

              discrepancy between the two sets of records.360 This further suggests inad-
              equate record keeping.

E.	 The Bank Responded to Audit Report Issues
       Correspondence indicates that the Bank’s financial management unit was
diligent in following up on audit reports, requesting clarifications regarding the
issues noted by the auditors, requesting deductions of disallowed expenditures
from future project reimbursement claims, and pursuing the project’s overdue
supplemental audit reports.361 The Bank’s supervision missions also noted when
audit reports were overdue or identified financial management issues, and they
pursued audit report delivery, occasionally through the suspension of statement-
of-expenses-based disbursement.362

       Financial management staff informed the DIR that the Bank now requires
project auditors to account for project finances as a whole and has begun to impose
detailed auditing standards on project auditors through the use of standardized
terms of reference. These steps may help prevent inadequate record keeping in the
future.


Project Reports and Assessments
       In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Bank’s supervision of the OHSDP,
the DIR reviewed the Bank’s project supervision documents and compared their
statements with the DIR’s findings. The DIR found that although the Bank observed
many of the same fraud and corruption indicators as the DIR, its low-volume
procurement reviews and Borrower-reliant supervision methodology appear to
have caused it to make these observations at a time and in a manner that deterred
effective remedial action. Further, the Bank’s statistics-based project evaluations
appeared to obscure the implementation problems observed by the DIR.

                    A.	 Procurement Post-Reviews
                           According to the documents made available to the DIR, the Bank conducted
                    four procurement post-reviews of the OHSDP—three reviews during project
                    supervision missions in 2002 and 2004 and one 2006 post-review of a sample of
                    contracts awarded between April 2004 and March 2005.363 In total, these reviews
                    encompassed only 11 percent of the civil works, EIF items, and drugs and materi-
                    als contracts awarded under the OHSDP.364 The reviewed contracts included one
                    design and supervision consulting contract, seven hospital construction contracts,
                    and 46 contracts to supply EIF goods, including one generator.365

                           The post-reviews focused on documentary completeness and procedural com-
                    pliance with applicable Bank guidelines. Indicators of fraud and corruption were
                    observed only as a corollary to this task. The reviews also did not involve site visits
                    other than those performed during the Bank’s general supervision missions.366 In
                    total, the reviews identified only six indicators of fraud and corruption, and no
                    documents produced to the DIR suggest that these indicators were addressed fur-
                    ther. In contrast, the DIR observed multiple indicators of fraud and corruption at
                    every level of project procurement.

                           The 2002 mid-term review mission post-review analyzed three contracts and
                    “found the documentation satisfactory.”367 Similarly, the December 2004 mission
                    post-review examined 25 EIF and drugs contracts and found all but one to be
                    acceptable. The only problem noted was that on one drugs contract, no order was
                    placed because the government found no bidder qualified.368

                           The Bank’s two other post-reviews were more successful at identifying indi-
                    cators of fraud and corruption. In its May 2004 supervision mission review, the
                    Bank noted that “some deviations … in civil works contracts in respect of pre-
                    bid minutes, qualification of the bidder and the bank certificate towards liquidity
                    and assets requirements.”369 The DIR identified all these issues as indicators of bid

                         According the PMC contract records, the OHSDP awarded 502 contracts. The Bank’s various post-reviews
                    analyzed 54 of them. See Mid-Term Aide-Mémoire, p. 7 (post-review of two contracts); May 2004 Aide-Mémoire,

rigging. However, while the May 2004 Aide-Mémoire stated that the Bank would
pursue these issues in future correspondence, the DIR was not given and could not
otherwise locate any such correspondence.370

       Similarly, the Bank’s 2006 post-review noted delays in the procurement process
for four drug contracts and orders “mailed outside of [bid] validity” for 14 other
contracts.371 In one case, the review noted that there was a 44-day delay between
the closing of the bidding period and the Bid Evaluation Committee’s (BEC’s) bid
opening.372 The BEC then further delayed its evaluation of submitted bids until
three months and 14 days after bid closing.373 In the end, only 64 bids were received
out of the 98 bid documents sold, and 14 of these were declared non-responsive,
leaving only 50 bids to consider.374 The review also noted that two bidders in this
tender quoted identical prices.375

       All these observations are indicators of bid rigging and/or collusion. But the
DIR obtained no documents suggesting that the Bank took action to further exam-
ine and address these issues. Further, all these problems were identified in drug
contracts procured by local government. The 2006 post-review did not identify
any problems in the civil works and EIF procurements that it reviewed.376 Accord-
ingly, the 2006 review recommended giving ELMARC responsibility for the drug
contract procurements conducted by the local government.377 In contrast, the DIR
found strong indicators that ELMARC engaged in fraudulent schemes with its
suppliers that resulted in the supply of technically non-compliant and occasion-
ally hazardous medical equipment.

B.	 Project Supervision
       As detailed in this chapter’s introduction, the Bank’s project design documents
did not consider fraud and corruption as a risk to the project’s success. The Bank’s
supervision activities eventually observed and documented some of the civil works
and EIF implementation issues identified by the DIR, but these observations began
in December 2004, when the Bank’s supervision mission noted that some hospitals
lacked electricity, running water, and might not be completed by project closure.378

                    Indeed, the project supervision documents indicate that the Bank began to com-
                    prehend the full extent of these problems only in mid-2005, when the Bank’s archi-
                    tect, Rakesh Sahni, and biomedical engineer, Dr. David Porter, reported the results
                    of their multi-hospital field visits.379 By this time the project had been extended
                    twice and would close in less than a year, providing little time to remedy noted
                    implementation deficiencies.

                           The late discovery of significant implementation quality issues suggests a weak-
                    ness in the project’s supervision structure. Yet in November 2001, the Bank’s Qual-
                    ity Assurance Group (QAG) reviewed the OHSDP and graded the project’s super-
                    vision design highly satisfactory.380 This positive evaluation of an apparently flawed
                    process and the Bank’s delay in conducting detailed field studies appear related to
                    the Bank’s overall approach to project supervision.

                           The OHSDP PAD, PIP, Project Agreement, and Credit Agreement detailed
                    many supervision activities to be conducted by the Borrower but provided no
                    details at all about how the Bank would supervise the highly decentralized project
                    activities. This is consistent with the Bank’s policy of delegating detailed project
                    monitoring and evaluation to the Borrower as a capacity-building opportunity.381

                           Under the Bank’s operational directives and operational policies, the Borrow-
                    er’s project management team bears the responsibility of: (1) continually assess-
                    ing project implementation against agreed-upon schedules; and (2) evaluating the
                    project’s performance, efficacy, and impact against stated objectives during and
                    after project implementation.382 The Bank, in turn, attempts to identify and miti-
                    gate risks in its project designs and then supervises the Borrower’s activities to
                    ensure that the project is implemented effectively.383 The Bank’s procedures state
                    that supervision involves regularly monitoring the project against PAD and PIP
                    targets, objectives, and indicators; monitoring and recommending improvements
                    to procurement and funds disbursement; reviewing Borrower audit and progress
                    reports; evaluating compliance with loan covenants; and assessing risks to the proj-
                    ect’s successful implementation, operation, and sustainability.384 The Bank’s super-
                    vision guidelines further emphasize that project supervision should be continuous
                    and responsive to changing project needs and operating environments.385

        However, the Bank’s supervision remains reliant, at least in part, on the Bor-
rower. For example, while the Bank’s supervision guidelines emphasize that
“[g]ood supervision reports are critical for the Bank[,]” for capacity-building and
cost-savings reasons the guidelines recommend that the Bank’s reporting require-
ments “should be integrated with the Borrower’s own monitoring and evaluation
systems, as far as possible[,]” including through collaboration with local agencies
and other stakeholders.386

        Given its limited mandate of identifying indicators of fraud and corruption, the
DIR cannot opine on the overall merits of the Bank’s supervision model. However,
the DIR found that: (1) the OHSDP exhibited widespread indicators of fraud and
bid rigging; (2) the PMC either did not know about these problems or chose not to
report them to the Bank; and (3) as a result, the Bank identified the problems only
at the project’s very end because it did not conduct earlier verifications of reported
project outputs. These findings indicate a serious weakness in the Bank’s current
supervision methodology, and the DIR’s review of the PIPs and PADs available for
successor Indian state health projects indicate that this methodology has not been
revised as a result of the Bank’s OHSDP experiences.387

C.	 Project Evaluation in the ICR
        The Bank’s ICR rated the OHSDP’s project outcome as moderately satisfacto-
ry.    388
             This evaluation was based largely on statistical indicators—such as health and
health-care usage statistics, budget allocations, passage of new policies, and hospi-
tal staffing rates—that sought to measure the project’s development impact.389 The
March 2006 supervision mission Aide-Mémoire stated that the project’s rating did
consider implementation issues as cutting against the positive statistical indicators
and prompting a less-than-perfect project outcome rating.390 But the ICR’s assess-
ment of civil works and EIF implementation was based on information provided
by the PMC that is inconsistent with the DIR’s site visit observations.391

    The DIR reviewed the Karnataka Health Systems and Reform Program PAD and PIP; the Maharashtra
Health Systems Development Project PAD and PIP; the Rajasthan Health Systems Development Project Agree-
ment and Project Proposal; the Tamil Urdu Health Systems Project draft PAD; the Uttar Pradesh Health Systems
Development Project PAD; the Uttar Pradesh Health Systems Development Project II (Uttar Pradesh and Ut-
taranchal) draft PAD; and the West Bengal Health Sector Development Project PAD.

       The ICR’s project rating thus reduced the weight given to civil works and EIF
implementation in two ways: it relied more heavily on health statistics–based indi-
cators, and it based its implementation assessments on apparently incorrect data.
To its credit, in its March 2006 Aide-Mémoire the Region acknowledged that proj-
ect implementation should have been given more weight as an indicator of project
success: “Assessing the project as a whole, the indicators agreed to at project start
had not envisaged the complex nature of each component and the need to directly
measure actual operationalization of upgraded health facilities, which is critical
in enhancing achievement of the project development objectives.”392 Nevertheless,
the Bank’s moderately satisfactory project rating stands in stark contrast to the
problem-laden hospitals and non-compliant or dangerous equipment observed by
the DIR.
