N0420-IN), and the Gujarat\n            Emergency Earthquake Reconstruction Project (Cr. 36370-IN)\n            The report proposes reallocating SDR 65.35 million\n            (approximately US$ 96 million equivalent) of credit proceeds\n            to support urgent financing needs for a polio eradication\n            program in India. Two of these projects (Orissa Health\n            Systems Development and Women and Child Development) are\n            financed through Interim Trust Funds (ITF). Approval is\n            being sought for these two projects through the\n            International Development Association since ITF credits have\n            become part of IDA'S general resources, and IDA may act\n            for itself with regard to such resources rather than as\n            administrator for ITF. The proposed restructuring will\n            assist the Government of India in eradicating poliomyelitis\n            from the country--this will contribute to global polio\n            eradication, and supplement the ongoing Immunization\n            Strengthening Project (Cr. 33400-IN) and the Supplemental\n            Credit to this project (Cr. 33401-IN) by financing\n            additional polio eradication activities required on an\n            emergency basis by the Government of India. In all five\n            projects, the proposed restructuring would neither\n            compromise the original objectives nor affect their overall\n            economic viability."}, "docdt": "2004-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
