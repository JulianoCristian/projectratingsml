Some lessons\n            learned included: in social sector projects consisting of\n            expanding services and improving quality, intellectual\n            resources and administrative efforts need to be balanced, so\n            that no only physical expansion targets are met, but\n            substantive work is devoted to institutional building. In\n            order to improve the quality of primary education in rural\n            and poor communities in Mexico it would be cost-effective to\n            focus attention on development of appropriate methodologies\n            and teacher training for multigrade situations since they\n            make up 60 percent of all schools in the country and a much\n            higher proportion in the areas covered by this project.\n            Delays experienced during the initial stages of the project\n            in procurement may be attributed to the use of rigid,\n            centralized procedures and lack of training and the high\n            turnover of the staff responsible for these tasks; this\n            demonstrated the need for training the relevant staff before\n            project initiation and for a proper transition when staff\n            changes occur. The project also demonstrated the\n            effectiveness of decentralizing procurement to regional and\n            state levels, and the need to review and simplify, as much\n            as possible, the steps required to complete a bidding\n            process, as well as to select and contract technical\n            assistance with funds from an international loan; this issue\n            should be revisited in the context of new projects."}, "docdt": "1998-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
