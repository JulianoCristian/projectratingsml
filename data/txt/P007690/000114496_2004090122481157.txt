Dear Sirs: 
We refer to the Loan Agreement between International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) and Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (the Borrower), and the Guarantee 
Agreement between United Mexican States (the Guarantor) and the Bank, both dated October 14, 
1991, as amended.  We are pleased to inform you of our agreement to amend the Loan and 
Guarantee Agreements, as follows:
I.
Amendments to the Loan Agreement

Section 1.02 (s) of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:
"(s)
"SEE" means a Project State’s Education Secretariat (Secretaría Estatal de 
Educación
) or equivalent;"
2.
In Section 1.02, new subparagraphs "y" and "z" are added to read as follows:
"(y)
"SOPE" means a Project State’s Public Works Secretariat (Secretaría de 
Obras Públicas del Estado
) or equivalent; and
"(z)
"School Council" means a Social Participation School Council (Consejo 
Page  2
Escolar de Participación Social
), established under the Guarantor’s 1993 General Education Law 
(Ley General de Educación
,
published in the Guarantor's Diario Oficial de la Federación
(Official 
Gazette) on July 13, 1993).".
II.
Amendments to the Guarantee Agreement
1.
Section 2.01 is amended by inserting the words ", or cause the Project to be carried 
out," immediately after the words "shall carry out the Project".
2.
Section 3.07 (a) and (c) are amended to read in their entirety, respectively, as follows:
"Section 3.07 (a) The Guarantor shall cause:  (i) CAPFCE to carry out all civil works 
financed with proceeds of the Loan, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section; (ii) new 
facilities to be constructed under Part C.3 of the Project, and to the extent feasible, facilities 
rehabilitated under Part C.1 of the Project to follow prototype designs satisfactory to the Bank; 
and (iii) no furniture and equipment to be procured under the Project unless contained in 
prototype furniture and equipment lists, satisfactory to the Bank, prepared for each type of 
facility by SEP."
"(c) Without limitation upon the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of this Section, 
the Guarantor shall cause:  (A) the Project States, in a manner and pursuant to terms and 
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, through their municipalities and under technical supervision 
by CAPFCE, the relevant SOPE or the relevant SEE, to carry out all works under Part C of the 
Project that do not involve procurement under international or national competitive bidding and 
that are estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent per contract or per bid package; such 
municipalities may (subject to said technical supervision) in turn cause School Councils to carry 
out such works (when such works do not consist of maintenance under Part C.4 of the Project) 
and must cause School Councils to carry out such works (when such works do consist of 
maintenance under Part C.4 of the Project); and (B) Part C.4 of the Project to be carried out in 
accordance with preventive maintenance plans and procedures, satisfactory to the Bank, adopted 
by each of the SEEs.".
3.
A new Section 3.21 is added to read as follows in its entirety:  "Throughout the 
course of Project implementation, the Guarantor shall maintain, in a manner satisfactory to the 
Bank, an annually adjustable data base of regionalized reference prices to serve as a reference for 
Project procurement costing in those cases where direct contracting is allowed for works.".
4.
Section 4.01 (a) is amended to read as follows in its entirety:  "The Guarantor shall 
maintain, or cause to be maintained, records and separate accounts adequate to reflect, in 
accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and expenditures in connection with 
the execution of the Project.".
5.
The Schedule is amended by adding a new paragraph 4 to Section I, Part C, to read as 
follows in its entirety:
Page  3
"(a) Works under Part C of the Project, estimated to cost less than the equivalent of 
$50,000 per contract or per bid package,  up to an aggregate amount equivalent to $15,000,000, 
may also be procured under contracts awarded after direct negotiations with contractors, in 
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.  Such procedures shall, inter
alia
,
require 
that contract prices be consistent with the regionalized reference prices determined by the 
Guarantor pursuant to Section 3.21 of this Agreement.  If such contractors are School Councils, 
the Bank shall not finance the labor costs of the works undertaken by such contractors.".
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating all three 
of the originals of this letter in the spaces provided below, and returning one to us.  This 
amendment shall enter into effect on the date of receipt by the Bank of one original of this letter 
signed by you. 
Sincerely yours,
