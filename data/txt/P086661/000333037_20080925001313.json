Bangladesh is well endowed\n            with groundwater resources. More than 90 percent of the\n            rural population has access to water supply mainly through\n            tapping these groundwater resources. Fifty percent of the\n            urban population has access to piped water. However, since\n            the early 1990's, many of the aquifers were found to be\n            contaminated with arsenic at levels not just above the World\n            Health Organization guideline level of 10 ppb but above\n            Bangladesh's national standard of 50 ppb as well.\n            Building on a previous project aimed at addressing the\n            arsenic contamination issue (Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation\n            Water Supply Project), the Bangladesh Water Supply Program\n            Project (BWSPP) was designed to shift rural households from\n            arsenic contaminated tube wells towards safe water sources\n            while simultaneously improving on the quality of service\n            provision through small scale piped water schemes in rural\n            villages. It was intended to improve service delivery,\n            strengthen ownership by end users, introduce cost recovery,\n            and ensure the financial viability of the water supply\n            schemes. The BWSPP endeavored to pilot institutional reforms\n            to ensure the sustainability of continued safe water supply.\n            The project restructuring will focus on the following\n            principles: (a) maintaining the overall project objective\n            towards supporting the increase of access to safe water; (b)\n            incorporating the reallocation and revisions occasioned by\n            the Bank response to the 2007 floods and cyclone; (c)\n            narrowing down the range of project activities by focusing\n            on a manageable range of innovative/pilot measures and\n            completing a reasonable target of schemes to achieve an\n            outcome consistent with the pilot nature of many project\n            activities; and (d) carrying out activities that have\n            already commenced up to the demonstration of actual increase\n            of safe water provision."}, "docdt": "2008-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
