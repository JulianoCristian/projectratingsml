    The Project Development Objectives of the original project were to:
The development objective o f the project is to contribute to Bangladesh's efforts to achieve the
MillenniumDevelopment Goals inwater supply and sanitationby 2015. Specifically, the project will
pilot innovative measures to scale up the provision o f safe water supply free from arsenic andpathogens
inruralareas and small towns.

    The revised Project Development Objectives would be to:
The development objective o fthe project is to contribute to Bangladesh's efforts to achieve the
MillenniumDevelopment Goals inwater supply and sanitationby2015. Specifically, the project will (i)
deliver increased access to the water and sanitation services in selected rural villages and small towns,
focusing on areas affectedby the 2007 floods and cyclones, and (ii)   pilot some innovative service
provisionmeasures, includingprivate sector participation inrural schemes.

A.      BackgroundandReasonsfor Restructuring

 1.     Bangladesh i s well endowed with groundwater resources. More than 90% of the rural
population has access to water supply mainly through tapping these groundwater resources. Fifty
percent o f the urban population has access to pipedwater. However, since the early 1990's, many
o f the aquifers were found to be contaminated with arsenic at levels not just above the World
Health Organization guideline level o f 10 ppb but above Bangladesh's national standard o f 50
ppb as well. Estimates suggest that between 30 and 50 millionpeople inBangladeshare exposed
to arsenic intheir drinkingwater. Further, water-related diseases continue to threaten infant and
child health outcomes. It was in this context that the World Bank approved a US$ 40 million
IDA Grant for the Bangladesh Water Supply Program Proiect (BWSPP) on June 17, 2004.
BWSPP was declared effective on February 25, 2005.                 The project would complete
implementation inOctober 2009 and close on April 30,2010.

2.      Building on a previous project aimed at addressing the arsenic contamination issue
(Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project), the BWSPP was designed to shift rural
households from arsenic contaminated tube wells towards safe water sources while
simultaneously improving on the quality o f service provision through small scale piped water
schemes in rural villages. It was intended to improve service delivery, strengthen ownership by
end users, introduce cost recovery and ensure the financial viability o f the water supply schemes.
The objective was to meet the Millennium Development Goals in water supply through
innovative partnerships with the private sector. The BWSPP endeavored to pilot institutional
reforms to ensure the sustainability o f continued safe water supply.

3.      Project performance i s poor more than three and a half years after Board approval. IDA
rated both progress towards achieving Development Objective (DO) and Implementation
Performance (IP) as unsatisfactory given the delayed start-up o f BWSPP, very slow
implementation and poor disbursement. Only 12.8% o f the IDA Grant had been disbursed as o f
June 25, 2008 raising significant doubt as to whether the project could be completed within the
remaining 22 months o f the project life. There was a clear-cut needto restructure the project.

4.      Several factors impeded smooth implementation. The project design was very ambitious
-withmultiplecomponents entailingcomplexinstitutionalandfinancialinnovationswhichwere
untestedinBangladesh. Notwithstandingthe pilot nature o f many proposedactivities, the project
envisaged large numberso f infrastructure schemes to be delivered as its target. The complex and
ambitious design i s compounded by weak implementation capacity and the lack o f experience in
implementing the institutional and financial innovation proposed. In addition, project design
envisaged a very heavy implementation task - the seven components translated to a procurement
plan with more than 170 activities. Some o f these activities are themselves further made up o f
multiple contracts (e.g., rural piped schemes under Component 1targeted 300 discrete contracts
each with multiple procurement stages).

B.      CountryContext

5.      Since the start o f the project the institutional framework for the water supply sector
remained unchanged in the rural villages and pourashavas. This institutional framework remains
unaffected by the state o f emergency declared in January 2007 and the current Caretaker
Government administration inBangladesh.




                                                 1

6.       Two natural disasters occurred in 2007 which necessitated emergency response of
assistance from development partners.           Two waves o f floods in July/August and in
September/October directly affected over 13 million people in 46 districts, caused over 1,000
deaths, affected over 2 million acres o f agricultural land, and damaged infrastructure, social and
educational facilities and private assets, including housing, crops, livestock and fisheries. The
floods were subsequently follows by cyclone "SIDR' which hit Bangladesh in November 2007
leading to further destruction. Cyclone "SIDR' affected about 9 million people in 30 districts,
and caused over 3,300 deaths.

C.       Project Performance to Date

7.       The Project Management Unit (PMU) has been unable to implement the original project
design at a reasonable pace. At project Mid-Tern Review (November 2007) it was assessed that
except for one component, all the targets and scopes o f activities in the other key components
originally envisaged for the project would be not be achievedby a substantial margin:


    (1)      Component I (Rural Piped Water Supply).            O f the envisaged targets o f 300
             completed village schemes, none had been completed and construction works were
             only in progress in seven schemes.        Component implementation was adversely
             affected by the required long chain o f selection of private operators, scheme design
             and approval processes and the new / untested contracting and financing
             mechanisms.
    (ii) Component 2 (Pourashavas Water Supply Schemes). Only the TA consultancy
             designed to assist with the implementation o f this component was underway. Design
             for the creation o f municipal water companies, rehabilitation works and the retention
             o f private operators for the targeted five pourashavas had not been completed or
             started. The problemwas compoundedby contractual problems and the deterioration
             o f relationship between the P M U and the TA consultancy.
    (iii) Component3(Non-pipedRuralWaterSupply). Thiscomponentappearedtooffera
             reasonable chance o f achieving its original targets although risks remain given that
             the actual activities on the grounds werejust about to commence.

8.       The implementation of other components was patchy. In the case of one component
envisaged to help create a Credit Market and Risk Management Mechanism to support private
participation inthe ruralpipedwater schemes, this has not materialized at all.

D.       Proposed Changes

9.      Following the 2007 floods, the Government o f Bangladesh (GOB) requested emergency
IDA assistance to help with post-disaster reconstruction. IDA respondedinpart with a US$ 122
million Flood Restoration and Recovery Assistance Program (FRRAP) to support rehabilitation
efforts. IDA restructured its Bangladesh portfolio to reallocate resources within projects and
transfer funds between projects to finance the emergency program. The IDA Board approved on
January 10, 2008 the Flood Restoration and Recovery Assistance Program (FRRAP), which
amongst others, cancelled $25 million equivalent from BWSPP to be transferred to other projects
and utilized for flood related assistance. The IDA Board also approved that the BWSPP was to
be restructured, includingreallocating within the project a hrther US$5 million equivalent o f the
remaining project funds towards the restoration o f water and sanitation infrastructure in flood
affected areas. The FRRAP legal agreements (including the cancellation o f US$25 million from
BWSPP) were signed on February 7,2008.




                                                  2

 10.     Following cyclone "SIDR',       GOB further requested that some funds from BWSPP be
reallocated within the project and utilized to construct about 5,000 water sources in cyclone
affected areas as part o f the relief andrehabilitation effort.

 11.     Inlightofthe performance to date ofthe project, itwas evident that the project couldnot
be implemented and funds disbursed within a reasonable timeframe. The transfer of funds to
assist in the 2007 floods and cyclone "SIDR, was therefore justified and appropriate. With the
cancellations and reallocation under FRRAP and the reallocation o f further resources to respond
to cyclone SIDR already agreed, the Bank and the GOB have revised the project plans and
activities under BWSPP. This Project Paper outlines the scope and strategy o f the revised
BWSPP.

12.      The project restructuring will focus on the following principles:

             Maintainingthe overall project objective towards supporting the increase o f access to
             safe water;
             Incorporating the reallocation and revisions occasioned by the Bank response to the
             2007 Floods and Cyclone;
             Narrowing down the range o f project activities by focusing on a manageable range of
             innovative / pilot measures and completing a reasonable target o f schemes to achieve
             an outcome consistent with the pilot nature of many project activities;
             Carrying out activities that have already commenced up to the demonstration o f
             actual increase o f safe water provision; and
             Simplifying project implementation arrangements (including implementation and
             contracting procedures and terms, disbursement conditionalities, and financing
             percentages).

13.      Project Development Objective (PDO). The main PDO to contribute to Bangladesh's
efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in water supply and sanitation by 2015
remains relevant and would be retained. However, some modes for increasing access to safe
water and sanitation and the target coverage will be revised. The project will seek to deliver
increased access to the water and sanitation services in selected rural villages and small towns,
focusing on areas affected by the 2007 floods and cyclones. The project will continue to pilot
some innovative service provision measures, including private sector participation in rural
schemes. However, the proposed reforms inthe urban sector and the creation o f a credit market
have proven too difficult to implement within the envisaged time-line and will be dropped. The
project indicators have been reduced and the results framework revised to align with the down-
sized scope. Paragraph # 44 o f this document outlines the revised results indicators in more
detail.

14.      Project Scope. The restructured BWSPP will only include activities envisaged under the
Bank response to the 2007 Floods and Cyclone and retain other ongoing activities already started
or assessed likely to be completed within the remaining project time-line. The current and
anticipated implementation performance o f each component was factored-in in identifying such
activities. The innovations proposed were reduced and project targets revised. The operational
procedures were simplifiedto better meet the project objective.

15.      ImplementationArrangements. The Department o f Public Health Engineering (DPHE), a
unitunder the Ministry of LocalGovernment, Rural Development and Cooperatives, implements
the project. The P M U located within the DPHE i s tasked with the day-to-day project operations.
The implementation arrangements would continue largely unchanged inthe restructured project.



                                                    3

The P M U would continue to partner with private `sponsor organizations' and non-government
`support organizations' in the rural piped and rural non-piped water schemes respectively.
However, the planned Pourashava Water Supply Entity (PWSE) would not be established in the
identifiedurban areas. The design, construction and management o f urban water services would
no longer be outsourced to private operators under the revised project scope. Civil works in the
urban areas would now be handledby the DPHE. Plans to develop a local credit market for rural
pipedwater supplywith its associated facilities would also bejettisoned.

Component 1:RuralPipedWater Supply

16.       This component is intendedto ensure the sustainable supply of safe water in select rural
villages with more than 900 households. It would do so by outsourcing the design, construction
and management of pipedwater supply systems to private sponsors. The private sponsors would
meet a portion o f the capital costs. It would charge users and levy connection fees, The private
sponsors would operate the system for a maximum o f 18 years under a Service Agreement with
the Water User Association to be established and the relevant Local Authority. This could be
extended subject to future mutual agreement.

17.       The overall design o f activities proposedunder the component remains unchanged for the
most part.      However, the number o f schemes targeted was reduced from 300 to 21. The
institutional, financing and operational innovations proposed would be piloted in those 21
schemes that stand a better chance of implementation success either due to early start-up under a
previous IDA operation - the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP)
or near-complete procurement action. Under the revised scope, the target beneficiary households
with access to safe drinkingwater arereducedfrom about 100,000 to about 25,000.

18.       Private sponsors had difficulty under the original project design to meet the required50%
o f the capital investment(including community contribution). The establishment o f a local credit
market under the BWSPP was intended to provide such funds to private sponsors. The local
credit market never took off due to delays in obtaining Central Bank approval and i s unlikely to
benefit the Private Sponsors at this late hour in the project time-line. The restructured BWSPP
has therefore reduced the mandatory contribution o f private sponsors from 50% to 30% o f total
capital investment (including community contribution).

19.       The IDA allocation for this component has been reduced from US$23.1 million to
US$4.7 million'. The revised cost takes into account the 70% capital outlay from the project.
The Sponsor Grant Agreements and Guidelines are being revised to (i) a 70% capital permit
contribution per scheme, (ii)      increase the maximum IDA Grant investment / contribution limit
from Tk5,000 to Tk12,OOO per household, and (iii)        simplifyand clarify the payment schedules.

Component 2: UrbanWater Supply Schemes

20.       This component was initially conceptualized to provide safe water in 3 to 5 mid-sized
urban areas known as pourashavas in Bangladesh.               The GOB was to establish ring-fenced
Pourashavas Water Supply Entities (PWSEs)s to own the assets o f the municipal water supply
system. It was to outsource the design, construction and management of the pipedwater supply
systemto private operators (POs). PSWEs were to enter into a formal contract with the PO for a
10 year period.
'Note   that although the target number of schemes now equal less than 10%the original, the costs have
not.. . beenreduced by a similar percentage - the actual scheme proposals received from communities and
Sponsors have mostly beenmuch larger than average schemes sizes envisaged during project preparation.


                                                     4

21.     The original design was ambitious and challenging. The time requiredto (i) on board
                                                                                      get
the technical assistance consultancy to help roll-out the proposed reforms, (ii)     build political
consensus in each identified pourashava, (iii)   establish the PWSEs, (iv) select and mobilize the
POs, and (v) have the PO design, build and manage the infrastructure was significantly
underestimated.     The creation of the PWSEs in fact required revisions to existing local
government legislation. It was not possible to complete the envisaged activities in the targeted
municipalities within the remaining timeframe.

22.     The establishment o f PWSEs, retention o f private operators and investment inmajor civil
works would not be undertaken. Immediate priority works in the five selected pourashavas and
 19 other flood-affected pourashavas would be undertaken instead. Service provision operations
inthe pourashavaswouldbering-fencedas perthe original design. Water departments withinthe
pourashavas would be made accountable for the operation o f the water supply system. They
would keep separate financial accounts which would be subject to annual audits. The PMU
would revise the scope and current status o f the technical assistance accordingly. The urban
sanitation pre-feasibility study would be dropped.

23.     The IDA allocation for this component has been reduced from US$14.8 million to
US$4.3 million. The revised allocation was based on a cost o f the immediate priority works, the
provisioning for the ongoing technical assistance consultancy and small works at Chapai
Nawabganj.

Component 3: RuralNon-pipedWater Supply

24.     This component is intended to provide safe water through partnership with non-
Government Support Organizations (SO) in peripheral rural areas with less than 400 households
where piped water supply i s not viable. The SOs would help set-up Ward Arsenic Mitigation
Water User Groups (WAMWUGs) in such villages and help develop ward-level community
action plans to mitigate the risk o f arsenic. The WAMWUGs inturn would contract out the civil
works. Much o f the proposed civil works would entail the construction o f deep hand tube wells
where each community would contribute 10% o f investment costs. Operations and maintenance
would be the responsibility o f the WAMWUGs.

25.     This component was assessedlikely to achieve its original target o f 200 villages giventhe
simplicity o f design, the tested success in the earlier IDA-financed BAMWSP and the near-
complete procurement. The initially estimated cost for SO consultancies and associated civil
works was much lower than projected. A modest increase inthe original component costs would
be adequate to fund the original component scope as well as an additional effort to construct
5,000 water sources inthe cyclone SIDR affected areas.

26.     This component has been accordingly revised to include (i) original project scope
                                                                       the
costing US$2.0 million, and (ii)  the cyclone response to construct another 5,000 water points at
the cost o f US$3.61 million. The funds allocated for the rural non-piped water component has
been increased from US$4.4 millionto US$5.61 million. 70,000 households would benefit from
improved water supply under this component. One point source would supply arsenic fiee water
for 10households.

27.     The implementation arrangements would remain unchanged for the original 2,000 water
points serving 200 villages. The P M U would however revise the current payment schedule for
the SOs inline with the delivery o f actual water points. The DPHE would procure the works for



                                                  5

the cyclone SIDR related activities through the Open Tender Method. The BWSPP would
provide resources to finance 100% o f the cyclone SIDRrelatedworks.

Component4: CapacityBuilding,RegulationsandTraining

28.      The capacitybuildingandtraining activities under the BWSPPhave been cut back in-line
withthe restructuring of the ruralpiped, urbanpipedandruralnon-piped components.

29.      The technical assistance to develop the regulatory framework and benchmarking systems
for the proposed private operators has not been started and has been cancelled. Activities to
support the Regulatory Framework for Groundwater Management i s not a core outcome o f the
project and no further activities are foreseen under BWSPP. The GOB i s pursuingother sources
o f funding for this activity. The technical assistance for water quality monitoring, groundwater
mapping and the development o f a water safety plan would continue. The quality testing o f all
wells drilled under BAMWSP and BWSPP would be completed and fed into a water quality
database. The ongoing riverbank infiltration test pilot activities would likewise be completed and
the existingdata from BWSPP test drills entered into a DPHE deep aquifer data base. A technical
assistance contract would help the P M U implement a water safety plan in the schemes
constructedunder the BWSPP. The total cost for this component under the restructuredproject i s
reduced from $3.2 millionto $1.36 million.

Component 5: Development of Local CreditMarket and RiskManagement Mechanismfor
RuralPipedWater Supply.

30.      This facility would not be available in time or relevant in light o f the restructured and
down-sized rural pipedwater component. Ithas therefore been canceled.

Component6: MonitoringandEvaluation.

31.      This component has been retained but with a significantly reduced scope. The revised
results monitoring framework would rely on data extracted from the proposals and progress
reports o f private sponsors and technical assistance consultancies as the primary source. Other
surveys carried out as per the original project design would, where relevant, provide secondary
data. The allocation for M&Ehas been reduced from $1.4 millionto $0.5 million.

Component7: ProjectManagement.

32.      The component to support the P M U has been reduced from $3.3 million to $2.19 million
inlinewiththe overalldownsizing ofthe BWSPP.

33,     Financial Management.         The project Financial Management arrangements remain
unchanged.

34.     Disbursement. There will be no changes in the disbursement arrangements. However,
the financing percentages for some categories / sub-categories will be revised or clarified i.e., (i)
sub-projects under the Component 1 (Rural Piped Water Supply) will be financed up to 70% of
the total sub-project cost [the Sponsor Grant Agreements will needto clearly distinguishbetween
the total sub-project cost and the total to be financed by IDA], and (ii) works to construct the
                                                                         the
5,000 water sources in the cyclone SIDR affected areas will be financed 100% by IDA. In
addition, various disbursement conditions which were found to impede the implementation
progress will beremoved:



                                                   6

    (i)       Component 1. The current condition prohibiting disbursement to the Special
              Account unless the schemes under Component 1 have been made in accordance to
              the Operations Manual i s impractical and of limited utility. Grants are made in
              accordance to Sponsor's Grant Agreements which in themselves confirm the
              adherence to required guidelines. This disbursement condition i s removed; and

    (ii)      Component 2. The current condition where payments cannot be made unless the
              selected pourashavas has established their PWSEs with separate financial accounts
              and entered into a management contract with a private operator for a periodo f no less
              than 10 years i s no longer relevant under the restructured component and i s removed.

35.      Audit. The P M U has submitted the project audit report for financial year 2007. Prior to
receipt o f the final report, there was a detail discussion on the draft audit report in an exit
(discussion) meeting arranged by the Foreign-Aided Project Audit Directorate (FAPAD). The
exit meeting was attended by the auditor, the auditee and a representative from the Bank. The
auditor expressed an unqualified opinion considering that the financial statements give a true and
fair view in accordance with the identified financial reporting framework. Bank review o f the
audit report found that the overall Financial Management system o f the project i s satisfactory but
recommended that more attention i s requiredto do the inventory o f asset timely and properly and
that contract administration needs to be improved and expedited.

36.     Procurement. Project procurement arrangements and thresholds remain unchanged. The
PMUhas prepared a revised list of procurement packages in line with the revised project scope
(as part o f the revision of the Development Project Proforma, DPP).

37.      Closing Date. The closing date o f the project remains unchanged i.e., April 30, 2010.
An extension ofthe project i s not proposedand the scope o f the BWSPP was revisedbasedon the
remaining timeframe. IDA would closely monitor project implementation progress. Should
implementation improve and significant outcomes achieved, IDA may consider the scaling-up o f
successful activities if funds are available. A decision to extend the project in such a scenario
would be made 12 months prior to the current project closing date.

38.     Project Costs and Financing Plan. The IDA original project cost o f SDR27.6 million
(US$40 million equivalent) for the BWSPP has been reduced by SDR15.8 million (US$25
million equivalent) as part o f the Flood Restoration and Recovery Assistance Program (FRRAP).
The remaining SDRll.8 million translates to about US$18.67 million equivalent. The revised
allocations by component (inUS$) and by categories (inSDR) are summarized inthe Attachment
1to this paper.

E.      Analysis

39.     Technical. The proposed changes to the project are not expected to have material impact
on the technical design and technologies used for the provision o f water supply inthe villages or
pourashavas. The original project design did not restrict the range o f technologies to be utilized
allowing for the choices to be made through the feasibility studies for each scheme and
encouraging a demand driven philosophy. This principle remains unchanged. For rural piped
water supply schemes, the target number o f villages together with some financing and
implementation mechanisms were revised but there are no changes to the scheme designs. For
the pourashavas water supply, while major changes were made to the operational arrangements of
the schemes, the priority investment inthe selected pourashavas will be focused on the repair and



                                                   7

rehabilitation o f existing water supply inthe pourashavas. For the non-piped rural water supply
 schemes, no changes are proposed to the original scope and instead the number o f point water
 sources to be constructedi s to be increased to cover several upazillas affectedby cyclone SIDR.

40.      Economic. The demand-based nature o f the project made it difficult to predict or
 quantify the full range o f economic benefits from the three major components o f the project. The
results o f the original project economic assessment rest on several assumed parameters and
benefits. Benefits from the rural piped water supply schemes and the pourashavas water supply
 schemes were estimated by valuing the incremental and non-incremental volume o f water
 supplied as well as estimating the health and institutional benefits attributable to the project
during its expected lifetime. Benefits from the non-piped rural water supply component were
estimated by valuing the potential time savings and health benefits attributable to the project
component. Given that the main restructuring involves a reduction in scheme numbers or sizes
with commensurate reduction in project costs with no change in technology, and that no actual
schemes have yet been built to give some actual data o f benefits and other parameters, the
initially estimated base ERR o f 20%, 16% and 20% for Components 1, 2 and 3 respectively
remains the best estimate. The new works under Component 2 related to the 19 flood-affected
pourashavas, and the additional activities under Component 3 related to the cyclone "SIDR'
related works are emergency activities meant to replace damaged existing facilities rather than
provide incrementalbenefits.

41.      Social. The proposed changes to the project are not expected to require a revision to the
social assessment conducted during the preparation o f the project. The rural piped water supply
schemes are expected to benefit about 25,000 households (instead o f about 100,000) due to
reduced number of schemes to be undertaken.               However, the pourashavas water supply
component has been expended from 5 pourashavas to 24, albeit the amount o f target investments
in each has been significantly reduced.         The non-piped water supply component i s being
expanded and i s now expected to benefit about 70,000 households (instead o f 20,000) through the
construction o f about 7,000 safe water sources. The Social Framework in the Guidelines for
Sponsors which were developed duringproject preparation to ensure the (i)           targeting o f benefits
to vulnerable groups, (ii)  inclusion, participation and voice o f stakeholders - especially o f women
and vulnerable groups, (iii)   transparent mechanisms for functional, financial and administrative
autonomy o f local communities, (iv) appropriate linkages with local government, (v) criteria for
demand driven initiative and cost sharing, (vi) accountability and transparency in transactions,
(vii) technical, institutional and financial sustainability, (viii) technical, financial and institutional
support to the communities and local government to build their capacity, and (ix) participatory
monitoring o f processes and outcomes, remain valid and enshrined in the Sponsors Guidelines
and Sponsors' Grant Agreements.

F.       EnvironmentCategory

42.      The restructured project would remain a Category B project. Given the small scale of
project interventions, no large-scale, significant and/or irreversible environmental impacts are
anticipated. The potential environment impacts primarily relate to water source quality protection,
ensuring adequate drainage and avoiding local construction-related impacts. The Environment
Assessment would continue to guide the management and mitigation o f environment issues when
identified. The Environment Management Framework prepared prior to project appraisal would
be retained to address the issues during selection, design, implementation and operation o f the
sub-projects. Regular supervision and environment audits would identify residual issues and
recommend contingency mitigationmeasures wherever required.

G.      Exceptionsto Bank Policy

43.     The proposed restructured project conforms to all existing IDA policies. No exceptions
are required for approval.

H.      Expected Outcomes

44.     As mentioned, the PDO would remain unchanged. However, the outcome indicators for
the PDO and results indicators for each retained component have been revised to reflect the
project restructuring.
