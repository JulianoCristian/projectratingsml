                         The Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project (BWSPP) has targeted to ensure access to safe and Arsenic free water to at least 1.25 million people in villages and small towns
                         including the cyclone affected areas through various innovative schemes. The project successfully piloted community managed Arsenic mitigation programs in 3 of the Arsenic

                         Upazilas. BWSSP introduced an innovative public-private partnership approach for rural piped water schemes. 21 village piped water schemes have been targeted and piloted which
                         would benefit approximately 0.106 million people in these selected villages. 12 schemes are fully operational while the rest 9 schemes will be complete by December 2010. About
                         30,343 people are now having access to safe water from the 12 Rural Piped Water Supply schemes. The project is also providing safe water supply to 0.17 million people living in 24
                         municipalities through rehabilitation and expansion of water supply systems. Additionally, the project is also facilitating to set up safe water sources in different parts of the country
                         particularly focusing on cyclone SIDR and AILA affected districts. A total of 0.7 million people are having access to safe water sources in these areas which has been made possible
                         through installation of 9659 water point sources against a total target of 9966 water points.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It is critical that the supervision of works by the project implementing entity is maintained carefully so as to enable the contractors and private sponsors to complete their sub-projects
                         according to the schedule and before project closing on December 31, 2010. Nevertheless, the focus will be on completing the ongoing works contracts in a stable manner and as per
                         the agreed schedule. It is important to focus on project evaluation so that the lessons and experiences from the current project can be analyzed and incorporated into any future
                         project. It is therefore critical for the project implementing entity to prepare its final evaluation of project implementation. Towards successful preparation of the follow-on project, it is
                         essential that the project preparation team remains functional following the closure of the current project and up to the approval of the proposed follow-on scaled up project.
