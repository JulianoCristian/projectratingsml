2015. Specifically, the project will pilot\n            innovative measures to scale up the provision of safe water\n            supply free from arsenic and pathogens in rural areas and\n            small towns. There are 7 project components. Component 1\n            promotes private-sector participation for rural piped water\n            supply. Component 2 promotes private-sector participation in\n            water supply in municipalities (pourashavas). Component 3\n            implements arsenic mitigation measures in small\n            arsenic-affected villages. Component 4 supports development\n            of adequate regulations, monitoring, capacity building, and\n            training. Component 5 supports the development of a local\n            credit market and risk mitigation mechanisms for village\n            piped water supply. Component 6 implements a monitoring and\n            evaluation system for the project. Component 7 funds project management."}, "docdt": "2004-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
