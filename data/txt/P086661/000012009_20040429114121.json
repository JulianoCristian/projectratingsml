Program\n            Projects is a pilot initiative, whose overall focus is based\n            on three guiding principles that will 1) assist the\n            Government in moving forward towards achieving the\n            Millennium Development Goals for water supply and sanitation\n            by 2015; 2) scale up measures to provide arsenic free, and\n            bacteriological safe water in rural areas, and small towns;\n            and, 3) support the decentralization process initiated by\n            the Government as part of the water sector reform process.\n            This environmental assessment (EA) provides an insight into\n            the  challenges in  dealing with water quality problems, and\n            those related to management of surface and ground water. The\n            EA outlines several types of risks: capacity building risks\n            of different institutions likely to be involved in the\n            project, enforcement and contractual risks for private\n            sector participation, tariff rationalization risks, policy\n            reform risks, environmental risks and risk of coordination\n            among the different stakeholders for a better operational\n            strategy. It suggests  mitigation strategies, and a\n            monitoring plan as follows. The monitoring plan includes an\n            environmental checklist for both rural and urban areas that\n            can be used as a tool to assess the status of adverse\n            impacts during project implementation. Adverse environmental\n            impacts include shallow and deep aquifers, treated dug/ring\n            wells, piped water supply schemes from treated surface water\n            sources, rainwater harvesting, pond-sand filter, arsenic\n            removal units attached to the contaminated tubewells, and\n            domestic filter at the household level. Other possible\n            impacts on natural habitat, and other pollution include\n            traffic congestion, noise pollution and drainage problems.\n            The environmental management strategy gives special emphasis\n            on arsenic contamination: its health implications, arsenic\n            removal technologies, water quality surveillance, and\n            arsenic sludge disposal options, and, further indicates the\n            relevant environmental legislations that can be used during\n            implementation. It also provides a rapid environmental\n            assessment checklist that can be used for both rural and\n            urban water supply projects."}, "docdt": "2004-03-01T15:45:00Z"}
