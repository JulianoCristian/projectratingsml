Some lessons learned included: both the\n            rural piped water and the pourashava components experienced\n            problems because certain pre-requisites were not in place.\n            In the case of the rural piped schemes, the BWSPP component\n            for a credit facility really should have been in place\n            before the private sponsors began construction. As this was\n            not the case, the component had trouble attracting and\n            retaining private sponsors because they could not obtain\n            loans for financing and capital investment. The pourashava\n            component, as originally designed, required changes in\n            legislation and buy-in from the municipalities before the\n            private operators could effectively begin to work. Better\n            sequencing of various activities could have avoided at least\n            some of the implementation problems. The procurement burden,\n            especially of innovative projects using local private\n            operators for water supplies, needs to be well-evaluated\n            during project preparation. Attempting to introduce a\n            private operator approach in both rural piped and pourashava\n            schemes was extremely demanding. The non-piped water\n            component was successfully implemented, despite the many\n            problems faced by BWSPP, in part because the approach had\n            been developed and tested in the course of Bangladesh\n            Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP)."}, "docdt": "2011-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
