The objectives of OILPP were to: (a)\n            reduce the decline in oil and gas production in the Assam\n            area; (b) minimize the flaring of gas not consumed by\n            installing facilities or gas compression and re-injection\n            into the field;( c) evaluate discoveries in OIL's\n            newly-licensed areas of Arunachal Pradesh and Rajasthan,\n            especially structures that were deep and geologically\n            complex; and (d) improve the technical ability of OIL in\n            various aspects of reserve evaluation and field development.\n            These objectives were a reasonable response to maximizing\n            oil and gas recovery. Bank\u2019s performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower\u2019s performance was good. The key lessons learned\n            from the project were: (i) OIL learned that it can increase\n            production more effectively by concentrating on the core\n            business of producing oil and gas rather than merely\n            fulfilling planned targets for field operations, such as the\n            number of wells drilled; (ii) OIL does not have sufficient\n            expertise that can improve the quality of work significantly\n            and enhance cost effectiveness; and (iii) OIL found that the\n            project's use of three-dimensional seismic surveys had\n            considerable advantage over the two-dimensional technology\n            the company had been using."}, "docdt": "1995-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
