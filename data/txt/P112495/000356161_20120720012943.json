and First and Second Restoring Equitable Growth and\n            Employment Programmatic Development Policy Loan Project for\n            Turkey were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: the flexibility of the Policy\n            Loan (PL) series was very important in order to adapt to\n            both external and internal political economy factors. The\n            authorities value greatly the analytical work and technical\n            assistance which includes a mix of local knowledge and\n            international experience from the Bank. The benefits of\n            supporting reforms on an opportunistic basis, without\n            parallel technical assistance or analytical work are not\n            clear. In such cases, monitoring and evaluation arrangements\n            appear to be somewhat weak. A more focused PL series may\n            improve monitoring and evaluation and enable communication\n            among different stakeholders. Going forward, treasury might\n            be able to do more to use its convening power and the policy\n            content of future Development Policy Loans (DPLs) to\n            strengthen inter-ministerial coordination, bring together\n            participating line agencies and promote peer learning or\n            cross-fertilization on reform implementation experiences."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
