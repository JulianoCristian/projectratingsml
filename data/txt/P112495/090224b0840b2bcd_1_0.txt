    Strengthening Turkey’s public sector administration and regulatory
    environment


Overview
Supported by three in a proposed series of four IBRD development policy loans (DPL) and
technical advice in 2006-11, Turkey reached almost universal health insurance coverage (from
86 percent), broadened the reach of pre-school, increased vocational training dramatically
(from 30,000 beneficiaries in 2008 to more than 200,000 by 2010), and improved its Open
Budget Index from 41 to 57 percent, as well as successfully navigated the global crisis in 2008-
09.


Challenge                                              MULTIMEDIA
From 2002-06, Turkey had introduced wide-
ranging financial, economic, and public sector
reforms to recover from its 2001 banking crisis.
By 2006, several years of sustained growth had
improved public finances (public debt fell from 78
percent to 48 percent of GDP over 2002-06) and
social indicators (poverty fell from 27 percent to
17 percent over 2003-07). But sustained
progress was threatened by ballooning health
and social security costs, implementation
challenges to public financial management
reforms, an investment climate clouded by
outmoded codes and regulations, and persistent
unemployment and a skills shortage in the labor market.
Added to these challenges was the sharp deterioration in the

Approach
In 2006, the Bank responded through two loan series, one

      Social security reform and universal health insurance:     Bank in Turkey
      a universal health insurance system was established
                                                                 Turkey - World Bank Partnership
      in 2006 and a comprehensive social security reform
      enacted in 2008. The Bank assisted with detailed
      actuarial simulations and trained Turkish counterparts
      to update these models. Health insurance coverage
      increased from 86 percent to 97 percent, while the combined deficit of the two systems,
      which peaked at 4.2 percent of GDP in 2009 due to the crisis, was held in check and
      declined thereafter (to about 3.9 percent in 2010).

      Investment in skills: vocational training was ramped up (from 30,000 beneficiaries in
      2008 to more than 200,000 in 2010) and a monitoring and evaluation system was
      instituted, with Bank technical assistance; the Government formally targeted universal
      pre-school education and in the 32 provinces targeted by the first phase of the program,
      enrollment of 5-year olds in kindergarten increased from 71 percent in 2008/09 to 92
      percent in 2010/11.

      Government efficiency: a series of laws overhauled public financial management and
      control, external audit, and state aid, while systemic operational reforms introduced
      modern management methods, such as performance budgeting, on which the Bank
      organized a series of symposia and provided more detailed technical inputs. Turkey’s
      Open Budget Index, a measure of budget transparency produced by the Open Budget
      Initiative, improved from 41 percent in 2006 to 57 percent by 2010.

      An improved climate for private sector-led job creation: the Bank and the Government
      held detailed consultations on the impact of the 2008-09 global crisis; financial and
      employment measures successfully protected employment (unemployment fell back to
      pre-crisis levels of around 10 percent by 2011); in 2011 the enactment of a new
      Commercial Code and a new Code of Obligations modernized the regulatory
      environment.



Bank Contribution
IBRD has so far provided US$2.2 billion in the first three operations of the series (PPDPL 1
and 2, and REGE-DPL). Individual loan amounts were EUR 403 million (PPDPL, 2006), EUR
255.4 million (PPDPL 2, 2008), and EUR 931 million (REGE-DPL, 2010). A fourth operation is
proposed for 2011.

Partners
While IBRD is the sole financer under the REGE-DPL series, several partnerships have
contributed to the knowledge base on which the operations are constructed. The Bank
collaborated with UNICEF and TEPAV (a Turkish think tank) to field surveys measuring the
impact of the 2008-09 global crises at the household level. Technical support to Turkey’s public
administration reforms has been financed by an Institutional Development Fund grant and a
Governance Partnership Fund grant (financed by the UK, the Netherlands, and Norway). Bank
staff also consults regularly with counterparts in the European Commission and the IMF on the
relevant policy areas.

Toward the Future
The REGE-DPL series is expected to close in 2011. World Bank support to continued public
sector and regulatory reforms in pursuit of equitable growth and employment will be framed by
discussions of the new World Bank-Turkey Country Partnership Strategy for 2012-15.

Beneficiaries
Policy measures to mitigate the global financial crisis helped Turkey’s most vulnerable groups
at risk of poverty: informal workers, children, and young workers. Economic analysis for the
operation suggested that, in the absence of policy changes, the global crisis could have
increased the poverty rate by about 5 percentage points. Universal health insurance system –
one of the public administration reform areas supported by the project – expanded health
insurance coverage to 97 percent of the population.
Tuğba Bozkurt, 47, has been earning her living as a cleaning lady for the past 25 years.
Suffering from chronic asthma and short-breath, she frequently goes to hospital and admits that
she never received good quality healthcare service ever since she started working – until this
year. “I used to take a couple of days off from work when I had to go to the hospital in the past
as I had to go into line and wait literally for hours to receive health services from doctors. Now
it only takes me one hour maximum, to get the services and prescription from my doctor.”
