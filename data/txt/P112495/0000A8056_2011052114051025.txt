                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The program supported by the REGE-DPL focuses on the transition from managing the impact of the global crisis to fiscal adjustment and shared growth and
                         aims to contribute to the following main objectives: (1) economic management; (2) public financial management;(3) affordable universal healthcare and
                         improved educational access; (4) employment; (5) improved investment climate; (6) increased financial intermediation, especially to SMEs. The proposed
                         program supports all three pillars of the Country Partnership Strategy, which are (i) improved competitiveness and employment, (ii) equitable human and social
                         development, and (iii) efficient provision of high-quality public services.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?
