Objectives
The objectives are to: (i) improve Lesotho's economy by converting
water to export income, and (ii) pursue the least cost option to meet
the growing water demands in the Witwatersrand area in South Africa. The
project is the second construction phase for the water transfer
component of the overall LHWP. It would enable water transfers of 11
cubic meters per second (cms/sec) in addition to the 18 cms/sec provided
for under Phase 1A. If implemented, all phases of LHWP would transfer
70 cms/sec.
Description
Total cost for Construction Phase IB is estimated at US$1.1
billion, including physical and price contingencies, and includes (i) a
dam at Mohale and (ii) a tunnel to transfer the stored water from Mohale
to Katse. The cost estimate also includes environmental protection
measures, resettlement, technical assistance for LHDA and construction
supervision.
Financing
The financial strategy for the project has not yet been
determined. The strategy used during Phase 1A was based on
international contractors providing their own financing from export
credit agencies and commercial banks outside the Maloti/Rand monetary
area with the balance being provided from the RSA capital markets. This
strategy may be replicated for Phase 1B. The Bank's financing would be
directed to those components where it would have the greatest impact
and, in observing the Bank's traditional role as lender of last resort,
would probably include environmental and resettlement measures,



technical assistance to LHDA, and detailed design and construction
supervision.
Implementation
The project would be implemented by the Lesotho Highlands
Development Authority (LHDA) which was established in 1986 after the
signing of the Treaty.
Environmental Impact
The resettlement/compensation impact is estimated as follows
(equivalent figures for Phase 1A provided in parenthesis): resettled
households 84 (73), hectares of arable land inundated 1,023 (685),
persons affected by loss of arable land 4,957 (6,929), hectares of
grazing land inundated 1,491 (3,188). The estimates would be assessed
during the environmental assessment to be carried out during
preparation. It is envisaged that a three-pronged environmental action
program would be developed in
line with best-practices employed in Bank/IDA funded large-dam projects.
This program is likely to include (i) protection of flora, fauna and
places of historical interest, (ii) compensation for affected
households, and (iii) rural development programs to further support the
income generating ability of affected groups.
The project will generate substantial public revenues envisaged
to be spent on poverty-alleviating programs through productive and
employment creating investments.    For Lesotho, the revenues for all
project phases would correspond to 5t of GDP, or M 167 million on
average p.a. in constant 1990 prices, between 1995 and 2044. If the
LHWP does not continue to future phases after phase 1B, the benefits for
Lesotho would be reduced to either (i) M 123 million p.a. on average if
RSA cancels future phases, or (ii) to M 91 million p.a. if cancellation
is caused by
any other reason. The benefits would accrue to Lesotho at no financial
risk as RSA would ultimately pay all project costs. Approximately 4,000
jobs would be directly created during peak construction. For RSA, the
LHWP is the least cost solution to
secure the water supply for the Witwatersrand area. Alternative water
schemes are at least twice as costly to construct and operate.
Preliminary calculations comparing the cost of resources to be used with
RSA water consumers' assessed willingness to pay for the water result in
a 16 W economic rate of return for both Phase 1B only and for all
phases.
