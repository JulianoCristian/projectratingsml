The lessons\n            learned include: 1) The project demonstrates that the Bank\n            can play a unique role and add significant value even when\n            it finances only a small portion of project costs. 2) The\n            project illustrates two factors that require careful\n            consideration when designing and implementing transnational\n            projects. First, there must be clear and equitable sharing\n            of costs and benefits, and second, there needs to be a\n            separation of governance and oversight functions from\n            implementation. 3) The project underscores the risks\n            associated with establishing a new agency for implementing a\n            particular project, especially a high-profile operation such\n            as this. 4) The project illustrates the benefits that can be\n            derived from appropriate expert input into implementation.\n            Both the engineering and the environmental Panel of Experts\n            provided valuable recommendations that impacted on the\n            design of these components and resulted in significant\n            savings. 5) Problems experienced in implementing the\n            project's environmental and social program point\n            towards the importance of advance planning, including the\n            preparation of sound Environmental Impact Assessments and of\n            Environmental Action Plans prior to project start-up, to\n            ensure that these components get off to a timely and\n            effective start."}, "docdt": "1999-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
