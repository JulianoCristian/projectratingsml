It is\n            one of the world's poorest countries, with a population\n            of about 2.1 million. The economy is substantially dependent\n            on South Africa as a source of income, employment and\n            foreign exchange. Most of Lesotho's land area is\n            mountainous and ill-suited for agriculture, but there is an\n            abundance of water. In the early 1980s, less than 6 percent\n            of its water was consumed domestically, with the remainder\n            running through South Africa to the sea. South Africa, on\n            the other hand, was chronically short of bulk water -\n            particularly in the country's industrial heartland of\n            Gauteng, some 400 km north of Lesotho. The Treaty committed\n            the two countries to implement phases 1A and 1B of the\n            Lesotho's Highlands Water Project (LHWP), transferring\n            water in the amount of 18 m/sec and 12 m/sec, respectively,\n            and left the subsequent phases open for further\n            negotiations. Phases IA and IB have made use of the\n            comparative advantages of Lesotho and South Africa to the\n            mutual benefit of both countries - with Gauteng receiving\n            much needed water, and Lesotho receiving revenues from water\n            export and hydropower. Future phases of the LHDP envisioning\n            additional water transfers to South Africa may be delayed. A\n            main reason is that South Africa in the mid-1990s, with\n            World Bank help, started to focus less on engineering\n            solutions to supply water to meet growing needs and more on\n            measures for managing water demand. In the longer-term, the\n            LHWP may still continue to be a key underpinning for\n            Gauteng's and Lesotho's future development."}, "docdt": "2008-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
