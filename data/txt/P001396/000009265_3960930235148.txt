LEISOT O SIGMAND WATER PROJECT (PHASE lA)
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower and
Seneficiary.            Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA)
Guarantors              Government of Lesotho
Aounts                  US$110 mllion
Terms$                  18 years maturity, including 6 years of grace
Guarantee Bees          101 mark-up on prevailing IBRD interest rate.
Protect Oblectives:     The main objective is to put in place the physical and
managerlal capacity for Lesotho to transform its only
natural resource of abundance -water - into export
revenues through its delivery to the Republic of South
Africa  (RSA).   A  second objective  is to produce
hydropower to reduce Lesotho's dependence on imported
energy.
Protect Descriptions    The project is the Phase Uk of a 30-year scheme to
export water from Lesotho to the industrial heartland of
ISA.  It Includes the following facilities to permit
water transfers of up to 18 m3lsec and install 72 MW
capacity of hydropowers Mi) a 182 meter-high concrete
arch dam at Katese (ii) 48 kms of tunnels to transfer
the stored water from Rtase to 'Muela; (iii) a 72 KW
hydro power plant (with 120 km of transmission lines to
Maseru) and a 55-meter high concrete gravity arch dam at
'Muela; (iv) a 16-km delivery tunnel from 'Nuela to the
crossover point into RSA; and (v) 200 km. of access
roads, Including two bridges and other infrastructure
facilities. The project also includes environmental
protection measurest compensation and resettlement.
construction supervision, technical assistance to LtDA
and to the Government of Lesotho (GOL) delegation to the
Joint Permanent Technical Commission (JPTC), road
maintenance, lmproved border crossing facilities and
studies to prepare the next phase (Phase 1B) of the
scheme. An important element of the project is the
creation of a development fund for channelling project
revenues (royalties and other project-related payments)
to development-oriented programs. These revenues would
be managed separately by the Government but in
coordination with the GOL central budget, and would be
subject to annual auditing by independent auditors.

Project Cost and
Pinancin                Project   costs.   including   physical   and   price
contingencies and Interest during conaLruction, are
estimated at US$2.4 billion. All costs related to the
water transfer component and its related costs in other
components (environment, supervision, etc.) are the
responsibility of the RSA through its comitment under
the Lesotho Highlands Vater Project Treaty of October
1986 to service the debt for the fliancing raised for
the construction of this part of the project. Financing
for the hydropower component is expected to be met from
grant and concessional funds. Excluding the proposed
IBRD finnclng, about US$0.51 billion of the financing
for the water transfer component has been secured from
European export credit agencies and comuercial banks;
the balance of the f4nancing, with the exception of
US$0.S8 billion from the RSA export credit agency, will
com from the RSA capital markets. The proposed IBID
loan would fincee those elements of the water transfer
component located in Lesotho that relate to detailed
design and construction supervision, and technical
assistance to LEDA In the fields of engineering,
environment, finance, administration and training. To
assure repayment of all offshore borrowings for the
water transfer component, a debt servicing trust
arrangement is being established un4er United Kingdom
(UK) laws through which all offt.hore repayments
guaranteed by the RSA will pass, to be shared pari-passu
with all lenders, Including IBRD.
Riskos                  There are five main risks that have been identified.
Measures to mfinimze these risks are summarized below.
Financial Riskss The risk of RSA defaulting on debt
service payments is being minimLsed, in the first
instance, by the RSA government, under the treaty of
1986, being obliged to repay any project loans to LUDA
irrespective of project performance, and, in the second
instance, with the Bank joining other international
lenders in sharing any short-falls in debt service pari-
passu, Implying that RSA, In case of default, vould be
in default to all lenders. A separate guarantee to
IBRD, In addition to the trust arrangement, will be
provided by the ¢OL for the IBRD loan. Repayment to
IBID by Lesotho under the guarantee agreement, in case
of default by RSA under the trust, will be for the sole
benefit of IBRD.  The risk of project delays due to
shortage of financing has been minimized by signing the
key civil works contracts and securing adequate funding
for these before presenting the project to the Board.
LEDA has the responsibility for providing funds to mest
cost overr-us, and RSA has committed itself to assist
LHDA in its efforts to raise additional finance if



- (iii) -
needed.
Technical Risks. The risk of construction delays aud
cost ovorruns resulting from technical complications has
been minimised by ensuring that detailed designs and
major contracts for the water transfer component bave
been awarded before the project is presented to the
Board.
Political Risks, IBID lnvolvemnt in the project would
imply some political risks, vis-a-vis RSA, which are
more difficult to assess. The project is of strategic
Importance to RSA, and project lending could therefore
be perceived as being in RSA's interest. The political
risk is judged to be acceptable in view of (i) the
unprecedented benefits that would accrue to Lesotho and
(11) the ongoing dialogue in the RSA between the
Government and BSA' 8 political majority alming at
equitable representation In the political process.
Leaders of RSA's political majority have been kept
inforeed throughout the preparation and appraisal of the
project.
Administrative Riskss Construction of the project is
scheduled to be completed in five years. The timetable
for issuing tender documEnts, evaluation of offers, and
award of contracts has been essentially adhered to.
Experience   with   the   implementation   of   large
infrastructure contracts indicate that the proposed
project may take longer to complete than programmed. To
ensure that umnecessary delays do not take place in the
future, adequate staffing sad technical assistance have
been provided.
Etvironmental Risks.   The environmental risks are
acceptable given the physical location of the dams and
the reservoirs in deep canyons with minimal vegetation
and wildlife.  Because of the altitude, the risk of
introducing water-borne disease is minimal. Expected
temperatures will make it very unlikely that problems
with water weeds would occur or that the water quality
In   the   reservoir   will   deteriorate   through
eutrophication.   Sedimentation of the reservoir is
unlikely to become a problem, but will be monitored.
Special conservation measures will preserve rare species
of alpine flora, avi and fauna. Appropriate measures
will protect a site of historic and cultural
significance in the vicinity of the project area. An
environmental act0qn plan reviewed by an international
panel of experts is included in the project.

- (iv) -
project preparation and Implementation by the two
governments concerned and by the international flinncial
community. Continued bank involvement is therefore
essential to ensure the necessary cooperation between
GOL, RSA and the offshore financiers to enable Lesotho
to take advantage of this unique opportunity to
transform water into export revenue. Project revenues
for Lesotho for all project phases of the water transfer
component would correspond to an average of 52 p.a. of
GDP between 1990 and 2044. No other project has been
Identified that would have anywhere near as large a
beneficial  fimact on Lesotho.   Additional benefits
include employment opportunities both directly and
indirectly through local Industry servicing the project,
and are estimated at between 7,000-10,000 jobs during
the peak censtruction period. Construction of housing
and roads, mainly in remote parts of Lesotho, vould open
up rural areas by providing infrastructure, thereby
promoting agriculture, fisheries and possibly tourism.
The LHWP is the least cost solution to secure the water
supply for the major industrial area of the RSA.
Alternative water schemes are at least twice as costly
to construct and operate and would be located completely
in the RSA, thus with no benefit to Lesotho.
Implementation of the Phase IA hydropower component
vwuld provide Lesotho with about 702 of its electricity
needs for 15-20 years on completion in 1996.   The
economic cross-over rate of return for this project
component is estimated at 6? using the bulk electricity
tariff from the RSA as the alternativ source.
Comparing costs both in Lesotho and the RSA with
incremental future water tariff revenues in RSA results
in a 162 econtiUc rate of return for the water transfer
component. The combined rate of return for the project
is estimated at 152.

LESOTHO HIGHLANDS WATER PROJECT (PHASE IA)
I. ]NATIONAL CONTEXT OF WATER EXPORTS AND ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION
A.    Introduction
1.01        Lesotho is a small kingdom entirely surrounded by the Republic
of South Africa (RSA).   Most of Its 30,350 sq kms of land area is
mountainous and ill-suited for agriculture. The economy is characterised
first, by substantial dependence on the RSA economy as a source of Income.
employment and foreign exchange, and second, by a poor supply of readily
exploitable natural resources.
1.02        Per capita income is about US$440 (1988), of which close to
half is derived from remittances from some 150,000 Basotho migrant workers
primarily working in the coal and gold mines in the RSA. As a source of
foreign currency, the remittances and revenues from Lesotho's membership
in the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) finance Lesotho's tradition-
ally large trade deficits. Remittances amounted to US$328 million in 19J8
while exports remained insignificant at US$96 million.M Imports, at
US$552 million, were almost six times greater than exports and larger than
cDP which was US$416 million. Most trade -- 95 of imports and 85S of
exports -- is with RSA, and nearly all coumercial fuel and capital goods
are Imported.
1.03        The continuation of Basotho employment in RSA as a major
source of incame is uncertain since the future mechanLsation of the RSA
mines could limit the employment opportunities for migrant labor and
higher wages are attracting segments of the RSA population so far not
attracted to jobs in the mines. Basotho employment in RSA is, therefore,
expected to remain constant at best, Implying that almost half of
Leootho's GNP and its most significant source of formal employment and
foreign currency earnings would not grow in real terms in the foreseeable
future.
1.04        Lessening employment opportunities In RSA's mining sector
would contribute to the increasing unemployment problem in Lesotho. In
1986, Lesotho's labor force was estimated at 672,000, out of a total
population of 1.6 million. Of the labor force, 13? had found emloyment
In the local formal sector and 22? In RSA. Given a population increase of
2.7? p.a. (1987), the net annual addition to the labor force was about
20,000 In 1990 and will reach 25,000 by 2000.  Creation of productive
local employment and provision of appropriate training are among the most
pressing policy goals Cor the future.
1.05        The economy is constrained by, first, internal structural
weaknesses such as a land tenure system that discriminates against the
optlmum use of the limited agriculturally productive land, and the lack of
1i    This lncludes both goods and non-factor services. Exports of
goods were limited to US$64 million.



comprehensive economic planning.  Second, Lesotho is endowed with few
natural resources other than its people and an abundance of upstream
water.  Eighty-seven percent (87Z) of the land area is inhospitable for
arable agriculture. Raw materials for the manufacturing sector have to be
Imported, and skilled manpower is hard to find.
1.06        Lesotho's close economic links with RSA have led to the
evolution of institutional links as manifested in Lesotho's membership in
the SACU and the Comon Monetary Area (CNA). Under SACU, import tariffs
are uniform for all member states (Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia
and RSA), centrally collected and later distributed to the members based
on an agreed formula. Under the CMA, the Loti, the local currency, is
pegged at par to the South African Rand.
1.07        While Lesotho generally has benefitted from membership In both
the SACU and the CMA, as it has provided fiscal stability and discipline,
it has also limited the scope for independent macroeconomic policies.
Given free movement of both capital and goods between Lesotho and ISA,
there is no room for independent monetary policies in Lesotho. Domestic
prices and interest rates must closely follow those in RSA and the
inflation rate is the same as in RSA. New issues of Loti must be fully
backed through government deposits of Rand or any other convertible
foreign currency. Although protection of infant industries is allowed
under SACU, protective trade policies cannot generally be used to promote
domestic production or to raise public revenues.
1.08        Even the use of fiscal policy tools is limlted, as SACU
revenues, representing half of Lesotho's budget receipts, are not directly
controlled by the government, but distributed from a central SACU-revenue
fund, and received with a two-year lag. Demands for budgetary resources
has increased due to (a) substantial infrastructure investments;
(b) externally-funded social sector projects Implemented in the past and
now becoming operational; and (c) growing unemployment exerting pressure
an the government to recruit staff in excess of its requirements. Given
its openness, budgetary expansion would likely worsen the economy's
Internal and external imbalances.   Thus, government influence on the
growth of the economy is restricted to the composition of its expenditure
and investment programs and, in the longer run, to the ability to create
incentives to promote growth via private sector responses.
S.    The Prolect and the Economy
1.09        The  prospects  for  Lesotho's  economic  development  have
significantly improved due to the Nighlands Water Treaty between Lesotho
and RSA which was signed In 1986.  This treaty provides a basis for
Lesotho to exploit its only major natural resource--water--for exports to
RSA's industrial hub in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV)
area, some 400 km north of Lesotho.   Studies have demonstrated the
feasibility of building over a period of 30 years a series of dams, pump
stations, conveyance tunnels and ancillary works to store some of the flow
of the Senqu River and its tributaries originating in Lesotho and redirect
it northward to the P1W area in RSA. The treaty arrangements, under which
RSA will ultimately meet all costs for the water transfer, provide an



- 3 -
unprecedented opportunity for Lesotho to embark on an ora of export-led
growth.
1.10        The water exports and the associated construction activitiss
will have a far-reaching impact on Lesotho's economy, and have been
compared to Lesotho finding oil. Moreover, as all costs related to the
water transfer would ultimately be paid by the RSA, Lesotho would collect
all associated benefits without being exposed to financial risk.
1.11        Most significantly, water exports will convert a renewable
resource, for which there is no comparable use, into an export commodity
that will earn income for economic and social development, and reduce
Lesotho's dependence on external resources. The size of project-related
revenues correspond to, on average, SS of GDP, 252 of exports and 142 of
public revenues every year between 1990 and 2045.  Obviously no other
single project has been defined that would have the same sustained and
beneficial impact on the economy. Revenues would initially come from
project induced imports in the fonm of SACU-payments. From 1996 onwards,
revenues would mainly accrue in the form of royalty payment- for the
exported water.
1.12        Expenditures for the first phase of LMiP amount to several
times Lesotho's GDP. In the short term, these expenditures will affect
the economy through the classical multiplier effect on production, income
and investment. LHWP construction in the form of advanced Infrastructure
has boosted related sectors of the Lesotho economy since 1989.  It is
estimated that some 7-10,000 jobs will be created during peak construction
periods (of which 6,000 would be In direct construction and the rest in
associated activities).  The job creation and the associated training
opportunities will have long term effects In strengthening local capacity,
particularly in the construction industry.
1.13        Project related infrastructure in the form of access roads,
power lines and housing will also contribute to the development of the
economy, and open up remote areas of Lesotho.
1.14        The GOL is fully aware of the risks associated with the sudden
financial windfall and the related increase in demand. The openness of
the Lesotho economy and shortfalls in budgetary management could lead to
a situation where a large share of the LiWP revenues would leak out in tho
form of imports without any long-term development effect on Lesotho. As
part of the adjustment process. GOL is strengthening the financial
discipline of the public sector, and significant progress has been made.
However, GOL has decided to create a Development Fund for the management
of LHWP revenue to mitigate these risks and administer the revenue
separate from other public revenue. LlWP funds will thus be used for
development-oriented activities with long term Impact on the human and
physical resource base in the country (paras. 7.17 - 7.23).

1.15        The project set out in the treaty, the Lesotho Highlands Water
Project (LUWl). also includes construction, initially, of a 72 megawatt
(Mli   hydroelectric  power station  that would  generate most of the
electricity required by Lesotho for 15 to 20 years on completion of Phase
LA in 1996, thus reducing the need to import power from RSA.  Taken
together, the two project components will more than help to reduce
Lesotho's dependence on South Africa: it will, in fact, help create an
inter-locking dependency in view of RM's pressing long-tern need for
dependable water supply resources.
C.   Bank/Country Goals and Strategy
1.16        The Bank's strategy In Lesotho, aiming both at correcting
existing structural problems and strengthening Lesotno's8 capacity to
derive maximum benefits from the LNWl, has three points of focus: (a)
assisting the Government in bringing domestic absorption under control
through, inter alia, establishing an effective system of budget management
and reducing the fiscal deficits (b) addressing the economy's main
structural problems; and (c) exploiting the new economlc opportunities
offered by the LEW.



1.17        This strategy has been endorsed by three Policy Framework
Papers (PPs)e.2/ In these documents, the Government reaffirms its
comitments to implementing an appropriate macroeconomic framework.
Lesotho's economy has been facing a major challenge during the 1988/89-
1990191 period.    On the one hand, domestic  absorption had to be
controlled, however, given the openness of the economy and lack of
exchange rate flexibility vis-a-vis the Rand, fiscal policy is the
fundamental Instrument in the Government's hands.  On the other hand,
Lesotho needs to expand its productive basis through efficient Investment.
LIV? nov offers a unique opportunity to finance such investments through
a regular inflow of forelgn resources. The PPPs' macroeconomic framework
takes Into account this issuel for a given level of external financing,
domestic consumption levels need to be consistent with a high level of
investment. The thrust of the program is therefore to produce an increase
in the level of national savings, particularly within the public sector.
At the same time, the strategy aIms at using the improvent in the
macroeconomic environment to Improve public sector management, diversify
agriculture (especially into high-value crops) and promote manufacturing
and agro-industry.
1.18        Countrr Macroeconomic Performance during the PPPs.  Overall
growth perfozmance was encouraging during the 1990191 period, despite
drought conditions that reduced agricultural sector growth to below 2 per
cent.  LIW-related activitylI and the manufacturing sector continued to
be the main sources of growth In the economy. Real GDP and real GNP4/
are estlmated to have grown by 7.7 per cent and 2.3 per cent,
respectively. Gross investment, reflecting the implementation of the
advanced infrastructure for the  UP project, is estimated at 52.4 per
cent of GNP. A combination of significant shortfalls In migrant workers'
remittances. a decline in the value of merchandise exports (reflecting
depressed world prices for wool and mohair), and the Increased price cf
oil led to an external current account deficit of 3.3 per cent of GNP. Of
this, about 1 percentage point may be attributed to the oil price
increase. The Government's fiscal performance Improved substantlally and
the fiscal deficit for 1*90191 is estimated at 1.2 per cent of GNP, down
from an estlmated 4.5 per cent of GNP In 1989/90.  Moreover, it was
financed almost entirely by external concessional borrowing. As for the
previous years, the deficit reduction was the result of expenditure
control masures rather than from progress in Implemeating revenue-raising
measures (apart from SACU-related receipts, other revenue items generally
stagnated or fell in real terms). On the expenditure side, as a result of
21   The first of May 27, 1988; the second of April 24. 1989; the third
of May 1, 1990.
3/    The  LIVP  project  started  its  engineering  and  preliminary
construction phase In 1988, and has recently begun construction of
its core components.  Thli had a positive impact in the related
economic sectors In Lesotho.
^I    Lesotho's GNP Is nearly twice its GDP given the overwhelming
importance of migrant worker remittance from RSA.



~  -
measures Introduced in 1989190 and further strengthening of expenditure
control measures, performance in limiting recurrent expenditure was more
than satisfactory.
1.19        A fourth year PFP 1991192-1993194 for Lesotho was presented to
the Committee of the Whole on May 14, 1991. The paper is linked to a
proposed SDR 4.5 million Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ISA?)
for 1991-92, which follows the 1988189-1990191 Structural Adjustmsst
Facility  (SAP).   Macroeconomic policoes  for 1991/92-1993/94  remain
appropriate and broadly similar to those onvisaged in the third year P1P.
The Government recognizes that over the medium term, it will be necessary
to reduee the fiscal deficit furtber as a proportion of GNP through both
diversifyinglincreasing non-custom revenues as a proportion of GNP and
continuing expenditure restraint. Bowever, room will have to be made to
allow the Government to increase its resource allocation to the social
sectors, h-amn capital formation and public management. The fourth year
PIP's macroeconomic framework also fully takes into account the Impact of
the implementation of the core components of the LIVP. This is expected
both to increase domestic growth and to exert a beneficial Influence upon
Government's revenues and the external current account.
1.20        The Bank's strategy and assistance program are geared to help
the government address a number of crucial policy objectives outstanding
under the PFP or included In a recently-adopted National Environmental
ActLon Plan. These program aIsm to (a) Implement identified lasd reform
measures to support community lnitiatives for environmentally-sustainable
agriculture; (b) reorient Industry and agro-industry toward greater
private sector participation and more support for small-scale enterprisest
and (c) reverse a recent serious decline In the previously high quality of
education and skills training. Poverty allevlation has been enhanced by
continuous IDA support for primary health care, nutritional program
implemented and through the formulation of a population policy, all of
which target women's groups.   Donor support for these objectives is
substantial, and coordinated through a United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) Round Table and within the framework of the country's overall
environmental action plan.
1.21        Progress in areas of structural reforms has been considerable
and strengthened the key elements of Lesotho's development strategy. For
the 1990/91 periods (i) in the area of agriculture and land reform, all
but one of the scheduled programs designed to combat overgrazing were
introduced as prograsmed and modifications of the land legislation have
been initiated; (i1) in the area of Industrial policy, the Government Is
taking steps to improve export incentives, to privatize agro-industrial
parastatals and to facilitate direct foreign investment; (11i) in the area
of public sector management, progress has been made to strengthen the
financial information system, to establish a personnel data bank, to
provide management training to civil servants and to increase pay
Incentives where needed; (iv) In the area of human resources, the
Government has increased its budgetary allocations to the social sectors
(education and health) and adopted a plan for reform of the education
systems and (v) in the area of institutional reform the Governmeant began



- 7 -
a process of decentralization, beginning vith the empowerment of village
development councils.
1.22        Other structural/institutional measures for 1991/92-1993/94
also follow those included in the preceding PPPs by continued
strengthening of reforms in the following areas: (1) public management
capability, where together with the civil service reform, the budgetary
process will be improved through the upgrading of the financial
information system (e.g. linking the recurrent and the capital budget and
incorporating all extra-budgetary accounts); (ii) sectoral policies where
the Government is progressively institutionalizing a business-oriented
environment by modifying the land legislation in agriculture, improving
the system of incentives in the industrial sector and investing in human
resoarces; and (iii) environmental conservation where the Government has
endorsed a set of implementation proposals following the adoption of a
National Environmental Action Plan. However, in the area of land reform,
delays in implementing needed reforms have occurred in the past.
Therefore, the Government has to continue its efforts particularly in
regard to the role of communities in decisions on land use and the
establishment of tenurial rights for women.
1.23        Linkage of Reforms with Bank Operations.   The areas of
structural reform are strongly supported by Bank operations. Despite the
constraints of limited IDA-8 funds, IDA lending to Lesotho peaked in FY88,
at US$36.4 million and reached US$22.5 million in FY91.   The Land
Management and Conservation Project (Credit 1897-LSO), approved in 1988,
is helping to control livestock grazing and improve the efficiency of land
use, thus helping to deal with Lesotho's erosion and land degradation
problems. The Urban Sector Reorientation Project (Credit 1898-LSO), also
approved in 1988, is allowing for greater cost recovery in housing and
urban infrastructure through streamlined and reorganized housing
institutions. The Second Population, Health and Nutrition Project (Credit
2059-LSO), approved in 1990, will improve efficiency across the sector
through more careful targeting of primary health care programs and
appropriate cost recovery. Under the ongoing Fourth Education Project
(Credit 1481-LSO), shortages of highly-skilled labor in ministries and
parastatals caused by skills demands from the LHWP are being addressed.
An Education Sector Development Project approved by the Board of Executive
Directors on July 16, 1991 aims at reversing the recent decline in the
quality of primary education. Finally, the Industries/Agro-industries
Project (Credit 2195-LSO) approved by the Board in FY91 aims to assist the
Government in promoting both foreign and indigenous private investment in
industry.
D.   The Water Sector
1.24        Water is the only natural resource in relative abundance in
Lesotho. Prom the lowlands in the west (1500 to 1700 m above sea level),
the land rises to the foothills in the central area (1700 to 2000 m above
sea level) and finally to the Maluti Mountains (above 3000 m) which
continue into the RSA as the Drakensberg Mountains.   This topography
strongly influences the distribution of rainfall, which amounts to 800
millimeters (mm) per year in the western part of the country and up to



- 8 -
1200 vm  in the eastern mountainous part.   Interannual variations In
rainfall are considerable, resulting in periods of drought and flooding.
The rainfall, very heavy at times, occurs mostly in the southern
hemisphere spring and sumer (October to April) and, together wil-h
snowfalls in the high altitudes of the mountains, replenishes the water
resources estimated at 5,500 million m3 per year, or 175 cubic meters per
second (m3lsec).
1.25        Due to topographic and surface conditions, practically all
run-off water enters the Sonqu River (which becomes the Orange River upon
entry into the RSA) and its tributaries, the Malibamatso, the Senqunyane
and the Mohokare (Caledon In the RSA) vhich originate in the Maluti
Mountains. Frequent heavy downpours and limited vegetative cover create
serious soil erosion on the unprotected slopes. This is one of Lesotho's
major environmental problems.
1.26        Available water resources in Lesotho far exceed present and
future demand, and total water consumption presently accounts for about
5 m3lsec, or about 3Z of available supply. About 272 of the population
(some 280,000, or 20 percent of the rural population and 120,000, or 652
of the urban population) have access to safe water supply, and the
remainder draw water from unprotected sources. Water quality is generally
good throughout the year. However, surface water sources for urban water
supplies require treatment because of high turbidity and the possibility
of fecal pollution.
1.27        GOL's plan to provide all urban areas and 60-702 of the rural
areas with safe water supplies by 2000 is presently being assessed as part
of the preparations of infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance
project (para. 1.61). The potential to expand irrigated agriculture is
limited because the country's topography restricts the irrigable area to
about 16,000 hectares (ha).  Allowing for increased water consumption
resulting from normal population growth and additional use for industry,
irrigation and domestic use, available water resources will still far
exceed future demand requirements, and water not used in Lesotho will
continue to be *lost' downstream first to RSA, and subsequently to
Namibia.
E.    Genesis of the LIIP
1.28        RSA has had a long standing interest in utilizing, as the
least cost option, water from the upper reaches of the Senqu river in
Lesotho's Maluti Mountains to meet the growing water demands in the PWV
area. This resulted in a feasibility study of a water transfer scheme in
the 1950's. Another feasibility study was carried out in the 1960's under
a UNDP-financed project executed by the Bank, and the last feasibility
study, the precursor of the present project, was completed in 1986.
1.29        The two earlier studies did not result in a project because
agreement could not be reached between the two goverrments on payment for
the water exports. However, in 1978, the governments of Lesotho and RSA
appointed a joint technical committee to undertake a new study.  The
resulting preliminary feasibility study (1979) recommuended a 35 m3lsec.



- 9 -
water transfer schoem requiring phaeod construction. This was later
Increased to 70 m3/sec. because of R&A's growing water needs and abundant
availability of water in Lesotho. The scheme also included a hydropower
generation component, reflecting Lesotho's desire to replace electricity
Imports from RSA with locally produced energy.
1.30        Following the review of the preliminary feasibility study, the
two governments agreed on the preparation of a more detailed project
layout and on the scope of another, more detailed, feasibility study. The
cost of this feasibility study was shared by the two governments, and the
study itself was carried out by two consulting groups engaged by the
respective governments but working as a joint operation.   Lesotho's
funding was made available through a grant from the European Development
Pund (EDt). UNDP financing, with the Dank as executing agency, provided
a technical assistance team to supervise execution of the studies on
behalf of GOL.
1.31        The studies identified an optimum project layout and concluded
that there were no unsolvable environmental, socio-economic or legal
difficulties. They further measured the quantities of water available for
transfer, located and dimensioned the dams, tunnels and hydropower
facilities,  and prepared cost estimates.   The first stage of the
feasibility study was completed in 1983 and the second stage in 1986.
1.32        The principal features of the LHWP, to be constructed over
several phases, are summarized in the following tablet

1.35        Phase 1A. to be completed by 1996. vould have a firm yield of
18 m3/sec and coamprise a main reservoir at Katse on the Malibamatso river,
with an active storage capacity of 1,519 million m3. Water would be
delivered by gravity through a transfer tunnel to 'Muela, some 48 kms
north of Eatee, where the hydropower plant would be located.   After
passing through the hydropower plant, water would be discharged to a
tailpond at 'Muela from where a delivery tunnel would carry the water
northwards to the Azle river in the RSA, from where it would finally flow
into the Vaal dam reservoir. The delivery tunnel would have sufficient
capacity to carry the total water requirement for both Phases LA and 1B.
A small weir to be completed by 1998 would divert 1.9 m3/sec by gravity
from the Matsoku tributary into the Katse reservoir thus advancing some of
the Phase II yield.
1.34        Phase 1B involves the construction of a second reservoir at
Mohale on the Senqunyane river. Water would be supplied by a gravity
tunnel to the Ratse reservoir, thus augmenting the Phase I firm yield to
30 m3lsec. The proposed cousissioning date for Phase 1B is 2004.
1.35        In Phase II, scheduled for completion by 2008, a third
reservoir with an active storage capacity of 2,430 million m3, would be
constructed at Mashai on the Senqu river downstream of Xatse. Water would
be pumped up to Ratee through a 19-km tunnel against a head of about 190
meters. A second transfer tunnel would be required to carry the water
from Katse to 'Muela, and a second delivery tunnel from 'Muela to the Axle
river. These tunnels would be sized to carry in combination the balance
of the full yield of 70 m3/sec. The cumulative firm yield with Phase II
vould increase to 55 ms3sec.
1.36        By 2017, the fourth reservoir at Tsoelike on the Senqu river
downstream of Mashai would be implemented under thase III, increasing the
total firm yield to 65 m3/sec or 70 mS/sec, depending on how the hydrology
may develop. Water would be pumped up to Mashai through a head of about
135 m, and thence pumped on to Katee. If necessary, additional reservoirs
and conveyance schemes to increase the yield to the original target of
70 mSIsec are envisaged in a fourth phase at Ntoahoe downstream of
Tsoelike and possibly at Malatsi downstream of Mohale to be completed by
year 2020.
P.    Environmental Aspects
1.37        Social and environmental concerns associated with the LHWP
have been the subject of intensive studies. The pre-feasibility study
completed in 1983 devoted one volume to the physical environment of the
country and the project area. Further environmental studies were carried
out in 1985 during the last stage of the feasibility studies.   These
studies addressed the following issues: (1) agriculture and land use in
the project area, (2) social structure and the rural economy, (3)
conservation and cultural heritage issues, (4) impact on water quality and
fishing, (5) effects on tourism, and (6) health effects.
1.38        The two participating governments have agreed under the treaty
to "take all reasonable measures to ensure that the implementation,



- 12 -
operation and maintenance of the Project are compatible with the
protection of the existing quality of the environment, and, in particular,
to pay due regard to the maintenance of the welfare of persons and
communites immediately affected by the Project  (Article 15 of the
Treaty). An Environmental Division was created in LHDA to deal with the
social and environmental aspects of the LUWP Funding was provided from
a number of sources, including IDA financing (Credit 1747-LSO) for a full-
time enviromtental advisor, MMN? for a rural development advisor, and
funding from the ED? for a number of studies. Proceeds of IDA Credit
1747-LS0 further funded two meetings of an  International panel of
environmental experts which reviewed the action program on the social and
envlronmental aspects of the project and endorsed the findings of the
studies undertaken so far.
1.39        The environmental and social impact of the LMVP will be small
compared to that associated with projects of similar size elsewhere. The
review in the 1986 feasibility study estimated that about 25,000 hectares
of land would be consumed by all project phases, about 275 households
would have to be resettled, and 2,200 households would lose at least one
fteld. The total project-affected population for the first two phases (IA
and 1B) was estimated at 15,800. No estimates were made for later phases.
The detailed planning indlcates that these estimates were fairly accurate
In terms of actual reservoir Impacts, but did not account for the impacts
of access roads, tailpond daa and tunnel construction, and associated
structures such as tunnel adits, construction camps and construction power
lines. In fact, about 175 households will receive replacement housing
(compared to an estimated 15), while at least 1,500 families will lose
arable land (compared to an estimated 700) with the implementation of
Phase IA.
1.40        No major impacts on the ecology of the Val river system are
expected to result from the transfer of water from the senqulOrange
system, since the waters of both systems originate from the same
geological base. The water to be transferred from the Katse reservoir In
Phase UA of LHWP will be virtually free of chemical residues and
pathogens. Screens will be used to prevent the passage of fish from one
system to the other. The information available on groundwater resources
in RSA suggests that project effects on groundwater are unlikely to
present any problem.
G.    International Water Riahts
1.41        The Senqu/Orange River is an international waterway; it
originates  in Lesotho, flows through the RSA and forms the boundary
between RSA and Namibia before reaching the Atlantic Ocean. Riparian
states are, therefore, Lesotho, USA and Namibia.   In 1985, Lesotho
notified the United Nations Governing Council for Naaibia, the governing
body mandated under U.N. General Assembly Resolution No. 2248 (S-V) of
May 19, 1967, of the plans to proceed with the LEN?. The Council informed
GOL that it had no objection to the scheme. Before notifying the Council,
GOL had consulted the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and
subsequently informed the Bank that SWAPO had no objection to the scheme.
Without prejudice to the decision taken by the UN Council for Namibia, GOL



- 13 -
sought and obtained from the new Government of Namibia (CON) In June 1991
Namibia's reconfirmation of the 'no objectionu position with regard to the
implementation of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. A copy of the
diplomatic note reconfirming Namibia's 'no objectLon' is attached as
Annex 1-1.
1.42        Upon implementatir of the entire LIWP, a total of 70 m3/sec.
of water will eventually be Giverted to RSA.  This corresponds to the
long-term regulated average yLeld of the catcbment area, and represents
about 402 of the total estimated yield of the Senqu/Orange River basin In
Lesotho. Present use of these waters by Lesotho and all other riparians
amounts to about 1,500 million ma per year, corresponding to 47 m3/sec.,
thus leaving a generous margin - about 58 m3/sec. after all phases of LBO?
are implemented - to meet future water requirements of Lesotho and lamibia
which are estimated not to exceed 5 m3/sec. and 6 m3/sec., respectively.
The implementation of LIV? should not, therefore, jeopardize future water-
based developments in Lesotho and Namibia.
1.43        RSA's alternative to building LIVP, i.e., the Orange Vaal
Transfer Scheme (OVTS), would impound the same quantity of water as that
of the LHIP just below the Lesotho border and transfer it within the RSA
through canals and pumping stations to the Vaal River system at
approximately the same place as the LMIP proposed delivery tunnel outlet.
Consequently, the impact on water users in RSA and Namibia would be the
same with either the LUIP or the OVTS scheme.
H.   The Treaty
1.44        On October 24, 1986, the "Treaty on the Lesotho Highlands
Water Project between the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho and the
Government of the Republic of South Africa' was signed between the two
countries to proceed with the implementation of the LHVP. It covers the
rights and obligations of each party and lays down the quantities of water
to be delivered, the cost sharing provisions, and the scope and
calculation of payments for the water. The treaty provides that RSA will
ultimately be responsible for all the costs of the part of LEVP related to
the delivery of water to RSA, i.e., all costs for the construction,
operation and maintenance of this part of the project including
infrastructure and access roads whether they are met directly by the RSA
or initially financed through loans obtained by Lesotho and/or the
implementing agency, the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LIBA).
Moreover, direct cost and debt service payments from RSA (the so-called
,cost-related payments') will not be linked to project performance, but
will be guaranteed by the government of RSA and met independently of any
water sales or delivery in the RSA. Reflecting Lesotho's interest in
producing electricity locally, the treaty foresees a hydropower component
in the LHWP for which Lesotho would be solely responsible for all costs.
A copy of the treaty is part of the Project filesI excerpts of some of the
key sections in the treaty are presented In Annex 1-2.
1.45        GOL and USA have agreed in a protocol (Protocol III) to the
treaty on the apportionment of costs between the water transfer component
and the hydropower component. Another protocol (Protocol IV) amplifies on



- 14 -
the mechsaism for the two parties to discharge thoir responsibilities and
how RSA would repay to GOL concessional funding used in earlier phases of
the water transfer project. With regard to the latter, the treaty obliges
RSA to repay to GOL, on IBRD terms, all concessional financing obtained by
GOL and applied to the water transfer (Article 11, Section 1 of the
Treaty).    Signing  of  this  protocol will  be  a  condition  of  loan
effectiveness.
1.   Royalty Payments
1.46        The treaty also provides that in addition to paying for the
cost-related payments, RSA shall make payments to Lesotho in the form of
a royalty related to the amounts of water transferred. The size of the
royalty payments will depend on the amount of water actually delivered and
correspond to 561 of the savings realized by RSA through the
implementation of the LHWP water transfer component rather than the
costlier next best OVTS scheme. Studies carried out in 1983 showed that
investment, operation and maintenance costs of the OVTS would be about
twice that of the water transfer component of LEWP. The royalty would be
a net benefit to Lesotho as all the cost of exporting the water would be
borne in full by RSA.
J.   LHVP Imlementins Institutions
1.47        Water resources and urban water supply/sewerage are the
responsibility of the water department in the Ministry of Water, Energy
and Mining (EMMIN). and the project was initially located in this
ministry. Rural water supply issues are the responsibility of the village
water supply division of the Ministry of the Interior. The unique size,
purpose and multisectoral nature of the LUWP effectively takes it outside
the functions of the existing water sector institutions. Following the
signing of the treaty, a number of new agencies were therefore created.
These liclude the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LEDA), the
Ministry of Lesotho Highlands Water and Energy Affairs (LHW & NA) as the
supervising ministry for the LUWP, a Joint Permanent Technical Comission
(JPTC), and the Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA) in GSA. As the
Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC) would distribute the power generated
by the LIV?, it is also associated with the implementation of the project.
LEDA and LLC are discussed in Sections It and III, respectively.
(a)    Joint Permanent Technical Commission
1.48        The treaty provides for the establishment of JPTC with equal
representation of three delegates each from Lesotho and RSA. Located in
Maseru, its main responsibility is to agree on and to monitor the
implementation and operation of the project in all matters related to the
delivery of water to RSA.  JPTC is the instrument by which the two
governments' Interests are safeguarded by ensuring (i) that the project is
efficiently implemented and operated; (it) that the funds expended by L8DA
for the implementation of the water transfer component qualify as costs
for reimbursement under the treaty: and (iii) that the agreed quantities
of water will be delivered to RSA according to the established time



- 15 -
schedule. Establishment of JPTC became effective upon the signing of the
treaty.
(b)    Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority
1.49        Based in Pretoria, the Department of Water Affairs (DVA) of
RSA is the overseeing authority of the RSA water sector.   In this
capacity, It has designated the implementation of the water delivery works
within LSA, including construction of the water delivery tunnel from the
Lesotho border to the Axle river, to the TCTA. TCTA was set up through an
amendment to the RSA Water Act.   Vhile TCTA is a separate financial
entity, it shares staff and administration with DWA. The TCTA has been
designated by the RSA authority as the agency that will ultimately bear
all costs, including the royalty payments, for the water transfer
component of the LHWP. It will be the recipient of the LHWP water, which
it will sell to the DWA with the aim of full cost recovery. DWA in turn
will sell this water together with water from other sources, to the water
boards and large industries in the Pm -area.
K.    The Energy Sector
1.50        Most of Lesotho's energy needs are met by traditional fuels
such as dung, agricultural residues and some local vegetation. However,
availability of these resources cannot easily be expanded. The country
has been virtually treeless for several decades, and reforestation is
difficult because of over-grating, rough terrain, poor soil and
inhospitable climatic conditions. Notwithstanding the limited options for
promoting a sustainable supply of traditional fuels, an energy assessment
In 1984, under the Bank/UNDP program, concluded that Lesotho could benefit
from external assistance for energy sector institution building and
improved  forestry  sector management.   Prospects  for production  of
coamercial energy are limited.   Some petroleum exploration has been
undertaken but available data do not encourage further exploration. The
existing coal and peat deposits cannot be exploited coamercially.
(a)    Hydrovower Development
1.51        Development of hydropower is the only promising possibility
for Lesotho to expand the supply of locally available energy. The supplies
of upstream water in the highlands provide a large, untapped source for
power production. The largest scheme envisaged to exploit this source is
the hydroelectric component of the LBOl which, when fully implemented,
would produce 865 Gwh p.a. by 2020.   Two mini-hydropower projects at
Semongkong (180 KW) and Manteonyane (1.9 KW) have been completed with
Norwegian assistance, and two other mini-hydropower stations at Tlokoeng
and Qacha's Nek are being constructed with French assistance. As costs of
mini-hydros are generally high and seasonal run-offs restrict their
continuous operation, their effective contribution to overall energy
supply is relatively small.



- 16 -
(b)    energy Sector Oblectives
1.52        the overriding govennieet objective is to improve the security
of energy supplies at the lowest economic cost.  Three strategies are
defined to promote this.
(i)   First, energy seerrity In the rural areas should be supported by
continued efforts to develop inexpensive and reliable energy sources
and ways to economLze the uses of energy, inter alia, through voodlot
and improved wood stove projects and promotion of renewable energy
sources.
(ii) Second, for consumers of imported and commercial energy, security
of supply is best supported by reducing the dependence on imports by
harnessing the local energy potential. This translates Into developing
the country's hydropower resources.   For the next decades,  the
goverNment intends to pursue this, first, through the Implementation of
the hydropower component of LMVP and later on through other possible
schemes. There are also plans to extend the power transmission network
to make electricity available in the rural areas. However, high costs
and low projected revenues hinder the prospects of this latter
objective.
(iii) Third, energy sector planning is to be improved by the
development of an energy sector information system and by the
establishment of a long term national energy plan (completed in 1988).
IC)    Commercial Eneray Demand and Supyly
1.53     Since the traditional and locally available energy resources are
not easily expanded, they are increasingly being supplemented by various
forms of commercial energy as the demand for energy grovw. Today, Lesotho
is completely dependent on imports from RSA to supply the growing use of
commercial energy. All petroleum products, all coal, practically all
comercial fuelwood and about 90t of all electricity is imported.
1.54     At about 0.14 tons of oil equivalent (too) p.a. per capita,
commereial energy consumption in Lesotho is among the lowest in the world.
Domestic energy consumption (including private cars) represents 55? of
total commercial energy use.  Industry uses a mere 72, indicating the
small size of this sector; commercial and government sectors use 292,
including fuel consumption for vehicles; and agriculture about 6?.
Aviation uses 1? and losses make up the remaining 22. For the poriod
1990-95, coumercial energy demand is projected to grow at 4.22 p.s.
(petroleum 3.7? p.a.; electricity 5.52 p.a.; and coal 3.72 p.a.). The
projected growth takes into account expected increased commercial and
construction activities resulting from the implementation of the LRP.

1.55        Following implementation of the hydropower component of the
LHWP, Lesotho would cut back drastically its electricity Imports from RSA.
However, to enable Lesotho to provide a sustainable supply of electricity
when the power is produced locally, the operational and financial
efficiency of its electricity sector needs to be maintained on a
comercially viable basis (Section III).
(d)    Energy Planning
1.56        WEMMIN  is  the  Ministry  overseeing  the  production  and
distribution of all forms of Comercial energy, including electricity,
except for hydroelectric production in the LHWP which will be handled by
LEW&EA.   WEMMIN's Department of Energy  (DOE),  supported by German
technical assistance, is in charge of energy planning, policy formulation
and data collection and analysts. The DOE's initial studies of energy
conservation possibilities, including electricity demand management, large
and small hydropower project evaluation and transmission network design,
provided the basis for the Lesotho Investment Planning and Tariff Study
(LITS) undertaken for LEC. LITS, financed by the EDP, was started in 1987
and completed in 1990.   By analyzing the problems and weaknesses
(distribution network long-term investment program, electricity market
analysis and demand forecast, manpower training and technical assistance
program, tariff study, etc.) of the power sector and recommending
solutions to correct them, it closed a critical gap in the sector's
knowledge and planning base.
(e)    Comercial Energy
1.57        Although prices of petroleum products and electricity are set
by GOL, they depend on prices in RSA, the source of Lesotho's energy
Imports. An interstate oil committee composed of representatives from
Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland (the BLS countries) further monitors
procurement, allocation, pricing and conservation of petroleum in the
three countries.
1.58        As some 90? of Lesotho's electricity is supplied by ESKOM, the
main supplier of bulk electricity in the RSA, electricity prices in
Lesotho depend on the cost of supply from ESKOM. ESKOM sells electricity



- 18 -
to LEC on the same basis as to other bulk consumers in the Orange Free
State Province of RSA.  ESKOM's tariff combines a demand or capacity-
related charge with an energy charge, a normal feature for this type of
supply. Lesotho, therefore, benefits from the ESKOM tariffs, which are
somewhat below world standards with most of RSA's electricity generation
coming from low-cost coal. Despite rising labor costs, ESROMIs real price
of electricity has increased relatively little in the past for large
consumers like Lesotho (about 0.52 p.a. in real terms on average over the
last 40 years).
L.    Previous Bank Group Involvement in the EnergyL and Water Sectors
1.59        The Bank has supported Lesotho's efforts to develop its
abundance of water resources into export revenue by (i) acting as
executing agency for the UNDP-financed consultants who supervised the
feasibility studies of the LHWP on behalf of GOL, (ii) providing an IDA
Credit of SDR 8 million (Credit 1747-LSO) for the preparatory phase of the
LUVP; (iii) providing an advance of US$750,000 under the project
preparation facility (PPF P536-LSO) and (iv) providing substantial
supervision and technical expertise during the preparatory stage of the
LUWP.
1.60        In the other parts of the water sector, a water supply project
was supported by an IDA Credit of US$6 million (Credit 887-LSO), approved
in 1979. It financed the construction of piped water systems in seven
small  towns  for  about  50,000  people.    This  project,  which  also
strengthened the Water and Sewerage Branch of 1OMMIN, was successfully
completed in 1985 after the initial project scope had been substantially
reduced as the result of large increases in cost estimates (Project
Performance Audit Report (PPAR-7021).
1.61        Except for the LUVP, the Sank Group does not plan to support
any other projects in the water sector, other than a water supply
component as part of a planned infrastructure rehabilitation and
maintenance project (FY94).
1.62        In the power sector, the Bank's involvement has boen limited
to (i) the execution of the energy assessment completed in 1984, and (ii)
to discussions with GOL about power sector issues during the preparatory
vork of the LHWP.  No Bank-funded projects are planned for the power
sector.
M.    Involvement of Donors in the Energy and Water Sectors
1.63        Foreign lenders provided technical assistance to LEC over the
last eight year, which comprised: (a) a team of two engineers provided
under Irish bilateral assistance between 1983 and 1986, (b) an engineer
provided under Norwegian bilateral assistance between 1987 and 1990,
tC) a team of two engineers provided under French bilateral assistance
between 1986 and 1991 and (d) ESK0M with assistance to management issues
through missions in 1990 and 1991.   Since 1991, technical assistance
positions (para. 3.04) were provided under Belgian, German, French and
U.S. bilateral assistance. In addition, France funded the extension of



- 19 -
the distribution system and the high voltage supply line from the Lesotho
border from 1989 onwards of about US$23.2 million equivalent.
1.64        In the water supply and sanitation sector a number of donors
contributed towards the financing of the extension of services.   The
Maseru Water Supply Phase 1I project which increased water production and
distribution facilities was co-financed in 1986 by the African Development
Fund (AfDF) with about US$8.6 million equivalent and the African
Development Bank (AfDB) about US$9.5 million equivalent. The Four Towns
Water Supply Project (construction of water production and distribution
facilities, completed in 1988) was co-financed by the African Development
Fund, about US$6.8 million equivalent, the OPEC Fund about US$2.7 mlllion
equivalent, and the Government of Norway, about US$5.5 million. In 1988
work started on the Greater Maseru Sanitation Project (construction of
sewers and extension of treatment works) with financing from the Kuwait
Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) with about US$3.8 million
equivalent and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADIA)
US$3.8 million equivalent. The 13 Towns Sanitation project. completed in
1990 was financed by a grant from Kf (about US$7.8 million equivalent).
ODA financed in 1988 extension of the sewers in Maseru and additional
works at the treatment plant about US$1.2 million equivalent. Execution
of all works of the above projects was supported by GOL contributions.
N.    Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.65        The main rationale for Bank involvement in the project is that
the LHWP is in the best economic interest of Lesotho as it offers a unique
opportunity to convert water into export revenues. At the same time, the
Bank's participation has been, and continues to be, crucial for successful
implementation of the project.   During the preparatory stages,  its
involvement in the form of technical and financial support sent strong
signals to international contractors and financial institutions confirming
the desirability as well as the feasibility of the project. These signals
were given the necessary credibility by the Bank's decision to support the
project financially and participate in the security arrangements for
international lenders on a pari-passu basis (paras. 5.04 to 5.11).
1.66        The proposed Bank funding would be essential for successful
project implementation as it would be directed to key project components
for which it is desirable to obtain international funding, but for which
such funding has proven hard to secure.   These components include
construction supervision, detailed design work, technical assistance to
LUDA and for the implementation of the environmental action plan and
compensation plans. The proposed Bank funding for the project is on IBRD
terms since lending would be confined to the water transfer component, the
debt service of which would effectively be met by the RSA. Bank financing
can therefore not be used to fund those project components for which GOL
has ultimate cost responsibility, such as technical assistance to the GOL
JPTC delegation and the hydropower component.

0.    Applications of Lessons Learnt
1.67        Lessons from Bank experience in similar large (water) civil
works projects such as the Kariba Hydroelectric Project (Loan 0145-RN),
the Tarbela Dam Project (PCR-6398), the tunnel of the Second and Third
Bogota Water Supply Project (PCR-7231), the Guatemala Aguacapa Power
Project (Loan 1426-GU) and the Guatemala Chixoy Power Project (Loan 1605
and 1605-1, GU) indicate the need for extensive geological explorations,
adequate cost estimates, securing of sufficient finance in advance, review
of designs by a panel of experts and clear specifications in the tender
documents in order to avoid tunnel collapses, construction difficulties
caused by unknown geology, large cost overruns combined with insufficient
finance and ambiguity of specifications for constructing the works. These
lessons were carefully considered in preparing the proposed project. In
addition, careful consideration was given to the Bank's experience with
regard to environmental and resettlement aspects and utilization of
project generated revenues in the form of royalty payments.   These
preparation activities started with the design and execution of the
engineering project (Credit 1747-LSO) which covered all aspects of project
preparation from design to finance, environment and institutional build
up. Also the need to have basic infrastructure and access roads in place
before start of construction was recognized. This approach ensured that
the geology of the area was adequately investigated, the design was
reviewed by a panel of internationally recognized experts and contracts
for the construction works awarded with secured financing and access roads
constructed to enable work on the main contracts to start without delays.
The early focus on environmental and resettlement issues resulted in the
agreement of all parties to a comprehensive environmental action and
rural development plan. Furthermore, agreement was reached with GOL for
directing project induced windfall profits in the form of project
royalties and other revenues to development purposes through the
administration and management of a development fund on the basis of well
defined eligibility criteria.
1I. THE BORROWER - LESOTHO HIGHLANDS DEYELOPMENT AUTHORITY (LHDA)
A.    Introduction
2.01        The  Lesotho  Highlands  Development  Authority  (LHDA) was
established by order of His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II, published in the
Government Gazette of November 16, 1986 (Order No. 23), and charged with
the execution of the engineering, construction and operation and
maintenance of LHWP, including the hydropower component. LHDA's Board of
DLrectors originally comprised seven Rmebers, with the principal secretary
of WEMMIN as its Chairman, and the LHDA chief executive in charge of
executing the Authority's policies and day-to-day operations, as an ex-
officio member.   The remaining five members of the Board have been
appointed for their knowledge of managerial, technical and financial
matters and are, with one exception, senior civil servants. The Board's
powers and functions include approval of contracts, tender documents and
major design parameters, as well as financing arrangements, budgets,
implementation plans, operation and maintenance schedules, and appointment
of auditors.   After the creation of the LHW & EA in March 1988, the



- 21 -
prlncipal secretaries of this ministry and of the Ministries of  the
Interior and Foreign Affairs were added to the Board.  The principal
secretary of LW & EA has now replaced as chairman of LHDA's board the
Minister of LHW & EA who had Initially taken over the chairmanship from
the principal secretary of VEMIM at the time of creation of LHW & EA.
B.   Management and Ortanisation
2.02        LUDA's current management structure, which is shown in
Annex 2-1. evolved during the implementation of the project's engineering
phase.   Initially, the chief executive was overseeing all of LEDA's
departments, which in the early phase consisted of the technical
department and the finance and accounting department.  In 1988, the
position of assistant to the chief executive was created to assist the
chief executive in the day-to-day managemnt of LHDA's operation. During
that year, additional departments were created, such as environment,
legal, public relations and training. Also In late 1988, the position of
deputy chief executive was established.   The environmental manager
Initially acted for the deputy chief executive. With the implementation
of the infrastructure component, the infrastructure department was added
In late 1988 and the capital finance division, in charge of coordinating
and monitoring the securing of finance for the Phase 1A construction
project, was created in early 1989. An internal auditor was appointed in
early 1990. By 1989, a second deputy chief executive was nominated to be
in charge of finance and public relations. From there on, one deputy
chief executive was in charge of finance, administration, human resources,
environment, public relaticas and legal affairs, and the other in charge
of engineering, infrastructure, and water resources. Technical assistance
contracts in the fields of engineering, finance, accounting and
environment provided LHDA vith the necessary skills for managing the
project, supervising the engineering consultants, supervising the
environmental and compensation studies and preparing relevant policy
proposals and for iWplementing the financlal management and accounting
systems. The various technical assistance aesignments were financed under
Credit 1747-LSO. All consultants have performed to the full satisfaction
of LEDA.
2.03        In early 1990, LUDA's board decided on a new management
structure. Consultants had recommended restructuring of the previous
management structure into one that groups LUDA's activities into three
departments each headed by a deputy chief executive.   These three
departments    cover:    (i) Engineering    and    Construction;
(il) Finance/Accounting,  Administration,   and  Legal  Services;  and
(III) Environment, Public Relations and Human Resources.  Within each
department, divisional managers are responsible for the various functional
units. Whilst in the past the engineering department was the predominant
one, the new structure reflects the greater importance that will be given
to the management of the project's finances and accounting as well as to
the implementation of the various environmental action programs. An
executive committee consisting of the chief executive, and the deputy
chief executives meets weekly to ensure coordination between the
departments on all important aspects.



- 22 -
2.04        The deputy chief executive in charge of entgineering and
construction and the one in charge of finance/administration have already
taken up their assignments; a candldate for the third position of the
deputy chief executive has been identified and will take up his asslgnment
soon. All three deputy chief executive positions and about half of the
divisions will initially be headed by expatriates provided under the
technical assistance programs until Basotho counterparts have been
sufficiently trained to take up these assignments.
2.05        The present organizational structure will change as the
implementation of the proposed project nears completion, in order for LUDA
to become ready for the operating phase of transfer of water and
hydropower generation.   To ensure that the appropriate organizational
structure, including staffing requirements and profiles, and the
complementary training programs have started at least two years before
start of operations, agreement was reached during negotiations that LEDA
(i) will undertake by January 1994 a study under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank to review the adequacy of its present
organizational structure in line with the requirements of the operating
phase, to determine statfing requirements and prepare staffing profiles,
and to outline an appropriate training program, (ii) will forward to the
Bank for its review and comments the findings of such study, and
(iii) start with the implementation of the agreed recommendations by
October 31, 1994.
C.    Personnel and Stafflng
2.06        During the execution of Credit 1747-LSO, LUDA gradually built
up staff from 60 by the end of PY87 to 248 regular employees and about 20
semi-skilled workers employed in non-permanent positions by FY90. Out of
its total work force, 68 positions were filled with higher level Basotho
staff in the fields of engineering, finance, accounting, administration,
legal and environment. The build-up of the competence of Basotho staff
was achieved through careful monitoring of the work performance and
appropriate training.   Practically all Basotho staff in higher level
positions were not assigned on a counterpart arrangement basis but instead
took over direct line positions. This arrangement proved to be successful
as it greatly increased the sense of responsibility of the staff and
prepared them for early career advancement. The present staffing level
will increase by about 100 during the peak construction period; a further
increase of about 30 staff members will be required for the operating
phase.   At the same time efforts will continue to replace expatriates
with Basotho staff as and when the latter acquire the requisite
experience. Based on the envisaged training programs of LHDA, the total
work force of 268 with 35 expatriates by end FY91 is forecast to be at the
same level by PY97 when the facilities are expected to be in operation,
with only 13 expatriates in specialized areas, compared with the current
expatriate strength of 33.
2.07        LUDA's salary levels are attractive enough to retain qualified
staff that otherwise might be looking for employment elsewhere, either in
the local private sector or in neighboring countries. The build-up of
LIDA's staff was to some extent accomplished through the hiring of



- 23 -
qualified staff from other government agencies. This temporarily caused
some difficulties in the affected agencies.   These difficulties were
addressed by restructuring the ongoing Fourth Sducation Project (Credit
l512-LSO) to expand the overseas trainiag of Basotho professionals to fill
up positions vacated by those hired by LUDA. As staffing requirements and
training needs will change over time, particularly in view of the
operating phase, a review of the present and planned staffing and training
arrangements are included in the proposed review of LHDA's organizational
structure (para. 2.05).
D.    Training
2.08        The good progress made in having professional Basotho staff in
senior managerial and professional positions was to a great extent due to
the efforts of LHDA's training division. This division was set up during
the engineering project (Credit 1747-LSO) under funding provided by the
Overseas Development Agency (ODA) of the U.K. for an experienced training
manager. One of the most valuable contributions of the training manager
was the outline of a comprehensive training program for LEDA's staff
designed to provide the necessary training during the construction and
later during the operation period. This program includes three areas of
trainingt (i) in-house training, (ii) short-term overseas familiarization
and training programs, and (iii) scholarships.   The in-house training
program has been successful as it provided training in accounting,
administration, finance and computer operations and other areas of
technical specialization such as engineering and contract administration.
Also the short-term familiarization and training programs contributed to
the building up of the competence of LHDA's staff and preparing them for
quick career advancement. This training program was recently reviewed and
updated by LHDA in terms of scope, timing, cost and funding, and its
continuing Implementation was agreed upon during negotiations.
2.09        In an effort to capture as soon as possible some of the
benefits of the implementation of the project, LMDA drew up a plan to
provide training for Basotho in construction skills with the help of
consultants. A training facility close to the project area exists and
appropriate programs have been designed by consultants.   Training in
construction  skills  has  begun  and  includes  machine  operations,
bricklaying, concrete work, and earth moving. Training courses of a six-
week duration with approximately 100 trainees per batch will provide
contractors with the opportunity to select construction workers from
Basotho nationals.
E.    Corporate and Financial Planning
2.10        The head of the capital finance division is in charge of
investment planning.   Forecast expenditures related to the investment
program, i.e., the implementation of the water transfer and hydropower
components cover the time horizon for their completion. LHDA's yearly
operating expenditures are formulated in annual budgets subject to a mid-
term review. All investment planning and budgets are subject to approval
by LEDA's board and the JPTC. With the considerable expansion of LHDA's
financial activities, its planning functions will increase. This should



- 24 -
ensure that funding is aval.able at time of commitment and that the
required financial resources are available to meet LHDA's expenses and
debt service payments in the currencies required. LHDA has established a
treasury department that recently became fully operational.
P.    Financial Organization and Accountina
2,11        LUDA started with a microcomputer-based commercial accounting
system after its creation in 1986.   The future requirements of the
accounting system will, however, be beyond the limits of the ezisting
software and hardware. LUDA has, therefore, engaged consultants to assist
in designing and implementing a minicomputer-based accounting system that
would meet its future accounting requirements. implementation of this
program has started. Agreement was reached at negotiations that LUDA will
ensure that this system is fully operational together with associated
controls by December 31, 1991 at the latest.
2.12        Management accounting will greatly expand.   The initial
dominance of financial treasury aspects during project implementation will
give way to a more balanced overall view covering all operational aspects,
in particular with the start of the water transfer and hydropower
operations. In order to ensure that management information is available
for quick decision-making,  agreement was reached during negotiations
(i) that LUDA will carry out a review of the appropriateness of its
management accounting system, (ii) that this study will be completed
before the end of FY94, and (iii) that the findings of this study will be
reviewed and agreed upon with the Bank with the aim of implementing the
agreed recomuendations by the beginning of FY95.
G.  Insurance
2.13        LHDA is carrying normal iniarance coverage for its vehicles
and vorkers' compensation. For the implementation of the construction
project LUDA has opted for insurance coverage to be controlled by the
owner of work, i.e. LUDA, instead of leaving the insurance coverage for
major risks during the construction phase with the contractors.   The
insurance would cover LHDA against defects of workmanship and design.
This arrangement will enable LHDA to recover the cost of any accidents
from the insurers regardless of where fault may lie and the insurer might
then seek recovery from the contractor or consultant on his/her own
account. LUDA would also obtain insurance coverage for accidents with a
X 250,000 deductible.   This insurance would not cover risks of the
consultant or contractors, who would be required to insure themselves in
accordance with traditional practices. There would be no coverage for
consequential damAges and losses due to civil disturbances, war or nuclear
events.
2.14        The insurance was placed in the London market in January 1991
with effectiveness on February 1, 1991.   Competitive quotations were
obtained.   In line with standar  practice,  a major portion of the
insurance was passed on through unuirwriters to reinsurers.



- 2S .
B.   Auditin
2.15         LHDA's accounts have been audited by independent auditors
since its establishment in 1986. Under Credit 1747-LSO, LDA is presently
committed to (i) maintain its records and accounts in accordance with
sound accounting principles to reflect the operations and financial
condition of LHDA; (ii) have its acco4Ats audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA; (Cli) submit the audit report to the
Association within four months of the end of the fiscal year;
(iv) maintain separate accounts In relation to expenditures finaaced under
the Special Account: (v) enable the Association's representatives to
examine such accounts; and (vi) ensure that such separate accounts are
included in the annual audit and that the auditors' report contains In
respect of such separate accounts an opinioa in relation to the
expenditures, i.e.. whether or not they were used for the purposes for
which they were provided. L8DA's performance in this regard has been
satisfactory. The audits did not raise any issue. The audit requirements
of Credit 1747-LSO are retained under the proposed project.
III. LESOTHO ELECTRICITY CORPORATION (LEC)
A.   Introduction
3.01        The Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC) is responsible for
electricity transmission and distribution in Lesotho.  Virtually all
electricity consumed in Lesotho is purchased by LEC in bulk from EIKJM,
RSA's electricity utility. LEC would not be a beneficiary of the proposed
IBRD loan, nor would it be responsible for the construction and operation
of the hydroelectric component under the proposed project. However. as
the distributor of the power to be generated under the project, the sound
management, operations and financial performance of LEC would be crucial
to safeguard the benefits of the project's hydropower component. Given
the structure of the water transfer component to which the Bank loan will
be directed, the Bank sought close collaboration with key donors who had
expressed interest in financing the hydropower component of the project -
the European Development Fund (EDF), the European Investment Bank (SIB),
and the African Development Bank (AfDB) - and who therefore vould be
intimately involved in power sector financial viability issues.
B.   Orsanization and Management
3.02        LEC was created by the Blectricity Supply Act of March 31,
1969 as a parastatal corporation under the jurisdiction of  3EM0IN to
handle transmission, distribution and generation of electricity. The
corporation is supervised by a board of directors of presently six
members. The board appoints the managing director, who, subject to
instructions from the board on matters of policy, is responsible for the
direction of the business of the corporation and its administration and
organization. The board, as currently constituted, is almost entirely
composed of GOL officials, with the Minister and Principal Secretary of
W 1MI as the chairman ad deputy chairman, respectively.  The heavy
presence of GOL officials on LEW'8 board effectively has created a culture
within LEC similar to that of a government department rather than that of



- 26 -
a commercial entity that needs to operate successfully to be viable. A
major focus during the preparation was to assist LEC to initiate actions
that would begin to change its internal culture.  The status of these
actions are discussed below.
C.    Staff ing
3.03        Out of a total staff of 477 (mid-March, 1990), 203 were
skilled, 60 were unskilled employees and 214 hired as laborers on an
hourly wage basis. The technical department (headed by a chief engineer)
and the financial department (headed by a financial manager) form the bulk
of   LEC's   staff   and   is   complemented   by   smaller   commercial,
administration/personnel and public relations departments. The present
organizational structure is generally adequate, but LEC has difficulties
in recruiting and retaining skilled staff.
3.04        A three-pronged approach to strengthen the management and
staffing situation was developed during project preparation, and is
currently under implementations
(i) Salary levels and structure are being adjusted to enable
recruitment and retention of qualified staff. To address the
immediate need for adjusting the benefits for LEC staff a general
salary increase of 352 became effective in March 1990 and another
one of 182 in April 1991. LEC'a Board has approved a new salary
structure to be implemented in August 1991 and LEC has prepared a
staff career development program that would provide an incentive for
staff to stay in the company;
(ii) A training program for LEC staff is being established. Short-
term programs covering training of electrical engineers and meter
readers and training in system operation have been implemented. The
medium and long term training needo have been addressed through a
training needs assessment completed I.n November 1990. The resulting
implementation program has been discussed, and it includes courses,
provision of teaching materials and equipment, and the setting up of
a small training center. Funding from France has been identified
for this (M 205,000 equivalent). In addition, a training engineer,
funded by the Center for International Migration (CIM) of Germany,
started his assignment with LEC on April 1, 1991; and
(iii) A technical assistance program has been implemented to fill
key positions until trained local staff is available. Donor funding
from Belgium, Germany, France, the US was obtained for the positions
of deputy managing director, chief engineer, design engineer, hijh
voltage engineer, light current engineer, metering engineer,
maintenance engineer, financial manager, training engineer and
computer analyst. Discussions are underway with other donors for
the funding of the two remaining positions, those of principal
engineer and distribution and commercial manager.

D.    Tariffs
S.OS        Sy early 1988, LEC's tariffs had fallen well below the level
required to ensure the financial viability of the company. Since then,
tariffs have been increased each year (102 on January 1, 1988, IO on July
1, 1988, 20Z on January 1, 1989, 242 in January 1090 and 182 on January 1,
1991). While the first tariff iacrease only passed on ESKOM's increase,
the whole of the second and about half of the last three increases vent
beyond ESXOM's increases and have started to restore LEC's financial
viability. During preparation, a target of 82 return on revalued assets
to be reached by FY93 was agreed on with LEC. The tariff adjustments to
date have been directed at achieving this objective on time. LEC's tariff
structure has not been changed since the early 1980's. It provides for
cross-subsidization of domestic and industrial customers by the comiercial
and general customers, has too many categories and bases the tariff for
the majority of customers on the energy rather than on the power consumed.
A new tariff structure has been finalized that will provide incentives for
electricity consumers to manage their consumption more carefully, and
provide savings for LEC by reducing the daily peak demand and increase the
load factor. It will be introduced in January 1992.
E.    Past Financial Performance
3.06        LIC's performance over the last four years is marked by
expansion of its sales as expressed in Kwh, which increased by 372 from
1986 to 1990. In the same period revenues more than doubled as tariffs
increased by about 201 in real terms. Also the number of new connections
grew steadily and in 1990 about three times more new connections were
installed compared to 1987. While the cost of purchased energy as a
percentage of revenue decreased steadily from 1987 to 1990, when it
represented about 462 of revenues, other operating expenses increased from
18.3Z in 1987 to 36GZ in 1990. Likewise the operating ratio increased from
852 in 1987 to 95Z by 1990. The rate of return on fixed assets dropped
from 1O0 in 1987 to 1.32 in 1990 largely because of revaluation of assets
in 1989. However, recently LEC has begun turning its operations around
with tariff increases, improvements in its collection rate and containment
of cost increases. These increases are mandated by LEC's comnitment to
achieve a 4.5Z rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in FY92, and a
8X rate of return by FY93.
P.   Accounting and Auditing
3.07        LEC's accounting system is in poor shapes billing is slow and
inefficient, there is no register of fixed assets, receivables are
inaccurate and have arrears, inventory is unreliable, budget is not
compared to actual results, there is neither cost accounting nor cash
management. As part of the effort to improve the accounting system, LEC
has obtained assistance from ESKO4.  ISSOM has a good understanding of
LEC's problems through their business relationsbip, and has initiated a
technical assistance program whose first objective is to deal with the
revenue cycle, from meter reading to reviewing budgeting, planning and
cost functions, and accounting controls, systems and procedures.  The
financial manager (para. 3.04 (Lii)), who is expected to be in post by the



- 28 -
third quarter of 1991, and the computer specialist (para. 3.04 (Lii)) who
Is already in post are expected, with ESKOM"a help, to produce an
lmplement an action plan to strengthen LEC's accounting system.
3.08        In FY87 and FY88, LEC's annual audits were performed by the
Auditor General's office, and started almost one year after the end of the
financLal year (31 March), because the accounts were late. As the auditor
had to redress the accountanes' Insufficiencies, the audits lasted five
and six months, respectively. For the FY69 audit, LEC decided to use the
services of private external auditors who performed the audit on time.
She auditors pointed out the weakneoss of the revenue cycle system and
emphasised the lack of management control In LEC's financial matters.
Their recognition of the urgent need for a financial manager led to the
request for technical assistance In this area (paras. 3.04 and 3.07).
0.    Consumers
3.09        On the basis of energy and maximum demand figures of LEC,
total energy consumption in Lesotho increased from 88 Gwh In 1980 to 180
Gbh In 1990, an average annual growth rate of just over 7.4?. Over this
period, maximum demand increased from 20 MN to 49 MV, with an annual load
factor of between 0.42 and 0.46. System technical losses are estimated by
LEC at 10? (3.7? transmissions 6.7? distribution), with non-technical
losses at 5.3?.
3.10        About 2? of the population, located largely in Maseru and the
few towns served by the transmission network, have access to electricity.
The 8,800 Maseru consumers constitute 80? of LIC's clientele and about 701
of the total load. In 1989, only 12? of urban households were connected
to the grid, and had an average consumption of 8,400 Rwh p.a., while the
0.7? of rural households with electric service had an average cons%z.tion
of 6,150 Vwh p.a.. The Lesotho Investment and Tariff Study (LITS)
(para. 1.56) concluded that few households remain to be connected among
the high lncome group. Thus, lower income households, with lower average
consumption levels, constitute most of the market for future connections.
The LITS, however, also concluded that LEC's connection fees were too high
and acted as a deterrent to market penetration at the lower income levels.
LEC is therefore presently testing a new policy in one urban and one rural
area.   The new policy provides for charging the consumers for the
connection from the line to their meter, while LEC would consider any
extension of the low voltage distribution line as an investment. The cost
reduction to the consumer is expected to be of about 50, on average. If
the experience is successful, it will be broadened, and the timetable
would be Included in LEC's 6-year (1990-95) investment program.
B.    Investment Program
3.11        As indLcated in paragraph 3.09 above, electricity demand
Increased at an average rate of 7.4? p.a. from 88 Gwh in FY80 to 180 Guh
in  FY90;  this  rendered  existing  electricity  import  facilities
insufficient. ESKOM is, therefore, upgrading its voltage transmission
system from 88 Ky to 132 Kv, which will raise the power demand ceiling
well above the present 40 MV. Because of a delay in Lesotho in planning



- 29 _
construction of the 132-Kv network, the country experienced some cut-offs
In the wivter of 1989 and 1990 when demand exceeded the present 40-MV
capacity. The 132-Kv network is now under construction and will also
supply Eatse and the construction sites. The 33-Rv and 66-Kv transmission
and distribution network will be renovated throughout Lesotho in the next
five years. LEC has entrusted LHDA with the construction of the 132-Kv
line from Haputsoe to Pelaneng and its continuation as a 66 Kv line to
R&tse and the project's construction camp sites.
3.12        The  investment costs  for  transmission  and  distribution
facilities will amount to M 290 million In current values from 1990 to
1996. Sources of financing Includes (i) funds from France (concessional
financing) for the Maseru and Maputsoe rings and the 132-Ky transmission
lines from the border to Nabote and Maputsoe. and Mazenod and the northern
line, for an approximate total amount of X 109 million; (ii) grant funds
from the Scandinavian countries, for the central and southern lines for an
approximate total amount of K 77 million; and (iil) for the balance local
and South African bank loans (M 73 million), and LEC's own funds (M 31
million). Detailed description of LEC's 1990-95 investment program is
presented in Asmem 3. These investments, however, are not included in the
proposed project.
I.    LEC's Future Role in the Power Sector
3.13        The implementation of the LHWP has resulted in significant
changes in the organizational framework and responsibilities of individual
institutions in Lesotho's power sector. Prior to the 1986 LWVP Treaty
with RSA, LEC was the only entity authorized to supply electricity in
Lesotho under the Electricity Supply Act (1969). LEC reports to iMKI=
which has responsibility for all energy supply in Lesotho, including
electricity, except for hydropower production associated with the LaW
whose jurisdiction belongs to LEDA. The latter reports to LSW & EA on all
matters relating to LlWP implementation, including the production of
hydropower. Thus, responsibilities for power supply in Lesotho are split
between two line ministries, lIMOIIN and LUl & EA, and two operating
entities, LEC and LTDA. However, the addition of new Institutions and
changes In responsibilities has not been fully accounted for in the
regulatory framework of the seotor.  The implications of the current
situation are discussed in Chanter VI.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Protect Oblectives
4.01        the main objective of the project is to put in place the
physical and managerial capacity for Lesotho to transform its principal
natural resource of abundance - water - int, export revenues from South
Africa.   An additional objective is to produce hydropower to reduce
Lesotho's dependence on imported energy. Specifically, the project aims
at  carrying  out  the  necessary  physical  investments,  providing
institutional support, safeguarding environmental and compensation aspects
of the Phase L.A of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP), preparing
for later construction phbses for further water transfers, and setting up



- 30 -
a development fund to channel revenues from the project to development-
oriented programs.
B.    Project Scope and Detailed Description
4.02        The project covers the Phase IA of the LWOP.  Its scope covers
all of the facilities required to permit transfers of water up to 18
m3lsec. and install 72 MW capacity for hydropower generation.  It would
include Ci) a 182-meter high concrete arch dam at Katse, (ii) 48 km of
tunnels to transfer the storcad water from Katse to 'Muela, (iii) a 72 MW
bahe load hydropower plant (with 120 km of transmission lines to Maseru)
and a 55-meter high concrete tailpond arch dam at 'Muela, (iv) a 16-km
delivery tunnel from 'Muela to the crossover point into RSA, and (v) 200
km of access roads. including five bridges and other infrastructure
facilities. The project also includes environmental protection measures,
compensation and resettlement, construction supervision, technical
assistance to LHDA and to the GOL delegation to the JPTC, road maintenance
and Improved border crossing facilities and studies for the preparation of
the follow-on Phase 1B project. In addition, a development fund would be
established for channelling project revenues to development oriented
programs. These revenues would be managed separately but in coordination
with the GOL central budget, and would be subject to annual auditing by
Independent auditors. Following is a detailed description of the various
components; Annex 4-1 contains further details of the project physical
workss

(h)   Development Fund
Setting up and operation of a development fund for the receipt of
project related income accruing to GOL.
4.03        In the RSA, simultaneous investments during construction of
Phase IA will be needed to transfer the water into the Vaal liver supply
system. These include a delivery tunnel from the Lesotho/RSA border to
the Axle river including outfall structures, access roads, and corrective
work on the Axle river.  These investments estimated to cost about
US$240 million equivalent are, however, not Included in the project as
defined here.
C.    Status of Project Preparation
4.04        IDA approved a credit of SDR 8 mlllion (Credit 1747-LSO) In
1986 to assist in (1) developing detailed designs for all of the project
components and refining the optimization of the hydropower component;
(ii) undertaking further geological investigations; (iii) preparing bid
documents and criteria for evaluating bids; (iv) providing technical
assistance and training for establishing and developing LEDA; and
(v) assisting LED in securing project financing.
4.05        Credit 1747-LSO was cofinanced by the UNDP (US$0.8 million
equivalent); the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), (through CII - US$ 0.3
million equivalent); the United Kingdom (UK - US$1.2 million equivalent);
France (US$1.6 million equivalent); and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID - US$0.07 million equivalent). The EDF
(US$10.6 mllion equivalent) and the SIB (US$4.2 million equivalent)
financed the design of the hydropower component, related geotechnical
investigations and some environmental studies. Lesotho contributed US$2.2
million equivalent, and the RSA provided US$18 million equivalent.
Funding  for  design,   construction  and  supervision  of  advanced
Infrastructure, including access roads, was secured from the Development
Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA, about US$230 million equivalent). Prance
provided, under two protocols, financing for the construction of power



- 33 -
lines in Lesotho (FF150 million, US$26.2 million equivalent) out of which
about FF50 million (US$8.? mllion equivalent) are attributable to the
construction of power supply lines to the project area. In addition, the
Cmcn0wealth Development Corporation (CDC) provided In early 1991 US$6.1
million   equi'vPlent   for   the   construction   of   project   related
telecommunications  facilities.   A  list of funding sources  for the
preparation phase of the project which will be repaid to Lesotho by RSA on
IBiD terms in accordance with Article 11.1 of the Troaty is shown In
Annex 4-2.
4.06        Additional preparatory activities identified in the course of
preparation and not covered by the proceeds of Credit 1747-LSO and other
cofinancing funding (computerisation of royalty manual, engagement of
international panel of experts to review the environmental action plan,
economic impact studies, etc.) were financed by IDA with an advance of
US$750,000 under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF P536-LSO) made
available in October 1988.
4.07        Construction of the project's advanced infrastructure is near
completion. The first contracts for engineering services were awarded in
1987 and contracts for the initial sections of the access roads to project
sites were awarded in early 1988 with initial financing (US$70 million
equivalent) provided by the DBSA. All advanced Infrastructure, including
the access roads, are due to be completed during 1991.
4.08        The designs of the Katse dam and the transfer tunnel were
carried out by a joint venture consisting of SOGIEAE, Coyne et Bellier
(France), Sir Alexander Gibb (U.K.) and the RSA firms of Hinham Shand,
Reeve Steyn and Watermayer, Legge Piesold and UhlImnn. The dellvery
tunnel was designed by the Lesotho Delivery Tunnel Consultants composed of
Vinham Shand, Inc. Van lickerk, Kleyne & Edwards, Keeve Steyne, Inc. and
Steffen, Robertson & Kirsten SA, Inc. The design of the hydropower
component was prepared by a joint venture of Sir Alexander Gibb and
SOGREAR. IDA Credit 1747-LSO financed, together with a grant from France,
the design services for the vater transfer component by SOGREAR, Coyne et
Bellier and Sir Alexander Gibb. The EDF financed the design services for
the hydropower component by Sir Alexander Gibb and SOGREA. All designs
were reviewed by an international panel of experts which convened at key
Intervals of the design work.   The findings of their reviews were
Incorporated in design modifications.  Selection of design consultants
financed by Credit 1747-LSO was carried out under IDA guidelines.
4.09        Tender documents for the major works for the water transfer
component civil works (Catse dam and reservoir, transfer tunnel and
delivery tunnel) were issued on October 16, 1989. Tenders were received
on April 20, 1990 and their evaluation was completed in August 1990 and
contracts were awarded in December 1990.
4.10        Tenders for the hydropower component are scheduled to be
invited by April 1992, and construction work is expected to start in 1993
with power production commencing in late 1996 when the water is being
delivered.
4.11        In order to ensure that the dams to be built under the project
and later to be operated by LIDA meet appropriate design and operation



- 34 -
criteria, agreement was reached with LEDA during negotiations that the
dams will be inspected periodically during and after construction by a
panel of experts acceptable to the Bank. Agreement was further reached
with LEDA: (i) that it will forward to the Bank for its review the report
of such panel together with actions it proposes to take in response to the
panel's recommendations, and (ii) that it will prepare for the Bank's
review no later than one year before the completion of the dame the
proposed arrangements for the operation and maintenance of each dam,
including its inspection in accordance with sound engineering practices.
D.    Project Costs
4.12        The total cost of the Phase IA project, including interest
during construction, is estimated at Maloti 8,441 million, or US$2,414
million, of which about US$883 million is in foreign exchange, i.e. in
currencies outside the Common Monetary Area (para. 1.06). The following
table summarizes the project cost estimatess detailed cost estimates are
shown in Annex 4-3.

4.13        The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  actual  costs  of  ongoing
infrastructure works, signed contracts for the Ratse dam, the transfer tunnel,
the delivery tunnel and the contracts in force for the supervision consultants
and technical assistance consultants supporting LHDA. The aggregate of these is
about 84Z of total base costs.  Projected data for LHDA costs are based on
staffing levels and training costs agreed with the JPTC.  Estimates for the
hydropower component, including related supervision elements, are based on the
design engineer's  estimates.   Estimates  for environmental protection and
compensation, studies, and GOL representation costs at the JPTC are based on
LHDA's estimates reviewed by an international panel of experts, JPTC and the
appraisal mission. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 15Z for the
civil works, except in the case of the infrastructure contracts where historical
expenditures were available. The physical contingency for the civil works is
considered ressonable. The geological investigations and design work have been
carried out by competent and experienced consultants from Europe and RSA. The
detailed construction designs and construction supervision will be undertaken by
the same firms, with the addition of Lahmeyer International GmbH (Germany) and
Mott MacDonald International Limited (U.R.) who executed the feasibility study.
An expert panel financed by the Bank has reviewed the designs and the proposed
construction methodologies and will continue to do so periodically during
implementation. Moreover, the dam at Katse and the transfer tunnel consultants
have an expert panel of their own performing similar functions.   Physical
contingencies for non-construction items were estimated at 102.
4.14        The base cost estimates are in March 1990.  Price contingencies have
been calculated on the basis of forecast inflation rates for the major supplier
currencies (US$, DM, FP, P Sterling, Lira and Loti) as provided by the harton
Econometric Forecasting Association (VEFA) who were engaged by LEDA for this
purpose. The conversion into Loti and dollars for cost estimate purposes was
carried out using exchange rates also projected by VEFA. Non-construction items
have been escalated by 6Z p.a. for non-CMA expenditures and 15Z p.a. for CMA
expenditures. The exchange rate of Loti to the US$ was assumed to bet
March          1991  1992  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997
HalotiIUS$l    2.60  2.81  3.12  3.41  3.73  4.08  4.57
For those costs that represent already incurred expenditures for infrastructure
and access roads, no allowance for price contingencies have been included.
4.15           The foreign man-month costs for construction supervision and LHDA
technical assistance are estimated at US$15,100 and US$26,200 equivalent,
respectively, reflecting the skill mix needed for the implementation phase.
E. Financing Plan
4.16           The table below shows the financing plan for the project,
including the hydropower component for which a firm financing plan is yet to be
finalized.   The financing for most items pertaining to the water transfer
component has virtually been secured; that of the hydropower component is based
on the interest expressed by the various multi- and bilateral donors to GOL and
the Bank.

4.17        The funding arrangements for the vater transfer and the hydropower
components are different. The water transfer component is financed entirely by
funds raised by LEDA with debt servicing guaranteed by RSA (Article 10 of the
treaty). Any water transfer-related financing provided on concessional terms
would be repaid by the RSA on IBID terms in accordance with the provisions of the
treaty (Article 11, Section 1 of the Treaty), with any difference - or spread  -
accruing to GOL.  The hydropower component is expected to be financed by
bilateral and multilateral concessional credits and grants to LHDAIGOL and any
resulting debt service would have to be serviced by Lesotho. The EDF, EIB and
the AfDB are assisting LEDA In coordinating the financing for this component.



- 37 -
(a)    Financing Stratepy for the Water Transfer Component
4.18        Chartered WestLB (CWl), formerly Standard Chartered Merchant Bank
(SCNB) of London, was retained under Credit 1747-LSO to assist LHDA in raising
the financing for the water transfer component. The strategy for raising the
offshore component of the financing rested on four principal elementss (i) to
maximize the international financing of the civil works through funding raised
by contractorsisuppliers in the form of export credits and associated commercial
loans; (Li) pari-passu debt servicing arrangements for all offshore lenders,
including IBRDs (iii) IBRD participation In the financing up to US$110 million;
and (iv) securing the remaining financing from onshore sources, including the
DBSA and commercial banks in Lesotho and RSA.
4.19        In implementing the strategy, export credits on OECD Category III
consensus terms or, preferably, 'mixed' credits containing bilateral concessional
financing were sought to cover about 85$ of the foreign exchange cost.
Additional finance amounting to at least 152 of the remaining foreign exchange
cost was sought from offshore comercial lenders with an interest in
participating in the officially-supported export credits and in support of client
contractors. After start of tendering, commrcial banks in esch export credit
agency (IECA) country, at the tenderers' request, started putting together the
credits and related commercial financing in support of the bids.   Foreign
financing in excess of direct foreign exchage costs was encouraged in line with
LRDA's objective of maximizing foreign financing, through the award of bonus
points to those bids that provided untied foreign exchange above the estimated
foreign exchange requirements.  The particLpation of the ECAs of the major
European countries, US, Japan, Taiwan and the ISA in the tendering process
enhanced competition.
4.20        This strategy proved successful with the receipt of bids from seven
joint  ventures   comprised   of  45  major  contractors   from   12  major
exporting countries, including Belgium, France, Germany, Italy. Japan,
Netherlands, Taiwan, U.K. and U.S.A. which were supported by offers of
significant export credits and commercial loans.
4.21        Evaluation of the tenders on the basis of cost, amount of financing
and terms resulted in contract awards for the dam at Katse to the Highlands Water
Venture-Dam joint venture consisting of Impregilo Spa. of Italy, Sochtief of
Germany, Bouygues of France, Concor and Group Five of RSA, and Kier and Stirling
of UK, and for the transfer and delivery tunnels to the Lesotho Highlands Project
Contracts joint venture, consLsting of Spie latigpolles of France, LTA of RSA,
Compenon Bernard of France, Zueblin of Germany and Balfour Beatty of U.K.. The
offshore financing associated with these contracts amounts to the equivalent of
US$508 million equivalent which are being made available in the amount of US$411
million equivalent as export credits, US$67 million equivalent as commercial
credits, and US$30 million equivalent from the Commornwealth Development
Corporation (CDC). Annex 4-4 presents a listing of leaders, amounts being lent
and the tenmo and conditions.
4.22        To complement the offshore lending, L8DA developed a strategy for
obtaining the on-shore financing from sources within Lesotho and RSA. Beginning
in 1988, lt obtained various long-term loans presently amounting to R554 million
from DBSA, with debt servicing to be met by RSA, for the financing of the advance
infrastructure required to provide access to the project sites. In early 1990,
It raised 1133 sllion (US$52.1 million equivalent) with the guarantee of the RSA



- 38 -
goverrment, out of which R107.5 million (US$42 million equivalent) were utilized
to cover its running costs, down payments for the engineering services and start-
up of the environmental and compensation components. Subsequently in mid-1990,
in order to keep construction on schedule, LHDA again raised R750 million
equivalent (US$ 289.6 million equivalent) out of which about R456.6 million
(US$176.3 million equivalent) would be used to cover the mobilization and
downpayment costs of the water transfer civil works contracts, the down payment
of the supervision consultants and the fees and commitment commissions on
offshore loans tied to the civil works contracts. The South African Reserve Bank
(SARB) provided guarantee for foreign exchange conversion to cover the foreign
cost elements in these payments. The above financing, except the DBSA loans, are
due for redemption by December 1991 when the entire financing package would have
become effective.
4.23        Finally, in December 1990 LHDA began the process of raising the long-
term onshore financing for the project. The total of this final phase of onshore
financing is R4.1 billion (US$1,583 million equivalent).   Proceeds of this
financing would be used to repay the financing referred to in para. 4.22 which
would be due in December 1991, except for those foreign exchange portions that
would be retroactively financed from the proposed IBRD loan and from the offshore
export credits and commercial bank loans. It would also finance debt service due
to DBSA to December 1991, and provide all financing needed throughout the
construction period over and above the offshore funds. The principal sources of
this financing are the RSA export credit agency (R1.5 billion - US$579 million
equivalent), and the RSA capital market (R2.6 billion - US$1,004 million
equivalent) in the form of money market instruments and long-term bonds
guaranteed by the RSA with the RSA Ministers of Water Affairs and Finance as
joint signatories. Whilst R1.3 billion (US$502 tillion equivalent) were raised
by LHDA directly to cover project expenditures, the additional R1.3 billion
(US$502 million) for debt service payments will be made available by TCTA which
has obtained an undertaking from the Public Investment Commissioners (PIC), the
RSA pension fund investment agency. Annex 4-5 shows the utilization of this
funding within the financing plan. Notification from the Trustee, that he has
received notifications certifying satisfaction of all initial documentary
conditions precedent to the agreements for the financing for the proposed
project, other than the funds being secured by TCTA will be a condition of IBRD
effectiveness.
4.24        In addition to the above, an amount of US$100 million equivalent in
Rand would be made available to LEDA by TCTA as cost-related payments at the time
of utilization. This amount represents a loan raised by TCTA with an original
lender (Citibank of the U.S.) whose funds were frozen under the interim agreement
of the RSA with its foreign lenders.51 This interim agreement provides that
original short term funds which were repaid in Rand and frozen in the RSA with
the PIC can be taken out of those arrangements and repaid to the foreign lender
if the latter enters into a new loan agreement with a repayment period of at
least ten years. The debt service obligation would stay with TCTA and not be
passed on to LEDA as TCTA would eventually have to meet those obligations. TCTA
has secured the PIC funds through a tripartite agreement between Citibank, N.A..
the Public Investment Commissioners and TCTA. A copy of the loan agreement is
available in Project Files.
SI     See par&. 8.03 for detailed discussion of the Interim Agreement.

(b)    Financing of the HYdrovower Component
4.25        Official concessional financing of about US$220 million for the cost
of the hydropower component is being sought by GOL . Discussions are underway
with the EDF, EIB, AfDB and other multi- and bilateral financing agencies for
mobilizing the necessary finance, and a first donors" conference to facilitate
this took place between February 27 and March 1, 1989. A follow-up meeting
attended by representatives from the Bank, the EEC, EIB and AfDB took place in
Brussels on August 30, 1990.
4.26        Several donor agencies have indicated their interest in financing
the hydropower component of the project.  While the EDF, SIB and AfDB have
expressed readiness to consider funding favorably, Norway, Finland, the Nordic
Development Fund and the Arab Development Fund are reviewing GOL requests for
funding and more recently the aid agencies of the UK, France, Japan and Taiwan
have indicated their willingness to consider providing financing.
4.27        A  financial advisor,  funded by the EEC,  is assisting in the
coordination of the financing of the hydropower component.
4.28        The relatively small costs for LHDA administration, environmett and
compensation associated with the hydropower component are expected to be financed
by the donors for that component or by COL. In line with LHDA's past practice,
the exact split of administration costs between water transfer and hydropower
components is agreed by the JPTC at the end of each fiscal year. It is estimated
that the water transfer would account for 902 of these costs with the remaining
1o0 to be covered under the hydropower component.
(c)  COL's Contribution
4.29        The size of the GOL contribution would depend largely on the success
of its efforts to secure financing for the hydropower component, the technical
assistance to the GOL/JPTC delegation and the implementation of the environmental
action and the rural development plan. Overall financing contribution required
from GOL ls estimated as follows:

Total GOL Contribution                                         &L.
Over the last three years ED? has financed technical assistance to the GOL
delegation to the JPTC.  The Lome IV consultations between GOL and the EEC
resulted in the signing of the national indicative program in Maseru in February
1991 under which financing of the GOLIJPTC costs will continue. ODA has also
agreed to finance an alternate to the GOL/JPTC delegate (with specialization in
contract management).  Germany, through its GTZ, is expected to finance another
alternate (with specialization in environment) initially for 3 years at about
US$0.6 million equivalent. GOL is finalizing funding from DBSA of 121 million
for the maintenance of roads in the project areas.
4.30        As the financing plan for the hydropower component is yet to be
finalized, GOL confirmed during negotiations that it will make available funds
to cover its share of all items outside of the hydropower component and the
technical assistance to the GOL JPTC delegation, namely (i) the cost of the 6OL
JPTC delegation including its share of the cost of the JPTC secretariat, (ii)
project related border crossing facilities and the expenditures of road
maintenance in the project area not covered by borrowings, (ii) its share of
environment, compensation, and rural development costs, in accordance with the
provisions of the Environmental Action Plan, in the event that this funding
cannot be secured from other sources and (iv) its share of LHDA administrative
cost.
(d) IBRD Loan
4.31        The proposed IBRD loan of US$110 mlllion would finance construction
supervlslon, detailed design work, and technical assistance to LHDA, as well as
technical assistance for the Implementation of the environmental action plan, the
compensation plan and the rural development plan. Other financing that would be
associated with the components being financed by the IBRD loan are: (i) ODA of
the U.K. would finance the technical assistance for LHDA's financial and
accounting operations for FY90/91 and 91/92, in the amount of US$1.3 million
equivalent; (11) UNDP would continue to provide technical assistance for
environment and hydrology, in an amount of about US$0.25 million equivalent;
(lii) Overseas Development Aid of Ireland would provide technical assistance to
LHDA for internal auditing and manpower development during RY 90191 and 91/92 in
the order of about US$0.4 million equivalent; and (iv) German bilateral
assistance would continue to provide two experts under arrangements with CIM for
three more years, estimated at US$0.2 million equivalent. The IBRD loan would
be made to LEDA with the guarantee of the GOL. Under the terms of the treaty RSA
6/   for which donors have not yet been identified.

will be servicing the loan via the Trust Instrument and the Deed of Undertaking
to be governed by U.K. law and in which the Bank will participate pari passu with
the other offshore lenders (paras. 5.05 - 5.13). It will be a condition of loan
effectiveness that the two instruments have been executed by all parties. LWHDA
will pay to GOL a guarantee fee equivalent to 101 mark-up on the IBiD interest
rate.
F.    Implementation and Proiect Monitoring
4.32        Annex 4-6 presents the project implementation schedule.  Contract
award for the civil works of the water transfer component was finalized in
December 1990. Construction activities on the Rstse dam and the transfer tunnel
started in January 1991.  Katse dam is expected to be completed in October 1996,
although reservoir filling would have begun in September 1994. The transfer
tunnel is scheduled for completion in 1996. The latest element of the hydropower
is slated for completion in September 1996. The delivery tunnel In Lesotho would
be ready by late 1996.   The delivery tunnel construction in RSA should be
completed by July 1996. Commissioning activities would start in April 1996 and
be completed in late December 1996.   Although the treaty stipulates water
transfers to begin in 1995, agreement was reached by the JPTC that water
deliveries may be delayed up to 1996, and that the water quantities for that year
may be increased to include the '1995 water', if impounding were to begin in
1994.  This delay would not adversely affect the amount of royalties to be
received by Lesotho, although the receipt of 1995 royalties would be delayed by
one year.
4.33        An additional difficulty arises from the ongoing infrastructure
facility that will continue into 1991. Temporary road access is being provided
via diversions, with full permanent access provided at varying dates during 1991.
Construction power should become available to construction sites at varying dates
in 1991, and the contractors will provide their initial power requirements by
diesel generation, which in any event would be required for standby.
Construction communications is planned for completion within the second semester
of 1991.   These matters were advised in the tender documents so that the
contractors could take them into account in their programs, and the contractors
have since confirmed that the status of completion of the infrastructure is
satisfactory.
4.34        In any lengthy construction period the risk of delay is considerable.
This is particularly so when dealing with substantial underground works in
distant and mountainous terrain in a developing country with limited
institutional and physical infrastructure. The quality of the engineering in
preparing the project has been high and the supervising consultants and the
contractors are appropriately experienced. The experience on the infrastructure
component is that the works have started later and taken longer - and cost more -
than planned. This experience was taken into consideration by the mission in
assessing the adequacy of price and physical contingencies for the components to
be financed under the proposed project.
4.35        LEDA, as borrower and the agency responsible for implementation of
the major components of the project, will continue the present coordination,
supervision and monitoring of consultants and contracts, and will prepare such
reports on implementation as are required by the participants in the financing.
LIDA will also be responsible for the preparation and processing of withdrawal
applications. The supervision of the civil works will be carried out by



_ 42 -
experienced consultants, and LUDA will be strengthened by a technical assistance
team to oversee the consultants' work. The project should be completed by
September 1997. Nevertheless, the executing ability of LUDA will be severely
tested and evidences of strains are apparent.   The appointment of three
expatriate deputy chief executives and the restructuring of LaDm management for
the construction phase (paras. 2.03 and 2.04) are intended to address these
problems.
4.36        LHDA will continue to prepare monthly progress reports covering
physical   vorks,   performance   of   consultants,   costs,   disbursements,
environmentallcompensation/rural development aspects, personnel training and
administration. The format of this report was established during the engineering
project phase and found acceptable, and was modified for new activities during
the construction phase.   The format was reviewed during negotiations.   In
addition LHDA will forward to the Bank semi-annual reports covering its budget,
its financial and   operational results and administration and managerial
situation, as well as the environmental aspects of the project. LHDA will also
prepare a Project Completion Report within six months after project completion.
G.    The Jank's Role and Project Sugpervision
4.37        In the early stages of project preparation, GOL explicitly requested
that the Bank be the lead agency in the raising of the massive amounts of funds
required for implementing the project and in helping to guide the complicated and
sensitive negotiations between Lesotho and the RSA.
4.38        That the proposed project has reached its current stage is clear
evidence of the Bank having successfully fulfilled this role to date. Staff and
other costs to the Bank have however been high, in absolute terms, but no
previous Bank financed project in Africa, and few elsewhere, have presented the
same combined technical, financial, institutional and, above all, political
complexities and sensitivities.
4.39        The appraisal presents the great achievements of the preparatory
period in the technical, financial, political and, perhaps most important, the
institutional area. Taking into account the magnitude and complexities of the
project, the experience of OED evaluations of large dams and the positive results
of intensive supervision during the engineering phase, the minimum requirements
of staffweeks estimated for supervision to cover all the major facets of the
project during the construction phase is as follow8s

At the recomendation of OED, the above supervision otaffweeks includes six (6)

4.41         The construction of the water transfer component will be implemented
through three major contracts (Katse dam, transfer tunnel and the delivery tunnel
in Lesotho).   LHU   did not pre-qualify  tenderers  for the water transfer
component, but established criteria in the tender documents which tenderers had
to meet in order for their tenders to be considered.



_ 44 -
4.42        Procurement arrangements for the services which would be financed by
the IUID loan, largely consultant services and technical assistance, are in
compliance vith Bank guidelines. At the request of LHDA, the Bank agreed, in
accordance with its guidelines, to the continuation of the consultants who
provided design services for the Katse dam and the transfer tunnel, and
engineering  technical assistance  to LEDA  under Credit  1747-LSO.   These
consultants, the design joint venture of SOGREAH, Sir Alexander Gibb, Coyne &
Bellier, and the technical assistance consultants, ACRES of Canada, had been
selected following the Bank's guidelines under Credit 1747-LSO and have performed
satisfactorily to date.   The joint venture will now provide construction
supervision services for the Katse dam and the transfer tunnel and ACRES will
continue to provide engineering support to LHDA.  The consultants for the
construction supervision of the delivery tunnel in Lesotho (Lahmeyer/McDonald)
were selected in accordance with Bank guidelines on the basis of competitive
proposals amongst shortlisted firms, to which the lank concurred. Each of the
consultant groups for the detailed design and the construction supervision have
formed a joint venture with South African consultants that provides for a 502
sharing of the services in line with provisions of the treaty. The South African
consultants were nominated by RSA's DWA and are experienced and have performed
well in the design stage. Proceeds of the proposed loan would however only
finance the services of the consultants selected and appointed in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines.
4.43        The advanced infrastructure elements for access roads, construction
villages, power supply, and the like were all awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding to the lowest evaluated bidder on a cash basis. They were financed by
loans from DBSA and grants from France. The consultants were selected on the
basis of regional competitive proposals and have been generally satisfactory.
4.44        Separate procurement arrangements will be followed for the hydropower
component using the procurement procedures of the contributing donors.
Invitations to tender are presently scheduled to be issued by LHDA in April 1992.
These tenders will exclude those hydropower component elements that have to be
constructed at the same time as construction of the water transfer component, in
order to permit the transfer of water in case of delay or cancellation of
implementation of the hydropower component. This was arranged by including in
the tender for the water transfer component the agreed necessary balancing
elements (about US$3 million equivalent) between the water transfer and
hydropower components such as the larger diameter of the transfer tunnel to
maxitsze the energy output and the provision of a bypass facility.   Under
Protocol III (para. 1.45) to the treaty, GOL agreed to meet the cost
responsibility of these balancing elements as fianmcing thereof is part of the
water transfer financing package which will be serviced and guaranteed by the
RSA.

(2)   Training                      US$  0.40 million  1002 of foreign
exchange
(3)   Repayment of IDA PPF Advances USS   .75 million Amount due
(4)   Unallocated                   USS 29.55 million
10S     0 mill"on
4.45         In order to expedite disbursement a special account of US$4.0
million representing an average of three months expenditures would be established
on terms and conditions satisfactory to IBRD. All IBRD eligible expenditures
would be financed from the special account unless otherwise previously agreed to
by IBRD. Withdrawal applications for replenishment of the special account would
have a minim=m value of US$100,000 equivalent. Payments from the special account
would be made on the basis of certificates of expenditures signed by authorized
representatives. The annual audit (para. 2.15) would also cover the operation
of the special account.   To allow sufficient tim  for submission of final
invoices, a closing date of March 31, 1998 lo proposed.
4.46         Proceeds from the IBRD loan could only be used to finance those
components of the project that will be ultimately supported by cost related
payments from the RSA for the debt service payments. It is, therefore, essential
that disbursements from the IBRD loan are recognized by the JPTC as expenditures
eligible for repayment by the RSA. Agreement was, therefore, reached with LHDA
during negotiations that it will utilize proceeds from the proposed loan only for
those contracts that have been formally approved by the JPTC.
J.    Disbursement Profiles
4.47         Annex 4-8 presents the proposed disbursement schedule for the Bank
loan. Proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed over a seven-year period.
Disbursement profiles for similar projects In the Bank were used in arriving at
the forecast disbursement levels. Whilst the overall time period is close to the
disbursement  profiles,  annual  disbursement  percentages  were  modifLed,
particularly in the earlier years. This modification is based on the advanced
stage of project readiness with award of major consultants' contracts in late
1990, requiring sizeable downpayments.
K.    Retroactive Financing
4.48         Retroactive financing in an amount of up to US$11 million is
proposed for expenditures incurred between appralsal and signing of the loan.
The amounts of retroactive financing for these contracts ares US$2.5 million for
technieal assistance engineering, US$4.8 million for detailed design and
construction supervision of the dam at Katse and the transfer and delivery
tunnel, and US$3.7 amllion for technical assistance to TSDA for tender
evaluation, legal advice and project management. Payments for these services
have already been made by LEDA from bridge financing obtained in 1990 from South
Afrlcan banks (para. 4.22), the foreLgn exchange elements for which SARB



- 46 -
guaranteed. Bank disbursement for the retroactive financing will therefore be
made against eligible expenditures of the relevant portion of the bridge loan.
V. FINANCE
A.       Past. Present and Future Financial Positions of LUDA
5.01         LHDA's financial position is, and will be, marked by a considerable
build-up of debt to finance project expenditures. To date, all LHDA's
expenditures have been financed by loans, concessional credits and grants from
the donor comunity, DBSA and the South African capital market and by direct
contributions from GOL and the RSA's DMA. No debt service payments have yet been
made since the loans and credits were designed to provide grace periods and
capitalization of interest for the time needed to set up the LEDA, carry out the
construction of the advanced infrastructure elements, and put in place the
financing of the water transfer physical works.
5.02         Debt incurred for the project's water transfer component would be
serviced and ultimately repaid by the RSA in accordance with the treaty. Trust
account arrangements for the offshore financing and a direct RSA guarantee for
the CMA financing have been agreed on as the vehicle for transferring the
responsibility for all water transfer related costs from the LHDA to the RSA.
The revenues Lesotho would receive as a result of delivering water to the RSA
would not accrue to LUDA, but to GOL directly. Therefore, the four revenue flows
that would be generated 7/ would not affect LHDA's filancial position and would
not be used to pay for LHDA's expenditures or debt service payments.   The
stability of LHDA's financial position would therefore depend solely on the
reliability of the trust account arrangements (described in Section B of this
chapter). The risk of RSA defaulting on payments is judged to be greatly reduced
by the fact that all lenders would share any shortfall in payments pari passu.
This implies that the RSA, in case of default, would be barred from future
lending from the creditors providing financing for the project, and would further
have to face the contaminating effect of such a default on its access to other
offshore lending sources.
5.03         The  impact of expenditures  and revenues  associated with the
project's hydropower component on LIDA's financial position is still difficult
to assess for two reasons. First, the financing plan for this component has not
yet been finalized.   The future debt service payments associated with the
hydropower component can therefore not be accurately calculated. Second, GOL has
still to take a number of decisions related to the financial temss and
responsibilities associated with this project component. These include (i) the
onlending terms for the (grant and concessional) financing, (ii) if the debt
service responsibility should fall on LHDA or on LEC, and (iii) if the power
should be sold from LHDA to LEC, or if LHDA should operate the 'Muela plant on
a cost-reimbursed basis. These issues, and the agreed way to resolve them, are
described in Section C of this chapter.
7/ Revenues would comprise (i) royalty payments for the transferred water,
(ii) Increased SACU revenues caused by project related imports, (iii) increased
tax revenues for GOL, and (iv) the spread between the concessional financing
Lesotho has made available and the associated debt service payments from RSA on
IBED terms. These revenues are described in Chapter VII.



- 47 -
B.       Trust Arrangements for *be Water Transfer Comonent
5.04         The treaty requires the USA to meet all costs related to the water
transfer component and, if required by lenders, to provide guarantees for all
loans and credit facilities for that component. As a consequence funding and
debt servicing arrangements have been organized on an "enclave" basis.  One
concern that this addresses is that due to political sensitivities lenders
outside the COA may not wish to receive direct guarantees for RSA.
5.05         To ensure that debt service payments for offshore lenders are met
in a timely manner and to provide some comfort for lenders who might otherwise
be reluctant to assist in the financing, the Bank has agreed to the establishment
of a trust in which it will participate on a pari passu basis.   The trust
arrangements have been discussed by the Bank, the offshore lenders, LEDA and RSA
representatives, and would be established in the United lingdom and governed by
English law. The Trustees' duties and rights will be governed by the terms of
a Trust Instrument. RSA's obligation to service the debt will be reflected in
a Deed of Undertaking between RSA and the trustee.   Under this Deed of
Undertaking, RSA irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes with the Trustee to
make payment to or to the order of the trustee of amounts due as water transfer
cost related payments. RSA will accept the application of English law and also
the jurisdiction of the English Courts, should any dispute arise with regard to
the enforcement of any rights under this agreement.
5.06         The Trust Instrument will be entered into between LEDA, the Bank,
the other offshore lenders, and the Trustee. The agreement envisages that other
lenders may join the trust from time to time and procedures will be in place to
allow for this to take place.  This involves the Trustee designating in a
Designating Instrument any principal indebtedness of LHDA as Designated Debt,
under the conditions prescribed in the agreement.  The Trust Instrument would
operate as a Designating Instrument with regard to the loans of the lenders who
are parties to the Trust Instrument. Signing of the Trust Instrument and the
Deed of Undertaking would be a condition to declare the proposed loan effective.
5.07         The Trust Instrument provides that the Trustee shall hold the trust
property for the beneficiaries. Such beneficiaries are defined in the agreement
as the creditors and representatives.  Creditors are further defined as the
original creditors under the Trust Instrument and such other persons described
as creditors in a Designating Instrument, while representatives are defined, in
relation to any part of the designated debt, as the person named in the
Designating Instrument as the representative, for the time being, of the
creditors of such Designated Debt. Trust Property is defined as the rights of
the Trustee; ti) to receive payments from RSA under the terms of the Deed of
Undertakings (ii) the amount for the time being standing to the credit of the
Designated Accounts, (banking accounts maintained by the Trustee for purposes of
the Trust); and (iii) all other security, property and rights that may be vested
in the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Instrument.
5.08         The Trust Instrument further provides that certain decisions can
only be taken by all the representatives. These include actions related tot (i)
releasing or discharging RSA from any liability under the Deed of Undertaking;
(ii) agreeing to any postponement of the due date for payment of any amount due
from RSA; and (iii) agreeing to any change in the currency/currencies in which
any payment from RSA is to be paid.



- 48 -
5.09         The agreement further states that after a payment default notice
has been served on RSA, the Trustee must take action to enforce the obligations
of RSA if so Instructed by any lndlvidual creditor.
5.10         If a default occurs, and after following the procedures outlined
In the Trust Instrument, any funds received by the Trustee would be shared pari-
passu among the beneficiaries in the proportion that such obligations then due
to such beneficiary bears to the total such obligations then due to all the
beneficiaries.
5.11         The provisions relating to the sharing of amounts received by any
beneficiary pari passu with the other beneficiaries do not apply to any amount
that the Bank may receive from GOL under the Guarantee Agrement. However, in
the event that IBRD would receive any payment under this guarantee, the Trust
Instrument provides that future payments under the Trust would be made to the
other creditors only, until their debt has been repaid up to the same proportion
as the IBED loan.
C.    Financing of the Hydropower Component
5.12         Implementation  of  the  project's  hydropower  component  will
significantly change the scope and allocation of the operational and financial
responsibilities in Lesotho's power sector. The present system, which is based
on supply of imported power and no debt associated with power generation, will
change to a system with its own generation capacity and associated debt. An
operational and financial framework would have to be put in place that would
maximize the cost savings from avoiding Imported electricity while ensuring
economic efficiency and financial viability of the agencies in the sector.
5.13        LTDA would, therefore, bave to carry out a study to address
operational and financial issues related to the operation of the '9uela plant
including the means to recover fully the cost from power consumers. This study
would have to be executed before interested donors finalize their financing for
the hydropower component so that their various conditlons in their operations
would reflect the outcome of this study. Therefore agreement was reached at
negotiations with LHDA thats (i) it will carry out a study to address the
operational and financial issues related to the hydropower component Including
the preparation of a financing plan by June 30, 1992, (ii) that it will make this
study available to the Bank for its review and comments, and (iii) that the
agreed recommendations in relation to the operating and financial issues
including level of tariffs and financing will be implemented following this
review.
5.14         Issues to be addressed in the study includes
Mi) Operational control of the water flows. As LTDA is charged with
the responsibility to deliver the agreed water deliveries to the RSA,
it is envisaged that LUDA would retain control of the size and
distribution of the water flows. The study should examine Ways in
which LUDA would accommodate LEC's requests for bulk electricity while
complying with the treaty obligations. A forum may have to be created
where LEC and LUDA can review LEC's power needs from time to time.



_ 49 -
(i1) Onlending terms of the grant/concessional financins. Financing
for the hydropower component would be passed on from 6OL to either LHDA
or LEC. The terms on which this is done would be reflected In the
tariffs LEC charges its customers. Preliminary financial calculations
indicate that passing on of all concessionality would allow LEC to
charge lower tariffs than if it continued to buy power from ESXOM.
Passing on the full funding on comemrcial terms, oan the other hand,
would result in LEC having to charge much higher tariffs than if it
continued to purchase from ESKOM.  The study should examine what
onlending terms should be applied, i.e. what portion of the
concessionality should be passed on to the electricity consumers. The
terms should be set so as to mlnimise the economic efficiency losses
while   safeguarding the financial viability of the organizations
concerned.
(iii) Incidence of the financial burden of sayint the debt service
including the foreign exchange risk of the proiect's hydronower
comlxment.   This burden would ultlmately  be passed on  to the
electricity consumers in Lesotho. The study should therefore consider
the possibility of allocating the responsibility for debt service
payments to the LEC, and that the 'kuela plant is included in LEC's
asset base when tariffs are calculated. This would also provide LEC
with an incentive to maximize the use of power from 'Muela as marginal
costs for buying from ESXOM would be much higher.
(iv) Payment of operation and maintenance costs. These costs would be
incurred by the LEDA, and could be recovered from LEC either by LEC
reimbursing LHDA or by LEDA selling bulk power to the LEC. Since LHDA
is not a revenue earning entity, it should be examined if LEC could
reimburse LHDA for costs incurred, in order not to drastically change
the existing character of LHDA. Terms of reference of this study are
included in Annex 5.
5.15         Only when the issues above have been resolved and a financing plan
has been finalized will it be possible to forecast with a degree of reasonable
certainty LHDA'1s financial position with regard to this component. As mentioned
In Section III, any projection of LEC's financial position would also depend on
the manner In which these issues are addressed. LHDA's commitment to forward to
the Bank for review and comment the aforementioned study on operational and
financial issues of the hydropower component would at the time of the review
allow an assessment of LIDA's future overall financial position and ea agreement
on financial performance targets. Agreement was therefore reached with LERA at
negotiations that following the review of the hydropower operational and
financing study it will agree with the Bank on a set of financial performance
targets that will be met.
VI. 9NVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. COMPENSATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
A.   Introduction
6.01         Annex 6-1 provides a detailed discussion of the environmental
impact, compensation and resettlement. An environmental action program has been



- so -
prepared by LEDA.   It comprises three parts:  (J) a natural environment and
heritage plan, (ii) a compensation plan and (iii) a rural development plan. GOL
has adopted a compensation policy and enacted the relevant regulations, and has
approved the Phase 1A Scheme as provided under the Order establishing LHUDA. LHDA
has completed the preparation of its action plans in accordance with financing
agreements reached by the JPTC. With the amendment to the LHDA order empowering
LHDA to acquire land for the project, these regulations and the scheme meet
existing Bank guidelines. JPTC has agreed on the scope and content of the plans
and on cost allocation, as well as on LEDA's Environment Division staffing,
training and technical assistance and on the finance proposals for compensation.
6.02         The environmental action program for Phase IA is expected to serve
as a pilot for many of the measures included in a National Environmental Action
Plan which is currently being implemented by the Ministry of Planning with Bank
and donor support.
B.    Natural Environment and Heritage Plan
6.03         The project affects two principal areass the Ratse reservoir local
catcbment and the 'Muela area where the hydropower works and tailpond will be
located. Localized impacts will also occur along access roads and tunnel routes.
To deal with expected environmental impacts,  LUDA's Environment Division,
together with consultants, has prepared a plan with six main components:
(1) biological monitoring, including vector biology, aquatic weeds, fisheries,
and conservation of biological diversity; (2) monitoring of the effects of
compensation flows on rivers, ecological and limnological studies of the
reservoir; (3) public health, including baseline surveys, monitoring and
provisions for health care of the construction work force; (4) cultural heritage,
Including preservation, restoration, and enhancement of archeological and
historic resources in the project area; (5) paleontology, including continuous
monitoring of excavations and salvage of any valuable fossil material identified;
and (6) pilot watershed management, including soil surveys, water quality
monitoring, sedimentation studies and land reclamation studies. Implementation
of the plan and preparation of Phase 11 environmental studies will be supported
by a geographical information system (GIS) to be developed for the project area
as a basis for watershed management and local land use planning. The Environment
Division, with the experience gained in monitoring the environmental impact of
construction activities during the construction of access roads, assisted LHDA's
technical division in preparing contract specifications and evaluation of tenders
that  incorporated measures  for environmental  safeguards.   Monitoring the
environmental impact of construction activities will be a continuing concern
during the Phase 1k project. In addition, the Environment Division, together
with LHDA's public relations division, has prepared plans to carry out an
environmental awareness program for construction workers and people in the
project area.
C.    Compensation Plan
6.04         Present estimates indicate that the Katse reservoir, following
project implementation, will flood about 656 ha of arable land and about 3,110
ha of grazing land. The population to be affected in the Katse area, on the
basis of a detailed survey, is estimted at about 1,350 households, 58 of whom

would actually lose their dwellings. All of the households would lose access to
grazing land, and about 372 or 1,250 households would lose arable land. The
project affected population in the 'Muela area is estimated at 260 households.
At 'Muela, site works will consume another 30 ha of arable land and the tailpond
will flood another 10 ha of arable land and 26 ha of grazing land. Ten homes in
the 'Muela area will be lost and therefore have to be replaced. Finally, the
construction of the access roads, construction of power lines and the delivery
tunnel in Lesotho will require the replacement of 104 additional homes and will
take 468 ha of arable land.
6.05         In an effort to draw up a compensation policy in line with the
needs and expectations of the affected population, a compensation cam'ittee was
established and meetings were conducted with local chiefs and project area
residents. Based on the results, LHDA has formulated a compensation policy which
is designed to ensure an augmented income stream over the life of the project and
to replace lost food crop and fodder production with food and fodder rather than
cash. As arable land is a scarce commodLty in Lesotho and much of it is of poor
quality due to soil degradation, erosion and uncertain climatic conditions, it
will not be possible to replace the lost arable land with land of the same value.
Therefore, households losing arable land will receive the equivalent volume of
food crops and grain for 15 years to replace the loss of crops. Fodder will be
provided to local grazing associations for 5 years to replace lost fodder
production on grazing lands.   Also, homes will be replaced with new homes
(including garden plots) constructed within the same comuunity. Compensation
payments will be made directly to affected families rather than to absent male
heads of household. RSA will discharge its future compensation obligations for
grain and fodder by capitalizing the future value of grain payments after year
15 and fodder payments after year 5 discounted at 62. This capitalization is
currently estimatel at M 10.3 million in 1990 base costs.  This capitalized
amount which would be adjusted for inflation would finance rural development
programs beyond those foreseen in the agreed Eavironmental Action Plan.
6.06         In addition to direct compensation for loss of assets and loss of
income the compensation plan includes provisions for transport improvements to
.eplace access lost as a result of the Katse reservoir. Regulations to implement
the compensation policy were gazetted prior to project appraisal. The appeals
process foreseen in these regulations has been amended by establishing the
Lesotho High Court as the final appeal authority instead of the Minister of
LHW & EA as originally proposed.
D.    Rural Development Plan
6.07         Land in the project area is mainly grazing land and is already
seriously degraded.   Traditional farming systems are therefore no longer
economically sustainable in the project area and most households survive on a
combination of wage earnings, remittances, and support from non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). The project offers an opportunity to improve rural welfare
in the project area through the implementation of a comprehensive rural
development plan. The plan includes action in the areas of range management,
agriculture, forestry, fishing, tourism, and rural infrastructure. The plan will
provide improved employment opportunities to project area residents through skill
training.   It also provides for improved land management and control of



- S2 .
overgrazing by supporting a process of collective decision raaking at the
coumunity level, and for a program to promote environmental awareness in the
project area.
6.08         The plan would expand the experience gained in implementation of
the Lesotho Land Management and Conservation Project (Credit 1897-LSO) and would
also help to improve living conditions in the project area by providing
infrastructure such as water supply, schools, health clinics, and feeder roads.
To ensure that funds allocated to all parts of the environmental action plan
under the project are used for the purposes intended, LHDA's annual audit would
include specific statements on the uses of the funds for these activities.
E.    Implementation
6.09         LHDA's Environment Division will have overall responsibility for
ensuring the effective implementation of the environmental action program for
Phase lA. To assist in this activity, the Eavironment Division will be supported
throughout the project period by a technical assistance team consisting of an
environment advisor, a social development advisor, a rural development advisor,
an environmental liaison officer, and a public health advisor. The Natural
Environment and Heritage Plan will be carried out largely by LHDA staff,
supported by short-term consultants and temporary workers. The Compensation Plan
will continue to be administered by LUDA, but food distribution will be delegated
to the GOL Food Management Unit. In response to GOL's desire to integrate the
Rural Development Plan into ongoing national programs, the Rural Development Plan
will be implemented by a combination of government agencies, 1400 and local and
regional contractors. The environmental awareness program will be carried out
by the Environment Division in collaboration with LHDA's Public Relations
Division. LSDA will assure overall coordination of these plans and programs,
will monitor progress in relation to agreed targets, and will prepare annual
reports which will be reviewed by the environmental panel of international
experts.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01         Implementation of the LSWP water transfer component would create
vast inflows of public revenue for GOL. This chapter starts by assessing the
size, composition and management of this revenue and is followed by a description
of additional economic benefits for Lesotho resulting from the construction
activities and other spin-off activities. The rate of return of the water
transfer component is then estimated by comparing project costs with the benefits
created. This is followed by an evaluation of the project's hydropower component
where the savings in imported energy is compared with project costs. Finally
costs and benefits for both project components are compared, and a rate of return
calculated for the combined project.
A.    The Water Transfer Component
(a)    Project Revenues for Lesotho
7.02         Revenues for GOL would accrue in the form of four flows: ti)
royalty payments for the exported water, (ii) payments from the SACU revenue fund

for LSWP Imports, (iii) the spread between the concessionary financing Lesotho
has made available for the construction of the water transfer component and the
debt service payments from the RSA oan 2RD terms, and (iv) increased tax revenues
for GOL as a result of the project activities.

7.03         Implementation of all project phases would yield GOL revenues
starting with M 19 mllion in 1990 and gradually increasing to X 202 million per
year between 2022 add 2044 (in constant 1990 prices). This would correspond to
an average annual revenue of N 167 million (US$64.5 million).
7 04         The importance and magnitude of the GOL revenues are heightened if
they aze c.npared to macro economic entities in the Lesotho economy. Provided all
phases of the LIWV are Implemented, the project revenue would correspond to an
average annual Increase In CDP of 51, an Increase in exports of 23t, and an
increase in govenmnt revenue of 142 between 1991 and 2044.81
8/ Calculations assume a unifots 3Z average growth rate p.a. in the
Lesotho economy without the project. The actual average annual growth
rate between 1980 and 1990 was S.952 with rather high growth rates
occurring during the later half of the decade. The percentage Increase
In GDP, exports and public revenue caused by the project revenue would
be smaller if a higher tha 32 p.s. growth rate occurred In the
economy. SImLlarly a lower than 32 p.a. growth rate would result in
project revenue causing hither percentage increases.

7.05         The  LHWP-revenue  would  be  a  net  benefit  to  Lesotho  since
(i) project costs are ultimately paid for by the RSA, including environmental and
compensation costs associated with water transfer, and because (ii) there is no
opportunity cost associated with the exported water as Lesotho will have ample
water supply after project implementation.
7.06         Royalty payments are by far the largest of the four revenue flows.
Estimates show that they would gradually increase with the water deliveries from
M 66.5 million (US$25.7 million in 1990 prices) in 1997 to H 202 million (US$80.0
million) p.a. between 2021 and 2044. For 1996, the royalty payments would amount
to M 107.1 million in 1990 prices (US$41.3 million) since the water for both 1995
and 1996 would be delivered that year.
7.07         The basis for the royalties is the difference between the present
value of cost of delivering water via the LHWP and the alternative next best OVTS
scheme. Lesotho and the RSA agreed under the treaty that 562 of these savings
will accrue to Lesotho through royalties that will comprise three parts; (i) a
fixed monthly payment reflecting the savings in investment costs; (ii) a cubic
meter payment based on the savings in electricity use; and (iii) a cubic meter
payment based on other savings.
7.08         A model for determining the royalty payments has been agreed in the
treaty. However, final calculations of the payments can only be made once
agreement has been reached on the hydrological data to be used in determining the
layout and the cost of the LHWP in the model that would ultimately deliver 70
m3/s. A final configuration of the LHW with five rather than six dams in the
model would increase the difference in cost between the LHWP and the OVTS and
therefore increase the royalties.
7.09         In accordance with the treaty, Lesotho and the RSA will agree
during the calendar year preceding the first water deliveries on the hydrology
that will determine the level of the royalties. Instruments measuring water
flows have been installed and studies are underway to improve the data base on
which a decision will be reached. Pending agreement, royalty payments have been
calculated on the so-called "interim hydrology", a conservative estimate of
hydrological data.
7.10         The method for determining the royalties is based on the following
two principless
(i) The cost for the actual LHWP will not affect the level or structure
of the royalty payments. The royalty calculations are carried out in



- S5 -
an agreed model, based on a comparison between a configuration of the
LHWP and the OVTS as desigped in 1984 to yield the same volume of
water, i.e. between two hypothetical schemes for which neither costs
nor design changed after 1984; and
(ii) The royalty payments are adjusted for inflation. The fixed monthly
payment and the per cubic meter payment for other savings are linked to
the production price index in the RSA and the cubic meter payment for
savings in electricity used is linked to ESKOM's electricity price.
7.11         Project related imports will increase Lesotho's revenues from the
SACU-revenue fund.  The SACU agreement between Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland,
Namibia and RSA provides for the uniform application of customs and excise duties
throughout the area, and for the pooling and distribution among the members of
the revenues from these duties. The annual LHWP-related SACU revenues (in 1990
prices) will fluctuate considerably over the construction period 1990-2020,
reaching M 132 million (US$51.0 million) during the peak year, with the annual
average between 1990 and 2020 being M 22 million (US$8.5 million). Total SACU
payments are estimated at M 678 million (US$261.8 million).
7.12         Lesotho obtained significant amounts of concessionary financing to
finance project preparation for the water transfer component.   The treaty
provides that such funds are to be repaid to Lesotho by the RSA as loans on IBRD
terms. Applicable terms would be those at the date of signing Protocol IV (para.
1.45). Since Lesotho's debt service obligations of the concessionary financing
will be smaller than the repayments from the RSA, a spread will accrue to the
GOL. Estimates indicate that this would result in revenues for GOL averaging M
5.8 million per year (US$2.2 million) between 1992 and 2004.
7.13         Income tax revenues generated by LHWP would,  like the SACU-
revenues, fluctuate in line with construction activities. Tax revenues have been
estimated (in 1990 prices) to reach M 26 million (US$10.0 million) during the
peak year with the annual average between 1990 and 2020 being M 10 million
(US$3.9 million). Total estimated tax revenues would be M 301 million (US$116.2
million).
7.14         Cancellation of subsequent project phases, which would reduce the
revenue flows, are covered in the treaty. As the parties are committed under the
treaty to go ahead with Phases 1A and 1B, no method was established for
determining the level of the royalties in case only Phase IA is implemented.
Phase 1A contains a substantial number of investments that also will be utilized
during phase 1B (Ratoe dam, the transfer tunnels from Katse to 'Muela, the
delivery tunnel, roads and other infrastructure) which makes it even more
unlikely that RSA would wish to stop LEWP after Phase 1A only.
7.15         Cancellation of LHWP after Phase 1B would result in a reduction of
the royalty payments in line with treaty provisions. Payments would still be made
until year 2044, and the size of the reduction would depend on the reason for
cancellation. If the LEWP is canceled at the request of RSA, the reduction is
smaller than if the cancellation depends on any other reason. If RSA cancels the
project after Phase 1B, the average royalty amount p.a. between 1996 and 2044
would be reduced from M 159 million (US$61.3 million) to 4 118 million (US$45.6
million). However, if the LHWP is canceled after Phase 1B for any other reason,
the average annual royalty payment will be reduced to M 83 million (US$32.0
million).

7.16         Delays in the lmplementation of future phases vould have limited
effect on the royalty payments even if the mounts would have to be recalculated
to fit the revised schedule of water deliveries. For example, a delay in the
implementation of Phase 2 of five years wuld 'freeze* the level of the royalty
payments for five years, after which they would continue to grow taking Into
account the additional water deliveries of Phase 2.

(b)    Development Fund
7.17         During project preparation, it was realized that measures should
be taken to prevent the project revenues from creating distortions in the local
economy that would frustrate the ongoing adjustment efforts and, in the long run,
jeopardize economic growth and optimal resource allocation. Specifically, a
situation should be avoided where the revenues are merged with other 6OL revenues
and used for financing higher levels of public consumption.
7.18         Evidence from other countries suggests that prudent management of
high but temporary revenues from the exploitation of natural resources is needed
to avoid *indirect costs' in the form of slower development of the economy.
Developing oil-producing countries have found it difficult to build a diversified
economLc base for manufactured goods and exports, and industrialized oiligas
producers have seen their manufacturing sectors decline due to cost increases
induced by higher real wage contamination from the oillgas sector. Since success
stories in development usually involve countries which have promoted the traded
sectors of their economies, cost increases for the traded sector could lead to
slower growth for the Lesotho economy. Obviously actions to promote agriculture,
industry and other sectors in the traded part of the economy, i.e., actions that
in any case would be desirable, would become even more pressing as Lesotho starts
enjoying the revenues from the water sales.
7.19         As a means to address these concerns, and in order to use the
revenues to create productive assets from which future generations of Basotho can
derive some benefit, GOL has decided to establish a government-controlled
91   A1al average



- 57 -
development fund. The fund would be the recipient of the royalties and 75? of the
water transfer component related SACU payments. The fund would fianmce, first,
development oriente' programs according to agreed criteria, second, build up a
reserve to be used for financing temporary shortfalls in ¢OL revenue, and third,
achieve a steady stream of investment incme for ¢OL through investments in
Lesotho and abroad.
7.20         The development fund would comprise three accounts. Payments would
initially be allocated to a development account used to finance development
oriented programs. Any excess funds, i.e. funds not requested for expenditures
from the development account, would be transferred into a revenue stabilization
account which would have a ceiling of 502 of total GOL (non-LHWP) annual
revenues. Once this account has reached its ceiling, any remaining funds would
be deposited into a long-term revenue supplementation account used to finance
investments. The yield from the investmeAts would accrue to GOL.
7.21         In order to function independently and effectively, the fund would
be governed by a board and managed by a secretariat. The board would be appointed
by the Minister of Finance and Planning, and be accountable to the GOL through
the minister. It would comprise five members, i.e. the principal secretaries In
the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Finance, the governor of the Central
Bank of Lesotho, one private sector representative and one qualified accountant.
The secretariat would comprise one executlve secretary (as the chief executive),
one development director, and one finance director, plus secretarial and clerical
staff. In addition a development couiittee will initiate and review projects to
be financed by the development account, and an investment committee will be
responsible for the management of the other two accounts.
7.22         An account has been opened and W 5.0 million from the 1991192
budget has been deposited into the fund. All necessary legal and procedural
steps for making the fund operational have been taken, and its board has been
nominated. Annex 7-1 contains a copy of a letter confirming the arrangements for
the development fund addressed by the MlnLster of Finance of Lesotho to the Bank.
7.23         During negotiations, agreement was reached with the government (i)
that it will prior to the beginning of each fiscal year agree with the Bank the
amount of project revenues it Intends to deposit in the development fund, (ii)
that it will apply sound accounting and management procedures for the fund and
its accounts, (iii) that the fund and its accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors, (iv) that the auditors's report, together vith financial
staements will be forwarded to the Bank within siz months after the end of the
financisi year, and (v) that the audited statements would be published by the
government in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The Government further agreed
that its performance with regard to the operations of the Development Fund would
be monitored within the context of the annual review of PFPs.
(c)   Indirect Benefits
7.24         In addition to the Increased public revenue flows described above,
the project as well as implementation of later phases of LHWP, will bring about
a number of indirect benefite to the Lesotho economy. While these are difficult



- 58 -
to quantify, their impact may be substantial, given the size and duration of the
LHWP.
7.25         First, project related spending will increase demand for Basotho
good6 and services, and thus create employment and business opportunities for
local entrepreneurs.   This improved investment climate is currently being
assessed by the Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC), which has
defined some 40 business opportunities related to the LHWP, of which five have
already been implemented. Preliminary estimates indicate that project-supporting
industries and other related activities may create 2,000 to 3,000 jobs during
construction of the phase 1A alone.
7.26         Second, the LHXW construction works will significantly increase the
demand for Basotho manpower, especially for professional staff and skilled labor.
it is estimated that the Phase 1A project will employ up to 7,000 persons during
peak construction activity.   Local staff should obtain valuable on-the-job
training which later can be utilized elsewhere in the economy.
7.27         Third, project related infrastructure investments will contribute
to developing the economy. These include mainly access roads, power lines and
housing that will benefit the remote northern parts of the Lesotho highlands.
7.28         Just as the implementation of the water transfer component will
yield indirect benefits to Lesotho, it will also entail indirect costs. The most
obvious cost is the drain on scarce skilled Basotho staff by the project. LHDA
now employs about 230 Basotho staff, some of whom may have been employed. in other
key areas in Lesotho's private and public sectors. Hitigating actions undertaken
includet (i) restructuring of the Fourth Education Project (Credit 1512-LSO)
under which 20 technicians from various Lesotho agencies are receiving training
for upgrading their skills through 2-year programs - 10 are presently receiving
training in the UK - and (ii; fellowship programs provided by various donors
primarily in engineering.
(d)    Economic Rate of Return
7.29         Implementation of all project phases of the LHWP is the least cost
option for satisfying the projected water demand of an additional 70 m3/s in the
PWV area in the Vaal river supply area in the RSA. The 1983 evaluation of the
cost savings of the LHWP in comparison to the second-best option, the Orange-Vaal
Transfer Scheme (OVTS), confirmed this, and concluded that the cost savings per
m3/s is largest for the first phases of the LHWP and lower, but positive, for the
later phases. The cost savings (in 1990 prices) to be realized by implementing
all phases of the LHWP were estimated at M 4.43 billion (US$1.62 billion), and
at M 1.98 billion (US$0.72 billion) for Phase 1A only.
7.30         Water consumers paid R1.00 per m3 of water in 1990 which was
composed of the bulk tariff charged by DWA of RO.20 and distribution costs
imposed by water boards and municipalities of RO.80. DWA will gradually increase
the bulk tariff in real terms to RO.40 by 1996 and to RO.50 from 1997 and
thereafter to recover its costs. The distribution costs are expected to remain
constant at RO.80 per m3.   The projected consumer tariff in 1990 prices is
therefore R1.20 for 1996 and R1.30 from 1997 and thereafter. Economic benefits
derived from the LHWP water comprise two parts: (i) the consumer tariff less
distribution costs, l.e. R0.40 per m3 in 1996 and RO..50 per m3 from 1997 onwards,
andt (ii) consumers surplus, i.e. consumers' willingness to pay for the LHWP



- 59 -
water In excess of the tariff charged. Consumer surplus is estimated at R0.43
per m3 of project water in 1996 and will then gradually increase as demand
continues to grow. Detailed calculations are presented in Annex 7-2 and are
based on the fact that LMWP will provide about one third of total water used and
on an estimated price elasticity of demand of -0.3 (i.e. a 10? increase in water
tariffs would result in a 3? reduction iA water use).
7.31         The overall economic rate of return for the water  transfer
component is 16?. This figure is calculated by comparing the benefits as defined
above with the component's costs in Lesotho (as shown in Annex 4-3) and in the
RSA. The costs include all elements associated vith the water transfer such as
envirovment, JPTC costs, operating and maintenance, etc.   Details of the ERR
calculation are found in Annex 7-2.

7.32         An alternative calculation of the econouLc rate of return has been
carried out where the financial revenues associated with the project are used as
benefits instead of the estimates of consumer surplus. In this calculation
benefits include Ci) bulk tariff revenues as in the main calculation, and (ii)
revenues from an incremental levy imposed on the bulk sales of water from
existing water supply sources. Costs are the same as in the base case calculation
above. The resulting ERR is 182, implying that a comparison between economic
costs and financial revenues yields an acceptable rate of return.
7.33         As discussed in Section VII and para 4.34,  there are risks
associated with the lengthy and complex construction arrangements envisaged under
the project. Technical and financial difficulties may delay implementation and
cause cost overruns.   Resulting delays in water sales would mean reduced
benefits. It is thus important to investigate the robustness of the economic
analysis to these downside rlsks. Accordingly switching values were calculated
for the project, with respect to the length of implementation delays and the
magnitude of possible benefit reductions and cost overruns that would still leave
the EBR greater taun or equal to 10?. This analysis suggests that a delay of 8
years or a more than doubling of project costs or a halving of water sales would
all be tolerable within a 10? ERR cutoff.   However,  in the typical case,
implementation delays would be associated with deferred (and reduced) benefits.
Where the two risks coincide, the switching points become a delay of 3 years and
reduced sales of 37?. However, given the considerable precautions taken under
the project, and identified in Section VIII, the risks are considered manageable.

S.       Hydropower Comoonent
(a)      Introduction
7.34         Lesotho has long sought to exploit its considerable hydroelectric
energy potential reflecting a deep-seated national wish to reduce its dependency
on RSA as the sole supplier of coumercial energy. Efforts to identify
economically viable schemes so far have been frustrated by the high cost of the
alternatives to energy import from ESKOE, The recently Implemented mini-hydro
statians have therefore been justified on the basis of contributing to rural
economic development rather than being economically viable sources of electric
energy.
7.35         The 'Muela hydropower plant is the first opportunity for Lesotho
to enhance its energy security at a comparatively low cost as other investments
to reduce the energy dependence would be more expensive. GOL therefore attaches
high priority to utilizing the energy created from the water transferred under
LEW for the generation of hydroelectric power. The Southern Africa Development
Coordination Conference (SADCC), the political grouping of 10 Southern African
countries, has endorsed this strategy, and has adopted the LHWP hydropower
component as a SADCC project eligible for bilateral and multilateral funding.
7.36         To arrive at an optimal configuration for the hydropower component
to the LHWP, a total of 23 alternatives were initially considered, including
options with and without headpond, various installed capacities, and different
locations of power plants and tailponds. The 1986 feasibility study originally
proposed a peaking plant with a headpond and a tailpond. This arrangement had
a very low rate of return, and during the design phase, a better option was
developed, consisting of a load-following plant. This alternative would minimize
the cost of supplementary power that would continue to be imported from ESKOM.
This elective took full advantage of all the head available from the Katse dam
by using the transfer tunnel as a penstock delivering water directly to the
turbines. It also provided a more economical and environmentally sound solution
as it eliminated the need for a headpond and gained additional energy generation
by using the full head from atste. It was concluded that no-headpond options in
the installed capacity range of 50 to 80 MW located either at Thlaka or 'Muela
offered the best alternatives.
7.37         Further analysis proved the location at 'Muela on the Nqoe river
to be economically and environmentally more advantageous than the original
location at Thlika. The 'Muela location offers lower capital costs and higher
energy production; less land would need to be flooded, smaller areas would be
needed for construction and the impact on water quality in downstream tributaries
would be less.  Three generating units with a total capacity of 72 MV were
considered the best option.   The facilities would be located underground at
'Muela. Annual energy production with the implementation of the various phases
of LHVP would grow from about 200 Ovh in 1996 to 500 Gwh in 2020 and onwards.
Transmission lines between 'Nuela and Maseru would feed the generated electricity
into the local power grid.
(b)      Benefits
7.38         The alternative to developing the LHWP hydropower component is to
continue to import electricity from the RSA.  The power generated under the
project would therefore displace lmported power.  Thus, the benefits of the



. 61 -
hydropower component are defined as the Import savings from the resulting
reduction in power imports.
7.39         The import savings comprise two partst a capacity benefit and an
energy benefit.   The capacity benefit ie defined as the cost savings from
reducing the peak power demanded from 3SKM.  In 1990, a reduction of one Rwh in
any one mouth would have saved Lesotho M 20.77 plus 12 transmission surcharge.
The energy benefit is defined as the cost savings from reducing energy demanded
from BS0N4.  A reduction of one Kwh in 1990 would have saved Lesotho M 0.03845
plus 1t in transmission surcharge. A possible additional benefit would be future
energy sales to RSAIRSKOM. However, to date no agreement exists on such sales,
and load forecasts for the LEC show that all of the power and energy available
from the 'Muela plant would be consumed in Lesotho.
7.40         The average tariffs charged by ESKOM has increased by 0.5t per year
in real terms based on almost 40 years of statistics. This increase mainly
reflects higher labor costs while costs for other inputs have remained at a
fairly constant level.   For the basecase evaluation of the LEWP hydropower
comonent, it is assumed that the long term 0.52 p.a. increase in ESK0  tariffs
(i.e. the hydropower component's benefits) will continue. This would mean a
moderate increase in tariffs of 31.5t between 1990 and 2045.
7.41         The estimated annual energy (GOh) produced and the average annual
capacity (Me) of the 'Muela plaat are shown in the table below. They have been
assessed on the basis of projected water flows, and under the constraint that
Lesotho will deliver the agreed scheduled water amounts to the RSA as set out in
the treaty.

Combining the annual energy and power production with the per unit savings in
imports provides a measure of the import savings Lesotho would realize by
implementing the 'Muela plant. Total import savings would increase from
416 million in 1996 (first year of power production) to X 40 million by 2008, and
then slowly irncrease, as ESK.0  tariffs increase, to M 49 million by 2045.

(c)     Costs
7.42         The investment and engineering costs have been estimated by LEDA's
consultants and are shown in Annex 4-3.   Ten percent  (10Z) of the LHDA
administration and 102 environmental costs are included as cost for the
hydropower component.
7.43         The investment costs vould be between 1992 and 1998.  The time
profile of the costs (and associated physical contingencies) is shown in
Annez 4-3.
7.44         Operation and maintenance costs were assessed at same detail by
LEDA, and it was concluded that they would amount to M 4 million every year, i.e.
about l1 of the investment costs.
(d)     Economic Analysis
7.45         Comparing economic costs and benefits for the hydropower component
as defined above yields a crossover rate of return of 62.  Details of the
analysis are shown in Annex 7-2.
(e)     Reliability of the cross-over rate of return
7.46         The cross-over rate of return varies significantly depending on the
assumptions made regarding the future level of E80OM'es tariffs, but it is
relatively insensitive to changes in electricity demand. The reliability of the
crossover rate as a measure of the economic desirability of the 'Muela plant
therefore depends on 35R01's future tariffs.
7.47         Presently, ESXOM bulk tariffs are low compared to world standards,
largely because of (i) a high system load factor from the large mLning load, and
Cii) large, modern coal fired generating plants located near the coal mines.
This assessment is supported by comparing RSA bulk tariffs with those of other



- 63 -
countries. The average yield in a sample of 27 LDC (at US cent S.30) Vas 1661
higher than in the RSA (at US cent 1.99). Compared to the mean tariff yield in
the OCD (at US cent 6.42), the tariff vas 223S lower. The ESKOM tariff of Us
cent 1.99 was in 1987 the lowest among the 10 industrial countries listed below
(prices in 1987 US cents per Rwh): Germany - 8.3; UK - 5.3; Belgium - 5.6; Italy
- 7.2; USA - 4.9; France - 5.0; Netherlands - 4.9; Ireland - 8.6; Canada - 2.8.
ESKON's tariff charged to LEC in 1987 averaged to US cent 4.07.
7.48         A number of reasons indicate that the cost for ESKO  to produce
electricity, and therefore the tariffs charged, will increase in the future. The
reasons are summarized belows
(1)      The cost of financing future power sector investments is likely to
Increase as the RSA Government is reducing its involvement with BSOK.
So far, the Government has guaranteed ESROM's borrowings which resulted
in ESKOM bonds having the highest security rating for investments.
Investors therefore accepted a relatively low yield. The RSA Government
recently rescinded a regulation which provided a guaranteed source of
funds whereby insurance companies and pension funds were required to
hold as part of their investments bonds meeting certain quality
requirements because of their security, which was the case of ESKOM
bonds.
(ii)     There  is an ongoing debate over proposals  to privatize  certain
government undertakings in RSA such as 3SO0. A general manager with
special responsibility for privatisation and legal services has been
appointed, and a series of (confidential) studies to assess the impact
of privatization has been undertaken. It is expected that some form of
privatization will be implemented even if many complex issues will have
to be resolved and even if there are influential opponents. ESRKM
acknowledges that privatization would lead to some increases in real
tariffs so that appropriate returns on investments can be generated.
Presently 3SK0  accounts for its assets using historical values and has
generated a return on historical assets averaging 121 during the last
decade when inflation averaged 14-16X. General revenues would have to
be increased by an estimated 302 to achieve returns of between 8-10? on
revalued assets.
(Lit)    810K4 has excess capacity expected to last for another 8 to 10 years.
Funding for new plants will have to be raised starting about 3 to 5
years from now, and this may cause tariffs to increase. Bulk tariffs
Increased by 461 in real terms from 1974 to 1987 when the generating
capacity in the RSA expanded rapidly. ESXOM also expects to build some
costly nuclear plants in the future, largely due to regional
reliability considerations for areas where coal-fueled plants are not
located. Some of the costs for nuclear plants would however be offset
by transmission savings and low operating costs.
(iV)     Pressure is increasing for 3S0OM to invest in pollution control and
water saving technology. This may lead to increased capital costs and
resulting tariff increases. With respect to pollution control, E8ROM
Installs  electrostatic  precipitators  on  all new  plants,  but  is
resisting pressures to install more costly Oscrubber equipment as the
coals burned have low sulphur content. One standard size plant has been
equipped with air cooling rather than water cooling technology which



- 64 -
saves about 1.6 liter of water per Kwh produced but increases capital
costs by 3S.
7.49         The risk of being subject to tariff iucreases in combination with
the Impossibility to import electricity from any other source form convincing
arguments for Lesotho to increase its energy security.
(f)      Sensitivity of the Crossover Rate of Return to the Future ESKOK
Tariffs
7.50         In the base case calculation of the crossover rate of return for
the 'Euela plant, it was assumed that only the modest increase In ESK0K tariffs
of 0.5s p.a. will occur. If, in addition, a 30? increase in ZSJK0 tariffs would
occur In order for ESKMK to achieve a 8-10? financial rate of return, the rate
of return for the 'Muela plant Increases to 8.0?. In the case of a cost increase
of 202 in the economic base costs, the rate of return would be reduced by about
12. Vith no future ES0K tariff increases, the rate of return would fall to St.

7.51         It is likely that part of the costs for the hydropower component
would be financed with funds that would not be available for alternative uses in
Lesotho (on the assumption that GOL would finance the scheme with only
concessionary funding). Since the donor funded programs are mainly in other
sectors of the economy, and implemented on a long-ternm basis, the additional
(non-fungible) funds for Lesotho may be substantial and have been estimated at
752 of total costs for the component between 1992 and 1997. From Lesotho's point
of view, the economic costs (i.e., the opportunity cost) for non-fungible
resources would be the associated debt service payment rather than the cost of
resources financed. Assuming that 751 of total costs between 1992 and 1997 would
be financed from non-fungible funds in the form of a loan payable over 20 years
(1998 to 2017) and with a 32 p.a. interest rate, the ERR for the hydropower
component would Increase to 122 (details of the calculation are included in
Annex 7-2). This would represent a measure of the desirability to implement the
project component strictly from Lesotho's point of view.
C. Economic Assessment of Both Project Components
7.52         An economic rate of return for the whole project was calculated by
comparing the flows of benefits and costs for both the water and hydropower
components. Benefits would include additional tariff revenues from the water
transfer component (i.e. revenues from the sale of water delivered under LUmP,
and revenue from the leny imposed on water sales from existing sources). Costs
would Include investment, operation and maintenance costs for both project
components.
7.53         Comparing costs and benefits for the overall project yields an
economic rate of return of 152.  This ls close to the 162 rate of return



- 65 -
established for the project's water transfer component alone, since costs and
benefits for the water transfer component are substantially larger than those of
the hydropower component.
7.54         The table below shows the sensitivity of the rate of return for
combined project to changes in costs. Cost alterations for the water transfer
component have a profound impact with a change in costs of 202 changing the rate
of return by 2-31. Similar modifLcetions in the costs for the hydropower
component results in changes of only 0.2-0.51. Details of the economic analysis
are shown in Annex 7-2.

D. Economic Impact of Water Transfer Component on RSA Consumers
7.55         The economic impact on different water consumers in the RSA has not
been evaluated. However, statistics from the PWV area, i.e. the area where most
of the water will be used, indicate that a majority of the population (642) is
black as is the majority of the orkforce (75?).

users and purposes of the water use will depend on how the existing supply
system will be expanded. Only then will an accurate evaluation of the value of
the water for the RSA water consumers be possible.

VIII. RISKS
8.01         There are five principal risk areas that have been identified in
the course of project preparation and appraisal.  These are discussed below,
along with measures to minimize such risks.
8.02          Mi) Financial Risks  The IIRD loan is being made to LHDA with the
guarantee of the Government of Lesotho. However, as the treaty puts the onus of
debt servicing on RSA, and an any case Lesotho is not creditworthy for IBRD loans
and would otherwise not qualify for such, it is the RSA risk that is relevant in
this regard.  The risk of RSA defaulting on debt service payments is being
minimized as (i) the RSA, under the treaty, is obliged to repay any project loans
irrespective  of project  performance,  and  (ii) the  Bank will  join  other
international lenders in concert to exercise remedies under the trust
arrangements.  The RSA, in case of default, would be in default to all lenders
and the implied threat of denial of borrowings from such sources at a time when
the political changes in RSA would call for much greater long-term development
funds than heretofore envisaged should be a sufficient deterrent to default. The
risks for project delays due to shortage of financing is minimized by ensuring
that adequate funding is secured before committing Bank financing. Although LHDA
has the responsibility of providing funds to meet cost overruns, RSA has
indicated its villingness to assist LUDA in its efforts to raise additional
finance if needed, as RSA would obviously have an interest in completing the
project.
8.03         As indicated already, the financial risk of the water transfer
component has to be seen in the context of the RSA overall financial situation.
The first half of the 1980', was a perlod of increasing foreign indebtedness in
the RSA. Foreign debt exposure grew from US$2.8 billion in 1970 to US$23.7
billion in 1985. Falling gold prices, economic sanctions, drought and poor
prices for other RSA export conmodities led to current account deficits, and an
increasing reliance on short term foreign borrowings.   At the end of 1985,
foreign lenders were no longer prepared to roll over the debt, and the RSA
authorities announced a debt standstill (no payment of principal) of short term
debt due to the international banking system, amounting to US$13.7 billion.
US$2.3 billion of that has since been repaid, and a further US$1.5 billion is
scheduled to be repaid by 1993.  US$4.0 billion has been moved outside the
standstill arrangements as lenders exercised the option to transform their short
term claims into long term debt.
8.04         The last five years have seen a marked improvement in the RSA
foreign debt situation. Total debt levels, as measured by cozuonly used ratios,
are not excessive even if an uncomfortably large share of the debt is still short
term. Foreign debt exposure fell, in spite of the revaluation of RSA's non-
dollar denominated debt, from US$23.7 billion in 1985 to US$20.6 billion in 1989,
the ratio of foreign debt to GDP fell from 1282 to 792. These improvements have
been carried out at the cost of RSA becoming a net exporter of capital, which in
turn has led to reduced investment levels. This situation is expected to last
well into the 1990's.
8.05         (ii) Technical Risks:  The risk of construction delays and cost
overzuns resulting from unforeseen physical conditions and construction
complications of the water transfer component has been addressed by ensuring that
detailed designs and major contracts are finalized before final comitments are
made by all parties. The RSA guarantee to pay all loans would not be affected
by any lmplementation problems during project construction.



- 67 -
8.06         (iii) Administrative  Risks,   Construction of the project  is
scheduled to be completed in five years.   The timetable for issuing tender
documents, evaluation of offers, and ward of contracts has been essentially
adhered to. Still, given the delays during the feasibility studies, in project
administrative arrangements, and the experience with the advance infrastructure
contracts, there is the likelihood that the project will, take longer to complete
and that there may be cost overruns due to unforeseen supply mishaps. The past
administrative delays were due to a number of factors, delays in procedures
within LHDA, the issuance of permits to contractors, decisions by LUDA and JPTC
and by the two governments. These by and large were teething problems of a newly
established and rapidly expanding organization handling a complex project. The
restructuring of LHDA discussed in para. 2.03 is designed to minimize these
risks. Also, to the extent Bank financing is involved, some provision has been
made, following historical disbursement profiles for large water projects, by
assuming that the project will take a year longer to complete than currently
programmed.
8.07         (iv) Political Riskst   Involvement in the project would also
contain political risks which are more difficult to assess. The project is of
strategic importance to RSA, and project lending could therefore be perceived as
being in RSA's interest. The political risk is judged to be manageable in view
of (i) the unprecedented benefits that would accrue to Lesotho and (ii) the
ongoing discussions by the RSA Government with representatives of RSA's political
majority aiming at equitable representation of this majority in the country's
political process. Leaders of RSA's political majority have been kept informed
throughout the preparation and appraisal of the project.
8.08         (v) Environmental Risks.  The environmental risks are manageable
given the physical nature of the location of the dams and the reservoirs in deep
canyons with minimal vegetation and wildlife. Because of the altitude, the risk
of introducing water borne disease is minimal. Expected temperatures will make
it very unlikely that problems with water weeds would occur or that the water
quality in the reservoir will deteriorate through eutrophication. Sedimentation
of the reservoir is unlikely to become a problem, but will be monitored. Special
conservation measures will preserve rare species of alpine flora, avi and fauna.
Appropriate measures included in the project will protect a site of historic and
cultural significance in the vicinity of the project area.

Kingdom of Lesotho
Lesotho Higshlands Water Project (Phase IA)
organizational Review and Training Assessment
Terms of Reference
A. Introduction
1.    The Lesotho Highlands Water Project, which ultimately foresees the
delivery of some 70 cubic meters of water to the RSA and the generation
of hydropower for the consumption In Lesotho, will be implemented in
several phases. The first phase, referred to as Phase LA, is presently
being implemented; it foresees delivery of up to 18 cubic meters of
water and the generation of power through an installed capacity of
72 MW. Delivery of water and generation of power is achieved through
the reservoir behind the dam presently being built at Katse, through
48 km of transfer tunnels, a hydropower plant with an installed capacity
of 72 M) and through a 15 km delivery tunnel in Lesotho.
2.   LTDA wishes to employ consultants who should review its existing
organizational structure with a view to determining its adequacy for
starting with implementation of the operational phase and at the same
time with the design phase of Phase 13. The consultant should also
assess TUDA's efforts in training Basotho staff to take over the

Review of Management Accountina and Information System
Iatroduction
1.    The Lesotho Highlands Water Project, which ultimately foresees the
delivery of some 70 cubic meters of water to the RSA and the generation
of hydropower for consumption In Lesotho, will be lmplemented In several
phases. The first phase, referred to as Phase IA, is presently being
implemented; lt foresees delivery of up to 18 cubic meters of water and
the generation of power through an Installed capacity of 72 MK.
Delivery of water and generation of power are achieved thrnugh the
reservoir behind the dam presently being built at Katse, through 48 km
of transfer tunnels, a hydropower plant with an installed capacity of
72 MV and through a 15 km delivery tunnel in Lesotho.
2.   LUDA wishes to employ consultants under a contract that would have
as its objective - review of the appropriateness of its management
accounting system, including its information system. This review is
mandated by the continuation of the implementation of Phase IA, the
design phase of Phase 1B and the future start of the operating phase of
Phase IA, expected In 1996.

LESOTHO HIGHLANDS WATER PROJECT
LEC TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION INVESTMENT
Program (7Y90-FY95)
1.          The preparation of the medium term investment program for
LEC, that covers transmission and distribution needs of Lesotho until FY
95 was part of LITS. Following its completion, early in 1990, LEC
worked on the proposal, made some adjustments, and produced a financing
plan for the whole transmission and distribution component up to FY95.
2.          The purpose of the program is, in the short term, to cope
with ESKOM's decision to raise the supply tension from 88 Kv to 132 Xv,
as the previous system limited to 40 MW the power that could be imported
from South Africa, and, in the medium term, to supply power for the
construction of the Katse dam and the 'Muela hydropower plant and to
strengthen the whole transmission and distribution electricity network
of the country that is both obsolete and unadapted to future needs. The
program has no rural electrification component as such, but it will
bring a better quality of service throughout the country, which will
benefit the rural areas.
3.          132 kV lines.  The decision to build a new 132-kV switching
station at Mabote was delayed and, consequently, thee were cut-offs
during the 1989 winter and load shedding during the 1990 winter.
Construction started in 1990, and it is planned that the first line from
Mabote to Maputsoe will be completed in 1991 and the second line from
Mabote to Mazenod (near the airport) in mid-1994. The first line will
take power to the North, whose three direct intakes from ESKOM (in Peka,
Maputsoe, Hololo) will be cut off as part of the modernization of the
South African network, and towards the Highlands Water Project sites.
The second line will take power to the southern part of the Maseru ring
to stabilize it, the Mazenod will be the starting transmission point to
the central and southern parts of the country.
4.          Maseru distribution.  The contour of the 33-kV Maseru ring,
which is the peripheral line on which the II-kV Maseru distribution
system is connected, will be modified. The strengthening of the ring.
started in 1989, is expected to be completed in 1992. The renovation of
the Maseru 11-kV distribution system has started and will be continued
until 1993. It also includes the distribution of the industrial estates
(Theteane and Ha Nyenye) will take place from 1989 to 1991.
5.          Central line.  The main central line will transport
electricity on 33 kV to Rom, Thaba Tseka and further north to Katse.
Works would be carried out in 1991-92. Later, in 1994-95, a 66-kV line
is planned to take electricity from Mazenod to Mobale to supply the
construction works of the second dam and tunnel for the water project.
This line will also be able to carry a greater load up to Thaba Tseka.
6.          North.  The 11-kV Naputsoe industrial ring would be built in
1989-90. The first line to be built, in 1991-i2, would be the 66-kV

6.          North.  The ll-kV )(putsoe industrial ring would be built in
1989-90. The first line to be built, in 1991-92, would be the 66-kV
transmission line Maputsoe-Pelaneng, continued in 33 kV to Katse and
thus completing the loop with the central project. The northern
campsites (main one in Sutha Buthe) vould be supplied in 1992 and the
33.kV reticulations, would be constructed in 1993-94.
7.          Southern lirs.  The first phase of construction of the
Southern Line would be to build, in 1992-93, a 66-kV extension from
Masenod to Mohale's Hoek and quthing and 11-kV reticulations around
Mlorija and Mafeteng.
S.          Financing.  Total construction expenditure in transmission
and distribution amounts to K 270 million in current value. spread over
si8 financial years (FYs, ending on 31 March).

Lesotho Highlands Water Project (Phase 1A)
Description of Prolect Physical Works
The project works in both Lesotho and RSA are described below.
A. Prolect Works in Lesotho
1.          Ratse Dam and Reservoirs  a 182 m high double curvature arch
concrete dam with a chord of 605 m and a crest span of 715 m and will contain
2.1 million m3 of concrete. It has a crest overflow with ten 15 a ungated
over-spill bays; a 19 m tailwater dam; and two outlets for future tunnels from
the Mohale and Mashai reservoirs. Temporary works include a cofferdam and two
river diversion tunnels. The minimum operating level is 1989 masl and the
full supply level, and the crest overflow, is 2053 maul; the crest is located
at 2060 masl. At fully supply level the reservoir area is 36 km2; live
storage is 1520 hm3.
2.    The dam will span the Malibamatso river at Katse 2.5 km below its
confluence wvth the Bokong river. It will have a spillway plunge pool and a
tailwater dam. There will be two low-level outlets at 1935 masl comprising
3.8 m diameter tunnels and radial gates.  The tailwater dam will be 19 ma high
with a weir crest at 1908 mael. An outlet structure for a future tunnel from
Mashai reservoir will be located 1 km above the dam and another for a future
tunnel from Iohale some 20 km above the dam site. The design, supply,
installation, and commissioning of mechanical and electrical equipment,
systems and instruments and equipment, and their operation until completion,
are included in the contract.
3.    Permanent access roads to the two outlet structures, the the crest of
Katse dar, the low level outlets, and the tailwater dan are included.
Appropriate environmental measures have been built Into the contract as well.
The supply and installation of a mini-hydro generating station is an option.
4.    Temporary works will include geotechnical exploration in the quarry area
and the dam site, the construction of a rollcrete gravity cofferdam 35 m high,
two 7.5 m diameter river diversion tunnels, and other works to dewater the
river channel.
5.    Design criteria are presented at the end of this annex.  The works were
designed by the Lesotho Highlands Consultants, comprising Sogreah, Sir
Alexander Cibb and Partners, Coyne ot Belller, Ninham Shand, Watermeyer Legge
Piesold & Uhlmann, and Keeve Steyn, Inc.
6.    Transfer Tunnels  a 48 km tunnel (tendered in two sections of largely
unlined, with a nominal diameter of 4.85 a if excavated by tunnel boring
machines, but with an estimated 200 m steel lined with a diameter of 3.35 m
and an estimated 6,400 concrete lined with a diameter of 4.35 m. Also
included are an intake tower 80 m high and vith a 25 m diameter in the Katue
reservoir, ventilation shafts, and permanent and temporary adits.



- 86-                            Annex 4-1
Page 2 of 4
7.    The transfer tunnel delivers water from the Katee reservoir to the
delivery tunnel via the hydropower penerating facilities. It must have the
hydraulic capacity to deliver 30 m31sec of Phase IA and IB; it has been
oversized in order to optimize the additional costs of an increased diameter
against the energy gain available for hydropower. As a consequence, the
transfer tunnel can deliver 35.9 m31s at the normal rated discharge of the
hydropower component turbines.
8.    The tunnel was divided into parts for the purpose of increasing
competition in the tendering process, a southern section of 19.5 km with the
intake in the gatse reservoir, and a northern section of 25 km. The two tunnel
sections, if constructed using a tunnel boring machine, would be largely
unlined and excavated to a nominal diameter of 4.85 m. Where steel lining
will be inserted the diameter would be 3.35 m and the sections with concrete
lining would have a diameter of 4.35 m. If drill and blast were used for
construction, the tunnel would have to be lined completely.
9.    The southern tunnel would have three ventilation shafts, an access adit
at the Katee Intake, a permanent access adit at Pelareng, and other temporary
adits whose location would vary depending on the construction technique used.
The intake structure would have gates at four levels and be 80 m high and 25 m
in diameter. The northern tunnel would also have three ventilation shafts and
permanent access adits at Hlotse and Muela, plus another adit whose location
wuld depend on construction technique.
10.   Under both contracts, and for the Katse dam and the delivery tunnel
contracts as well, the contractors would have to build extensions of the
access roads to the adits, maintain certain segments of the access roads, and
construct, operate, and maintain certain specified infrastructure. The
contractors would have to provide the necessary works and measures to ensure
appropriate environmental protection and mitigation of detrimental effects
thereon.
11.   Design criteria are presented at the end of this annex.  The works were
designed by the Lesotho Bighlands Consultants, comprising Sogreah, Sir
Alexander Gibb and Partners, Coyne et Bellier, Ninham Shand.
12.   Delivery Tunnels  a 16 km tunnel excavated to a nominal diameter of 5.1
m and where concrete lined to a 4.5 m diameter. A 24 diameter weir and screen
and bellmouth weir will be installed in the 'Muela reservoir. It will
discharge into a 5 m shaft leading to a bifurcation in the tunnel, with a stub
for a furture extension.
13.   The delivery tunnel takes the water from the 'Muela reservoir, or from
the transfer tunnel via a by-pass arrangement in the event the hydropower
component and the 'Muela dam are delayed, and delivers it to the delivery
tunnel at the border with South Africa. It is sized for both Phase 1 and 1B,
that is, for a nominal flow of 30 m3/s and a design flow of 32.6 m3/s. The
portion of the delivery tunnel in Lesotho, identified as delivery tunnel
South, would be 15.1 km in length.
14.   An intake in the 'Muela reservoir would deliver the water to a 5 s drop
shaft leading to the tunnel, which would include a bifurcation with a stub for

Page 3 of 4
Phase 2. The intake with screens and a bellmouth weir at 1758.5 masl would be
able to pass up to about 60 m3ls.
15. Design criteria are included at the end of this section.The delivery
tunnel was designed by Ninham Shand Inc., Van Niekerk, Kleyn & Edwards, Xeeve
Steyn Inc., and Steffen Robertson & Kirsten SA !nc.
16.   Infrastructure:  Infrastructure constructed in preparation for the major
construction contracts (so-called advance infrastructure) includes 95 km of
paved roads, 74 km gravel roads, rehabilitation and upgrading of 124 km of
existing roads, two bridges in the project area and one bridge between Lesotho
and South Africa, construction villages at Katse and Butha Buthe (contractors
provide their own accommodations), and expanded border crossing facilities.
17.   The principal elements ares
(a)   Northern Access Road: 95 km of paved road from Pitseng to the Katse dam
site, including two bridges, one a major bridge projected Katee
reservoir near its midpoint. This road will provide access re-er
deviations from January 1991 and will be completed in May 1991.
(b)   Southern Access Roada 56 km of gravel road from Thaba Seka to the tatse
dam site, including a bridge over the Halibamatso river. This work is
completed and will provide access until the Northern access road in
completed.
(c)   North End Access Roads: 6 km of new road and 47 km upgraded road to
provide access to Hlotse, lololo, Muela, and Ngoajane. They will
provide passable access from July 1990 and complete access by July
1991.
(d)   Rehabilitation of Existing Access Roadit 124 km of existing Lesotho
roads which will be used by project traffic will be rehabilitated. Cost
will be shared by the project and the GOL in proportion to the share of
anticipated traffic. These works were tendered in July 1990 and the
work .s expected to be completed in late 1991.
(e)   Construction Village at Katses  Services such as water supply,
sewerage, electricity, roads, public and comnercial buildings, services
to 100 stands, 81 houses, and the like for government services and LHDA
staff.
(f)   Construction Village at Butha Buthe: Services such as water supply,
sewerage, electricity, roads, public and comercial buildings, services
to 80 stands, 60 houses, and the like for government services and LBDA
staff.
(g)   Border Crossins Facilitiess A bridge at Caledonspoort and houses and
border post buildings at Maputsoe and Caledonspoort.
(h)   Construction Power: 66 km of 132 kv steel towers, 32 km of 66 kv, 37 km
of 33 kv, and 4.5 km of 11 kv lines as well as 10 substations are being
constructed to supply electric power to the construction sites. Power



-88 -                            Annex 4-1
Page 4 of 4
should be available by mid-1991. Earlier power requiroments would be
met by the diesel generators that the contractors are expected to
install for stand-by purposes.
(i)   Communications Systems Radio telephone facilties are being procured for
all sites, using the network of the Lesotho Telephone Corporation.
18.   Hydrogower Comonentt The transfer tunnel delivers the water to three
Francis turbines with a total capacity of 72 MS in an underground powerhouse
with a turbine floor at 1748 masl. The tailpoind at 'Muela is formed by a 55
m high concrete gravity dam with a live storage of 0.55 hmS. A surface
substation connects to a 126 km transmLssion line to Maputsoe and Maseru
19.   The facilities will consist of an underground powerhouse and a surface
operation building and a switchyard and substation. The transfer tunnel will
essentially be the penstock in order to take maximsm advantage of the head at
the Katse reservoir. A surge shaft will be located immediately upstream. It
will limit maximum upsurge to 2078 m and the minimum at 1950 m.
20.  A drainage gallery and curtain are intended to be constructed upstream
of the main underground cavern to reduce hydraulic pressure. A surge chamber
would be built downstream to control pressures in the long 1200-meter tailrace
tunnel. A vertical access shaft will carry the main cables to the surface.
The tailrace will discharge into the 'Muela reservoir for delivery to South
Africa.
21.   Three Francis turbine: wvil  be installed with a total capacity of 72
megawatts (MW). A speed of 750 rpm with a rated head of 236 m have been
selected. There will be space for additional units when subsequent phases of
the water transfer project are built. Other equipment include a 55 ton crane,
dewatering and drainage pumps, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and
circuit breakers
B.    Project Works in RSA
1. Delivery Tunnel North
22.   The delivery tunnel North in South Africa is designed to the same
criteria as the delivery tunnel in Lesotho and will operate, in fact, as a
single unit. It is being tendered in two sections, the Caledon Tunnel of 10.1
km and the Ash tunnel of 11.8 km. The former would have a steel siphon
crossing the Caledon river valley, a shaft for dewatering at the Caledon
river, and two ventilation shafts. The Ash tunnel would have a cut-and-cover
siphon crossing the Little Caledon river valley and a dewatering shaft at the
Little Caledon. Both contracts also include ancillary works, access road
extensions, construction, operation, and maintenance of certain
infrastructure, and similar conventional construction requirements.
23.   Infrastructure works in RSA In anticipation of the project consisting of
access roads and upgrading of essitng roads to be used by the project have
been completed.

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
LESOTHO HIGHLANDS WATER PROJECT (PHASE 1A)
Review of Operating Arrangements for the 'Muela Power Station
A.    Introduction
1.    The Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) is intended to deliver water
to the RSA at an ultimate rate of 70 cubic meters per second and to generate
hydroelectricity in Lesotho. Implementation of Phase 1A of the water transfer
component has started and will provide up to 18 cubic meters per second to the
RSA beginning in 1996. A hydroelectric power station of 72 MV installed
capacity at 'Muela is also planned for this phase under financing terms that
have yet to be determined.
2.    The 'Muela Station will be the only significant indigenous power
generation capacity in Lesotho, and will subsr-ntially change the character of
power sector operations in the country because of the need to coordinate the
output with power imports from ESKOM (RSA) and the delivery of water to RSA.
3.    Implementation of 'Muela will also require major changes to the
financial and institutional arrangements for power supply because of the need
to allocate responsibilities for covering the costs of the 'Huela Station
between the Government of Lesotho (GOL), LEDA as the implementing agency for
LHWP and controller of water transfer operations, and the Lesotho Electricity
Corporation (LEC) as the distributor of electricity in Lesotho.
4.    The incorporation of 'Muela into Lesotho's power system raises a number
of operational and financial issues for obtaining maximum benefit from 'Muela,
particularly to (a) use the output from 'Muela to minimize the costs of power
imports; and (b) ensure that the benefits of any concessional terms for the
financing of 'Muela are recovered from power consumers to meet national
economic priorities.
S.    GOL, LHDA and LEC thus need to establish arrangements that (a) match the
schedule for recovering the capital costs of 'Muela from power consumers with
the tariffs charged by LEC; (b) provide LEC with the incentive to use 'Nuela
output optimally and recover revenues from power consumers efficiently to meet
the costs of 'Muela; and (c) allocate the financial risks of e"ogenous events
affecting 'Muela output.
6.    LEDA wishes to employ consultants to evaluate options for resolving
these operational and financial iesues, and to propose contractual
arrangements between LUDA and LEC for maximizing the net benefit of the 'Muela
station to Lesotho.
S.    Scope of Work
7.    The following tasks will be undertaken b7 the consultants:
tl)      simulate power production patterns under different modes for
despatching 'Muela output under peak and base load conditions
within the allowable scope for regulating water flows under

Lesotho's treaty obligations to RSA, to meet daily and
seasonable load requirements under the anticipated growth in
power demand on LEC's system, including construction loads from
later phases of LHWP for the first 15 years of operation of the
'Muela station;
(14)     evaluate the costs of power imports under the expected
structure and level of ESROM's tariff to LEC and power demand
in Lesotho for each of the different modes for despatching
power from the 'Muela Station, ldentify the mode that minimizes
payments for imported power from ESKOM, and examine the
sensitivity of this concluslon to different demand growth
rates;
(iii)    review alternative instLtutLonal arrangements for coordLnatLon
between LHDA and LEC over power production from 'Nuela,
including operating procedures which reflect different levels
of involvement by LEC and guarantees contracted water
deliveries to RSA, and identify the arrangement that is most
suited to achieve the mode of power despatch from 'Muela that
minimlzes payments for imported power in terms such as the
duties, composition and procedures of a working committeet
(iv)     propose terms for the technical provisions of a power sales
agreement between LHDA and LEC that cover points of supply.
quantum of supply, phase and voltage of supply, and
responsibilities for transmission;
(v)      prepare a range of projections of cash flow requirements to
cover the costs of operating and maintaining the 'Muela station
and for recovering fully the capital costs under various
repayment terms to GOL that reflect the opportunity cost of
capital to Lesotho; in preparing the projections, the
consultant will take Lito consLderation likely sources of
finance, terms and condLtions. The projections should be
comprehensLve and include forecast income statements, funds
flow statements and balance sheets;
(vi)     compute the annual dLfferences between cash commitments for
'Muela and the avoided costs of power imports dlsplaced by
'Muela output under each of the projected cash flows for
'Muela, and show the impact of these differences on the level
of iEC's retall tariffs that enable LEC to meet satisfactory
standards of financial performance;
(vii)    evaluate and propose terms (interest rate and repayment period)
for capital payments by LEC for power from 'Nuela that can be
financed from LEC's revenues and that avolds significant
deficits between annual payments on external loans used to
finance 'Muela and payments for 'Muela power by LEC;
(viii)   propose a formula for indexing LEC's payments for 'Muela power
to cover general price escalation and that provides a means to



- 104 -                                Arsex S
Page 3 of 3
cover uncertainty about the future demand for power in Lesotho,
structure and level of ISKOM's bulk power tariff, and foreign
exchange rates on loans for 'Muela and that gives LHDA
incentive to control the operating and maintenance costs for
'Muela;
(ix)     evaluate various payment formulae for a power sales agreement
between LHDA and LEC within the proposed terms for capital
payments, such as a two-part (fixed and variable) tariff, "take
or pay' clause or flat levy on power sales, that provides LEC
with the financial Incentive to use 'Muela power optimally and
generates adequate revenues to cover the costs of 'Muelas
(x)      prepare a draft power sales agreement between LEDA and LEC that
covers the proposed terms for the bulk sales tariff, the
institutional arrangements and technical provisions for
managing the working relationship between these organizations,
legal and administrative clauses specifying at least the date
of entry into force and assignability of the agreements, the
procedure for revising the terms under exogenous events such as
changes to the foreign exchange rate, and the responsibility
for carrying the costs from changes in water output to meet
Treaty obligations and from force majeure conditions that
affect the production of power from 'Muela or LEC's ability to
take power from 'Muela into it's network.
C.   2Outut and Studs Program
8.    The study will be executed in the following two phases:
Mi)      review and proposals for the institutional and technical
arrangements presented in an interim report (items i-iv of the
Scope of Work);
(ii)     evaluation and proposals for the financial arrangements and
preparation of the draft power sales agreement presented in a
draft final report (items v-x of the Scope of Work).
9.    The study will be executed in 10 months according to the following
programs
presentation of the interim report - 3 months;
review and comments by Government/LEDAILEC - 2 months;
presentation of the draft final report - 2 months;
review and comments by Government/LRDAILEC - 2 months;
presentation of final report - 1 month.
10.  The consultants will train LEDA and LEC staff to use the models for
simulating 'Muela power station operation and the financial flows, and leave
adequate documentation to update the simulation periodically.
11. The consultants shall provide thirty (30) copies of each report to LMDA
and five (5) copies to the World Bank.

Lesotho Highlands Water Prolect (Phase 0A)
Environmental ksDects of the Prolect
A. Introduction
1.        The environmental and social impacts of the entire Lesotho
Highlands Water Project (LHWP) were reviewed in a 1986 feasibility study by
a six-person team including a rural sociologist, an agronomlst, an
ecolotiist, a fisheries specialist, a public health specialist, and a
tourism planner. The feasibility study concentrated on the impacts of
Phases IA (the present project) and 1B (Kohale Dam and Matsoku Weir), but
also considered the possible impacts of Phases II (Mashai Dan) and III
(Tsoelike Dam). The study concluded that LUVP did not present any
insurmountable environmental obstacles to development.
2.        The total estimated yield of the Senqu River system in Lesotho
is about 175 m3/sec.   The LHWP will divert a total of 70 m3/sec to the
Vaal River system. Present riparian use of water in the Senqu-Orange
system amounts to about 47 cms/sec. Thus, after implementation of the
LHVP, there will still be a margin of 58 m3/sec of water flowing
downstream. Future growth in water demand is unlikely to exceed 5 m3/sec
in Lesotho and 6 m3lsec in Namibia. Treaty provisions foresee maintaining
an agreed minimum flow in the Senqu-Orange River downstream of the LHWP.
3.        Sufficient annual flows to meet local needs will be maintained
downstream of each of the dams. The following table shows the quantities
to be delivered in each phase and the associated flows remaining in the
Senqu river system.

These estimates are taken from the simulation studies done in the early
design stage of the project, which indicated that in order to reach the
delivery target of 70 m3/sec, additional dams would have to be constructed
at Ntoahae on the lower Senqu and possibly at Malatsi on the lower
Senqunyane. However, more recent hydrological studies provide a more
optimistic estimate of average yields, ouggesting that the target can be
attained with the construction of the first three phases listed above.



- 106 -                             Annex 6-1
Page 2 of 17
Only if necessary, a fourth phase involving a dam at Ntoahae, just above
its confluence with the Senqunyane, would be constructed.
4.        Average annual flows in the lower Senqunyane are currently
estimated at 23.9 m3/sec, from which 9.6 m31sec would be abstracted in
Phase 1B. This would leave an average flow of 14.3 m3/sec in the lower
Senqunyane after the Phase 13 project, to which would be added the 2.0
m3lsec compensation release from Ntoahae. Thus, after completion of the
whole LHUP, there would still be an average annual flow of 16.3 m3ssec in
the lower Senqu between Ntoahae and the Lesotho border, not counting the
contribution of other tributaries in this area. Before the Senqu system
leaves Lesotho, it is joined by the Makhaleng, another major river system
which will not be affected by the project.
5.        The Department of Water Affairs in RSA has reviewed the possible
environmental impacts of interbasin water transfer from the Senqu/Orsnge
system to the Vaal system. It has concluded that no major impacts on the
ecology of the Vaal system are expected to result from this transfer, since
the waters of both systems originate from the same geological base.
Consequently, the water of the Senqu/Orange system will be chemically
similar to that of the Vaal system, and similar biological otganisms will
find appropriate habitat in bOLh systems. The water to be transferred from
the Katee Reservoir will be virtually free of chemical pollutants and
pathogens. Screens will be used, if needed, to prevent the passase of fish
through the tunnel from one system to the other. RSA has also evaluated
the potential impact of reduced downstream flow in the Orange River on
streambed morphology and groundwater levels in the RSA, which is not
expected to result in any major negative impact.
B. Conclusions of the Phase IA Studies
6.        The altitude (2,040 meters above sea level) and expected
temperature (less than 20 degrees Celsius) of the Katse reservoir make it
unlikely that it will have a major problem with water weeds or that it
would provide a favorable environment for water-borne disease vectors.
Rapid siltation of the reservoir due to soil erosion in the upstream
watershed is unlikely to occur, given the prevalent underlying basaltic
rock formation with only the thinnest of soil cover remaining, and the
large volume of dead storage in the reservoir. Agrochemicals are rarely
used, if at all, in traditional farming systems around the reservoir and
are not likely to contribute to water pollution.
7.        In the last fifty years, Lesotho has experienced a rapid decline
in its once-rich diversity of flora and fauna. Concern over the possible
impact of the Katsee dam, especially on rare species of alpine flora, led
the Government to undertake special studies in the project area in order to
identify rare and endangered species and to recommend measures for their
conservation. These studies identified some rare plants located in the
area to be flooded by Katee reservoir. The Environmental Action Program
includes transplanting these rare plants to the Herbarium at the National
University of Lesotho at Roma, near Maseru. A rare fish species, the
Maluti Minnow, has been reported occasionally in mountain streams but has

Page 5 of 17
However. routiae checking for aquatic weeds will be carried out during
biological monitoring operations, and a reference collection of aquatic
weeds will be established within the Environment Division.
17. The Phase 1 area has three species of large birds classified as
threateneds the Bald Ibis, the Cape Vulture, and the Bearded Vulture.
Blasting operations during construction, and reservoir filling, could cause
some birds to change their nesting sites; however, alternative sites are
abundant in the area. A rescue operation will be carried out while the
reservoir is filling to save any chicks that remain in the nests. The
routing and design of transmlssion lines serving the project has been
specially studied to minimize the potential impact on large birds. Further
studies of possible impacts on bird populations will be carried out during
the project with NGO assistance.
18.       The tatse reservoir has a relatively small fish production
potential, of between 15 and 25 tons per year. A study of the fish biology
of the catcbment area will be carried out by the Department of Fisheries
with support from LEDA. the rare and endangered Maluti Minnow has not been
found in the catcbment area, but its possible presence will continue to be
monitored during project implementation. Fishing potential at 'Muela is
negligible because of the speed, turbulence, and volume of flows between
the transfer tunnel and the delivery tunnel.
19.       Public health. Major water-borne diseases often found in water
schemes in tropical Africa are not likely to occur in Lesotho. However,
there is a possibility that the project could provide habitat favorable to
the development of the similium blackfly. Simulium species present in
Lesotho do not bite humans and therefore do not transmit onchocerciasis.
However, simulium can also have a severe effect on cattle. The fly breeds
in rapidly flowing waters, and control is best obtained by completely
stopping river flows long enough to dry out the breeding sites. The
probability of such outbreaks as a result of Phase 1A activities is not
high, but a monitoring program will be carried out to establish baseline
data and monitor change in simulium populations. Should the situation
become critical, the structures are designed in such a way that flows could
be interrupted as needed.
20.       Major health problems in the project area include malnutrition,
alcoholism, and sexually transmitted diseases. These problems are likely
to be exacerbated with the arrival of the construction work force. Public
health programs in the project area will be expanded and supported as part
of the Rural Development Plan. Four new clinics will be constructed in the
project area to serve construction workers and the local population. The
hospital at Leribe, already being upgraded under a loan from the African
Development Bank (AfDB), will be strengthened to provide 24-hour emergency
treatment for trauma cases. In addition, LUDA has employed a public health
adviser with a small support unit to monitor health services and working
conditions provided by contractors to the work force. LUDA will also
recruit an expatriate inspector of mines to supervise the health and safety
aspects of tunnel construction.

21.       Cultural heritage.  Lesotho has an important cultural heritage
which is in danger of disappearing due to lack of knowledge and neglect.
The country is particularly rich in fossils, Stone Age archaeological
sites, and rock art. There are also significant historic and cultural
sltes connected with the development of the Basotho nation. Most of the
project area is underlain by volcanic rocks in which fossils are extremely
rare. However, selected sites lie within the Elliot Formation, which is
believed to contain the world's most diverse assemblage of fossils of land-
dwelling vertebrates from the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods. A
palaseontological recomnaissance of these sites revealed no exposed fossils;
however, fossils of considerable scientific interest were found in the
vicinlty of the Caledon Crossing site. Tunnel blasting will be monitored
during construction, and any fossils found will be immediately protected
and removed for study as soon as possible. when proper facilities are
established for storage and display, the fossil collection will be
transferred to the National University of Lesotho.
22.       Archaeological studies carried out during project preparation
Include a reconnaissance survey for rock art in the Phase l1 areas of
sedimentary rock, a detailed survey for both rock art and Stone .ge sites
In all Phase IA ork sites located in sedimentary rock, and brief studies
in sample Phase 1A volcanic areas. LHWP activities will substantially
increase the pressure on rock art in their vicinity. Important rock art
panels will be removed and protected, and rock art in other endangered
sites will be subjected to detailed scientific recording. It is expected
that Increased tourist activity will not seriously endanger the Stone Age
deposits frequently found in the same sites.
23.       Only one site of known historical importance is located in the
Phase 1 area. This is a very large cave located a few kilometers upstream
of the Hololo Crossing. As well as historical importance, the cave has
exceptionally valuable and well-preserved rock art, and also contains a
large Stone Age deposit. Vhen LUWP construction starts, a continuous
stream of visitors to this site can be expected. LHDA is negotiating with
the local chief to provide protection to the site and to develop it as a
tourist attraction under proper management as a source of local employment.
Fencing, interpretive materials, and some tourist facilities will be
provided under the project.
24.       Znvironmental monitoring.  Throughout the construction period,
LEDA will monitor the effects of dam and tunnel construction and reservoir
operation on the ecology of the project area. Contract specifications have
been reviewed by the Environmental Division to ensure that contractors take
adequate account of the need for environmental controls. LHDA will also
employ an expatriate environmental liaison officer to supervise the work of
the environmental monitors to be hired by the supervising engineers. A
special program to test alternative revegetation methods for high altitude
areas will be carried out. The construction contracts contain detailed
specifications on methods of waste water treatment, minimum water quality
standards to be maintained in streams draining the site areas, and water
quality monitoring activities to be carried out by contractors. In
addition, LUDA will carry out a regular program of water quality monitoring
at streams &ad springs within the catchment areas.

never been found in the waters entering Ratee reservoir. Nevertheless the
Environmental Action Program iAcludes research on this rare species, to be
executed in collaboration with the ¢OL's Department of Fisheries.
S.        The high mountain pass traversed by the Northern Access Road, at
the headwaters of the Bokong River, represents an ecologically sensitive
subalpine sone that will be unavoidably affected by the project. Measures
have been taken to protect this area as much as possible during road
construction, and further measures will be taken after construction to
restore and enhance its ecological value. The Environmental Action Program
includes conversion of this sone into a protected area with limited
development for ecological tourism, including opportunities to view from a
distance the nesting sites of the Cape Vulture, which has been classified
by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a
threatened bird species.
9.        Lesotho is rich in sites of archaeological, historical and
cultural significance, including traces of early Stone Age cultures and
Bushmen cave paintings. Many of these valuable resources are deteriorating
due to lack of adequate protection. ReconnaLssance studies showed that
fossils of paleontological significance were only likely to be found in the
vicinLty of the Caledon tunnel crossing and possibly of the 'Muela dam.
Further studies carried out in these areas during project preparation
showed that fossils and artifacts of archeological interest are likely to
be found during tunnel excavation. Proper precautions, including test
excavations in advance of construction at potentially important sites, have
been planned as part of the Environmental Action Program.
10.       A site of archaeological, historic and cultural significance is
located in the general area of 'Muela dam. It will not be directly
affected by project construction but could be indirectly affected by
uncontrolled use due to the presence of construction workers and tourists
in the area. Measures are planned under the project to protect this site,
to provide interpretative materiale, and to allow access to the public
under controlled conditions.
11.       Lianological studies have shown that the wat9r conditions in
atets reservoir are not likely to be conducive to the 1evelopment of
commercial lake fisheries. A trout hatchery below 'Muela reservoir is
planned as a commercial venture providing employment to a small number of
local area residents. Under the Environrental Action Program, support will
be provided to the Department of Fisheries to stock Ratse reservoir and the
surrounding mountain streams with trout. The potential for tourism
development will be limited to some extent by large annual fluctuations
expected in the reservoir water level.
C. Environmental Action Program
12. The Environmental Action Program for Phase LA of the Project
comprises four parts: a natural environment and heritage plan, a
compensation plan, a rural development plan, and an environmental awareness
program. Each of these plans is described briefly below.

1. Natural Environment and leritaue Plan
13.       The Natural Environment and Heritage Plan covers the physical,
biological, and cultural heritage aspects of the project, as well as public
health aspects, including health and safety issues related to the
construction work force. There are, of course, many linkages between the
Natural Environment and Heritage Plan, the Compensation Plan, and the Rural
Development Plan. The Natural Environment and Heritage Plan includes six
programss soil conservation and sedimentation, pilot watershed management,
biological monitoring, public health, cultural heritage, and environmental
monitoring.
14.       Soil conservation and sedimentation.  Soil erosion is a major
environmental problem in Lesotho. In the highlands where the project is
located, however, the soils are lees susceptible to erosion and land
pressures have been markedly lower than in the lowlands. Varying estimates
of the likely rate of erosion in the catcbment area and sedimentation of
the reservoirs have been made during project preparation, underscoring the
need to carry out a sediment monitoring program to obtain better data and
to plan corrective actions when needed. A baseline study of soil erosion
In selected mini-catcbments is being carried out, and studies will continue
throughout the project period to determine soil losses under differing
management conditions. In addition, the Environment Division of LEDA will
conduct regular measuremeats of the amount of sediment entering the
reservoir from tributary streams, and an annual survey of the development
of the sediment delta in the reservoir. The project will also strengthen
the Environment Division to carry out a soil and water conservation program
In the project area.
15.       Pilot watershed managemeAnt.  The pilot watershed management
program will assist local communities in managing natural resources,
Including soil, water, and wildlife, in a sustainable manner, so as to
protect the reservoirs and associated structures from the consequences of
continued environmental degradation in the catchment area. The program
Includes pilot rehabilitation of wetlands or *sponge" areas.  Range users
will be encouraged to identify such areas as drought reserves or fodder
banks, to be protected and utilized only in emergencies.  The program will
also be linked to broader range management initiatives in the catchment
area.
16.       Biolosical monitoring.  Although large mammals have been
virtually eradicated in the project area, the fauna and flora of the area
are still very diverse.   Because of the limited present knowledge of
animals, plants, birds, and fish in the project area, it is important to
continue monitoring change in wildlife conditions over the life of the
project. Although it is unlikely that any large maumal8 will be trapped by
reservoir flooding, a rescue operation has been designed for use, if
needed, as the reservoir is filled. Strict controls will be imposed on the
use of chemicals in pest control programs. Rare plants in the reservoir
area will be transplanted to similar habitats nearby, and representative
samples will be replanted at both the Botanical Gardens of the National
University and at the proposed 'Muela reserve. Aquatic weeds are not
present in the project area and are unlikely to survive if introduced.

Page 7 of 17
25.       The treaty provides for a compensation flow release from latse
reservoir of 0.5 m3/sec. At 2.5 km below the proposed dam, the Malibamatoo
River is joined by the Khohlo Ntsu, a stream with a catchment area of 90
km2. Below this point the riverine ecology will not be significantly
affectet by the project. To make more effective use of the compensation
water and to improve the visual effect, it is intended to landscape the
area lmediately below the plunge pool of the dam.  The surrounding river
bank will be developed with e, hikiAg trail and the area will be maintained
by LEDA as a public amenity.
2. Resettlement and Compensation
26.       Resettlement.  The resettlement and compensation requirements of
the Phase LA project are shown in Table l(a) attached. Table l(b) shows
the expected resettlement and compensatioa requirements of the future
Phases 1B, II, and III. Unlike many other large water projects, Phase IA
of the LEVI will necessitate a relatively small amount of resettlement.
Most of this is related to access road and delivery tunnel construction,
and can be arranged at other sites within the same villages. In only one
case will resettlement of an entire village (five households) be required
by reservoir flooding. Sites are identified by local chiefs in
consultation with the house owners, and local building contractors are
hired by LUDA to construct replacement housing of the same floor area on
the new sites. Owners are given a choice of traditional or modern designs
and construction materials.
2?.       Along access roads, resettlement consists mainly of relocating
houses which fall vithin or too close to the new road alignment. A total
of 53 households will be relocated along the various access roads. At the
Caledon crossing of the delivery tunnel, the portal of the tunnel will be
located within the village of Roopa. Although only two houses lie within
the expected construction site, 14 additional families will experience
unacceptable dust and noise impacts during construction. Consequently, the
whole western end of the village will be relocated on the eastern side.
Four houses in other villages will have to be moved as a result of delivery
tunnel construction. In addition, 21 houses will be relocated in order to
build the construction community at Butha-Buthe, and 10 houses will have to
be moved in connection with the construction power component.
28.       Some 58 families, representing about 300 people, will be
resettled in the Ratse reservoir area, and 10 households will be moved in
the 'Muela area. One village, comprising five households, will be
resettled in a neighboring village under the same local chief. In other
cases, homes will be rebuilt above the water line on land belonging to the
same community and allocated by the local chief. At the far northern end
of the reservoir is Pelaneng, a largely commercial community with several
cafelbare and a few dwellings near a large trading post. These properties
will be relocated to one of two nearby villages according to the preference
of their owners.
29.       Comgensation. LHDA's current estimates of compensation
requirements for the project include land taken for Katse reservoir and
'Muela tailpond, the Northern, Southern, and Northeast access roads, the



- 112 -                              Annex 6-1
Pago 8 of 17
work sites at Katse and 'Musia, the construction communities at Kates, Ha
Lejone and Butha Buthe, work sites for the transfer and delivery tunnels,
and transmission line corridors. A total of 172 homes and 13 other
buildings have been or vill be relocated. Lost production on 1,164
hectares of arable land, including 4 hectares of garden land, will be
compensated for by the project. Direct compensation will also be provided
for an estimated 2,120 privately *wned trees, 80 hectares of thatch grass
and 16 hectares of thickets. Compensation paysents for the communal loes
of 3,185 hectares of grasing land will be made by fodder payments to the
local grating associations. The most cost-effective solution to the
problem of compensating for acce8s routes cut by Katie Reservoir will be
determdied by an optimization study. Additional transport investments that
may prove economically feasible will be included in the Rural Development
Plan.
3. Rural Development Plan
30.       The Rural Developmemt plan involves programs in the followLng
areass livestock and range managemeat, horticulture and field crops,
forestry, fisheries, land use planning, rural training and income
generation, rural roads, village water supply, rural sanitation, rural
electrification, tourism development, and construction communities. In
many cases these actions simply involve extending existing rural
development programs in.o the project area.
31.            Livestock and range management. As a result of the
flooding of substantial areas of grazing land, livestock pressure on the
remaining land in the project area will certainly increase. This will have
negative consequences for livestock nutrition, range quality, and soil
conservation, resulting in a decline in productivity in the livestock
sector. The objectives of the proposed livestock and range management
program are to lower livestock density to a level sufficient for range
recovery and sustainable use, and to support increased fodder production
and range reseeding. This will be accomplished through the establishment
and operation of two additional range management associations in the Ratse
local catcbment, including a livestock exchange program, and the provision
of extension and credit in the 'Muela area.
32.       Horticulture and field crons.  The objectives of the program in
horticulture and field crops are to increase the productivity of the
remaining arable land and to promote horticulture for improved nutrition as
well as cash income for farmers. The program will support extension and
marketing services and small scale irrigation constructed in connection
with village water supply systems. It will also support the multiplication
and distribution of high-yielding highland maize seed to farmers.
33.       Forestry.  Under the project, LIDA will implement the first
phase of a ten-year forestry program In the Kate. local catchment, to be
developed in the context of the National Forestry Sector Plan. The need
for phased development reflects uncertainties as to farmer response and
tree productlvity in the highlands. During this first phase, the project
will directly support two seedling nurseries and provide advice and inputs
for up to six village nurseries started under local initiative. A



- 113 -                             Annex 6-1
Page 9 of 17
demonstration area will be established for each of 22 local chiefs, and
trials of different tree species will be made. Conservation plantings and
village woodlots will be undertaken in response to community requests, and
about 200 households will be assisted to develop privately owned woodlots.
34.       Fisheries.  The long-term fishery potential of Xatse reservoir
is limited due to expected temperature, water quality and limiological
conditions. Under the Rural Development Plan, it is proposed to train 40
.0o 50 persons as part-time fishermen and 8 to 10 as recreational fishing
guides. A commercial opportunity has been identified to develop a cold
water aquaculture complex, including a hatchery and early fingerling farm,
below the 'Muela Dam, and a large cage culture complex in Katee Reservoir.
A detailed proposal has been prepared for consideration by private
investors, and the Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC) will
publicize and promote the enterprise. In addition, TNDA will provide
support to the Fisheries Section of the Ministry of Agriculture to
inventory and monitor fish stocks in Katse Reservoir, to stock the vaters
with rainbow trout, and to monitor the commercial aquaculture venture. A
special feature of this collaboration will be a joint research project on
the r&re Maluti Minnow.
35.       Land use planning with the people.  LEDA will assist communities
In planning for better manauement of their remaining resources through
preparation of a land resource inventory and a land capability atatement
for each village. Through discussions with village leaders and people.
resource constraints and development options will be identified and
priorities established by each comunity. This process will result in a
written plan for each village, spelling out contributions by LEDA, the
villagers, Government, and other parties. The planning process will be
initiated and monitored by LHDA staff in cooperation with extension agents
from the various Government agencies serving the project area.
36.       Rural training and income generation.  LEDA is already
implementing a construction worker training program which is open to all
Basotho, but with priority given, In principle, to project area residents.
In addition, under the Rural Development Plan, a Rural Skills Training
Center will be established at Katse. This program is targeted to meet the
needs of persons who have lost part of their traditional source of Income
through LWP land acquisition. Training will include basic literacy and
nmeracy, production and entrepreneurial skill development, and on-the-job
training combined with production. Training outreach will be extended to
householders, mainly women, whose obligations require them to work at home
or within their immediate village areas. A separate project is being
designed to provide training and employment opportunities to project
affected persons outside the Katse catcbment area.
37.       Rural roads.  The improved access provided by the roads
constructed under LUWP can be extended to many rural commmnities by the
construction of short feeder roads. LHDA will determine those feeder road
alignments which are most likely to improve rural mobility. Detailed
design of road works will be done by a consultant in collaboration with the
Department of Public Works to ensure that completed roads meet the
standatds required for road maintenance. The construction of improved



- 114 -                             Annex 6-1
Page 10 of 17
bridle paths, footpaths, and stream crossings may also be included uwder
this component.
38.       Village water supply and sanitation.  This program represents an
extension into the project area of government programs intended to cover
the whole country. The provision of safe drinking water is coordinated
with a parallel program for household sanitation and primary health care.
Villagers must make a substantial contribution of labor and some cash to
the construction, operation, and maintenance of their water supply systems.
Targets for the water supply program include the provision of potable water
from public standpipes for all 121 villages in the Xatse area and 12
communlities in the 'Muela area, only 5 of which have such water supply
systems now. This program will be implemented by the Village Water Supply
Section of the Ministry of Interior, Chieftainship Affairs and Rural
Development. The rural sanitation program will ensure that all prim*ry and
secondary schools are provided with latrines, that all communities receive
health and sanitation education to improve hygienic practices and community
health, and that all communities have access to trained commercial builders
of ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines. This program will be carried
out by the Environmental Health Section of the Ministry of Health.
39.       Rural electrification.  Transmission lines will be constructed
under the project to bring reliable electricity to the main construction
sites. It will be possible for local communities in the transmission
corridors to tap into these lines at low marginal cost. Constructing
additional lines to serve local commiuties is likely to be prohibitively
expensive, particularly if full cost recovery policies are to be applied.
LUDA will conduct a survey to determine if the demand is sufficient to
justify any additional investment.
40.       Tourism development.  The Phase IA project will create two
reservoirs with ready access in scenic mountain and foothill areas. The
infrastructure established for project construction can serve tourist needs
in the longer term. However, the recreational attraction of Katse
Reservoir will be limited by the cold water temperature and the expected
visual effects of the large drawdown zone. All tourism development will be
undertaken relying on private sources of finance. It is not expected that
tourism will be a major source of additional employment and income in the
project area.
41.       Construction communities.  LHDA/contractor communities will be
established at three sitess Katse, Ha Lejone, and Butha Buthe. Villages
near these sites, and the town of Butha Buthe, will grow rapidly during the
construction period. There vill be pressure on agricultural land and on
existing local services as the new arrivals seek to establish residential
sites and commercial activities. To mitigate the anticipated impact of the
construction work force on local coomunities, it is proposed to upgrade
social services in adjacent villages, and to acquire, demarcate, and
provide basic services to selected sites for self-help development by the
newcomers.

Page 11 of 17
4. Environmental Avareness
42.       Environmental Reserves.  The unavoidable negative impacts of
LHWP on the environment will be partly mitigated by the establishment of
three environmental reserves in the project area. The first reserve,
Bokong, will be located around the source of the Bokong River along the
Northern Access Road. This site represents a rare African Alpine ecosystem
and has become highly accessible as a result of the project. While there
are other alpine areas in nearby parts of Lesotho and South Africa, none is
readily accessible. It is expected that the Bokong Reserve will be about
1,000 hectares in size. Parking, controlled pedestrian access and a small
visitor center will be provided. Footpaths will be built to the various
features of the area, including a lookout point where a large colony of the
threatened Cape Vulture can be observed. The project also includes staff
housing, vehicles, fencing, and fire control equipment for this reserve.
43.       The proposed Hololo reserve covers a small area (about 100
hectares) of well developed woodlands in the area of the Hlotse adit.
Woodland communities of indigenous species are rare in Lesotho and the area
around the Hlotse adit is an outstanding example. The improved access due
to LHWP has already started to accelerate the destruction of the woodland
through cutting for firewood and subsequent overgrazing. This reserve is
intended to preserve a remnant sample of woodland for posterity.
44.       The area around the 'Muela reservoir will have to be fenced for
safety reasons because of the daily varying levels of the reservoir. The
permanent surface of the reservoir will cover 25 hectares and a further 12
hectares vill only occasionally be flooded for short periods. A wildlife
and bird refuge will be established within this protected area. Once
suitable habitat is established, one or more "hides, will be constructed to
allow animals entrance to the protected area without actually reaching the
reservoir. The reserve would also be used to preserve representative
samples of the flora and fauna of Lesotho's lowland and foothill zones.
The facility will assist LHDA in promoting environmental awareness and may
also interest visitors to the hydropower plant.
45.       Environmental Information.  Information about LHDA's
environmental program is provided to the public through LEDA's Public
Relations Division, which has also worked effectively with the environment
division in establishing cammunications links with local communities. In
order to successfully implement the Environmental Action Plan, there will
be a need for continuing environmental education for construction workers
for the project affected population and for the public at large.
Environmental officers will be permanently based at the two main field
sites to coordinate the environmental aspects of the public information
program, and other staff will participate in the program as required by
their special tasks. In addition, LHDA will create a small library of
relevant environmental publications and media products, and will establish
space and facilities for the use of professional visitors.
46.       Three areas of critical concern are being addressed by a
priority environmental information program prior to the start of
construction activities. These includes (1) dissemination of public



- 116 -                             Annex 6-1
Page 12 of 17
health information to communities likely to come into contact with
construction workers or to be otherwise affected by health hazards created
by the project; (2) environmental awareness training for construction
workers themselves; and (3) dissemination of detailed information on the
compensation policy and program, to facilitate full participation by the
affected households.
47.       Visitor Centers.  Environmental displays and basic facilities
for visitors (picnic tables, trash baskets) will be constructed at the two
main headquarters of LHWP operations, at Katse and 'Muela.
D. Environmental Panel
48.       LHDA has twice convened an Eavironmental Panel to review the
progress of planning for environmental aspects of the project. The first
meeting of the panel was held in February 1989. The panel consisted of
Dr. Guillermo Cano, an environmental policy and law specialist;
Mr. Charles Clay, a civil engineer and environmental specialist; and
Dr. Thayer Scudder, a compensation and resettlement specialist. The panel
recommended some amendments in the LEDA Order to improve management
effectiveness and to provide a legal basis for the acquisition of land by
LHD.  It pointed out the need for increased staff and logistic support to
the environment division, specifically mentioning the important role that
the division would have to play in reviewing contract documents and
monitoring contractor performance. It recommended prompt adoption by the
Government of LHDA's proposed compensation policy. It also recommended to
the Government to seek donor funding for the proposed rural development
program, and recommended that the Government should allocate a significant
part of the royalties from the project as counterpart funds for this
program.
49.       A second environmental panel meeting took place in March 1990.
This time the panel consisted of Dr. John Ledger, environmentalist;
Dr. Robert Hitchcock, anthropologist; and Dr. Thayer Scudder, compensation
and resettlement specialist. The panel reviewed the preappraisal draft of
the Environmental Action Program, which was to be presented to the JPTC for
approval prior to appraisal. It endorsed this program and pointed out the
urgent need to commence work on the proposed physical and biological
baseline studies of the catchment areas, as well as to accelerate the
rehabilitation of sensitive ecological areas damaged during advanced
infrastructure construction. It also stressed the need for immediate
action on the environmental awareness and public health programs. The
panel highlighted problems encountered in the first year of implementing
the compensation policy, and made recommendations for improvement. Once
again the panel stressed the importance of fully funding the Rural
Development Plan as part of the Phase IA Construction Project.
50.       LUDA and the participating Governments responded positively to
the recommendations of the environmental panel. Changes in the LHDA Order,
promulgation of a Scheme for Phase IA, and adoption of the compensation
pollcy and accompanying regulations were carried out by the Government of
Lesotho prior to appraisal. The environment division was strengthened to



- 117 -                          Annex 6-1
Page 13 of 17
participate actively in the drafting of contract specifications and in the
evaluation of bids on environmental grounds. LHDA has endeavored to assist
the Government of Lesotho in its search for donor funding for the Rural
Development Plan. It is the Government's desire to integrate this program
with other national programs and with the national Environmental Action
Plan.
Z. Environmental Evaluation
S1.       In addition to LUDA's planning vork, studies carried out during
project preparation by consultants, and the reports of the Environmental
Panel, an Environmental Evaluation report was prepared by LUDA in May 1990
and reviewed by the Bank at appraisal. The report endorsed the findings of
the studies, the panel recommendations, and the proposed Environmental
Action Program. The following recommendations were mades
(a) Existing studies of fauna and flora in the project area are
inadequate. A complete baseline biological survey of the project area
should be conducted ismediately, especially in the alpine area, to verify
and record the presence of endangered and/or endemic species.
(b) Further research should be carried out on revegetation
options for the alpine area.
(c) Critically needed watershed erosion and sedimentation data
should be obtained, using mathematical modelling to define experiments
reflecting different grazing and land use practices.
(d) The effects of compensation flows from Katse and 'Muela
reservoirs should be studied during the project period to detenmine the
optimal flow rates.
(e) The proposed Bokong Reserve should be established and
protected as soon as possible. Critical areas for protection should be
established based on a scientific survey of the area, including the
presence of rare and endangered species.
(f' The Natural Environment and Heritage Plan for Phase IA
should be approved, funded and staffed as soon as possible.
(g) A formal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Phase 1B
should be prepared during the planning period, drawing upon lessons learned
from the implementation experience of Phase IA. Formal BISs should also be
prepared for all subsequent phases of the LHWP.
(h) The staff of the Environment DivisLon should be reinforced
with (a) a biologist to supervise the flora and fauna surveys, and (b) a
soils scientist capable of designing mathematical models, to help design
and carry out the erosionlsedimentation monitoring program.
52.       The appraisal team discussed these recommendations with LEDA and
the following actions have been takens



- 118 -
Annex 6-1
Page 14 of 17
(a) LHDA has started the baseline biological survey.
(b) LHDA has started the baseline physical survey of the project
area.
(c) LHDA has initiated planning studies for the Bokong Reserve.
(d) LEDA agreed to accelerate the implementation of its program
of field testing various options for revegetation in the alpine area.
(e) The Phase 1A Construction Project includes funding for Phase
13 environmental studies.
(f) The Phase lA Construction Project includes funding for
short-term consultancies.
F. implementation
S3.       LUDA's Environment Division will have overall responsibility for
ensuring the effective implementation of the environmental action and rural
development programs for Phase 1A. The division will be composed of a
compensation section, a rural development sector, a natural environment and
heritage section, and a public health unit to be created. It is supported
by cartographic and geographic information system (GIS) units, computer and
secretarial services, and field stations established at strategic points in
the project area. The environment manager will be responsible for
coordinating all aspects of the three plans and the Environmental Awareness
Program.
54.       The Natural Environment and Heritage Plan will be carried out
largely by LHDA staff supported by short-term consultants and fixed-term or
daily paid workers. The environmental monitoring program will require
close cooperation between the Environment Division and the Technical
Division, which supervises the contractors and the supervising engineers.
The public health program will be carried out by the proposed public health
unit in cooperation with contractors and with the Ministry of Health.
xzecution of parts of the plan will also require close cooperation between
LHDA and the National University of Lesotho.
55.       The Compensation Plan will continue to be administered by staff
of the Compensation Section. LHDA would continue to manage cash payments
and construction of replacement housing directly. LHDA will also procure
grain and fodder annually to meet its compensation obligations.
Distribution of grain and other food products will be delegated to the GOL
food management unit, which has appropriate facilities and experience and
will soon have spare capacity. In the 'Muela area, LHDA will experiment
vith the use of a local cooperative to deliver compensation food.
Compensatory access improvements will be designed by local consultants and
constructed by local contractors. Cross reservoir ferries will be operated
by LEDA, while motorable roads will be turned over to the Ministry of Works
for maintenance, and local comunities will be responsible for the future
maintenance of footpaths, bridle paths and small stream crossings.

Page 15 of 17
56.       Staff of the Rural Development section will supervise and
monitor the implementation of the Rural Development Plan. Final
arrangements would depend upon the requirements of different donors. At
present, the following arrangements are envisageds (i) the range management
program in the Katee area, which will build on a program already started
with USAID financing, will be Implemented by local, regional or
international consulting groups or an international NGO0 the much semller
range management program at 'Muela will be implemented by the Ministry of
Agriculture or by a local consultant; (ii) the horticulture and field crops
program will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture or a local
consultant; (iii) the community forestry program will be carried out by an
international NGO or regional consulting group; (iv) the comm ercial fishery
project will be executed by private enterprise; support to subsistence
fisheries will be provided by contract with an NGO; the program will also
provide support to the Fisheries Section of the Ministry of Agriculture;
(v) tertiary access improvements will be designed by local consultants,
built by local contractors, and maintained by the Ministry of Workst
(vi) village water supply and sanitation programs will be carried out by
the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health respectively; (vii)
rural electrification, to the extent this proves to be feasible, will be
planned by LHDA in consultation with the Ministry of the Interior, and
executed by LEC; and (viii) construction communities will be initially
managed by LHDA with a gradual devolution of responsibility to special area
development committees and local councils. Planning with the people will
be implemented directly by LHDA headquarters and field staff. Delegation
of subproject execution responsibility outside of LEDA will be confirmed by
written contracts or agreements specifying the rights and responsibilities
of each party. LHDA will monitor progreos with respect to each
subproject's annual work program and will conduct periodic surveys to
establish the plan's overall effect on household production and human
welfare in the project area.
57.       The Environmental Awareness Program will address issues related
to all three plans. It consists of the creation of three environmental
reserves, the construction of visitor centers at LEDA's two main
headquarters, and the execution of a public information program aimed at
construction workers, project affected communities, and the population at
large. The main responsibility for managing this program will rest with
the Natural Environment and Heritage section, although its funding is
included in the Rural Development Program. The environmental reserves
component will be executed by LHDA in cooperation with the Ministry of
Agriculture's National Parks Unit and the Natal Parks Board. Visitor
center facilities, including environmental displays, will be constructed
and operated by LHDA. The public information program, which includes
widespread dissemination of information about compensation entitlements and
LHDA programs, will be planned and executed in close cooperation with
LHDA's public relations division.
G. Cost Estimates and Financina
58.       Tables 2(a) through 2(e) summarize the cost estimates for the
environmental program, including the Natural Environment and Heritage Plan,
the Compensation Plan, the Rural Development Plan, and the Environmental

Awareness Program.  The base cost of the Katural Environment and Heritage
Plan is about Maloti 9.3 million (US 83.6 million) in 1990 prices;
however, this does not include the costs of LHDA's Environment Division
staff, support, training, and technical assistance (see below). The base
cost of the Compensation Plan is approximately Maloti 39.9 million (US
$15.4 million) in 1990 prices. The Rural Development Plan is estimated to
require about Maloti 104.4 million (US $40.3 million), plus M 12 million
(US$4.6 million) for tertiary access improvements. The estimated cost to
carry out the Environmental Awareness Program is Maloti 3.7 million (US$1.4
million) in 1990 prices. The total cost of the environmental program is
therefore estimated to be about Maloti 169.2 million (US $65.3 million) in
1990 prices, not including physical contingencies.
59.       RSA vill finance M 37.7 million of the compensation program, M
8.3 million of the natural environment and heritage program, M 52.0 million
of the rural development program, and M 1.3 million of the environmental
awareness program, for a total of H 99.3 million (US $38.3 million) In 1990
base costs. It is estimated that the direct hydropower-related costs of
the environmental program will amount to about M 2.7 million (US $1.0
million). This includes Maloti 1.2 million for compensation, M 1.0 million
for natural environment and heritage, and Maloti 0.5 million for
environmental awareness ('Muela reserve). GOL will have to secure
financing for M 1.0 million in additional compensation, M 52.4 million for
rural development, X 12 million for tertiary access improvements and an
additional K 1.9 million for environmental awareness. The total GOL
obligation with respect to the Environmental Action Plan is therefore
estimated at M 70.0 million (US$27.0 million) in 1990 base costs.
H. Staffing, Training, and Technical Assistance
60.       The costs given in the preceding section do not include the
costs of LHDA environmental staff, the equipment purchase and operating
costs of the environmental division, the costs of long-term technical
assistance to LEDA, or the costs of training environmental staff. These
costs are included in the administrative costs for LHDA staff as a whole.
It is currently considered that LHnDA's Environment Division should more
than double from its present staff of 36 to about 80 Basotho employees
during the construction period, of whom 22 would be hired on a fixed-term
basis for this period.
61.       The training requirements of LEPA environmental staff are of
three types: in-house training for new recruits, short-term training in
local or regional institutions to acquire specialized skills, and
university level training for a few key positions for which trained Bsasotho
staff are not presently available. The program includes short-term
secondments and study tours abroad for up to nine environment division
staff members each year, as well as local and regional seminars and short
courses for an estimated 20 staff per year, and university level training
for the principal rural development officer and the cartographer. The
total cost of training for the environment division over the project period
is estimated at Maloti 1.5 million (US $0.5 million) in 1990 base costs.
This cost is included in LHQA's administrative budget.

62.       The long-term technical assistance needs for the Environmental
Division during the project period are estimated at 30 staff-years, broken
down as follows an environmental adviser (6 years). a social development
adviser (6 years), a rural development adviser (6 years). an onvironmental
liaison officer (6 years), and a public health adviser (6 years). These
experts would be recruited as individuals. The environmental adviser for
the first two years vould be provided by UNDP.
63.       Counterpart positlons have been proposed for all of the
tecbnical assistance positions except for the environmental liaison
officer, whose task would be to work with the environmental monitors hired
by the supervising engineers. One counterpart position (principal
environment officer) is already filled, while cometent staff Sn the
Division may be considered for promotion to the posts of principal
compensation officer and principal rural development officer.
64.       In addition to long-ternm technical assistance and trainiug, the
Environment Division will require occasional short-term consultancies. The
project also provides for conducting an Environmental Assessment of Phase
1D during the Phase IA Construction Project (I 1.8 million or US $ 0.65
million in 1990 base costs), and for the costs of annual meetings of the
Environmental Review Panel (M 0.9 million or US $ 0.3 million over the
project period in 1990 base costs). The proposed Bank loa would finance
consultancies, environmental studies and the environmental review panel.

Lesotho Righlands Water Prolect (Phase U)I
Phase 1B Environmental Assessment
Terms of Reference
Introduction
1.        Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) study the effects of a
proposed development policy. programs or project on the natural and human
environment. An EIA should be development oriented and carried out
according to correct scientific procedures; should have sufficient lead
tine to allow timely planning, investigation, and public participation;
and should lead to meaningful recommendations and appropriate decision-
making. Also, an ZIA should follow an iterative process so that at each
iteration, the level of detail increases. In this way, an ZIA becomes
cost-effective and saves valuable time.
2.        In Lesotho, the concept of EIA was popularized during an
International Conference on Environment and Development sponsored by the
Government of Lesotho and the World Bank in April 1988. The Lesotho
Highlands Water Project CLMP) is the only project, to date, that has been
subjected to environmental impact analysis in Lesotho. A preliminary EIA
on the whole LEVP was undertaken as part of the Feasibility Study, and the
results of the BIA were considered In arriving at the decision to proceed
with the Engineering Project for Phase 1A. Further studies were carried
out during the Engineering Project. These studies formed part of the basis
for the decision to proceed with the Phase 1A Construction Project, and for
the preparation of an Environmental Action Plan to be implemented as part
of that project.
S.        The Eavironmental Panel and the Environmental Evaluation of the
Phase 1A Construction Project have both stressed the need for a full EIA to
be carried out for the Phase 1B Project.
4.        it is clearly necessary that early planning for the detailed
engineering project for Phase 1B should be done concurrently with
environmental impact assessment for the same phase. The advantage of such
an approach is that the studies will provide detailed information on the
potential Impacts of Phase 1B on the natural environment. Early
integration of the EZI for Phase 1B into planning will have benefits to the
design of the engineering structures, to the environment, and to the
affected communities. It will also be possible to incorporate early
lessons learned from the experience of planning and implementing Phase U.
Obiectives
5.        The objectives of this programme ares  ti) to integrate the
practice of ZIA into the design of Phase 1B of the LMWP; (ii) to carry out



- 126 -
Anex 6-2
Page 2 of 5
a detailed EIA of Phase 1B from 1993 owards so as to provide sufficient
lead time over the engineering phases and (iii) to formulate an
Eavironmental Impact Statement (HIS) by identifying and quantifying the
probable ipacts, and recomending ways to mitigate these impacts.
Current Information on the Phase 1B Proiect and Proiect Area
6.        Information on the physical characteristics and expected
environmental impact of Phase 1  described below is taken from the
Feasibility Study (1985) and from a familiarization visit to the Phase 1B
area by staff of the LHDA Enviromet Division.  Information an the design
characteristics of the Phase 1B project will need to be updated when final
Terms of Reference are prepared for the execution of the RIA in 1993.
7.        Phase 1B comprises an earthfill dam and reservoir at Mohale and
a tunnel from Mohale to Katse. The catchment of the dam includes the
Senqunyane, Bokong, Likalaneng, and Jordane rivers. The total catcbment
area is 940 sq. km. The full supply level of the reservoir will be 2083
meters above sea level, and the reservoir surface area at full supply will
be 2461 hectares. The Phase 1B project also includes the construction of a
weir on the Matsoku River and a short tunnel connecting this weir to the
Katee Reservoir, as well as short access roads leading to the Mohale
reservoir.
S.        It is estimated that 2,300 hectares of arable and grazing land
will be inundated, thus affecting 4,732 people. At least 470 people from
84 households will need to be resettled. There are therefore serious
social and environmental problems to be solved. In fact, exper@R'ce
elsewhere, and in Phase IA so far, suggests that the magnitude of such
problems is always underestimated. Hence, carefully pluaned studies will
be needed for Phase 1B.
9.        The main problem will be the relocation and separation of
coamsnities, and loss of arable and grazing land. The numbers are small
compared to water development schemes of similar magnitude to the LHWP.
However, due to the shortage of land in Lesotho, even these numbers present
a difficult problem. There will be a need, therefore, for a detailed
socio-economic survey of the area and follow-up social and economic impact
studies. Phase IA experience indicates that major project impacts can also
be expected in the areas of public health and nutrition. Thus there is
also a need to establish baseline conditions in these areas.
10.       The terrestrial flora and fauna of the Phase 1B area are more or
less similar to those of Phase IA. However, Phase 13 is more isolated than
Phase lU, and as a result wildlife (e.g. mountain reebuck) is less rare.
The rare and endangered spiral aloe (Aloe poliphylla) is present in the
area. The vegetation is predominantly HMarrhenia-Themeda-Cymbopogon-
ZrEArostis grassland with some alpine vegetation. The rare Maluti Minnow
(Pseudobarbus guathlambae) is known to inhabit the upper reaches of the
Jordane River. The area has not been well studied and a baseline
biological survey will need to be carried out to establish definitively



- 127 -
Aune 6-2
Page 3 of S
the presence or absence of species requiring special protection during
Phase 15.
11.       Other areas of likely Important impact will be wetland ecology,
landscape and visual effects, public health, vater borne diseases, cultural
heritage, limology, and reservoir sedimentation. There will be a need for
a baseline physical survey of the catchment area to establish current
conditions vith respect to soil erosion, water quality, and streamflows.
Specialized consultant assistance will be needed in some of these areas.
particularly those which require mathematical modelling In order to
deteminfe expected reservoir Impacts.
12.       Secondary impacts of the project are expected to include
employment generation, the social and environmental impact of the
construction work force, and the effects of the loss of arable land on
Income and welfare in the project area.
Scope of Work
13.       The Phase 1B environmental studies to be carried out during the
Phase lA Construction Project will be done in two phases. First,
reconnaissance studies of the Phase 13 area will be done in conjunction
with technical studies to optimize the location and dimensions of the Phase
13 Project. Once the optimization study results are known and the optimal
alternative has been selected for detailed design, an Environmental Impact
Statement will be prepared for this alternative. This statement will
identify the Impacts to be addressed in subsequent environmental planning
studies for Phase 13, not included in the Phase IA construction project.
A.   Reconnaissance Studies
14.       These studies must t  closely coordinated with the definition
and assessment of different design alternatives for Phase 13. The
following specialized assistance will be required at this stages
Man Months
- Identification of project affected population              2
- Aquatic biology, including fisheries                       2
* Erosionjsedimentation study                                1
- Flora and fauna survey                                     1
* Archaeological survey                                      1
Total                                                     mm
15.       The studies will be designed and conducted in order to provlde
an order of magnitude estimate of impacts and environmental costs
associated with each design alternatlve. Recent aerial photography at
appropriate scale will be used as a basis for determining, in conjunction
with limited ground surveys, the location and numbers of households,
settlements, arable lands, other agricultural resources, and existing
access in the project area. The cost of obtaining aerial photography of

the Phase 13 project area is Included in the estimate of reconnaissance
study costs.
16.       Extended tim. is required for the aquatic biology work because
of the recorded presence in Ibe project area of the endangered MalutL
Minnow, Pseudobarbus Quathlhebao. the erosionisedimentation study should
be closely coordinated with the hydrological work to be carried out by LHDA
and consultants in connection with the Phase 13 optimiwation study. The
flora and fauna survey will focus on the location of the rare Aloe
ployphylla and any remnant large mamals in the project area. The
archaeological survey will be a surface reconnaissance to identify sites
that may require further study in the detailed design phase.
17.       Reconnaissance studies will be carried out in project year
1992/93, in parallel with the Phase 1B optimisation study. A draft report,
in 10 copies, comparing the environmental costs and benefits of the
different design alternatives considered In the optimLsation study, will be
completed by December 1993. LUDA will provide a copy of this draft report
to the World Bank by March 1994 for coimnts. The Environmental Panel for
1994 will also review and comeent on this report. A final report will be
prepared In 10 copies by June 1994 and one copy will be provided to the
lank.
S.  Environmental Impact Assessment
18.       Once the optimal design alternative has been selected for
detailed study, an Environmental impact Assessment should be prepared for
this alternative. Thls will requir execution of the following surveys:
- Baseline socioeconomic census and income/expenditure survey
- Baseline health and nutrition survey
- Baseline physical survey of the catchment area
- Baseline biological survey of the catcbment area
19.       In addition, specialist Input will be required in the following

20.       The EIA will be carried out through a participatory process
involving frequent review and cammute by the LEDA Liaison Conmittee, by
local chiefs and people living in the Phase 1B area, and by interested
outside parties such as national and international NGOs. The Environmental
Panel will also participate In this review process. Public participation
In the Elk process will be jointly oranized by LEDA's Environment Division
and Public Relations Division, In consultation with national, local, and
traditional authorities in Lesotho. Staff of the Environmental Secretariat
to be established in the Ministry of Finance and Planning, which, under the
national Invironmental Action Plan, has oversight responsibility for EIA of
all projects in Lesotho, may be involved with the Phase 1B EIA effort as a
trainlng exercise.
21.       It is expected that the baseline surveys and specialized studies
will be carried out in project year 1993194, and the analysis and
production of the EIA would take place in project year 1994195. A draft
EIA should be available for review no later than June 1995. Because of an
expected widespread distribution, the EIA report will be produced in
1000 copies. It is foreseen that the final report should be submitted to
LEDA by January 1996.
LHDA Staffing and Trainina Requirements
22.       The Manager of the Znvironment Division of LEDA will have
overall responsibility for the management of the EIA of Phase lB. Under
the Environmental Action Plan for Phase lA, suitable Basotho will be
recruited and trained to implement the biology, conservation, compensation
and rural development programmes. These staff will gain experience in
environmental impact management which will be useful in carrying out some
aspects of the ZIA for Phase 1B. However, due to the specialized nature of
the Investigations, both local (outside LHDA) and international experts
will be needed to help carry out the EI. It is necessary, however, that
key LIDA managers be given the training needed to competently manage such a
study.
23.       It is therefore proposed that the study contractor should ensure
that at least one senior manager from the Environment Division participates
in an international training programme in Environmental Impact Assessment.
In addition, short-term training in EIA techniques should be provided to
the professional staff of the Environment Division.

Phase 13 Optimization
Tern of Reference
1.        The Consultants will review all available documentation
pertaining to Phase 13, the projected Matsuko weir and the Mohale
reservoir, and physically reconnoiter the area to confirm, or recommend
additional investigations for potential alternatives of, the most likely
location, timing, and configuration to follow Phase 1A and fulfill the
objectives outlined in the treaty between the Kingdom of Lesotho and the
Republic of South Africa.
2.        The review will include, but not be limited to, the original
feasibility reports, the subsequent optimization studies, and the rainfall
runoff, and other climatological and hydrological data, with particular
attention to the information collected in recent years.
3.        After careful scrutiny of the available maps and aerial
reconnaissance, ground visits will be made to promising alternative
locations on which one or more dams might be located as necessary to
deliver the required additional water. Geological investigations will be
limited to surface investigations with no drilling and no substantial test
pits.
4.        If the projected works appear to be optimm, barring minor
modifications which could be accoomodated in the detailed design stage,
this is to be stated, with any appropriate considerations to be brought to
the attention of the designers. Should alternatives to the projected weir
and/or Mohale reservoir, with sufficient potential to justify additional
investigations be found, terms of reference are to be prepared to
Investigate the alternatives in order to establish which of them should be
Implemented. The terms of reference should include msnmonth and total cost
estlmates for work program contained thereli.
S.        The optimization study is expected to take about six months.  It
should be carried out in calendar 1992, to allow time for any additional
necessary investigation, so that design and construction can be completed
in time to meet the required water deliveries. It should be conducted in
parallel vith an environmental impact study, which would include the
anticipated environmental impact in the consideration of alternatives.
6.        Progress reports will be prepared every two months and a draft
final report should be presented at about siz months after the start of the
study. Following review and comments by LUDA and JPTC within 60 days, a
final report will be prepared within 30 days.

Mr. Stephen M. Denning
The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Denning,
PROPOSIX.A MN PUNCZON                 FMDY3ONNY
The purpose of this letter is to set out the major issues and
considerations that will be taken into account by the Government
of the Kinqdom of Lesotho in the utilisation of the resources of
the Development Fund established under the Lesotho Highlands
water Project (LHWP).
a. Link Betw   the Fud and th  PSIP
The methodology to be used in establishing investment criteria
under the Fund will be consistent with that used under the Public
Sector Investment Programme (PSIP). The objective is that the
Fund will complement rather than compete with other investment
projects implemented with the Government's own resources or with
donor assistance.
B. Seleion of Proects on Basig or Rate ol Retur
The Fund will play a major role in the implementation of the
existing PSIP through the allocation of part of its resources to
investment projects in the PSIP. In this respect, the selection
of the best. set of projects would guarantee the optimum use of
the Fund's resources. The selection of investment opportunities
will involve comparison between capital expenditure options.
The Government will secure the Fund's resources with low risk
foreign investments yielding the highest possible rates of
return. All investment projects with economic rates of return
(ERR) equal to or exceeding the above   threshold will be
considered for financing by the Fund.



- 132 -                Annex 7-1
Page 2 of 5
In Lesotho we are faced with the following additional features:
(1) the number of projects that can be implemented, irrespective
of their yields, is limited by capacity constraints: (ii) the
country' s development strategy revolves around the strengthening
of  both  its  human  and    capital  stocks:  and  (iii)  the
implementation of PSIP is largely determined by the availability
of external resources. The Fund's contribution may focus on
accelerating the implementation process of the existing PSIP.
Accelerating the implementation of a project normally contributes
substantially to increase the rate of return. Given that it will
operate in the context of the PSIP, the Fund will also seek to
supplement donor-supported investment programmes.
Annex 1 attached proposes a practical approach for project
selection that takes into account the issues mentioned above.
C. other Klelents for th Protect Selection Process
*eaaive Criteri . It should be noted that in some cases it will
not be possible to calculate a project's EMR (this could be the
case for projects in the social sectors or in areas where a
project's output cannot be quantified). In such cases (see Annex
1), the project selection procedure may have to incorporate
negative criteria such as "Government's development objectives."
Sustainabilitd. The level of recurrent expenditure associated
with projects selected for financing under the Fund will have to
be carefully monitored by the Government.   The sum of all
recurrent expenditure associated with selected projects will have
to be compared with their overall budgetary impact (following the
procedure being established for the PSIP). This would include
the impact of the projects in terms of both expected recurrent
costs and expected revenues.
hasL. The spreading of risks associated with any investment will
be analysed as a factor in selecting a project's risks.
Crowdina-out o      anI Corition. There is a need to obtain
the maximum complemntarity with donor supported activities in
Lesotho. The Government will strive to ensure that projects
financed from the Fund will not displace funds available from
donors and will also seek to achieve an optimum sharing of the
risks of projects with the donor comunity.
D. Allocation to te Revenue Stabilization Accountz.
After allocation is made to the Development Account, the
remaining resources of the Fund will be placed in the two
Stabilisation Accounts provided for in the Fund's regulations.

Page 4 of 5
Projects for which no ERR can be calculated after appraisal (due
to the intrinsic characteristics of the output, e.g. social
service improvements), the selection process will be as follows:
Stage - Ql    Identify  only  projects  that  contribute
significantly  to  the  Government's  stated  development
objectives in the priority areas of the country's
development strategy (social sectors, projects that aim at
diversifying the economy, also those that are labour-
intensive and export-oriented). As in the selection stages
outlined earlier, projects identified after this screening
will be those with donor financing and government
contribution, new projects for which donor support is
expected,  (but with  no  government  contribution),  and
unfunded projects.
Sa&Aq l: Select projects that passed Stage 0 ..... those
with dc ior financing and increase the Government's
contri, dion to 20-30 percent. To be totally financed by
the Go ernment, a project under this category will be
appraised, discussed and approved by the relevant entities
of the Fund and the Government.
Satge tt  For totally unfunded  projects, the Government
should plan to contribute 5-10 percent and seek donor co-
financing.   Projects under this selection stage,  will
preferably be assured of donor support before benefiting
from the Fund.



Annex 7-1
Page 5 of S
LESOTHO HIGHLANDS WATER PRO T DEVELDET  DM
TENTATIVE PROCEDURES FOR PJEW   SELECTION
Taking the PSIP as the given limit of the Government's project
implementation capability, the selection of projects through an
adequate appraised economic rate of return (ERR) will follow the
following three -stage approach:
Stage 1D Identify all projects whose ERR is higher than the
agreed   "threshold rate"  (not just a positive ERR); the
"threshold rate" needs to be carefully discussed and determined
and should represent the social discount rate and/or the
opportunity cost of capital investment plus an agreed risk
premium (for example one alternative use of the Fund's resources
would be building foreign assets for which South Africa's savings
deposit rate ...... about 17-18 percent today in nominal terms
would be an indicator).
StaU22. Within projects identified under Stage 1, there may be
existing donor-financed projects with government contribution,
new projects for which there is an expected donor support and no
qovernment commitment, and unfunded projects.   The selection
process will be as follows: the Fund will select all projects
with donor support and, for each project either (a) provide a
qovernment contribution, if not already beinq provided, or (b)
increase the level of the existing contribution to 40-50 percent.
This will simultaneously accelerate project implementation and
minimize investment risks for the Government.   For unfunded
projects, the Government may decide to make an initial
contribution of 10 -20 percent and seek d4nor co-financing. To
be totally financed by the Government, a project should have a
very high ERR (i.e. well above the "threshold rate'plus a risk
premium).
Stage 3. For projects below the cut-off "threshold rate," but
above 60 - 70 percent of South Africa's savings deposit rate
(i.e. projects with an ERR of about 10 percent), the procedure
outlined above will apply, but with a lower government
contribution. The selection process will be as follows: the
Fund will select all projects with donor support and, for each
project, either (a) provide a government contribution if not
already being provided (but at a lower level than under StagQe 2),
or (b) increase the level of the existing contribution of 5-10
percent and seek donor co-financing. Projects in this category
will preferably be assured of donor support before benefiting
from the Fund.

LSSOTHO HIGHLANDS WATnE PROJECT (PHASE 1A
Economic Rate of Return Calculation
A.          The Water Transfer Component
The economic rate of return analysis is based on the financial
costs in Annez 4-3 and on economic benefits in the form of consumers,
willingness to pay for the water delivered by the project.
Capital costs in constant 1990 prices are computed using base cost
data (with physical contingencies) and includes
a) In Lesotho; Katse dam, transfer and delivery tunnels and
associated infrastructure and construction supervision, 6OL costs
for the JPTC, 90S of LHDA's administrative costs and
environmentallcompensationlrural development costs. Source;
Annex 4-3.
b) In the RSA; transfer tunnel, associated infrastructure and
construction supervision and administrative costs. Source DWA.
Operating costs are estimated at 1Z of capital costs.
Benefits are estimated by the following two benefit flowss
a) tariff revenues from the bulk sales of the water delivered from
the project. Water sales will increase from 336 million m3 in 1996
to 710 million m3 p.a. between 2002 and 2045. Bulk tariffs are
estimated at R0.40 in 1996 and 10.50 per m3 thereafter in line
with envisaged (real) tariff increases from DWA (distribution
costs are estimated at RO.8. resulting in consumer tariff being
R1.2 in 1996 and R1.3 in subsequent years).

Economic Rate of Return Calculation
D.          The Hydropower Component
The economic rate of return is based on the financial costs In
Annea 4-3 and on financial savings realised by reduced electricity
imports from the RSA.
Capital costs in constant 1990 prlces are computed using base cost
data and include construction of the projects' hydropower
component (including transmission lines to connect to the national
grid) and construction supervision.
Operational costs are estimated as 12 of capital costs.
Administration and environmental costs are estimated as 10? of
LEDA's total environmental and administrative costs in Annex 4-3.
Physical Contingencies are as in Annex 4-3.
benefits are valued at constant energy and power tariffs paid by
LEC to  S0OM in 1990 (data from LEC).
Capacity benefit; Each kV produced is priced at M20.77 plus 1?
charged by 1S10) for transmission, and would increase by 0.5Z p.a.
in real terms (in line with ES0) long-run past tariff data).
nergy benefits Each kWh produced is priced at M0.03845 plus 1I
charged by ESMM for transmission and would increase by 0.51 p.a.
in real terms (in line with long-run past tariff data).
Capacity and energy outgut; Electricity production would start in
1996 at 42 MW and llu million kWh. Capacity would reach 66 MW by
2002, and energy production would grow to reach 520 million kWh
p.a. by 2008 (data from LEDA).

Economic Rate of Return Calculation
D.          Alternative Calculation for the Water Transfer Component
An alternative calculatLon of the nRR for the Water Transfer
Component has been carried out with a different definition of benefits
than that used in section A. of thls annex. Instead of using consuivre
surplus as benefit the fnioncial revenues from a levy imposed on sales
of water from existing sources has been used. Costs and other
assumptions are the sam as in section A.
Benefits in this alternative calculation are estimated by the
following two beneflt flows,
a) bulk tariff revenues from the sales of the water delivered from
the project as In section A.
b) revenues from a levy imposed on sales of water from other
sources to assist in the financing of the project. Water amounts
will increase from 1257 million m3 in 1991 to 1540 million dS p.a.
between 2005 and 2045. The levy will Lcrease from R0.06 per m3 in
1991 to O.38 In 1997 and thereafter.

Alternative Rate of Retumn Calculation of the Hydropower Comonent
Calculation of Economic Rate of Return
B.          Alternative Calculation for the Hydropower Component
Since an estimated 752 of the funds for the hydropower component
would be additional funds for Lesotho, an alternative ERR is calculated
below, expressing the desirability of the project strictly from
Lesotho's point of view. Benefits are the same as in the main
calculation, but costs are calculated differently. 252 of costS between
1991 and 1997 (and all costs thereafter) are measured as in the main
calculation, but 752 of the costs are measured as the debt service
payment Lesotho would pay if a loan to be repaid over 20 years at an
interest rate of 32 p.a. were obtained to pay for 752 of costs between
1991 and 1997. These terms correspond to the average financing terms of
the envisaged funding for the component.
Debt service for the loan has been calculated on the following
assumptions; (i) the loan would pay 752 of all hydropower component
costs between 1991 and 1997 during which time no repayments ould be
made and no interest would accrue; (il) loan repayments would take place
at the end of each year between 1998 and 2017 with equal installments of
principal (i.e. 52 of the total loan amount) plus Interest at 3Z p.a. of
the outstanding amounts (iii) the loan would be in US$ and be repaid in
U8$, and debtservice In Haloti has been calculated assuming purchase
power parity and 152 p.a. Inflation for Haloti and 62 p.a. for US$; and
(iv) the debtservice payments have been deflated by 152 p.a. to express
them In current 1990 prices In the table below.

Water SuMIZ and Dewmad in the Vaal Area
A.   Water Demand
1.        The Department of Water Affairs (DWA) in Pretoria has estimated
the total water demand in the Vaal river supply area (i.e. the Vaal basin
and the other basins receiving water from the Vaal) to increase by 32 p.a.,
i.e. from 2848 million m3 in 1989 to 8370 million m3 by 2025. Practically
all of this increase, or 982, will be derived from the power, urban and
Industrial sectors, with the remaining 22 coning from the agricultural
sector. This reflects RSA's transition from agriculture towards an
industrial based economy. The projected growth rates of water demand are
judged reasonable, given that urban and industrial water demands in the
area have been growing at an exponential rate in excess of 52 per year for
more than 70 years. The past growth rates have fluctuated from year to
year, mainly as a result of water management policies in the form of tariff
actions to cope with periodic droughts which have necessitated the
imposition of restrictions.

2.        It is estimated that 672 of the total increased water demand up
until 2025 in the Vaal river supply area would come from increased water
use In the urban/industrial sector in the so-called Pretoria-Vitwatererand-
Vereenisgin (PWV) area in the RSA, located some 400 km north of Lesotho.
There are no commonly accepted borders defining the location of the
expanding Pm area, but it is popularly thought of as the area stretching
from Rustenburg in the west to Nigel in the east, and from Klipvoor Dam in
the north to the Sasolburg and Vaal Dam area in the south.

B.   Water Supply in the Vaal River Area
4.        The Vaal River originates in northeastern RSA, west of
Swaziland. Shortly after coanencing its journey westward, it flows into
the Grootdraai dam, constructed in 1979. The dam is the main tool for
water management in the upper Veal supply region. From Grootdraai dam, the
Vaal flows westward into the Vaal dam, originally built in 1938 but raised
In 1956 and 1986 to increase its capacity to today's 2500 million m3.  In
the Veal reservoir, the Vasl is joined by its main tributary, the Wilge
River which brings quality water from the high areas of the Drakensberg
from the south, and links the Veal and Sterkfontein dams. The
Liebenbergsvlei River also feeds into the Vaal reservoir.
5.        From the Vaal dam, water is released to the Veal barrage
downstream where it is extracted for consumption in the industrial and
urban areas of the P1V area, and for other users further downstream. The
Vaal barrage was the first non-irrigation water project when it was
constructed in 1923. The Vaal River continues its flow toward the
southwest, picking up groundwater discharges from the dolomite area to the
west and surface runoff from the east.
6.        Bloemhof dam, with a capacity of 1300 million m3, was built In
1970 to provide irrigators and towns in the lower Veal region with water
and to alleviate the pressure on the Veal dam. Below Bloemhof dam the
principal tributaries are the Modder and Rlet rivers from the west which
together are the largest single contributors to the Vaal, but often with no
natural runoff.

7.        The present firm yield 1l of the Vaal river system.
comprising the Grootdraai, Vaal and Slomhof reservoirs, is estimated at
1537 million mS per year. To meot the lncreasing demand in P1V and the
upstream areas supplied from Grootdraai dam, water has been transferred
from the Tugela River to the Val system since 1974. The transfer scheme
Includes Woodstock dam and Driel barrage from where water from the
watershed is pumped over the mountains to the Kilburn dan. From there the
water is pumped to Sterkfontein dam where it joins the Wilge Rliver and
enters the Vaal river system. Transfers from the Tugela Rliver via
Sterkfontein dam can amount to 1000 million mS per year, of which 800
million mS is considered the firm yield Increment to the PsV area. A system
of pumps, pipelines and canals transfer an additional 121 m3 per year from
the Assegaai River (one of the tributaries to the Usutu liver) to the upper
reaches of the Vaal. Additional sources In the Vaal catchbent and in
neighboring catchments supplied by the Veal through transfers (groundwater.
wells, other dams in the tributaries, etc.) supply another estimated 300
muSyear in firm yield, which brings the total firm yield for the Veal river
supply sources to about 2758 million mS per year.
S.        A substantial part of the water used is recycled via return
flows. The share of the water used that flows back Into the supply system
increases as water use goes up. Return flow in 1989 is estimated at 460
million m3 (16? of demand), and is expected to increase to 1620 million .3
(29? of demand) by 2010.
9.        Comparing firm supply (and return flow) with projected demand
shows that the risk of supply failure will increase above 22 from 1996197.
However, since vast amounts of water are stored in existing reservoirs,
adequate water supply is judged to be ensured until about 1998. After
1998, water from LHUP, or some other inter-basin transfer scheme, will be
critically needed to avoid water supply failure.
U    Firm yield is defined as the yield that can be achieved with 981
certainty.

C.   LHWP - The Least Cost Option
10.       The LHWP is the least-cost option for supplying additional water
to the Vaal River Supply Area in the RSA. A comparative analysis of the
cost for different water supply alternatives carried out in 1983 confirmed
this. The net present cost for LBWP without royalties (i.e. counting only
the resources to be used for construction and operation) was R 0.105 per
m31second. Including royalty payments for Lesotho, the cost was R0.165.
Transferring water from the Tugela catchment was the next-best option at
RO.171 cent per m3isec, followed by the OVTS scheme, at RO.219. An
alternative called the Orange Vaal Weirs Transfer Scheme, aiming at
transferring water from the Vaal confluence with the Orange further
upstream of the Vaal, would cost RO.25 per m3/sec. A study estimating the
cost of transferring water from the Zambezi arrived at a similar figure.
and the most costly alternative turned out to be desalination of sea water
and transfer to the Vaal from Richards Bay. Transfers from the Tugela have
been expanded since the study was done, and it is doubtful if further
transfers are possible from the Tugela as other users downstream also claim
the remaining water. The conclusion is, therefore, that LHWP is the least
cost option to increase the water supply, and the OVTS is the second least
cost option.

Figure 2: LHWP is the least cost solution
for meeting the projected water demand.
11.       In 1984, the LHW  and the OVTS were further assessed, including
combinations between them which would result in a total of 70 m3lsec p.a.
being transferred. The results of the studies again showed that the LHWP
would be the most economical way to supply the Vaal river system with this
annual volume. For a 50-year life span of the transfer scheme, discounting
capital. operation and maintenance costs at 6 percent showed that 14W
would cost about R1.9 billion in 1983 prices less than the OVTS scheme. It
would be more cost effective to combine the schemes than to pursue the
"pure* OVS project, but less costly to go ahead with the LHW alone.
12.       The economic superiority of the LEW over the hypothetical OVTS
depends on lower capital costs as well as significantly lower operating
costs. About half of the LNW water would be transferred by gravity while
the OVTS, which is entirely pumped, would require considerable energy as
well as a major capital investment. The cost for electricity alone for the
OVTS was estimated at R 60 million per year in 1986.
