MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Ghana
Energv Proiect (Credit 1373-GH)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report
on Ghana - Energy Project (Credit 1373-GH)" prepared by the Africa Regional
Office.  While the Borrower did not prepare Part II, the report provides a
comprehensive and informative account of the Project and its outcome.
After a slow start, substantial objectives were met: the project
attracted foreign oil companies to invest in exploration in Ghana; it also
assisted the GOG in increasing the price of petroleum products to nearly
international levels, in establishing two national energy institutions and in
training local technical staff in petroleum geology and geophysics. However, the
Ghana National Petroleum Company is now deeply involved in high risk direct
exploration activities which had originally been intended to be left to foreign
companies.  Furthermore, no commercial deposits were discovered.  Overall,the
project is rated as unsatisfactory.
Eight studies were executed, a number of which helped the Government
decide against development of marginal energy resources. Studies on renewable
energy resources were never completed, and a work program for investments in
renewable energy was never established.
The Bank accepted a significant change in the project scope after the
original project closing date. The revised project scope included funding for
seismic surveys, drilling, and well testing in support of exploration programs
of foreign oil companies, unrelated to the original project scope and design and
outside the framework of Bank Guidelines for Petroleum lending. About half of
the original credit was used in this manner. While the project achievements in
the institutional area appeared substantial at the time the PCR was prepared,
sustainability was considered uncertain.
An audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GHANA
ENERGY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1373-GH)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Energy Project in the Republic
of Ghana, for which the Credit 1373-GH in the amount of SDR 10.2 million (US$11.0
million equivalent at the time of negotiations) was approved on May 24, 1983. The credit
was closed on December 31, 1990, three years behind schedule. The last disbursement
was made on May 17, 1991, and the undisbursed balance of SDR 1,467,650.06 was
canceled.
The PCR was prepared jointly by the Industry and Energy Division of the Western
Africa (AF4) Department in the Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III). The Ghanaian Ministry of Energy (previously Ministry of Fuel and
Power) was on March 3, 1992 requested to comment on a draft Part I of the PCR but to-
date these comments have not been received and therefore not included in Part II of the
Report.
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia on the data available in the project
files, including the President's Report, Credit Agreement, supervision reports,
correspondence between IDA and the Borrower, internal memos and discussions with
some members of the Project team.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GHANA
ENERGY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1373-GH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
BackgrEund
(i)          In the early eighties Ghana was a minor petroleum producer, producing some
1200 barrels per day, to meet 7% of domestic requirements. Although Ghana's economy is
not petroleum intensive by international standards, Ghana's heavy dependence on imported
petroleum and the increased cost of crude oil has strained its foreign exchange situation. In
1982 Ghana paid over US$280 million for petroleum imports, nearly 40% of its estimated
export earnings.
(ii)         Domestic petroleum production was from a small depleted field (Saltpond),
which was about to be abandoned by the Operator, Agripetco. Discoveries of oil and gas
offshore in the South Tano basin by Phillips Petroleum Company were relinquished. In the
onshore part of the Tano basin "tar sands' had been identified and studies by consultants
(Robertson Research, U.K.) indicated that these "tar sands' may in fact be near surface
accumulations of deeper light oil reservoirs.
(iii)        Exploration had demonstrated that the geological conditions necessary to the
formation of oil and gas accumulation exist in Ghana. The Government has decided to take
an active role in rekindling and accelerating exploration development of indigenous
hydrocarbon resources and improving knowledge and use of the country's other energy
resources.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
(iv)         The project's objectives were to: (a) support GOG's efforts to stimulate
interest and accelerate petroleum exploration in the Borrower's territory; and,(b) strengthen
technical capabilities of Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the National
Energy Board (NEB) in the efficient development and management of the country's energy
resources. The Project comprised the following three main components: (a) petroleum
exploration promotion which included evaluation and integration of existing data, processing
and evaluation of additional 1000 kilometers of new seismic and preparation of a promotional
package; (b) revision of petroleum contractual, legal and institutional framework; and (c)
strengthening the technical capabilities of the then proposed GNPC and NEB by providing
them with expert assistance, training, equipment, office and storage space. Furthermore, the
Project included sizable allocations for technical and economic studies (tar sands, Saltpond oil
field evaluation, gas utilization, petroleum products pricing,information management and
safety codes) and assessing of potential and pilot field testing of renewable energy (solar
energy and mini hydropower stations). A complete description of the project components is
given in para 1.06.
Implementation Experience
(v)          Project implementation fell behind the originally programmed schedule and
completion was delayed by three years. The major problems were: (a) delay in establishing,



- iii -
organizing and staffing Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the National
Energy Board (NEB); (b) delay in appointing consultants to carry out studies; (c)
complications resulting from involving several parties in the review of studies and decision
making; and (d) changing the project focus from exploration promotion and technical
assistance to supporting PCIAC's seismic and drilling operations and Arco's company well
drilling and testing program. At the time of the Credit's initial closing date (December 31,
1987) there was a balance of SDR 5,583,446 of undisbursed and for the most part unallocated
funds.
Results
(vi)         The project helped establish and strengthen the National Energy Board and the
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation. The legal framework for petroleum exploration and
production was modified to suit the industry's international climate at the time. These two
factors, the sector institutional set-up and modification of an antiquated legal framework must
have encouraged companies to favorably respond to the promotion campaign arranged by the
private geophysical/contractor, GSI, during the summer of 1984. Three of these companies
formed a consortium, applied for and were granted exploration concessions offshore Ghana.
The basin study and the Tano tar sand evaluation were ready only two years after the
promotional campaign was launched and their usefulness as promotional tools as foreseen in
the project documents was seriously diminished.
(vii)        Implementation of all the studies was delayed by more than two years,
however several of the studies did achieve their objectives. Following the completion of
Saltpond field study the Association advised the Borrower that the field was marginal and any
additional investment would be risky. In anticipation of the findings of the petroleum pricing
study the Borrower had increased the prices of petroleum products to near international levels.
Furthermore, pricing study recommendations have been used to control and optimize refinery
operations and define prices acco?ding to market exchange rates. The establishment of an
'Energy Information Center" and the introduction of computer technology in energy planning
was successful. Impact of the basin study, needed for the exploration promotion campaign
scheduled for 1984, was seriously impaired by the long delays. However, this study was used
later on for another round of promotion in Canada during 1987, which resulted in attracting
a consortium of companies to explore in Ghana.
(viii)       Seismic surveys and interpretations, financed under the credit agreement, were
about five fold what was originally planned at appraisal time. Such an increase was justified
on the grounds of supporting the exploration and the drilling efforts of international oil
companies. The extent to which the expanded seismic program had served that purpose could
not be assessed; nevertheless, it is a valuable addition to the geological/geophysical database
of Ghana.
(ix)      Training of Ghanian nationals, though had a slow start, but turned out to be
highly effective. The Association had supported training programs for trainees in various
disciplines and under different training environments. Some were sent abroad to attend short
courses and others were attached to consultants and contractors while implementing complex
assignments such as two and three dimensional seismic processing and interpretation, geologic
basin studies, gas utilization and information management and energy planning. Use of
computer was introduced to GNPC and NEB and by the time of the project completion
Ghanian nationals were using personal computers in their daily work.

Conclusion and Lessons Learned
(x)           Ghana Energy Project was not a simple petroleum exploration promotional
project. It extended beyond the conventional scope of shooting hundreds of kilometers of
reconnaissance seismic and collating geophysical and geological data to cover a multitude of
complementing but quite distinct areas. Under the project, two major institutions had to be
established along with the requisite organization, staffing, and training. Eight studies had to
be undertaken :(Tano tar sand, geologic basins, Saltpond field, gas utilization, petroleum
product pricing, energy information database, renewable energy, and safety codes and
regulations (para 1.06, project description)). It was highly optimistic to prescribe such a
varied and rich menu, particularly as, a) this project was the first petroleum operation in
Ghana; b) the entities responsible for most of the implementation were not established at the
time of credit negotiations and their future performance was unknown to the Association; and
c) the demand on staff time to supervise all the studies and to coordinate various activities
appears in retrospect beyond the norms set by the Bank for project supervision.
(xi)          The Association had extended itself, after the original closing date of the
credit, to financing a huge seismic acquisition, processing, and interpretation program in
addition to funds approved for drilling consumables and wells drilling and testing. The
Association was not only monitoring the activities of foreign petroleum companies, but
complementing their exploration and appraisal work over which the Association had little or
no control. At such juncture, the Association might have considered one of two options: a)
to limit the financing to the components indicated in the Credit Agreement and consider the
balance as surplus; and, b) change the Credit Agreement, adding particular covenants to
address the changes in the project concept and the new project scope. Such an action could
not have been taken at the time since the original Credit closing date had coincided with the
Bank reorganization, the dissolution of the Energy Department and the redeployment of its
staff.
(xii)         It appears that one of the thorny issues IDA's supervision mission had to
contend with was addressing, and in some cases satisfying, the needs of various
donors/operators (para 1.10). This was particularly evident after the Government tied the
award of studies' contract and some of the services to the availability of grant financing (para
1.15). There was no justification for the Association to grant the borrower such freedom,
when IDA's funds were available and earmarked for the particular studies/services and
involving other parties would result in considerable delays and dilution of IDA's role.

PART I - PROJECr REVIEW FROM IDA'S PERSPECIVE
A.    PROJECT IDENTITY
Project Name:   Energy Project
Credit Number:  1373-GH
RVP Unit:      Africa Region
Country:       Republic of Ghana
B.    BACKGROUND
1.01        In the early eighties Ghana was a minor petroleum producer, producing some
1200 barrels per day, to meet 7% of domestic requirements. Although Ghana's economy is
not petroleum intensive by international standards, Ghana's heavy dependence on imported
petroleum and the increased cost of crude oil has strained its foreign exchange situation. In
1982 Ghana paid over US$280 million for petroleum imports, nearly 40% of its estimated
export earnings.
1.02         Domestic petroleum productions was from a small depleted field (Saltpond),
which was about to be abandoned by the Operator, Agripetco. Discoveries of oil and gas
offshore in the South Tano basin by Phillips Petroleum Company were relinquished. In the
onshore Tano area "tar sands' had been identified and studies by consultants (Robertson
Research, U.K.) indicated that these 'tar sands' may in fact be near surface accumulations of
deeper light oil reservoirs.
1.03         Exploration had demonstrated that the geological conditions necessary to the
formation of oil and gas accumulation exist in Ghana. The Government had thus decided to
take an active role in rekindling and accelerating exploration development of indigenous
hydrocarbon resources and improving knowledge and use of the cbuntry's other energy
resources.
1.04         The Government had changed its previous ad hoc approach of awarding
exploration acreage within an antiquated and ineffective legal framework to engaging in a full
exploration promotion effort. To this end the Goverment negotiated a 7,300 km speculative
seismic survey (at an estimated cost of US$7.3 million) with GSI, USA, with no outlay by
Ghana. In parallel, and with financial assistance by IDA under two advances from PPF
amounting to US$715,000 (approved August, 1980 and May 1982) the Government hired
qualified international consultants to: (a) evaluate existing and recently acquired geological
and geophysical data and integrate them in packages which will be used as the basis for
defining and evaluating concessions; (b) study and prepare organization of Ghana national
petroleum company (GNPC)and a national energy board (NEB); (c) study and recommend
changes to the old petroleum law, draw-up a model "exploration/production contract" and
assist in contract negotiations; and (d) evaluate past performance and future recovery of
Ghana's single producing oil field (Saltpond).

C.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
1.05         The primary objectives of the project were to rekindle interest and accelerate
petroleum exploration in Ghana. It would entail collection, processing and evaluation of all
past exploration data, acquisition of some new data as well as evaluation of new seismic data
to be acquired under a 7,700 km seismic survey financed by a private geophysical company.
The work would provide the first countrywide assessment of the petroleum prospects in
Ghana, essential to intensifying petroleum exploration in the country. The project would also
aim at strengthening the technical capabilities of the proposed Ghana National Petroleum
Corporation and the National Energy Board, thus assisting in the efficient development and
management of the country's energy resources.
1.06         The project included the following components:
(a)    Petroleum Exgloration Promotion
Under this component consultants (200 man-months) would be retained to
assist in:
(i)   retrieving, reviewing and interpreting existing geological and
geophysical data, including a basin source rock analysis, and a
comprehensive stratigraphic study of available well information;
(ii)   evaluation of all data generated by the seismic survey to be carried out
by GSI and integrating it with existing data;
(iii)  acquisition and evaluation of 1,000 km of new data in the Tano
offshore afea recently relinquished by Phillips Petroleum Company;
(iv)   collection and evaluation of new data on the Tano Tar Sands area,
including data from some 75 km of seismic lines and samples from 5
core holes;
(v)   revision of the country's petroleum legislation and the formulation of
draft model petroleum exploration and production agreements;
(vi)   preparation of a promotional package for the oil industry and
organization of bidding by oil companies on acreage open for
exploration;
(vii)  negotiation of exploration contracts with oil companies;
(viii)  monitoring the activities of operating oil companies and integrating the
data they furnish into existing knowledge of the basin;
(ix)   monitoring the activity at Saltpond and if necessary completing the
Saltpond reservoir engineering study;



- 3 -
(b)    Assistance to the Ghana National Petroleum CoCporation
As part of the exploration promotion effort, the project would fund the
services of geological and petroleum engineering experts who would reside in
Ghana for one to two years and advise GNPC on a day-to-day basis with
regard to petroleum matters as well as provide on-the-job training. The
project would also provide for training abroad of about six to eight Ghanians
in petroleum geology, geophysical, engineering, economics and law (short-
term courses); three students for an eighteen month diploma course, and one
Ghanian for a two-year post graduate course in petroleum geology and
engineering. This training program would be finalized by consultants to
GNPC, and would have to be satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.01 (d)
of the Development Credit Agreement). The project also included funds to
extend an existing building, and provide for storage facilities for well cores
and samples as well as equipment for reproducing and storing seismic sections
and well logs;
(c)    Assistance to the National Eneray Board.
This component would fund technical assistance services for energy
economists (36 man-months), renewable energy specialists who would reside
in Ghana for up to one year, as well as short term visits of other economic
and engineering experts (10 man-months) who would provide on-the-job
training to NEB staff and assist the Board in specific tasks, including the
following:
(i)    Establishment of an energy information center which will comprise of
a computerized energy statistical data base and an energy library;
(ii)    Preparation of a work plan for investments in the renewable energy
sector;
(iii)   Carrying out a petroleum pricing study to determine wholesale and
retail prices, and mechanism for adjusting these prices;
(iv)   Carrying out a natural gas utilization study, including an evaluation of
potential domestic markets;
(v)    Carry out other studies that will serve as the basis for drawing up a
long-term energy plan for Ghana; and
(vi)   Development of safety and other regulations covering petroleum
exploration and production activities, and the establishment of
procedures for inspecting and monitoring such activities.
The terms of reference for some of these studies were discussed during negotiations. The
Government agreed that it would prepare and discuss the work plan for investments in
renewable energy with the Association prior to December 31, 1985, including plans for
securing foreign currency support for the investment program. The project would include
funds for pilot demonstration projects which would be required in order to prepare the
investment program. The project would also include the provision of equipment, library

material and training. The training component would include the preparation of specialized
material by the resident experts to be used in Ghana, as well as training of Ghanaians abroad.
The final training program will be prepared by the experts funded under the project.
D.    PROJECT PREPARATION. DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
1.07         The project under review was first identified during an IDA energy sector
mission to Ghana in April/May 1980 which recommended PPF in the amount of US$340,000.
IDA approved the PPF on August 14, 1980. The project was appraised in August 1981. In
view of a change in Government in December 1981 and expanding the scope of the PPF to
cover additional institutional, technical and contractual issues a supplemental amount of
US$375,000 was approved by IDA on May 3, 1982. The project was reappraised in January
1983.
1.08         The project concept was discussed during the various missions and through
correspondence between the time it was first identified in 1980 and the time it was reappraised
almost three years later. The project components and objectives were understood and agreed
upon by IDA and the Government at the time of credit negotiations. Studies (financed by
IDA's PPF) on the establishment and the organization of GNPC and NEB were well
underway. Amendments to the petroleum law were seriously considered by the Government.
Model petroleum contracts were drafted by international consultants and studied by the
Association and the United Nations Center for Transnational Corporations.
1.09         On the petroleum exploration promotion side, the consultant was in the
process of collating geological and geophysical data. In the meantime, a private geophysical
contractor was processing and evaluating some 7700 kilometer of speculative seismic data.
According to the agreement between the Government and the geophysical contractor, the
Government provided no outlays'but the contractor had the right to market and sell the data to
prospective interested international oil companies. Assurances were received by IDA during
Credit negotiations that exploration promotion efforts of the geophysical contractor and of the
Government under this project would be coordinated. As it will be explained later (para
1.13), the first promotional seminar was singularly offered by the contractor in mid-1984 long
before additional seismic surveys and basin studies, financed under the project, were
completed.
E.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
1.10         Project implementation fell behind the originally programmed schedule and
completion was delayed by three years. The major problems were: (a) delay in establishing,
organizing and staffing Ghana National Petroleum Company (GNPC) and the National Energy
Board (NEB); (b) delay in appointing consultants to carry out studies; (c) complications
resulting from involving several parties in the review of studies ,award of contracts and
decision making; and (d) changing the project focus from exploration promotion and technical
assistance to supporting GNPC's seismic and drilling operations and well testing program. At
the time of the Credit's initial closing date (December 31, 1987) there was a balance of SDR
5,583,446 of undisbursed which for the most part were unallocated funds. The following
paragraphs provide a detailed account of the implementation of the key project components:



-5 -
1- Explorations Promotion
1.11         As was mentioned earlier, the geophysical contractor, with MFP agreement,
organized three promotional seminars in London, Houston and Calgary in June 1984. At
these seminars 71 offshore blocks were offered to the industry and the new petroleum law and
model contract explained. The seminars were well attended and several major companies had
expressed interest. The promulgation of new petroleum legislation featuring production
sharing contracts and international price parity with full repariation of profits had encouraged
international oil companies to attend the seminars. However, none of these companies were
granted any exploration concessions in Ghana at that time.
1.12         Following the completion of the basin study in mid-1986 another round of
promotion was held in Calgary, Canada. A consortium of three major intenational companies
( Arco, Union and Shell) applied for and were granted exploration rights in the Tano basin.
PCIAC, through a grant from Canada, participated on behalf of GNPC in the operations.
1.13        The Association and the Government had initially agreed to a seismic
acquisition program of 1000 kilometer of new data in the Tano offshore area recently
relinquished by Phillips Petroleum Company. That was in addition to the evaluation of the
seismic surveys carried out by GSI (7,700 kim) at no cost to the Government. Seismic
acquisition as originally provided for under the credit agreement was fulfilled in 1984 by
carrying out a 1,086 km program in South Tano by geophysical contractor Petty Ray.
However, seismic acquisition, processing and evaluation went far beyond the program initially
agreed upon. Frequent additions were proposed by MFP and agreed by the Association on an
ad hoc basis to help locate drilling and appraisal wells and delineate structures. Detailed
seismic grids (4 x 4 km spacing) and highly sophisticated and extremely fine three
dimensional seismic network (not wide spacing reconnasance seismic needed for acreage
promotion) was shot and financedmdMer the project. To illustrate the degree of variance to
the main component MFP requested and the Association agreed, after the initial credit closing
date (December 31, 1987) to reallocate SDR 2 million to additional onshore and offshore
seismic and USS 750,000 to shallow water (trasition zone) seismic (over and above the
original amount allocations of USS One million). Furthermore, an amount of US$665,000
originally earmarked for Tano tar sand study was diverted to seismic surveys. Furthermore,
several million dollars were spent on testing of wells drilled by the exploration
concessionaires and for drilling services ( such as horizontal drilling).
1.14        Launching of the Tano tar sand study, once thought as an important
compliment to the exploration promotions packages was delayed by more than three years
after Credit effectiveness. A total of 175 kilometers of seismic lines were shot and, later on,
eleven deep core holes were drilled in 1987. Additional seismic surveys were run to detect
any deep structural closure but there were none. The study was aborted.
2. Gas Utilization and Petroleum Products Pricing Studies
1.15        The petroleum product pricing study due to be completed by September 30,
1984 was delayed by more than three years due to difficulty in securing MFP approval to
award the contract to consultants. The decision taken by the Government to employ foreign
consultants where suitable through bilateral assistance (grant financing) advesely impacted the
implementation of several studies under the project. The pricing study was initiated after the
Government secured financing from the UN for $60,000. The Association discussed with the
Government an action plan for implementation, which was a condition of effectiveness for a



-6 -
later Credit (Credit 1819 GH). Petroleum products' prices were adjusted upward and were
brought close to international levels. Some other recommendations such as having the refinery
responsible for crude oil purchases were not enacted by thy Government which lead to a delay
in declaring the effectiveness of Cr. 1819 GH by more than a year. Meanwhile, the
relationship between the Association and the Borrower was strained which lead to delaying a
decision on the extension of Credit 1373 GH.
1.16         Natural gas ( and gas liquids) utilization study was also delayed due to time
spent to secure Government approval and later for waiting on a report by the basin study
consultant on the potential of natural gas reserves. Work on this study was completed by
1988. Later, the study was complemented by another study (not under IDA financing) which
covered the configurations and the cost estimates for various sizes of offshore platforms and
pipelines. The natural gas utilization study had very little impact and should have been
cancelled once the only source of natural gas in the country (Saltpond field) was abandoned in
early-1986.
3. Saltpond Field Evaluation
1.17         During the project appraisal the Government requested the Association to
assist in the financing of a reservoir engineering study on the only producing field in Ghana
(the Saltpond field). A study financed under the Credit concluded that the original reserves
were half what was previously estimated. GNPC requested the Association to finance a more
sophisticated study comprising reservoir computer modeling. Results of that latest study were
made available late 1986, long after the concessionaire abandoned the field. IDA's
recommendations did not differ materially from its previous stand and advised GOG that the
field was marginal and any additional investment would be very risky.
4. Establishment of GNPC and NEB and Implementation of Appropriate Training
Ptrogran
1.18         Institution building was one of the main project objectives. In addition to the
exploration promotion the two other components that commanded an almost equal allocation
of funds were assistance to the National Oil Company and the National Energy Board.
Formation and organization of these two entities was studied under the PPF advance some two
years before the credit effectiveness. Legislation establishing the two entities was passed in
September 1984 and the appointment of the NEB board of directors and approval of GNPC
organization chart were not done except two years after Credit effectiveness. Delays in the
formation and the operation of these organizations and the absence of other executive entities
directly responsible for implementation seriously impacted the pace of project execution for
several years.
1.19         Institutional in effectiveness and unfamiliarity with IDA's procedures early in
the project life not withstanding, both GNPC and NEB had greatly benefitted from the
project. Many staff members were trained on applying latest technology (processing and
interpretation of seismic data, petroleum engineering, regional and development geology) as
well as petroleum marketing and international law. Training was done through short courses,
attachment of nationals to consultants during execution of studies and working along with
resident and visiting experts. Computer technology was introduced to NEB and Ghanaian
nationals were trained to develop national energy balance. A library and an information
center were established, albeit a bit late (1987).



-7-
1.20        During project implementation GNPC had expanded to a huge organization of
some four hundred employees which was way beyond the scope conceived at the time of
project preparation. Its role had undergone considerable changes; instead of being a
government entity responsible for attracting and negotiating with international oil companies
GNPC assumed the role of an operator. It mobilized external financing to explore and drill
offshore wells. During the Credit extension periods IDA had assisted in the financing of
seismic acquisition, far beyond the project scope, and the consequent well drilling and testing
services. The new role which GNPC assumed was different from the one originally conceived
under the project.
5. Energy Information Center
1.21        A contract to study and establish an Energy Information Center was signed
November, 1985 with Sema-Metra Conseil, France. The tasks undertaken by the consultants
were to: (a) create and initially operate a computerized national energy data base; (b)
establish and organize energy planning; (c) design and provide appropriate information
services to managers, planners and workers; and (d) make recommendations for long term
development. By January 1987 all above tasks were successfully implemented. The
consultant work was fully documented by a six-volume final report.
6. Field Testing in Renewable Energy
1.22        The scope of work, consultancy requirements and the role of the executing
agency (NEB) were subject of discussions between the Association and MFP up to October
1985. Solar radiation measuring equipment were bought in 1986, installed in February 1988
and functioned for only couple of months before breaking down. A request was made on
November 5, 1990 by the Government to engage an expert on solar water heating which was
not approved on account of timing being close to Credit closing date.
1.23        By the end of 1985 MFP contracted Arch and Engineering Services
Corporation of Ghana (AESC) to study the potential of mini-hydro sites in the southern part
of the country. AESC identified forty sites and provided economic/financial analysis of the
three most viable ones. This sub-component (power generation) was later cancelled as per
MFP's request.
7. Office Building and Eguipment
1.24        -Data storage facilities for GNPC and the warehouse for classifying and storing
the cores were completed in February 1991.
F.    PROJECT RESULTS
1.25        The project helped establish and strengthen the National Energy Board and the
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation. The legal framework for petroleum exploration and
production was modified to suit the industry's international climate at the time. These two
factors, the sector institutional set-up and modification of an antiquated legal framework must
have encouraged companies to favorably respond to the promotion campaign arranged by the
private geophysical/contractors, GSI, during the summer of 1984. Though that round of
promotion was unsuccessful in attracting international oil companies to explore in Ghana
but it helped call attention to Ghana's prospects. Another round of promotion was held in
Calgary,Canada, following the completion of the basin study. Three companies formed a



consortium, applied for and were granted exploration concessions offshore Ghana. Results
were disappointing and the companies relinquished the area at the end of 1990.
1.26         Based on the results of the Saltpond field study the Association advised the
Borrower that the field was very marginal and the field had been abandoned. Preempting the
results of the petroleum pricing study the Govermnent had increased the prices to near
international levels. In addition, the study helped the Government to adopt a formula for the
determination of refinery margins, level of taxes and retail sale prices. Other studies , with
the exception of the energy data base study, were not as useful; some were generic and others
were not completed.
1.27         Aside from the major delays in implementing key studies, a main variance
was the modification made of the acquisition and interpretation of seismic surveys and
financing drilling and testing services. Seismic surveys as originally provided in the credit
agreement were completed before the end of 1984. Such surveys were meant to be wide-grid
reconnaissance type to help promote interest in exploration. During the course of the project
several wells were drilled offshore in the Tano area, where oil and gas was previously
discovered, but later abandoned, by Phillips Petroleum Company. Additional surveys were
approved for the reason of delineating structures, locating appraisal wells and developing
discoveries. The main variance was not only the magnitude of the additional surveys (four
folds the original program) but the change in the project focus.
1.28         Several NEB and GNPC staff were sent overseas for short courses which
proved effective. Many Ghanaian nationals profited from on-the-job training and working
with consultants/contractors particularly in areas of geological and geophysical data processing
and interpretation and energy planning. Introduction of computer usage to GNPC and NEB
operations and technology transfer on various levels and disciplines of the petroleum industry
has been effective.
G.    PROJECT SUSTAINABIIY
1.29         The sustainability of the project component related to exploration promotion
and strengthening of Ghana National Petroleum Corporation depends on new production
sharing agreements being concluded with foreign petroleum companies. The basin study and
extensive seismic work financed under the project coupled with information on oil and gas
potential resulting from the work of foreign companies could form the basis for negotiating a
production sharing contract. Ghana may need to further modify its petroleum law and model
contract in a way to fully compensate foreign partners for their efforts in the development and
the production of natural gas resources.
1.30         The functioning of the National Energy Board (or its successor, the Energy
Commission) in national energy planning and maintance of a sound and reliable energy data
base would depend on the infusion of minimal amount of foreign exchange needed to maintain
the equipment and the software and keep the staff abreast of new developments. It appears
that Ghana could easily mobilize such modest financing through bilateral aid.

H.    IDA's Performance
1.31         IDA provided an advance in the amount of US$340,000 for the project
preparation which was supplemented a year later by another advance US$375,000. The
project was well prepared and it embodied all the requisite elements for a successful
exploration promotion effort. However, the Association, based on the favorable experience
during the project preparation, did not fully evaluate, at the appraisal stage, the risk arising
from delays in the formation of GNPC and NEB and hiring foreign consultants. Institutional
difficulties, as it turned out (para 1.18) were the main reason behind an initial delay of two
years and subsequent implementation delays. Furthermore, the Association engaged itself and
spent an exorbitant amount of time and effort in establishing dialogue and coordinating with
other parties. A more effective approach at the time would have been a better definition of
the mission of each party and refocussing on the project objectives.
1.32         In parallel with the project implementation, several wells were drilled by a
consortium of international oil companies and new information on oil and gas potential in the
Tano offshore area were made available. The Association adapted the project to the
Borrower's need by providing huge outlays for additional seismic surveys, drilling services
and wells testing (para. 1.13). The closing date was extended three times for three additional
years to accommodate the changes in the project scope. A few questions may be raised
regarding the efficacy of the Association's role during these three years.
1.33         The Association supervised the project about three times a year on the average
except in 1986,1987 and 1988 when the frequency of the missions was temporarily reduced.
A summary of the use of IDA resources, staff inputs and missions is given in tables 3.8 of
Part IH of this report. A total of 215 staff weeks were used in identifying, appraising and
supervising the project. The reason for such an unusually high input was mainly due to: a) the
political situation in Ghana in the early eighties and the need to reappraise the project; b) the
complicated nature of the project and the activities and studies involved; and, c) the expansion
of the project scope beyond the originally planned.
I.    BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
1.34         Cooperation between MFP and the Association was good during the project
preparation phase. Government commitment to the project waned during the first couple of
years of implementation as illustrated by: (a) serious delays in establishing GNPC and NEB;
(b) laxity in exercising a coordinating role with the private geophysical contractor and
agreeing to launch the promotional campaign in June '84 much before technical inputs from
the project were available; (c) delays in awarding contracts to consultants and equipment and
services suppliers; and (d) frequent change in focus and priorities of GNPC. Such an attitude
persisted throughout the originally scheduled implementation period and reduced the
effectiveness of many of the studies. Given the relative increase in the exploration and the
drilling activities, it appeared that GNPC management was spread thin responding to the
demands of various operators. The role of GNPC was mistakenly conceived, particularly
during the extension periods from 1987 to 1990, as complementing the role of the foreign
operators and not stimulating interest in new ventures.

J.    CONSULTANTS' SERVICES
1.35         Consultants' performance was on the whole satisfactory. The basin study, was
well prepared and helped trigger some interest from the international oil companies. The
pricing study which was financed through a UN grant addressed the basic issues and met its
objectives. The consulting personnel in charge of the data bank and energy information study
helped train several nationals in energy planning and information management. Their study
was the most comprehensive of all the studies under the project. The Association had actively
interfaced with the consultants, whenever possible, and reviewed and commented on their
draft reports, though several of the studies were financed by other agencies.
K.    PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
1.36         Considerable difficulty was experienced in locating relevant information in the
project files. Notably missing in the files were: Terms of reference for many of the
consultants and specifications of equipment, progress reports by consultant/contractors, IDA's
views/comments on most of the studies. Final reports on some of the studies could not be
located. Details of training programs and number of trainees were missing except in couple of
cases. In preparing this PER, considerable reliance was placed on the supervision reports,
several of which were well prepared and comprehensive, and on discussion with some
members of the project team.
