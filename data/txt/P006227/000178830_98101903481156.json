A consortium of consultants known as CANAMBRA,\n            working under a United Nations Special Fund grant for which\n            the Bank acts as Executing Agency, have studied the market\n            for power in the region.

The Estreito and Xavantes developments, which together\n            will provide additional generating capacity of almost 1\n            million kilowatts, are of high priority within this program.\n            The Xavantes project has been under construction for several years."}, "docdt": "1965-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
