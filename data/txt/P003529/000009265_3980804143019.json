The technical\n            assistance components are rated highly satisfactory, while\n            the enterprise modernization component is rated highly\n            unsatisfactory. Likewise, sustainability is rated as likely\n            for all technical assistance components, but uncertain for\n            the enterprise modernization component. The Bank's\n            performance is rated as satisfactory. Bank staff provided\n            effective support and advice. However, additional staff\n            resources were needed. Borrower performance is rated as\n            satisfactory. The report notes excellent management,\n            coordination, and communication of results. Overall, the\n            project's simultaneous focus on multiple target groups,\n            government entities, enterprises, and financial institutions\n            in various localities made the project very complex and\n            difficult to manage. Also, the substantial delay between\n            project appraisal in 1998 and project effectiveness in 1991\n            led to poor performance by the initial batch of subprojects.\n            There are six main lessons learned. First, successful\n            execution of technical assistance requires the full\n            commitment of all stakeholders throughout the process.\n            Second, national ownership is important. In this case, Spark\n            is a national program and the Bank is perceived as a helper.\n            Third, sound organizational setup and dynamic leadership are\n            essential to project success. Fourth, the Bank's\n            project supervision missions must be better staffed with\n            technical staff and consultants. Fifth, while financial\n            institutions must improve their expertise in subproject\n            evaluation, the Bank must recognize that enterprises still\n            face many constraints under the current national policy\n            framework. Finally, for lines of credit operations using\n            financial intermediaries to be successful, basic structural\n            changes in the financial and enterprise sectors are needed."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
