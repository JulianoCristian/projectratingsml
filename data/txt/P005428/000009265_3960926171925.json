participating Regies and will be implemented during\n            1988-1994.  The project aims at rehabilitation, upgrading\n            and expansion of the electricity distribution systems of the\n            beneficiaries and rehabilitation of thermal power stations\n            operated by ONE.  It comprises:  (a) construction,\n            rehabilitation and extension of substations, distribution\n            stations and switching stations; (b) extension and\n            rehabilitation of distribution networks; and (c)\n            construction of operation centers.  It further entails (d)\n            imported spare parts and replacement items for thermal\n            plants; (e) materials, equipment, utility vehicles and\n            training for hot line works; (f) teleprotection and\n            telecommunication equipment; (g) computer hardware and\n            software, training materials, training and fellowships; and\n            (h) distribution planning analyses.  In addition to improved\n            institutional performance, benefits are expected from:  (i)\n            expanded electricity sales; (ii) reduced distribution\n            losses; and (iii) longer lifetimes and lower operating costs\n            of rehabilitated facilities."}, "docdt": "1988-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
