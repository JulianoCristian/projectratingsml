MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXEC, TIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Kingdom of Morocco
for US$90.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be
for 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's stansard
*         variable interest rate and would help finance the proposed Power
Distribution Project.
Background
2.       Morocco became a heavily indebted country by the late 1V70s,
largely because of the ending of the phosphate price boom and the costs of
the war in the Sahara. An adjustment program initiated in late 1983
succeeded in reducing the current account deficit from 12.7% of GDP in 1982
to 2.1% in 1987 and the Government deficit from 12.22 of GDP in 1982 to 4.7%
in 1987. GDP growth has averaged 2.2% per year since the program began,
while inflation has fallen from over 10% per year to 5S in 1987. However,
debt service remains high at about 12% of GDP despite substantial debt
rescheduling.
3.       Morocco depends on energy imports, 'nostly oil, to supply about 88%
of its commercial energy requirements. In toe earlv 1980s domestic
petroleum product prices reached the international level, thereby giving a
large impetus to energy conservation and contributing to a substantial
slowdown in the growth of energy demand. When international oil prices fell
in 1986 the Goverrment decided to keep domestic prices at the previous level
and use the additional revenues to reduce the Government deficit. In 1987
prices for all petrole'un prod'icts (except liquified petroleum gates% and
coal were above the international level and electricity prices were above
long-run marginal cost.
4.       because of the taxes paid by the power subsector on oil, imported
equipment and on value added, and because of action under the Public
Enterprise Rationalization Loan (PERL) to raise electricity prices and
reduce Government contributions to the power subsector, the latter is now a
large net contributor to the Government treasury. At the same time, it has
only partly emerged from financial difficulties experienced since 1981 as a
result of increased fuel expenses due to a drought which reduced
hydroelectricity generation, large financial arrears by the Government's
administrative subdivisions and agencies, and a failure to increase
adequately the margins between the Regies' buying and selling prices to
compensate for increased operating expenses caused by inflation. Actions
under the proposed Project to address these problems would not only improve
the financial performance of the power subsector entities, they would assure
an increase in its net financial contribution to the Government. Despite
these measures, and since electricity supply is capital intensive, the power



- 2 -
subsector will need to make large investments and borrow from abroad to
supply growing demand caused by forecast economic growth.
5.       Morocco has the fifth lowest per capita consumption of electricity
in the EMENA Region (343 kWh in 1986), and less than 50 percent of the
population has access to electricity. The main entity in the power
subsector in Morocco is the Office National de 1'Electricit6 (ONE), a
government-owned utility. ONE generates about 88 percent of Morocco's
electricity supply with industries producing most of the remaining 12
percent, mainly for own use. ONE is responsible for all transmission of
electricity and distributes about 47 percent directly to final consumers.
It sells the remaining 53 percent to 10 publicly-owned utilities IRegies)
entrusted with distribution of electricity in the main urban areas.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.       The proposed Project forms an integral part of the Borrower's twin
strategies of supporting a technically and economically efficient expansion
of the power system on the one hand, and improved financial performance and
management of major public enterprises on the other. As such, in addition
to continuing the long-standing dialogue on specific issnies in the power
subsector, this Project has been prepared in close collaboration with and
builds upon the recently-approved Public Enterprise Rationalization Loan
(PERL) and the National Water Supply Rehabilitation Project. These three
operations together provide an integrated package of support for policy and
institutional reform in the power subsector and the water sector. Thus the
PERL provides an overall framework for increasing the administrative and
financial autonomy of public entities, reducing the fiscal arrears of the
Government to these bodies, and strengthening the institutional framework
for management of the public enterprise sector. It also includes specific
commitments to raise electricity prices and to undertake studies to develop
coordinated least-cost investment programs for OJJE and the Regies and to
define an electricity tariff structure based c-a economic cost. The Project
contains specific measures to reinforce the actions initiated under PERL to
reduce the financial arrears owed to and by the power subsector entities and
to ensure that ONE's financial performance is satisfactory (especially for
the period after the disbursement of PERL); it would also support the
sustained implementation of the recommendations for investment planning and
price reform that will be made by the investment and tariff studies. The
Project was also prepared in coordination with the National Water Supply
Rehabilitation Project, which contains measures benefiting the electricity
as well as the water departments of the Regies including providing
improvements in procurement decisions, and the £ntroduction of a uniform
general accounting system, a cost accounting system, a management
information system and external audits. The Project would be the first Bank
operation to involve the electricity departments of R6gies, and would
contribute to strengthening the financial performance of these departments
and to improving coordination within the power subsector. Although only the
R6gies of Casablanca, Neknes, Kenitra, Fes and Tetouan, accounting for 702
of the sales of the Regies, would receive financial assistance (the other
five Ragies which distribute electricity do not need Bank financing at this
time), the non-participating R6gies would benefit from the actions to
improve investment planning and reduce Government arrears and the Government
plans to make all efforts so that they implement some of the actions taken
by the participating Regies (see para. 9).

Project Objectives
7.       The objectives of the proposed Project are, first, to assist ONE
and five Regies in rehabilitating, upgrading and expanding power facilities
at least cost, particularly distribution networks, thereby reducing losses
and improving technical efficiency. It would provide electricity to about
90,000 new customers. The second objective is to introduce procedures for
ensuring the updating and coordination of least-cost investment programs for
the power subsector, and to provide technical assistance to improve
management, planning and technical capabilities. The third is to continue
for ONE and extend to the Regies the process of financial strengthening that
will be an essential feature of their future operation as effective and
efficient public utilities.
Project Description
8.       The proposed Project comprises: (a) construction, rehabilitation
and extension of substations, distribution stations and switching stations;
(b) extension and rehabilitation of distribution networks; (c) construction
of operation centers consisting of public attendance offices, warehouses,
workshops, housing, etc.; (d) imported spare parts and replacement items for
thermal plants; (e) materials, equipment, utility vehicles and training for
hot line works; (f) teleprotection and telecommunication equipment; (g)
computer hardware and software, training materials, training and
fellowships; (h) carrying out of analyses to: (i) develop an improved
informatioa system for ONE's investment planning; (ii) identify, evaluate
and recommend measures to improve the organization and efficient operation
of ONE's distribution department; and (iii) identify, evaluate and recommend
least-cost equipment norms and work practices for ONE's distritbution
system. The total cost of the Project, excluding interest during
construction, is estimated at US$167 million equivalent with a foreign cost
component of US$90 million equivalent. Project implementation is projected
to take seven years, based on past Bank experience with similar projects as
reflected in the relevant disbursement schedule. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B (all on the basis of the seven-year period). A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Morocco
are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6916-MOR, dated January 20, 1988, are also attached.
Main Agreed Actions
9.       The following actions have been agreed upon: (a) the establishment
of a technical committee to assure the coordination of investments between
the electricity systems of ONE and the Regies; (b) the annual preparation of
a coordinated investment program for the power subsector for the following
five years, with the coordinated and individual programs to be furnished to
the Bank for review; (c) implementation of actions to strengthen the demand
forecasting and planning capabilities of ONE and the Regies, based on
recommendations to be made by the coordinated investment study, and after
consultation with the Bank;(d) prompt payment of bills to ONE and the ten
electricity distributing R6gies by the Government's administrative
subdivisions, to ONE by the five participating Regies, and to fuel suppliers
by ONE; (e) payment of Government arrears as of July 31, 1988 to ONE and the
ten electricity distributing Regies in equal annual iustallments ending not



- 4-
later than September 30, 1992; (f) payment of the arrears of the five
participating R6gies to ONE in equal annual installments ending in 1992;
(g) measures by ONE to produce a net internal cash generation (excluding
working capital changes) equivalent in 1988, 1989 and 1990 to at least 25S,
and in 1991 and thereafter to at least 30S of annual capital expenditures
(excluding expenditures financed by customers' contributions) on a moving
three-year average basis and to maintain a debt-service ratio of 1.5; (h)
establishment of an automatic mechanism to deal with the financial
implications of variations in hydro availability; (i) adoption of measures
by the five participating Regies to ensure that they generate a positive net
i.xcome and produce a net internal cash generation (excluding working capital
changes) equivalent to at least 302 of annual capital expenditures
(excluding expenditures prefinanced by customers' coatributions) on a moving
three-year average basis; (j) prohibition of cross-financing from the
electricity to the water departments of the five participating R6gies when
the R6gies' payables to ONE exceed two months' purchases; and (k)
preparation of a study by the five participating R6gies to develop a system
of forecasting consumers' contributions for connections and related works.
The Government has stated its intention to use its best efforts to ensure
that the five non-participating R6gies which distribute electricity
implement the same actions as those undertaken by the participating R6gies
in the categories c, d, f and k. It was also agreed to include under the
Project the major actions affecting the power subsector undertaken unde-
PERL and the National Water Supply Rehabilitation Project. A study to
examine the transmission and distribution losses of ONE and the Regies will
be carried out through the UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program. The loan proceeds will be on-lent to ONE and the five
participating Regies on the same terms as the Bank loan with the foreign
exchange and interest rate risks being borne by the beneficiaries. The
conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement with each beneficiary will be a
condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Justification
10.      In addition to the institutional improvements described in
paragraph 9, economic benefits under the proposed Project are expected from:
(i) expanded electricity sales, (ii) reduced distribution losses, and (iii)
longer lifetimes and lower operating costs of rehabilitated facilities. The
economic rate of return calculated on the total investment programs of ONE
and the five participating R6gies is estimated to be 12.42 on the basis of
appropriate electricity prices. It substantially understates the real
economic return since it excludes the consumer's surplus.
Risks
11.      No special technical risks are foreseen, and no major
implementation problems are expected. The main risk associated with the
Project is that in the event of possible adverse circumstances such as below
average rainfall the Government may not be able to implement, fully and
promptly, the policy actions required to strengthen ONE's and the Regies'
financial performance and ensure the eliminaticn of financial arrears. The
Government is making every effort to implement the commitments made under
PERL and is expected to do the same under the proposed Project, which will
be monitored closely.



R.eeommeIMltion
12.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
