The main\n            objectives of the project are to: 1) provide support for\n            overall project management and coordination, in order to\n            foster both effective project implementation and long-term\n            institutional transformation; 2) restore and develop the\n            collections and associated functions of the Botany and\n            Zoology Divisions; 3) design and establish a computerized\n            database of specimen-based data for collections management,\n            collection plans and development, and external use; and 4)\n            strengthen the capacity to coordinate and foster\n            collaborative biological research activities and client\n            services. The Biodiversity Collection Project will include:\n            1) the establishment of a steering committee, a project\n            management committee and a project implementation unit, a\n            technical advisory group, a user advisory group, short-term\n            advisors and trainers, language training and provision of\n            training materials and supplies; 2) human resource\n            development, collections restoration and development,\n            research facilities, and publications and products; 3) a\n            computer database and a local area network capable of basic\n            specimen data entry, automated label production, collections\n            management functions, and information dissemination; and 4)\n            scientific collaboration and services with the help of\n            technical assistance and office equipment."}, "docdt": "1994-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
