F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The Chilean Montreal Protocol project has II phases. The overall objective of the Phase
I was to achieve a 63% reduction in the consumption of ODS through a combination of
means including public awareness raising, financial subsidies (TECFIN), creation of an
ozone team and specific training. The objectives to Phase II were: To assist Chile in the
phaseout of the use of substances that deplete the ozone layer (at least 400 MT); to
develop the regulatory framework for an ODS phaseout by 2006; and to consolidate the
institutional capacity gained by CONAMA in the execution of Chile's Montreal Protocol
program.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

Chile's Ozone Depleting Substances Phase-out Project assisted the country in phasing out
ozone depleting substances (ODS) and complying with Chile's Montreal Protocol (MP)
Commitments. The project included two phases that were approved in June 1992 (ODS
Phase I) and June 1996 (ODS Phase II). The activities ranged from institutional
strengthening (IS) to a subsidies program that sought to promote technological
conversion.

The sub-sections below describe the country context at appraisal and the objectives,
components, and main outcomes of this operation.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in 1987
as an international treaty to eliminate the production and consumption of ozone depleting
chemicals, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC),
methyl chloroform (TCA), and methyl bromide (MeBr). Scientific theory and evidence
suggest that these compounds, once emitted to the atmosphere, can significantly deplete
the stratospheric ozone layer that shields the planet from damaging UV-B radiation.
Under this treaty, developed countries had to phase out CFC by the year 2000 (2005 for
TCA and MeBr). Developing countries, also known as Article 5 countries in the context
of the Protocol, benefit from a 10-year grace period.

Because of its geographic location in the southern latitudes, where thinning of the ozone
layer has greater impact, Chile was one of the first countries to ratify the Montreal
Protocol, on March 26, 1990. Under the Protocol, the Government of Chile (GOC)
committed to (a) freezing 1999 CFC consumption at average 1995­1997 consumption
levels, (b) reducing CFC consumption by 50 percent by 2005, (c) reducing CFC
consumption by an additional 35 percent by 2007, and (d) phasing out CFC consumption
by 2010. The country's remaining commitments under the MP are summarized in table 1,
which shows the phase-out schedule for Article 5 countries.

     1.1.1 Brief Overview of the Implementation of the MP Program in Chile

     In June 1992 the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund (ExCom) approved the
     Country Program (CP) prepared by the GOC. The CP described the trends of ODS
     consumption, identified the major consuming sectors in the country, and outlined the
     country's strategy for their phase out. In 1992, at its seventh meeting, the Montreal
     Protocol Multilateral Fund (MLF) approved Phase I of Chile's ODS Phase-out Project as



                                                           2

the first MP project to implement Chile's Country Program. Phase I targeted the
reduction of 63 percent of total ODS consumption in the country.

At the time of the Bank's involvement in Chile in 1993 (a Grant Agreement between
Chile and the World Bank as implementing agency was signed on July 7, 1993), the
country was a net consumer of ODS, and no production had historically taken place.
Most consumption (CFC-11 and CFC-12) was in the refrigeration sector (56 percent) and
foams sector (16 percent), which played a key role in processing natural products such as
fish, livestock, and agricultural produce. Most CFC were imported from Mexico, while
smaller quantities were brought in from Venezuela and Argentina. The remaining 28
percent of consumption of other ODS (mainly TCA and CTC) were used in the solvents,
halons, and agricultural sectors. Although Chile had a large number of CFC consumers,
about 50 percent of national consumption was concentrated in four large companies. Two
of these consumed more than 40 percent of the ODS used in the refrigeration sector,
while two foaming enterprises consumed more than 55 percent of the foam sector's
consumption. The project included a set of measures to strengthen the institutional
capacity of Chile to implement and promote the Montreal Protocol. These included the
creation of an ozone seal, a massive communications strategy, and the establishment of
an Ozone Team (OT) in the Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente (CONAMA, or
National Commission for the Environment).

Also, to complement and test the involvement of the private sector, the MLF funded a
Technology Conversion Financing Program (TECFIN) of subsidies to co-finance
conversion to non-ODS alternatives. This was one of a kind approach to competitively
allocate MLF grants to ODS phaseout projects. Essentially, interested companies would
bid on a grant cost-effectiveness basis; those companies offering to implement their
eligible ODS phaseout projects and showing the better cost-effectiveness ratios would
obtain the grant resources first. The approach would also work on a reimbursement basis,
substantially reducing the transaction costs and increasing the efficiency of MLF's grant
resource allocation. The project got a special recognition at the Montreal Protocol's 20th
Anniversary Celebration.

In 1996, as part of the definition and structuring of Chile's ODS Phase II, the Ozone
Depleting Substances Phase-out Project focused on establishing a competitive structure
for TECFIN and promoting the reduction of Chile's MeBr consumption. According to the
MP compliance schedule, consumption of MeBr must be reduced by 20 percent by 2005
and phased out by 2015.

1.1.2 ODS Phase-out Project Background and Institutional Structure

CONAMA was formally established in 1994 as a national entity to promote sustainable
environmental development and coordinate policy-driven environmental actions and
strategies defined by the GOC. CONAMA's responsibilities included the implementation
of international environmental agreements, conventions, and treaties signed and ratified
by Chile. Within this institutional framework, CONAMA became the national entity in




                                             3

charge of coordinating activities to promote phase out of ODS as mandated in the
Montreal Protocol.

Financial support was approved in the amount of US$213,0001 to create the country's
Ozone Team as part of Phase I of the ODS phase-out project. The OT begun its activities
in 1993, with the responsibility of implementing and monitoring Phase I of the ODS
project and later for structuring Phase II. Through the World Bank, the MLF provided
assistance for the establishment and operation of the OT and later for its continuous
operation through six IS projects (IS-I, IS-II, IS-III, IS-IV, IS-V, IS-VI, for a total of
US$986,600 beginning in 1992).

Through the OT, CONAMA was given broad policy, regulatory, and monitoring
mandates and also acted as the financial agent for establishing contracts with recipient
companies. CONAMA channeled the financing for industrial conversion projects and
disbursed the corresponding funds or grants. The OT was also responsible for supervising
sub-project identification, preparation, and implementation for the Bank's ODS phase-out
operations in Chile. CONAMA also coordinated Chile's ODS phase-out activities with
other ministries and institutions and served as counterpart to the Montreal Protocol
implementing agencies, mainly the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO), and World Bank. Other important bilateral projects, including
those of Environmental Canada and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA),
were also channeled through the OT and CONAMA.

World Bank MP financed activities in Chile have two main components: 1) industrial and
technological conversion and 2) institutional strengthening. Projects sought to enable the
elimination or reduction of ODS, mainly in private but also in some public entities. The
MLF financed the incremental costs associated with those conversions, which are defined
in terms of both capital and operating costs. Depending on the sector, the MLF financed
incremental costs under pre-agreed cost-effectiveness thresholds. Potential enterprise
beneficiaries developed their projects together with government agencies and with MP
implementing agencies, and these proposals were then submitted to the MLF Executive
Committee for approval.
In Chile the Bank project was structured as an umbrella program, under which MP
projects were approved and implemented. The Bank operation served as a legal
framework, offering a financial ceiling for channeling resources approved by the MLF.
This was a novel approach at the World Bank, and the umbrella agreement with Chile
was one of the first operations of this type. The rationale behind the new design was to
minimize transaction costs for both the Bank and Chile, as all approved operations under
the Montreal Protocol would become subprojects of the umbrella agreement. This legal
design would allow the project to perform as an envelope for all eligible operations
approved and financed by MLF. Extensions of the agreement were a consequence of the

first approved a larger amount, $US213,000.

legal approach, and the Grant Agreement was extended four times to allow
implementation of the last eligible operations that could be included under the Bank
operation.

The Ozone Trust Fund (OTF) Grant Agreement in Chile was signed for US$1,206,000
for Phase I and updated in 1996 for US$6,456,000 for Phase II. The updated grant
agreement for Phase II redistributed resources across categories affecting the original
category ceilings of funds for Phase I. The updated grant agreement was followed by
three resource reallocations across categories to update the category ceiling to reflect the
funds approved by the ExCom for new projects. Table 2 summarizes the grant agreement
structure for Phase I and the end of Phase II.

1.1.2.1 ODS Phase-out Project Components

Below is a detailed summary of the ODS Phase-out Project.

   A. Phase I (1992­1996). The main goal was to achieve a 63 percent reduction in the
        consumption of ODS through a combination of strategies including public
        awareness raising, an ozone seal, financial subsidies for technological re-
        conversion (TECFIN), creation of a local ozone team, and targeted training. The
        specific sub-projects approved within Phase I are listed below.

        a. Part A. Implementation of a Technological Conversion Financing Program, or
           TECFIN (US$448,000). This sub-project competitively allocated subsidies to
           private companies for alternative production technologies by financing
           incremental costs of conversion to non-ODS systems. Companies bid for




                                             5

             grants, offering their lowest cost effectiveness possible (i.e., lowest cost to
             achieve the most ODS phase out).
        b. Part B. Implementation of an Ozone Seal Program (US$7,000). This sub-
             project sought to introduce a label on "ozone-friendly" products and services
             to educate consumers and create incentives among producers for converting to
             ODS-free technologies.
        c. Part C. Public Awareness Program (US$351,000). The objectives of this sub-
             project were to raise public awareness about health-related effects of ozone
             depletion and promote the adoption of adequate protection measures. Public
             information was provided through mass media.
        d. Part D. Implementation of a Sector-Specific Training Program (US$105,000).
             This sub-project's objective was to provide technical guidance to technicians
             and entrepreneurs in specific industries on mechanisms to shift to non-ODS.
        e. Part E. Creation of an Ozone Team based at CONAMA ($191,000). The OT
             was to coordinate and monitor project activities and develop an action plan for
             Phase II of the ODS phase-out project.

    B. ODS Phase II (1997­2007). The main goal was to assist Chile in phasing out the
        use of at least 400 metric tons (MT) of substances that deplete the ozone layer
        through a continuation of TECFIN. As in Phase I, open bidding calls used for
        resource allocation sought to maximize the cost effectiveness of MLF funding.
        Subsidies were allocated to companies that offered the lowest cost per MT of
        ODS to be phased out on a limited number of bidding calls based on proposed
        conversion cost effectiveness, at costs at least 10 percent below the thresholds
        approved by the MLF for conversion to non-ODS technologies in all sectors. The
        methodology would achieve ODS reductions at lower costs per converted
        enterprise and at lower administrative costs (as projects came on a demand-driven
        process with counterpart funding already committed).

        In addition, the MLF subsequently approved additional phases of the IS
        operations, plus two more sub-projects for Chile through the World Bank as
        implementing agency. These included 1) a demonstration sub-project to phase out
        MeBr and 2) a halon bank sub-project. The total amount assigned for IS in the
        grant agreement reflected the total amount approved by the ExCom over time, i.e.,
        the funds approved for the establishment of the OT during Phase I (U$213,000)
        and the IS project and its following extensions (U$773,600) approved in Phase
        II.2 The total amount assigned for investment sub-projects in the grant agreement
        in Phase II represented the ceiling set by the Bank, which was higher that the total
        amount of funds approved by the ExCom for investment sub-projects over time.3




2The Executive Committee of the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund (ExCom) approved the institutional
strengthening sub-project for US$113,500 and authorized its extension five more times, for a total amount
of US$773,600.
3The ExCom approved US$3.8 million for TECFIN II, US$348,130 for a methyl bromide demonstration
sub-project, and US$60,000 for a halon bank sub-project.

1.1.2.2 ODS Consumption and Production

Because Chile has never produced ODS, all consumption has historically been imported.
More than 60 percent of the roughly 923 ozone depleting potential (ODP) tons in 1992
were consumed by the refrigeration and air conditioning sub-sectors. In 1997, when
assessment of Phase II took place, approximately 857 ODP tons were consumed in Chile,
with almost 78 percent of this amount concentrated in the same sub-sectors. The second
largest level of consumption was in the MeBr sector, which represented 20 percent of
total consumption in 1992 and 16 percent in 1997. MeBr consumption rose sharply (more
than 45 percent) between 1997 and 1998 because of the growing use of the fumigant by
new strawberry plantations producing for both local and export markets.

Table 3 shows Chile's yearly consumption4 of ODS at the time of preparation of Phase I
and Phase II by type of chemical.




4Consumption, as defined by Article 1 of the Montreal Protocol, means production plus imports minus
exports of controlled substances.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
    Approved)

The objectives of Chile's Ozone Depleting Substances Phase-out Project, as originally
approved, are listed below.




                                                   8

    1. Phase I: Reduce ODS consumption by 63 percent through:

       a. Public awareness raising
       b. Financial subsidies (TECFIN)
       c. Creation of an ozone team
       d. Creation of an ozone seal
       e. Specific training

    2. Phase II: Strengthen institutional capacity and reduce ODP by at least 400 MT
       through:

       a. Competitive allocation of subsidies for technological conversion (TECFIN II)
       b. Development of the regulatory framework for an ODS phase out
       c. Consolidation of institutional capacity gained by CONAMA in the execution
           of Chile's Montreal Protocol Program

The original project indicators used by the Bank to monitor performance were 1) metric
tons of ODS reduced, 2) development of an institutional framework for the
implementation of the MP in Chile, 3) establishment of labels on "ozone-friendly"
products and services, 4) increased awareness of the ozone layer problem, 5) provision of
technical guidance to entrepreneurs in specific industries on mechanisms to shift to
ozone-free technologies, 6) enterprise compliance with equipment disposal agreements,
and 7) the Ozone Team's effectiveness in identifying, facilitating the preparation of, and
monitoring implementation of ExCom-approved projects. Information on these indicators
is included in the Project Completion Reports prepared by the Bank and the GOC and
submitted to the MLF Secretariat after each sub-project was completed.

1.3 Revised GEO (as Approved by the Original Approving Authority) and Key
    Indicators, with Reasons/Justification

The original project objectives and indicators were slightly adjusted. The overall
objective of achieving a substantial ODS reduction was kept, although updated with the
second phase restructuring, from the original 63% of total ODS consumption to 400 MT
ODP. Indicators were kept at measuring the impact of the Ozone Team in promoting and
coordinating the ODS phaseout programs in Chile, and the reductions in ODS
consumption.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the Montreal Protocol Implementation Program grant were
Chilean enterprises converting to the new alternative technologies to eliminate or reduce
ODS emissions, as well as the general Chilean population, who benefited from increased
awareness of the effects of ozone depletion. At the industry and capacity building levels,
the project did not focus on a particular sector but rather established a broad target of
beneficiaries. These beneficiaries included industries that used ODS in their production
operations, especially rigid polyurethane foam producers who used CFC-11 as a foaming
agent and domestic and commercial refrigeration equipment producers, and service
organizations that used CFC-12 as refrigerant. A MeBr demonstration project was also
undertaken as part of Phase II.


                                            9

Global benefits also resulted from the elimination of ODS, as depletion of stratospheric
ozone could lead to significant increases in UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface.
Increased UV radiation could in turn lead to adverse human and animal health effects, as
well as ecosystem impacts. The ozone layer protects the biosphere from this type of
radiation.

    * These values reflect the maximum amount of resources that could have been disbursed by the
      project even though the ceiling of the grant agreement was higher.


As explained in section 1.1 above, the Bank project was structured as an umbrella
program under which MP projects were subsequently approved and implemented. The
Bank operation served as a legal framework, offering a financial ceiling for channeling
the MLF's approved resources. The ceiling amount was calculated by multiplying the
number of MT of ODP (as assessed by the Country Program) by the threshold grant
allocation per sector (US$/MT of ODP) determined by the MLF. As stated above, the
OTF Grant Agreement in Chile was signed for US$1,206,000 and updated in 1996 to
US$6,456,000. Because the Bank operation served as a legal framework offering a
financial ceiling for channeling the MLF's approved resources, the total approved amount
was lower than the grant agreement ceiling of US$6,456,000. The difference is basically
explained by the MLF's decision not to finance any more final users at supermarkets,
which has been pre-identified as one of the sector with priority for the Bank, thus



                                                    10

curtailing the allocation of new resources to sub-projects oriented to replacing
refrigeration units at supermarket chain stores.

1.5.1. Phase I

This section describes the components of Phase I of the Chile Ozone Depleting
Substances Phase-out Project in detail.

1.5.1.1 TECFIN I

In 1992 the MLF approved US$448,000 to implement the Technology Conversion
Financing Program (TECFIN). The program was structured as a market mechanism that
offered subsidies to companies willing to undergo industrial conversion. Grants were
allocated competitively based on proposed conversion cost effectiveness, at costs at least
10 percent below the thresholds approved by the MLF for conversion to non-ODS
technologies in all sectors. Subsidies granted by CONAMA accounted for 30­60 percent
of total investment. As designed and approved by ExCom, the program consisted of the
following steps and conditions:

    1. ODS-consuming firms were invited to bid for grants in return for reductions in kg
        of ODS (calls for bid).
    2. Bids, expressed as US$/kg reduced, were screened by CONAMA and the World
        Bank to ensure MF eligibility and verify accuracy of the reduction reported.
    3. Bids were ranked in ascending order of bid value (i.e., grant requested per kg of
        ODS eliminated).
    4. Bids were made within a cost-effectiveness cap established by CONAMA for
        each bidding call, based on expectations about the sectors participating in each
        bid.
    5. Bids were awarded the corresponding grant in ascending bid order until the funds
        for each specific bidding call were depleted.
    6. As an additional safeguard, each bidding call had to have a minimum cost-
        effectiveness equal to 90 percent of the MLF-established threshold for the sectors
        participating in that bid (weighted by their respective shares of ODS reduction in
        accepted bids).

Setting up the competitive and regulatory framework took two years, so that TECFIN
was able to start allocating grants in 1995. The foam and refrigeration sectors were first
selected, based on their sector participation in national ODS consumption (the aerosol
sector, for example, practically had been converted by Chilean companies long before).
Rules and conditions for the competitive bidding calls were duly advertised in national
newspapers. Participant companies had to show (a) financial solvency, (b) purchases of
ODS in the past three years backed by corresponding invoices and receipts, and (c)
records of annual production for the past five years and projections.

TECFIN I funded 11 projects in the sectors of domestic refrigeration (1), commercial
refrigeration (5), and rigid foams (5). Three of the firms initially approved, Himmer &
Himmer, SAAM S.A., and Supermercado Gran Avenida, requested cancellation before


                                             11

signing sub-grant agreements because they lacked financial solvency to fund the
investments not covered by the grant. In the end, 118.82 MT of ODP (CFC and HCFC)
were phased out, with a grant component of nearly US$424,000. TECFIN I had an
overall cost-effectiveness of US$3.56/kg of ODP eliminated, well below the standard
cost-effectiveness thresholds set by the MLF of over US$7/kg of ODP for foam projects
and over US$14/kg of ODP for commercial refrigeration projects. TECFIN I reduced
65.9 MT of ODP in the rigid foam sector (19.1 percent of the 1989 ODP consumption
level) and phased out 52.91 MT of ODP from the refrigeration sector (nearly 22 percent
of the 1989 ODP consumption level). Table 5 summarizes TECFIN I's overall results.

The original target of 729 MT of ODP established during project appraisal for the larger
umbrella project was later adjusted to reflect a realistic ODS phase-out potential of 120
MT of ODP. Each of the sub­projects implemented under TECFIN I is described below.

       1. Frigocar. This company, which produces steel vehicle bodies for transportation,
         replaced CFC-11 as a foam blowing agent in the manufacture of insulation panels
         with HCFC-141b. Because the new technology required more accurate control



                                                                               12

   systems (e.g., temperature, mixture), the company acquired a high-pressure
   Gusmer FF-1600 1600psi dispenser machine).

2. Instapanel (IPAC). IPAC manufactures insulation panels for construction. Panel
   production in 1995 reached 128,502 m3. The company replaced CFC-11 with
   HCFC-22 with a US$131,607 grant from the MLF. New equipment purchased
   included 1) a Foam Enterprises LLC spray dispenser machine with four
   distribution cylinders and an operating pressure of 1,000lb/inch2, 2) two
   stabilization pools for R-22, 3) an isocyanate storing pool, and 4) a thermally
   isolated shed 2,000m2 X 6m high to keep a homogeneous 25ºC temperature on
   the production line.

3. Kifafi. This mid-size enterprise produced 39,370m3 of insulation panels for
   refrigeration in 1995. With a US$20,000 grant from the MLF, the company
   replaced the use of 0.9 MT of CFC-11 with HCFC-141b in its manufacture of
   insulation panels. The project included the purchase of a high-pressure Gusmer H-
   2000 spray dispenser machine with a variable ratio of 2000psi as proposed. The
   old equipment was to be adapted for flexible foam application using water as a
   blowing agent.

4. Metalcargo. This company replaced CFC-11 with HCFC-141b as a blowing
   agent in the manufacture of thermal insulation panels. Because the new
   technology required more accurate control systems (e.g., temperature, mixture),
   Metalcargo acquired a high-pressure Gusmer FF-1600 1600psi dispenser machine.

5. MIMET. This company, which manufactures commercial refrigerators,
   consumed approximately 60 tons of CFC in 1994. It converted its production line
   from CFC-12 to HFC-134a and from CFC-11 to HCFC 141b, with a US$93,672
   grant from the MLF. MIMET's total project cost was US$183,770 (the MLF
   financing was less than 50 percent, bringing the project's cost effectiveness to
   US$2/kg ODP). As part of technology conversion, MIMET purchased chargers,
   invested in specific refrigeration equipment (chargers and vacuum pumps), and
   modified its foam system. Because the company's original vacuum pumps were
   modified, final equipment disposal did not take place.

6. Polimin. This brokerage and services enterprise had incorporated the production
   of periodic unit cell (PUC) foams beginning in 1994. In 1995 its panel production
   reached 515m3. The company received a US$9,120 grant from the MLF to fund
   the replacement of CFC-11 with HCFC-141b and acquired a high-pressure
  Gusmer FF-1600 1600psi dispenser machine.

7. CST (Central de Servicios Técnicos). This company provides post-sales and
   maintenance services for products of Compania Tecnológico Industrial S.A. (CTI),
   the largest refrigerator producer in Chile. With approximately 60 certified service
   stations throughout the country, CST consumed more than 4 tons of CFC-12 in
   1995. The company identifies and selects its service providers independently,



                                        13

       evaluates them periodically, supplies them with its equipment, and frequently
        trains them. CST not only proved highly effective in terms of ODS reduction from
        the point of view of replacement technologies, but also increased awareness
        among its service providers and their clients, who showed substantial interest in
        the new technologies and requested further training. As part of the project, CST
        purchased Robinair recovery and recycling equipment and provided training,
        reducing annual ODS consumption by 300kg.

    8. Frigorent. In 1995 this company, a national leader in the manufacture of
       industrial refrigerators, used R-502 in its manufacturing process. With a
       US$20,166 subsidy from TECFIN, it phased out the use of 0.1 MT of ODS
       annually and replaced this with HFC-404a.

    9. Supermercado (SM) Vicuña Mackenna. Part of the Ekono-Almac supermarket
       chain, in 1994 this company was accountable to the distributing firm Distribución
        y Servicios (D&S), Chile's largest supermarket chain. Vicuña Mackenna used R-
        502 (48.8 percent HCFC-22 and 51.2 percent CFC-115) and CFC-12 in its
        refrigerating equipment and appliances. Annual sales were estimated at US$14
        million in 1994. The project eliminated the use of R-502 and R-12 in 19
        refrigeration units, replaced condenser units with parallel systems working with
        R-22, and renewed refrigeration connections. The new installations handled low
        and mid temperatures, and one of the parallel units had computerized controls.
        Old and obsolete equipment was eliminated.

    10. SM Macul. Also part of Ekono-Almac and accountable to D&S, SM Macul used
        R-502 (48.8 percent HCFC-22 and 51.2 percent CFC-115) in its refrigeration
        equipment and appliances. Annual sales were estimated at US$11.6 million in
        1994. The project replaced R-502 with R-404a in its refrigeration equipment and
        replaced the old central with two mid- and low-temperature centrals operating
        with R-404a. One was adapted and the other was purchased. Changes were also
        made in the refrigerating connections and furniture.

    11. SM Plaza Egaña. Also part of Ekono-Almac and accountable to D&S, SM Plaza
        Egaña used R-502 (48.8 percent HCFC-22 and 51.2 percent CFC-115), and CFC-
        12 in its refrigeration equipment and appliances. Annual sales were estimated at
        US$4.8 million in 1994. The project eliminated the use of R-502 and R-12 in 10
        refrigeration units, purchased new Protocol equipment operating with HCFC-22,
        and dismantled obsolete equipment.

1.5.1.2 Ozone Seal

The ozone seal sub-project sought to introduce a label on "ozone-friendly" products and
services to educate consumers and create incentives among producers to convert to ODS-
free technologies. During the first semester of 1994, the Ozone Team launched a public
contest for the design of the Ozone Seal logotype. SGS Chile Limitada was selected out
of three applicants to develop the logotype, which was given to Johnson & Johnson for its



                                            14

STERRAD-100 product. This medical sterilizing unit uses hydrogen peroxide instead of
the typical mixture of CFC-12 and ethylene oxide.

1.5.1.3 Public Awareness

This sub-project's main objectives were to raise public awareness of the health-related
hazards resulting from ozone depletion and promote the adoption of adequate protection
measures. These objectives were to be achieved through mass media public information
campaigns on the ozone depletion problem. The massive launch of Chile's first public
awareness program through radio, television, newspapers, and other print and audio-
visual media included a training program for young leaders, radio programs, press
conferences, and distribution of articles, leaflets, and brochures among ODS-consuming
firms.

1.5.1.4 Training Program

The objective of this sub-project was to provide technical guidance to technicians and
entrepreneurs in specific industries on mechanisms that would enable them to shift to
non-ODS. The training program was implemented differently than originally planned to
more effectively address Chile's capacity building demand. A single comprehensive
seminar on refrigeration and foams replaced the planned small sector courses and
technical advice seminar. The solvents sector was not covered. Nonetheless, the seminar
was broadly welcomed by the firms involved, and participants expressed their satisfaction
with the event's organization, quality of speakers, and relevance.

The "First Refrigeration and Plastic Foam Workshop," organized by the Ozone Team and
CONAMA, took place in Santiago from March 11 to 14, 1997. The workshop's
objectives were to (a) provide information about new technologies in the refrigeration
and foam production sectors, (b) raise awareness among firm managers, (c) provide
information about the eventual negative economic effects of exporting goods that use
ODS in their production, (d) stimulate prompt technological conversion, and (e) promote
the TECFIN grant program for technological conversion. At a cost of approximately
US$70,000, including international speaker fees, auditorium leasing, and charges from
the event organizing firm SERSE, the event attracted around 140 technical and
managerial staff out of 400 invited. This lengthy workshop was a success for CONAMA.
The topics on the agenda included (a) the ozone depletion problem: causes and facts, (b)
the Montreal Protocol and ODS phase out schedules, (c) Chile's Country Program to
Protect the Ozone Layer, (d) measures of major international economic blocs to control
imports of products using ODS, (e) the main characteristics of substitute substances, (f)
international technological conversion case studies, and (g) case studies of industrial
conversion in Chile.

1.5.1.5 Institutional Strengthening

This sub-project envisioned the creation of an Ozone Technical Unit to coordinate and
monitor the activities implemented by the project and to develop an action plan for Phase



                                             15

II of the ODS Phase-out Project (1996­2000). In November 1993 CONAMA established
the Ozone Team, appointing two people to coordinate and manage all matters pertaining
to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol in Chile. By the time Phase I concluded
in 1996, the OT included a program coordinator (an economist), a technical advisor (a
chemical engineer), an administrative secretary, an administrative assistant, and an
external legal adviser. The last two provided services on a part-time basis.

Although the Ozone Program was established under CONAMA's International Unit, the
program coordinator enjoyed full autonomy to manage and implement the project,
including planning and budget-related matters. Administrative dependency was flexible,
and the program coordinator had direct access to the CONAMA executive direction, units,
and department. With relation to budget execution, the program coordinator directly
arranged the levels of monthly and annual expenses with CONAMA's Financial and
Administrative Department and authorized actual payments. In addition, the Accounting
Department appointed a specific officer to manage the project's financial operation. The
OT was not only in charge of promoting and coordinating the Chilean County Program
for Protecting the Ozone Layer, but also became a key actor in all Montreal Protocol-
related issues. As such, the team acted as technical advisor to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in international meetings and negotiations associated with the Montreal Protocol.

 1.5.1.6 Actual vs. Projected Achievements

 This section describes the achievements and outcomes of Phase I of Chile's Ozone
 Depleting Substances Phase-out Project compared with the planned targets.

                  Projects implemented vs. projects pre-identified in the Project Appraisal
                  Document (PAD)

                  TECFIN I funded 11 of 14 firms that submitted proposals, with projects in the
                  sectors of domestic refrigeration (1), commercial refrigeration (5), and rigid
                  foams (5). Three of the firms initially approved, Himmer & Himmer, SAAM S.A.,
                  and SM Gran Avenida, requested cancellation before signing the sub-grant
                  agreements because they lacked financial solvency to fund the investments not
                  covered by the grant. The firms phased out 118.82 MT of ODP (CFC and HCFC),
                  with a grant component of nearly US$425,000. TECFIN had an overall cost-
                  effectiveness of US$3.59/kg of ODP eliminated, much better than the MLF's
                  envisioned cost-effectiveness of over US$7 for rigid foam and over $11 for


                                                                                                        17

         refrigeration. At the sectoral level, the project reduced 65.9 MT of ODP (19.1
         percent of 1989 ODP) in the rigid foam sector and phased out 52.91 MT of ODP
         from the refrigeration sector (nearly 22 percent of 1989 ODP consumption).

         Amount Approved vs. Amount Disbursed

         The difference between approved and disbursed resources for TECFIN I of
         US$23,583.96 was rolled over for TECFIN's second phase.

         Counterpart Funds

         All investment sub-projects implemented required a certain amount of counterpart
         financing, which covered the costs of expenditures (i.e., non-incremental
         expenditures) that were not eligible for financing under the MLF. A total of
         US$759,349 was leveraged in counterpart financing. Considering the size of some
         of the beneficiary companies and the economic conditions of the industrial sector
         at the time of project implementation, the ability to leverage these funds was an
         added benefit of the project.

         Approved vs. Actual Impact

         The main reason for the difference between approved and actual impact in the
         Phase I sub-projects was a lack of experience regarding realistic ODP phase-out
         potential for each type of project/sector. This operation was one of the first
         projects approved by the MLF, and a much larger effect on consumption was
         initially appraised, especially with respect to non-investment activities in the
         umbrella project. Estimated MT of ODS to be eliminated were from both direct
         and indirect effects. Revised expected impact was about 120 MT of ODP from the
         investment component only (TECFIN) against the 729 MT of ODP estimated at
         appraisal.5 The revision was made after CONAMA carried out ODS consumption
         assessments and surveys and was based on the cost-effectiveness thresholds for
         grant allocations established by the MLF. Although consumption of ODS did not
         decrease as consistently over Phase I, there was a higher impact on ODS
         consumption once more realistic measures were assessed and more stringent
         policies adopted at both the international and country levels. As shown in section
         3 further below (assessment of outcomes), the overall program allowed reductions
         well over the 50 percent reductions target set out by the Montreal Protocol
         Commitment for 2005.This phase achieved an ODP reduction of 118 MT of ODP.

         Project Duration

         The umbrella project was prepared based on an implementation schedule of four
         years. All institutional strengthening, training, ozone seal, and public awareness
         programs were completed within that time frame. Technological conversion sub-

project completion reports.

projects were implemented in an average two-year frame. Given the number of
sub-projects to be implemented, the project was extended to a second phase to
continue achieving results as those from the first phase.

1.5.2. Phase II

This section describes the components of Phase II of the Chile Ozone Depleting
Substances Phase-out Project in detail.

1.5.2.1 TECFIN II

The Bank approved Phase II of the project in 1996. TECFIN II was approved by the
Excom in two tranches, one for US$1 million and a later one for US$2.8 million. As for
Phase I, TECFIN II envisioned a bidding system to allocate grant funds competitively
based on proposed conversion cost-effectiveness, at costs at least 10 percent below the
thresholds approved by the MLF for conversion to non-ODS technologies in all sectors.

As part of the mechanism, more than 20 enterprises were invited to bid on cost-effective
conversion projects in order to receive co-financing. Each bidding call was structured to
last approximately four months, and companies were expected to submit their proposals
bidding on cost-effectiveness thresholds announced before each auction by CONAMA,
which administered the program. At the close of each auction, project proposals were
evaluated for funding eligibility in terms of MLF eligibility criteria, technical feasibility,
and the company's financial solvency. Next, grants were allocated to the selected
enterprises, starting with the most cost-effective bid, until funds were depleted or all
selected projects were funded in each bidding call. Eight auctions were held under
TECFIN II, with the participation of more than 20 enterprises. The resulting projects in
reduced approximately 410 MT of ODP CFC at a cost for the MLF of approximately
US$2.3 million.

The cost-effectiveness of TECFIN II was US$5.58/MT of ODP, higher than the
US$3.59/MT of ODP of TECFIN I (under which participating enterprises were
aggressive in offering higher counterpart funding to get the subsidies), but still much
lower than the thresholds established by the MLF for the sectors included in the project
(i.e., mostly rigid foam and domestic refrigeration).6

Each of the sub­projects implemented under TECFIN I is described below.

   1. Himmer & Himmer. This company used CFC-11 in spray foaming processes
        and replaced it with HCFC-141b. A total of 7.17 MT of ODP were eliminated as a
        result of the project, which received US$49,467 from the MLF in 1998.

   2. Formas Fibra (Nielsen). Formas Fibra, which manufactures foam panels,
        received US$17,300 financing from the MLF in December 1998 to replace CFC-
        11 as a foaming agent with HCFC-141b and eliminated consumption of 4.62 MT
        of ODP.




                                                21

3. Formac. This company received US$145,353 from the MLF in 1999 for
   technological conversion of equipment needed to manufacture foam panels,
   displacing 23.88 MT of ODP (CFC-11).

4. Simac Ingeniería Ltda. In 1999 the MLF disbursed US$45,630 for Simac to
   purchase the necessary equipment for the industrial conversion of the manufacture
   of spray foam. The project replaced the use of CFC-11 with HCFC-141b and
   reduced 5 MT of ODS consumption at Simac's manufacturing facility.

5. Aisell Limitada. In 1999 Aisell used CFC-11 as a spray foaming agent in its
   manufacturing process. With a US$83,424 grant from the MLF, the company
   financed the conversion of its equipment and ended consumption of almost 10
   tons MT of ODP a year.

6. Aislaciones Térmicas. This company received US$30,571 from the MLF in
   December 1998 to finance the technological conversion of its foam panel
   manufacturing facility. The grant helped eliminate 7.91 tons MT of ODP (CFC-
   11) that was used as foaming agent.

7. Inema S.A. A metal-mechanics company, Inema is part of the MIMET
   Commercial Group, the first sub-project funded by TECFIN I, and accounts for
   most of Chile's production of metallic furniture, commercial refrigerators, and
   sandwich panels for thermal insulation. At the time of project implementation,
   Inema produced approximately 200 commercial refrigerators a year. The
   company submitted a project proposal in 1998 as part of TECFIN II to purchase a
   high-pressure Henneke machine to produce foam with HCFC-141b. The project
   cost US$350,389, received US$59,727 financing from the MLF, replaced 5.5 MT
   of ODP (CFC-11), and was concluded in 2000.

8. Química Anglochilena (currently Orica Chemicals). This company first
   introduced HCFC-141b to replace CFC-11 in its production of formulated poliol.
   Once in the market, the product sold at US$2.40/kg, compared with US$2.90/kg
   for CFC-11-based poliol. Anglochilena initially consumed approximately 70 MT
   of CFC-11 a year. During project implementation, consumption changed to 150
   MT of HCFC-141b a year, and all imports of CFC-11 ended. In 2002 the
   company decided to replace HCFC-141b with HFC-245. The new chemical did
   not involve any new investments or equipment changes for final users. During
   implementation in 1999 Sindelin S.A., a client of Anglochilena, faced technical
   difficulties with 900 refrigerators that switched to HCFC-141b. Some of the ABS
   plastic components proved deficient in contact with HCFC-141b. As a result,
   Sindelen reverted to production with CFC-11. According to the legal agreement
   between the two companies, Anglochilena was responsible for problems
   associated with the technological change. While assuming all the financial costs
   of the defective refrigerators, Anglochilena continued providing Sindelen with
   CFC-11-based poliol in 2000. The Bank and CONAMA discussed alternatives
   with both companies and in 2001 agreed to proceed with legal action against



                                         22

    Anglochilena. As a result, Anglochilena had to end the sale of CFC-11 in 2002,
    and Sindelen began CFC-free production of domestic refrigerators in 2003.
    During project implementation Química Anglochilena eliminated consumption of
    more than 70 MT of ODP with a US$185,096 grant from the MLF.

9. Camponar S.A. This company received US$17,203 from the MLF in 1999 to
    replace its existing CFC-11-based equipment and use HCFC-141b as a substitute
    in the manufacture of spray foam. The project reduced 1.67 MT of ODP.

10. CTI. This domestic refrigeration company consumed 170 MT of CFC-11 and
    CFC-12 annually. CTI replaced ODS consumption with HFC-134a and
    cyclopentane. MLF funding was used to purchase Pentamatic Henneke safety
    equipment for cyclopentane management, storage tanks, furnaces, water heating,
    and HFC-134a chargers and to cover testing and training activities. The project
    was completed in May 2000 and displaced 155.85 MT of ODS with
    US$1,157,072 financing from the MLF.

11. Multipanel. The MLF provided US$110,549 to Multipanel in July 1999 to
    finance the technological conversion of its manufacture of isolation panels. The
    project reduced 18.68 MT of CFC-11, which were used as a blowing agent,
    replacing it with HCFC-141b.

12. Souyet. This manufacturer of foam panels received a US$26,577 grant in 1999 to
    finance the technological conversion of its equipment. It was able to replace the
    use of 5.14 MT of CFC-11.

13. Térmica Haschke. This company, which used CFC-11 in its spray foam
    manufacturing process, received US$12,046 from the MLF to replace 9.04 tons of
    ODP (CFC-11-based equipment). The sub-project agreement was signed with
    CONAMA in October 1999 and disbursed in August 2000.

14. Asiterm S.A.. This company signed an agreement to receive MLF funding in
    November 1999 and envisioned replacing two low-pressure CFC-11 injection
    machines with high-pressure HCFC-141b-based equipment with larger capacity.
    To ensure adequate equipment performance, Asiterm also installed a specific
    electric system. The new systems began operating in 2001. The sub-project
    helped eliminate 7.95 MT of ODP consumption with US$25,764 from the MLF.

15. Superfrigo. Superfrigo used spray foam in its manufacturing process. Approved
    in October 1999, the sub-project received US$19,914 from the MLF and replaced
    4.74 MT of ODS (CFC-11).

16. Adiquim S.A. This company, which produced poliol using CFC-11 as an agent,
    concluded its technological conversion to HCFC-141b in May 2001 and received
    MLF funding in July the same year. The sub-project was partially financed with a
    US$47,924 grant from the MLF and helped reduce 32.90 MT of ODP.



                                       23

    17. Chileplast S.A. In 2001 this sub-project replaced the use of 3.68 MT of ODP
        (CFC-11) in its foaming process with an April 2001 grant of US$14,690 from the
       MLF.

    18. Inmopol. This sub-project, partially financed with a US$68,226 grant from the
       MLF, helped reduce 9.54 MT of ODP by displacing the use of CFC-11 in the
       manufacture of synthetic products. The sub-project was implemented in 2001 and
        received MLF funding shortly afterwards.

    19. Sindelen R-11. This company, which also submitted a proposal to replace the use
        of its CFC-12-based refrigerant in domestic refrigerators, initially proposed to
        modify a low-pressure foaming machine to operate with HCFC-141b. Later
        Sindelen decided to invest in high-pressure equipment and proceeded to destroy
        the equipment replaced. The foaming project involved an investment component
        that replaced equipment based on CFC-11 with HCFC-22 and CFC-141b. After a
        number of technical difficulties (explained in further detail under the section on
        Química Anglochilena above), Sindelen hired a full-time manager dedicated
        exclusively to implementing the ozone conversion projects in the company. With
        technical assistance from the World Bank, Sindelen's personnel visited facilities
        in the United States (Greenville and Huntsman) and Brazil (Tecunseh) to
        strengthen its technological capacity and knowledge. The project received
        US$49,565 from the MLF and reduced 9.02 MT of ODP.

    20. Rosen. The largest flexible foam producer in Chile, Rosen was the last to
        participate in the auction system. The company produced two types of foam in a
        single production line using Maxfoam high-pressure foaming equipment, which
        was replaced under the sub-project.

1.5.2.2 Methyl Bromide Alternatives Demonstration Project

This demonstration project was designed to test MeBr alternatives in soil treatment
applications for soil sterilization in the production of tomatoes and peppers. Approved in
1998 with a budget of US$348,130, the project tested a combination of chemical and
non-chemical alternatives such as (a) solarization, (b) steam pasteurization, (c) integrated
pest management, (d) substitution of agrochemicals, and (e) various seedbed substrates.

The project was implemented by the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIA,
the National Institute of Agriculture Technology), a semi-private, well-recognized
research entity in Chile. Tests were undertaken in the Santiago Metropolitan Area
(INIA's research center) and in Quillota and Colchagua, where mainly small agriculture
production units were involved. As part of project implementation, surveys were
undertaken under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture to update MeBr
consumption and usage practices. The results of the demonstration project were to
contribute to the design of an investment project to phase out the use of the chemical in
Chile. Although alternative technologies were found feasible, the GOC decided not to



                                              24

move forward with an approved MLF MeBr phase-out project. Nonetheless, the
demonstration project has had an impact in the regions where the tests were conducted
and has strengthened INIA, the institution in charge of training and technical assistance
for agricultural producers in Chile, especially small and medium-size growers.

1.5.2.3 Halon Bank

This US$60,000 sub-project envisioned creating a facility to help recover, reclaim, and
recycle the remaining halons in Chile but was designed to rely on the enactment of
Chile's ozone law, which would establish specific control over imports of ODS. Because
the law was not passed until March 2006, no funds could be disbursed. As a result, when
the World Bank prepared the closing of its MP operations in Chile, the project was
transferred to UNDP for implementation.

1.5.2.6 Actual vs. Projected Achievements

This section describes the achievements and outcomes of Phase II of Chile's Ozone
Depleting Substances Phase-out Project compared with the planned targets.

                   Projects implemented vs. projects pre-identified in the PAD

                   The division of TECFIN II into two tranches, one for US$1,000,000 and the other
                   for US$2,800,000, was approved. The objective of splitting the project into two
                   phases was to prove the auction mechanism before advancing to the second,
                   larger, phase. However, demand for technological conversion grants was much
                   lower than expected with the second tranche, and only 57 percent of the funds
                   were allocated. The main reasons for this lack of demand were (a) conversions


                                                                                         25

undertaken by the potential companies on their own, (b) environmental
management seen as a means to achieve competitiveness in the national and
international markets in Chile, an exporting country, (c) the rising price of CFC,
which made conversions economical, (d) changes in projects eligibility criteria,
which is the case for supermarkets and end-users in general, (e) the fact that most
remaining consumption was from small companies that had difficulty financing
the conversion projects in advance, and (f) the possibility of finding MP financing
at higher levels than the auctioning through other UN implementing agencies; this
was true for SINDELEN, whose project to convert its refrigeration production
line to HFC-134a was initially submitted to the Bank, then withdrawn, and later
implemented through UNDP; the Bank returned US$1,512,624 to the MLF at the
end of the project.

The halon bank funding was not disbursed as anticipated. As explained above,
this was the result of delays in the approval of the enabling legislation. It was then
agreed with CONAMA that the project would be transferred to UNDP to perform
as an implementing agency for UNDP management.

Amount approved vs. actual disbursement

TECFIN II was structured on the assumption that a local law accelerating CFC
phase out would be enacted to provide a strong incentive framework for the grants
auction. When enactment of such a law took longer than expected, it was
necessary to promote the advantages of the MLF grants program using funds from
the institutional strengthening component. As explained above, the entire project
allocation was not used (US$1,512,624 was not allocated and had to be returned
to the MLF). However, the ODP impact was higher than expected: 409 MT of
ODP vs. the 400 MT estimated.

Counterpart funds

All participants in the TECFIN sub-projects had to submit a project proposal,
committing to invest counterpart funds. The higher the counterpart funding, the
better the chance of obtaining the grant. TECFIN counterpart funding accounted
for 63 percent of total project costs. TECFIN I and II project costs were estimated
at a minimum of US$5.1 million. For the MeBr sub-project, counterpart funding
amounted to 26 percent. The level of counterpart funding for the investment
projects financed with the competitively allocated grants under the TECFIN
program was relatively high compared with the average 20­35 percent
contribution of project beneficiaries in other MP programs, as reported by the
MLF in its project database. This is because companies obtained the grants by
offering the lowest possible cost-effectiveness (CE) ratio, which at the end
translated into lower grant ratios per project.




                                      26

        Approved vs. actual impact

        The project set an unrealistically high ODP target for Phase I because it was one
        of the first MLF projects approved and there was no reference to the effect that
        soft measures could have on the market. In the end, MLF rules were clearly set, so
        that no ODP impact was to be counted as a direct result of non-investment
        projects. The target of 729 MT of ODP to be phased out under Phase I was
        revised to 120 MT, which was met through TECFIN I. The project also met the
        target of 444 MT of ODP set by TECFIN II, as the project's actual impact in
        Phase II was 409 MT of ODP.

        Project Duration

        TECFIN II was structured as an umbrella operation. Therefore, the entire group of
        sub-projects had to wait for the last bidding call and completion of the last
        selected projects before TECFIN II could be declared finalized. As a result,
        TECFIN II lasted for seven years, to allow for eight bidding calls and
        implementation of 20 conversion projects. Phase I lasted three years, and the
        MeBr Demonstration Project lasted four. On average, TECFIN sub-projects took
        two years to implement.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The OTF Grant Agreement in Chile was prepared to assist the country in meeting its MP
commitments. The Grant was approved in May 1993 for a total of US$1.2 million and
later restructured in July 1996 for a total of US$6.5 million. This amount corresponded to
an indicative ceiling determined on the basis of the ODS consumption trends outlined in
the 1992 CP prepared by the GOC and the expected impact of the Bank's potential
projects. In general, the ceiling was determined by assuming (a) the average MLF cost-
effectiveness level (US$/kg ODP) of the projects to be financed, per sector and (b) the
ODS consumption per sector identified in the CP.

This methodology allowed flexibility in the implementation of an uncertain number of
sub-projects in undetermined sectors and therefore a significant range of cost-
effectiveness ratios. The Bank used similar procedures to establish overall program
ceilings up to 2001 in the development and sizing of all of its MP operations, as did the
other implementing agencies when estimating the potential size of their portfolios.




                                              27

The following lessons were learned from the design of Chile's Ozone Depleting
Substances Phase-out Project:

    1. Although the project had good coverage of industries from the different ODS-
         consuming sectors, the following factors prevented a more positive outcome of
         sub-projects and investment operations:

         a. The phase-out schedule implemented by the GOC was more accelerated than
              that of the Montreal Protocol, which caused industries in the halon and aerosol
              sectors to implement the projects on their own.
         b. MP policies changed regarding supermarkets as an industrial sector eligible
              for financing. The ExCom decision not to finance conversion of supermarkets
              had a significant impact on the potential size of the Bank's project. In fact, the
              PAD had pre-identified this sector as one of the priorities for the Bank, as
              ODS consumption by the sector had been estimated at roughly at 500 MT.
         c. A strong economic recession in 1999 drastically reduced industrial output and
              ODS consumption. The levels of ODS consumption on which the Bank's
              project was designed and which were included in the 1994 CP fell drastically
              during the 1999 recession7 and never recovered.
         d. The development of new, more cost-effective technologies reduced the overall
              costs of conversion projects.
         e. MLF-funded conversions cannot take place for small and medium enterprises
              (SME) within the pre-established cost-effectiveness thresholds.

     2. Overall, the competitive approach used in TECFIN proved effective in reducing
          project preparation costs and avoiding bureaucratic delays, as sub-projects were
          developed by the beneficiaries to be selected by CONAMA based on a pre-
          determined set of clear rules. The system was unique at global level and helped
          achieve a very cost-effective conversion to non-ODS technologies.

     3. The umbrella project showed that overall cost effectiveness, consistent with
          Multilateral Fund Executive Committee (MFEC) thresholds, can be achieved
          while allowing for low cost-effectiveness thresholds for individual sub-projects.
          In so doing, this approach allows greater participation by SME in technological
          conversion programs within the MP framework.




7At the end of the 1990s, Chile, like most of Latin America, faced a one-year downturn. Its domestic
economy underwent a minor recession, and its growth faltered briefly. In early 1999, Chile's private sector
experienced a crisis of expectations triggered by the negative impact of the Asian crisis on its terms of trade
and export volumes, sharp fluctuations in domestic interest rates, exchange rate pressures, and a serious
drought (attributable to the weather phenomenon La Niña (Aninat, Eduardo. 2000. "Chile in the 1990s:
Embracing Development Opportunities." Finance and Development 37 (1), March. Washington:
International Monetary Fund).




                                                     28

     4. The project ultimately phased out 527 MT of ODP, compared with the expected
        520. It is more indicative of the project's impacts and successful outcomes that
        100 percent of the approved phase out was realized with only 70 percent of the
        resources approved by the ExCom, considering the large counterpart share of all
        approved sub-projects.

     5. The creation of the Ozone Team, a generalized practice in all MP operations, has
        proven to be a key element for the success of the project. In general, MP
        operations are somewhat different from operations performed by the institutions
        hosting the ozone teams (i.e., environmental and industrial executive agencies at
        national level). The institutional strengthening resources provided by the MLF
        helped consolidate the MP institution in Chile, including the establishment of
        legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms. The creation of an institution
        responsible for implementing activities and projects to reduce and phase out ODS
        ensured the fulfillment of the obligations under the Montreal Protocol.

2.2 Implementation

To enter into the Second Phase, the project was restructured, new resources were added,
the objectives were changed, and the components as well. In general, implementation was
carried out as outlined in the corresponding MOD, by financing conversion subprojects in
the various ODS consuming sectors. In spite of some implementation delays associated
for the most part to procedural difficulties involving individual beneficiaries, the project
advanced in a satisfactory manner.         The project's performance was consistently
satisfactory. After the second phase design and approval, no mid-term review was
conducted and the project was never considered to be "at risk".


In 2003 a National Phase-out Plan for Refrigerants was approved for Chile, implemented
by Environment Canada and UNEP with funds managed by UNDP, to reduce all ODS
consumption in the refrigeration sector. This program was directed to most of the
industries with remaining ODS consumption. As no additional ODS would be phased out
by the Bank project, internal discussions took place to consider whether it would be
prudent to amend the Grant Agreement to reflect the change in the project's indicative
ceiling. At the time, it was decided not to amend the Agreement, primarily for the
following reasons:

    1. The Grant Agreement ceiling had no impact on the country's or Bank's
        performance, as it did not portray any legal obligation to the parties. As explained
        in section 1.1 above, the Montreal Protocol Umbrella Projects set funding ceilings
        to create a legal framework for sub-projects approved on a continuous basis by
        the MLF.

    2. Amending the Grant Agreement would have added unnecessary costs to the
        project, as well as unwarranted processing both for CONAMA and the Ministry
        of Finance.




                                             29

    3. All Bank MP trust funds were set up following the same model, and none were
        amended to reflect their actual impact.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Close monitoring and evaluation of the progress of each individual sub-project financed
under the MP are intrinsic to the operations of the MLF and its Secretariat. After approval
of each sub-project, implementing agencies are required to report quarterly to the
Secretariat on the progress of each individual activity. The country prepares detailed
progress reports including the number of beneficiaries, status of signing of agreements,
disbursement levels, phase-out levels, and many other data every three months. These are
compiled by the Bank and submitted to the MLF Secretariat for scrutiny. All of this
information is publicly available on the MLF Secretariat's database. If projects are non-
performing or targets are not being met, the Secretariat (on behalf of the Excom) sends
official letters to the countries to inquire about progress and demand mitigating action
plans.

In addition to the reporting, implementing agencies are required to conduct periodic
supervision missions, to meet with the government to discuss issues involving regulatory
controls of ODS consumption and production, and to inspect delivery of equipment and
actual phase out at beneficiary enterprises.

Given these requirements, it was absolutely essential for the team working on this project
to keep in close contact with the OT at CONAMA and to be informed at all times of the
progress of each sub-project. Supervision missions were carried out twice a year at first
and then at least once a year. The Bank team also met periodically with other
implementing agencies and bilateral organizations involved in programs in Chile (either
during missions in Chile or during Excom meetings). The Montreal Protocol institutions
include the regional Ozone Networks organized by UNEP, which consist of regional
meetings of the ozone teams and the multilateral implementing agencies. In addition, the
Bank holds annual meetings of the governmental agencies at global level. These forums,
in addition to the MLF meetings, helped the Bank develop good communication with the
UN agencies (UNDP and UNIDO) and other governmental agencies (e.g., Environment
Canada) engaged in developing the Montreal Protocol in Chile.

The project development objective was to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by
providing financial incentives for industrial conversion from ODS to non-ODS
technologies and promote measures to reduce or eliminate emissions of ODS.
Performance indicators to measure progress toward achieving the development objective
included (a) reduction of ODS consumption (Phase I and II), (b) development of an
institutional framework for the implementation of the MP, (c) development of a
regulatory framework to comply with maximum consumption targets, (d) establishment
of labels on "ozone-friendly" products and services, (e) raising awareness of ozone
depletion and (f) technical guidance to entrepreneurs on mechanisms to shift to ODS-free
technologies.




                                             30

Because individual sub-projects were not known at the time of project preparation and
Grant Agreement signing, performance indicators were linked to the outcome of sub-
projects approved by the MLF. Information on these indicators was included in quarterly
progress reports and Project Completion Reports (PCR) prepared by the Bank and the
GOC and submitted to the MLF Secretariat after each sub-project was completed. The
PCR are particularly detailed documents that report all expenses and clearly outline all
the outcomes of the project and must be approved by the MLF Secretariat. Any funds that
remain unspent after project implementation is completed must be indicated in these
reports and returned to the MLF.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project was rated as category C because no potential negative environmental impacts
were identified. Rather, the project offered positive environmental impacts at both global
and local levels. According to the Environmental Data Sheet for this project, participating
enterprises were responsible for meeting emission standards, preparing environmental
impact assessments where needed, and obtaining environmental licenses required by
Chilean law and World Bank environmental guidelines. Because of the nature of these
sub-projects, the impact was so negligible that only environmental data sheets, but no
environmental impact assessment, were required.

Grant funding under the project was approved for sub-projects designed to phase out
ODS in all sectors for which the ExCom approved sector guidelines. These guidelines
resulted from the input of the UN Technical and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP)8
and World Bank Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG)9 and from interaction with
technical staff at the Ozone Secretariat, MLF, country representatives at the ExCom,
Open-Ended Working Group, and Meeting of the Parties. Under these guidelines, the
ExCom evaluates and approves sub-projects. The project dealt with existing enterprises
and relatively small quantities of ODS. Safety issues associated with some of the
substitute chemicals or other issues were addressed project by project.

Fiduciary compliance was ensured by training staff working on the project on both Bank
regulations and the specific requirements associated with MP projects (eligibility and
fiduciary issues). For example, OT staff were invited to Washington once a year to
participate in annual Financial Intermediary workshops conducted by World Bank's
Global Environment Division (ENVGC). In these two-day workshops, staff from every
country where MP operations are carried out discuss procedural and project issues, as
well as the latest Excom requirements. Periodic procurement and financial management
reviews were also conducted.




8This is an international group of experts appointed by the United Nations System through the Ozone
Secretariat, which evaluates technologies and associated economic effects of ODS phase-out
implementation options.
9This is a group of international experts appointed by the World Bank to provide technical advice, help
review potential MLF sub-projects, and update the Bank and other agencies on the state of the art of phase-
out technologies.


                                                    31

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Sustainability of the project as a whole was guaranteed by establishing a national legal
framework. A law prohibiting the consumption of ODS in all manufacturing and
consuming sectors, in accordance with the MP phase-out schedules, was drafted by
CONAMA, reviewed by all relevant government agencies, and approved by Presidential
decree in March 2006. The law has been implemented for some of the ODS-consuming
sectors, and specific decrees have been fully in place since 2007. Decree 37 of the
Secretary General Ministry to the President, which entered into force in September 2007,
provided the input for the creation of a control import system under the responsibility of
the Customs Service by establishing the regulation applicable to the import of ODS,
maximum import volumes, and criteria for distribution of ODS import volumes.
Companies were given incentives to phase out ODS. Now that ODS sectors are clear of
ODS consumption, the law prohibits recurrent ODS activities in the specific sectors.

In addition, the MLF financing mechanism enhances the sustainability of sub-projects
because it provides incremental operational and capital costs during the transition to the
new technologies. All equipment purchased under the project was fully paid for each
company (in some cases, firms had to contribute their own resources).

Finally, the project built the necessary institutional capacity at CONAMA through the
creation and funding of the Ozone Team, which had strong ownership of the country
program to eliminate CFC. The fact that Chile has been in compliance with the Montreal
Protocol is a good indicator of proper capacity attained at CONAMA. CONAMA
continues to be the executing agency for Chile's national phase-out program, will
continue to be the national focal point until MP commitments are over, and is the
institution responsible for the implementation of the Ozone Law by coordinating a group
of multi-sectoral public entities including the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health,
Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economy, among others.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Chile and its Montreal Protocol Obligations

The Montreal Protocol phase-out commitment established three main reduction targets:
(a) the 1999 ODS consumption freeze (national average consumption 1995­1997), (b) a
50 percent reduction in ODS consumption from a 1999 freeze level by 2005, and (c) a
complete phase out by 2010.

Data on ODS consumption in Chile have been very encouraging since 1994, as shown in
table 9, to a great extent as a result of the government's commitment to comply with the
MP. Although consumption of ODS did not decrease as consistently over Phase I, as seen
in the table and figure below, there was a higher impact on ODS consumption once more
realistic measures were assessed and more stringent policies adopted both at international
and country levels. The Montreal Protocol called for consumption of CFC in Chile not to
exceed 414 MT in 2005. In that year CFC consumption in Chile was 221 MT of ODP,


                                              32

roughly 50 percent below the required level. Chile has therefore been very well
positioned to meet its 85 percent consumption reduction target, which became effective
in January 2007.

The projects in which the World Bank was involved have been successful in contributing
to the country's ODS phase-out targets. While market forces and government
intervention have also influenced this trend, the projects implemented by the World Bank
have helped ensure that the conversion to non-ODS technologies is sustainable and have
prevented a recurrence of ODS use over the long term. In this case, the Bank helped the
country eliminate over 50 percent of the baseline ODP consumption. In many of the
implemented projects, this was done through innovative solutions specifically tailored to
the Chilean context. The TECFIN auction process, for example, was innovative in its
approach to eliminating some of the barriers to SME participation (e.g., insurance deals,
tax exemptions) and ultimately extremely effective in eliminating a significant fraction of
the sector's consumption. Under TECFIN, enterprises competed for the MLF grants by
bidding on cost-effectiveness to eliminate their ODS consumption. The lower the ODS
phase out for MLF, the greater the chance of obtaining the grants. In this way the project
allowed competitive and cost-efficient allocation of the grant resources from the MLF.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Chile's ODS Phase-out Project objectives have been in line with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) objectives. Most important, the project was developed at a critical time
for Chile to meet its commitments to the Montreal Protocol. Under the MP, developing
countries were expected to reduce their consumption of CFC by 50 percent by 2005 and
85 percent by 2007. The project helped Chile meet the 2005 quota by contributing to
eliminate ODS consumption through projects in two key sectors (foams and refrigeration).
Chile is presently on track to meeting the 2007 target, as described in the following
section.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

Project success is deemed satisfactory, as measured by three main indicators. First, the
fundamental objective of the project was to ensure that Chile could meet its Montreal
Protocol targets to phase out ODS according to the protocol schedule. Chile's CFC
consumption decreased from a baseline of almost 900 MT of CFC in 1993 to roughly 181
MT by 2006, in compliance with its MP commitments (table 9 and figure 1). Second, the
results of the individual sub-projects targeted by the World Bank were satisfactory (527
MT vs. 520 MT of direct impact from 1993 to 2007). Third, the project built institutional
and technical capacity to bring long-term benefits to Chile, guaranteeing sustainability.

Success of sub-projects. The Ozone Projects Trust Fund Grant was successful in
contributing to the elimination of ODS use in Chile. Sub-projects in which the Bank
participated achieved the expected levels of ODS phase out. Table 10 shows the
combined impact of the Bank's intervention in the five sectors.

          effectiveness of the project).

3.3 Efficiency

Montreal Protocol projects do not require a net present value (NPV) or economic rate of
return (ERR) calculation. The main criterion that determines the level of eligible funding
for these projects is cost effectiveness. Project cost effectiveness must fall within pre-
established CE thresholds for the different sectors to be eligible. These thresholds were
established by the MLF based on the assessment of experts from the Bank's Ozone
Operations Resource Group and experience from previously executed projects, as the
MLF Secretariat registers and keeps records on phase-out costs. This means that all
approved MP projects are expected to comply with that pre-set indicator of efficiency.
Table 11 shows the final cost effectiveness achieved per sector.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

By the time this project was approved, there was no requirement for monitoring
indicators. Therefore, the assessment of outcomes presented in this section is based on
the indicators that were later included in the Implementation Status and Results Report
(ISR) and listed below.

    1. To develop a regulatory framework to comply with maximum consumption
       targets in order to ensure that ODS imports do not exceed controlled values
    2. To establish labels on "ozone-friendly" products and services
    3. To raise awareness of the ozone layer problem
    4. To provide technical guidance to entrepreneurs in specific industries on
       mechanisms to shift to non-ozone-depleting technologies

However, the overall performance of the project is rated satisfactory because the country
has been meeting its consumption reduction commitments under the Montreal Protocol.
Based on the following progress indicators, the project achieved its goals:

    1. An Ozone Law that includes caps on consumption was put into effect by
       presidential decree in March 2006, following passage by Congress in October
       2005. The regulation of this Law entered into force in September 2007, and it is
       being implemented by the Customs Service that controls the maximum import
       volume system (license system).
    2. In 1996 the Ozone Seal Program was established and developed standard labels
       for products and services that avoid emissions of control substances.
    3. In 1995­1996 a public awareness campaigned promoted demand of non-ODS
       products, informing the public on how to prevent UV radiation and promoting
       industrial conversion.
    4. In March 1997 the Ozone Team held an international workshop on alternative
       technologies in the refrigeration and foam sectors.



                                                   36

    5. Most important, Chile's CFC consumption decreased from a baseline of almost
        900 MT of CFC in 1993 to roughly 181 MT by 2006, in compliance with its MP
        commitments.

According to all of the performance indicators above, the project satisfactorily met its
targets. The indicative funding and phase-out ceilings outlined in the Memorandum of the
Director (MOD) were reached in terms of both the project contribution and the voluntary
phase-out process.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low or negligible

The risk to the global environmental outcome would arise from Chile's non-compliance
with its obligations under the Montreal Protocol. This risk is considered minimal, and
long-term project sustainability is rated likely. As shown below, the GOC has shown
strong commitment to adhering to its Montreal Protocol obligations.

    1. Parallel to the projects, the GOC enacted regulation that controls imports of ODS
        in accordance with the reduction targets imposed by the MP. This has been an
        effective way to control internal consumption. Regulation also controls the use of
        ODS in manufacturing sectors in which ODS consumption has been phased out.
        Finally, the GOC has been actively involved in regional efforts to control illegal
        trade of ODS substances, which has not proven as critical in Latin America as in
        other regions of the world.

    2. With assistance from the Bank, Chile has successfully implemented Phase I and
        Phase II projects that have phased out more than 50 percent of the country's
        baseline ODS consumption in key industrial sectors over the past 15 years. With
        assistance from UNDP, the country is currently phasing out consumption of
        halons, the final significant consuming sector. UNDP has also established a fund
        for technical and financial assistance for remaining projects in the foam and




                                            37

        refrigeration sectors that specifically targets small industries. The country is well
        on its way to meeting its 2010 total reduction commitment.

    3. The companies that received assistance from the MLF were granted new
        equipment and training to ensure that they would be successful in their transition
        from ODS to alternative substances. Moreover, old ODS-based equipment was
        destroyed in all applicable cases, as per the requirements of the MP. It is therefore
        unlikely that any of the companies that benefited from Bank or UNDP projects
        will return to using ODS.

    4. The IS project continues and will be financed by the MLF at least until 2010 and
        possibly beyond. This will ensure that the capacity created at CONAMA at
        central and regional levels will remain in place until full phase out of ODS. Public
        awareness events (e.g., International Ozone Day, radio and newspaper campaigns,
        the Ozone Seal, recycling program for old refrigerators) successfully conducted
        across the country by the OT over the past 15 years will continue until 2010.

    5. Global production of ODS, except for those needed to satisfy critical uses that
        have been granted exemptions, will be phased out by 2010. This residual
        consumption will be limited to a few sectors (e.g., laboratory and analytical uses,
        metered-dose inhalers for asthma patients) and heavily controlled. The global
        supply of ODS, which has been dropping over the past 20 years, will be reduced
        to virtually zero by 2010. The unavailability of ODS in the world market will
        contribute to supporting the efforts that all developing countries have been
        making to eliminate their consumption of ODS and to further reducing any risks
        that the GOC does not meet its obligations under the MP.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

As noted in earlier sections, throughout the life of the project, Bank staff worked closely
with CONAMA to ensure proper identification, preparation, and implementation of
conversion sub-projects. In particular, Bank staff involved local OT and other CONAMA
staff in sub-project preparation and implementation. The Bank hired highly specialized
consultants to support the GOC in key areas such as the design of technically challenging
projects, the analysis of market studies to assess the best strategy for phase out, including
the Ozone Seal, and training activities. The OT was involved in all aspects of
implementation of Bank projects, including equipment selection and procurement
(following Bank guidelines).

The Bank also provided valuable support to the GOC in the strategic policy design (e.g.,
specific aspects of the ODS control regulation) and during its negotiations at the ExCom
meetings.




                                              38

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision was adequate, as Bank staff worked closely with the OT and CONAMA to
ensure the adequate progress of the project. The Bank maintained close contact with both
agencies to prepare the quarterly reports required for submission to the MLF Secretariat
(e.g., Business Plans, Progress Reports, and Project Completion Reports). Supervision
missions were conducted at least twice a year during most of the project life and once a
year during the final year of implementation. During these missions, the Bank
(accompanied by the OT) visited the companies with projects under implementation and
provided guidance and technical support (see Annex 6). At the same time, CONAMA
supervised and assisted the companies throughout implementation.

To mainstream MP operations, Project Supervision Reports (PSR) were introduced in
FY00. Moreover, aides mémoire were elaborated after preparation and supervision
missions starting in 1998, even though they were not formally required until 2000.

Procurement post-reviews, as well as financial audits, proved satisfactory. With regard to
safeguard policies, because project documents were typically prepared in collaboration
between the OT and the Bank, they had to comply with Chilean laws and Bank
environmental guidelines before being sent to the MLF.

The project was reviewed by QAG in February 2000 and its supervision was considered
satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The project assisted the GOC in meeting its ODS reduction targets under the Montreal
Protocol. In particular, Bank-implemented projects contributed to the phase out of ODS
consumption in the refrigeration (commercial and industrial) and rigid foam sectors. The
Bank's proactive involvement in helping the GOC start implementation was important in
surmounting the initial delays and advancing implementation.

The Bank's involving the OT in all aspects of project implementation helped build
capacity at CONAMA (e.g., for project identification, design, and preparation,
procurement, and financial management) and promoted government ownership of all of
the Bank-implemented conversion projects.

5.2 Borrower

CONAMA (through the OT) was the agency designated by the GOC to execute the Grant.
All technical, regulatory, and policy and financial issues were handled by the OT.

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory




                                             39

The GOC was responsible for identifying the sub-projects and industrial sectors that
would request funding from the MLF. With the support of the Bank, the government
established a clear strategy to create awareness of ozone depletion and to prepare sub-
projects in different industrial sectors. The GOC's leadership and vision ensured that the
program developed was appropriate to adhere to the ODS phase-out schedule of the
Montreal Protocol. Its commitment to ensure compliance to MP commitments guaranteed
that the pertinent regulation to control imports of ODS was enacted and enforced at the
national level. Its oversight of day-to-day operations and its attention detail, crucial for
the successful implementation of the type of investment sub-projects financed by the
MLF, warranted the impact that the overall MP program has had over the past 15 years.
Its performance is therefore assessed as satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

CONAMA's role as implementing agency was satisfactory, as all project documents and
activities were prepared on time and of high quality. In addition, supervision reports for
ongoing projects were of high quality and always submitted on time to the Bank. The
team at CONAMA worked closely with the Bank during the entire project and prepared
logistics for Bank missions ahead of time, making supervision easier.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance of the GOC during the project is assessed as satisfactory for the
reasons mentioned above. The objectives of the grant were met, and Chile is well on its
way to phasing out ODS completely by 2010.

6. Lessons Learned

Lessons learned from Chile's Ozone Depleting Substances Phase-out Project are listed
below by category.

6.1 National and sectoral approaches to phase out ODS

The main lesson to be drawn from this and other MP operations implemented by the
Bank is the importance of considering the overall national picture when tackling issues as
broad as the phase out of a major raw material such as ODS. One of the main lessons
learned at the level of the Excom is that a project-by-project approach would never have
resulted in the overwhelming success that national phase-out plans have achieved. The
responsibility and flexibility given to governments by these types of performance-based
agreements allow them to adapt operations to the specific context of their countries, as
well as to combine policy-level actions and specific investments in the various industrial
sectors.

6.2 Auction mechanism (calls for bidding)

An auction system can reduce project costs and administrative expenses. Because the
program in Chile only disbursed after implementation, less administrative work was


                                             40

required during the projects (only in cases of technical or financial difficulties). A
drawback of a post-project reimbursement mechanism is that companies have to bear the
financial risk, causing some projects to stall. CE values must be attractive to SME for
increased participation. Under the "cap" for each auction, SME could participate at lower
cost-effectiveness than larger companies. This approach can be applied to some extent in
sector and umbrella projects. Unless project preparation support is provided to SME with
low or no technical capacity, they are unable to participate. In the Chilean case, an
independent and neutral consultant helps promote the program and assists companies put
together the required documentation.

6.3 Regulatory support

The phase out achieved through investment sub-projects would not have been sustainable
if the GOC had not put in place regulation to control and phase out ODS imports and
manufacturing using ODS. ODS are still available in much smaller volumes around the
world, and limited supply will continue until 2010. If the GOC had not introduced
regulation and enforced its control on ODS supply, market forces would have encouraged
Chilean enterprises to continue the use of these substances. The strong commitment of
the GOC to comply with its MP obligations and its continuous oversight of the regulatory
situation were absolutely critical to the success and the sustainability of the project.
Moreover, in 2006 GOC enacted a law to advance controls for CFC according to the
achievements in the country to ensure that the achieved reductions could be sustained.

6.4 Institutional strengthening

The Chile MP operation is indicative of the importance of the Bank being the
implementation agency that provides institutional support to a government. Through this
project, the Bank effectively contributed to the institutional strengthening of CONAMA.
While the OT gained considerable experience in negotiation techniques at the
international level and a better understanding of the mechanisms of several agencies of
the United Nations, it also gained extensive capacity in project management and
knowledge of the Bank's procurement and financial management procedures.

6.5 Bank implementation of Montreal Protocol operations

The Chilean MP project is one of the first MP operations implemented by the Bank, out
of approximately 20 country-based programs. These programs are atypical by Bank
standards but very successful according to both Bank and MLF criteria. A few of the
noteworthy aspects of this project, which has offered insight into efficient ways of
carrying out these operations, are listed below:

    1. The timeframe for these projects is typically longer than normal Bank operations,
        and progress (as reflected by disbursements) takes place in batches rather than on
        a continuous basis. This is due to the nature of the beneficiaries of the sub-
        projects and the difficulties in implementing each individual operation. It is
        important to stress that the time period needed to implement each of these sub-
        projects is dictated not only by Bank requirements but more precisely by MLF
        standards. Documentation and reporting requirements under the MLF were



                                             41

        extremely strenuous, particularly when applied to the typical beneficiaries of the
        projects and during Phase I. For group projects, these requirements multiply and
        can slow progress considerably. In the Chilean project, streamlining and
        simplifying these requirements as much as possible under the MLF standards
        greatly improved the response of small enterprises and made it possible to
        complete some of the projects.

    2. Indicative ceilings for disbursements under Grant Agreements have been used for
        all MP operations implemented by the Bank. This has allowed the team's
        flexibility in developing sub-project concepts and national strategies, without the
        constraints of amending legal documents. Although in some cases, such as the
        Chilean project, these ceilings are not fully met, this is not a poor reflection on the
        project performance but rather an indication of the context of each individual
        country. Ceilings are estimated on a sound technical basis and with the full
        endorsement of the countries, and they may or may not be met depending on the
        will of the governments.

    3. Close supervision, but more important, government ownership of these projects
        was critical in ensuring their successful completion. Relatively small problems
        could delay implementation for months, and it was the government's oversight
        that helped minimize these potential delays.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

    CONAMA (Technical Ozone Unit)

    (Former Executive Director of CONAMA, Ms. Ana Lya Uriarte, who left office in
    March 2007). The support of the MLF has been essential for the implementation of
    the Montreal Protocol in Chile. It has helped the conversion of companies to ODS-
    free production and has also provided resources for capacity building. It has proven
    essential in the increase awareness of people on this subject, promoting a behavioral
    change of individuals towards a shared responsibility on the protection of the
    environment. By ratifying the Protocol and all its Amendments, as well as the
    entering into force of the Ozone Law that regulated the consumption of ODS, Chile
    maintains its pledge with the goals of ODS reduction and the fulfillment of its
    commitments under the Protocol. Our current and future challenge is to keep this
    commitment, for which the support of the MLF and of all implementing agencies, as
    the World Bank has been, is and will continue to be essential for the country.

(b) Cofinanciers

Besides the direct project beneficiaries, which had to finance most of the conversion costs,
there were no other institutional co-financiers.

In general, companies that participated in the investment projects (auction system) had
very positive comments, mainly for two reasons: (a) the financing mechanism offered by



                                             42

the Montreal Protocol helped them during the transition of technologies by providing
incremental capital and operational costs, and (b) the technical assistance provided by the
project proved essential for the implementation of the conversion process (e.g., for
Sindelen and Química Anglo Chilena).

Because of the high costs involved in the process of changing technologies, TECFIN
allowed companies to implement their conversion process earlier than they could have
using only their own means. This technological financing program allowed some
companies (e.g., CTI and Rosen) to access more environmentally demanding national and
international markets.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Chile Ozone Depleting Substances Phase out (Montreal Protocol) Project does not
have a specific economic and financial analysis. Grant operations within the framework
of the Montreal Protocol use pre-established cost-effectiveness criteria for all investment
projects. Cost effectiveness is the ratio that indicates the specific cost for phasing out a
kilogram of ozone depleting substances (ODS). The project was designed to improve the
average Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund cost effectiveness by means of a market-
based grant allocation mechanism. The result has shown that the project is highly
effective from a cost-effectiveness standpoint. Considering that the regular costs (to the
MLF) for conversions are over US$12/kg for the refrigeration sector and over US$7/kg
for the rigid foam sector, the operation in Chile has achieved ODS reductions at much
lower costs. Because most of the Chilean ODS consumption at the beginning of the
project was in the sectors mentioned above, achieving an average cost effectiveness of
US$5.15/kg is highly satisfactory.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente (CONAMA) provided overall positive
comments on the implementation and execution of the Chile Ozone Depleting Substances
Phase out (Montreal Protocol) Project. These comments are reproduced below.

We fully agree with what has been described in the ICR. It reflects the coordinate work in
implementing projects and activities for the fulfillment of the obligations of Chile under
the Montreal Protocol, between the Ozone Unit in CONAMA as the representative of the
Chilean government and the World Bank. It also accurately describes the financial and
technical support provided by the Bank for the launching of the Ozone Unit, as the
agency responsible for ensuring the completion of all activities to reduce ODS.

The work with the World Bank has been very effective in creating capacity within the
country. The Bank has provided technical assistance to elaborate and evaluate projects
and for the planning of future activities. Supervision missions have been very helpful,
providing an opportunity to work on issues that required more detailed attention and on
those that were more complex to deal with. In particular we are very grateful for the
support of the Bank for the analysis and evaluation of projects.

From a specific project perspective, TECFIN I and II were an essential tool for the
fulfillment of the obligations of Chile under the Protocol. Both projects focused on
providing cost-effective financial support for those companies that used CFC and HCFC,
ensuring long-term and environmentally friendly results. Providing support with
government funds for conversion would have otherwise been very complex. These
projects allowed the country to fulfill the ODS reduction targets for 2005 (50 percent)
and 2007 (85 percent) with a good margin. Nevertheless, the fulfillment of the remaining
15 percent reduction required the elaboration and implementation of the Ozone Law.

Even more, Chile was very pleased to receive, as part of the celebration of the 20th
anniversary of the Protocol, "Recognition as the Exemplary Project of the Montreal
Protocol" for the Financing and Technological Reconversion Program (TECFIN).

The missions of the Bank offered great support in reference (sic) to raise awareness
among authorities of the importance of the implementation of an Ozone Law, which
would control the imports of ODS, and of the importance of the implementation of an
imports and exports licensing system. In May 2004, after the Bank's mission, the
Executive Director restructured the Ozone Unit and since then it has been given greater
consideration in the institutional decision making and planning processes, directly in
coordination with the Pollution Control Department and the Executive Directors
Department.

The support of the Bank on Institutional Strengthening has also been an essential element
that has ensured the completion of activities to reduce and eliminate the consumption of
ODS in the country. These resources have permitted the existence of a group of
professionals completely devoted to this task. The experienced gained in all these years
has been transferred to other departments within CONAMA, as well as other areas that

also deal with multilateral environmental agreements. For CONAMA, it is essential to
rely on the support of the Ozone Unit in order to comply with the obligations under the
Montreal Protocol.

In general, CONAMA and the country value the fact that all planned activities and set
objectives under the Montreal protocol have been completed and achieved.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

In general, companies that participated in the Technology Conversion Financing Program
(TECFIN) investment projects (auction system) had very positive comments, mainly for
two reasons. First, the financing mechanism offered by the Montreal Protocol helped
them during the transition of technologies by providing incremental capital and
operational costs. Second, the technical assistance provided by the project proved
essential for the implementation of the conversion process. This was true, for example,
for Sindelen and Química Anglo Chilena).

Because of the high costs involved in changing technologies, TECFIN allowed
companies to undertake their conversion processes earlier than they could have using
their own means. It is important to emphasize that this technological financing program
allowed some companies (e.g., CTI and Rosen) to access more environmentally
demanding national and international markets.
