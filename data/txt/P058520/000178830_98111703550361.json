The project's\n            three components are: Component A) implementation of health\n            financing reforms, which will establish the State Compulsory\n            Health Insurance Central Fund (SCHICF) and the Regional\n            Sickness Fund (RSF) as managers of the health care on the\n            part of their populations; Component B) development and\n            restructuring of health care services, establishing a\n            centralized priority-setting mechanism for major capital\n            investments; and Component C) implementation of health\n            communication strategies, through focus groups, surveys and\n            ad campaigns, the component will assess public views of the\n            health care system and prepare reform programs. Parallel to\n            project preparation, a social assessment of poverty was\n            carried out to complement the project and a positive\n            environmental impact is expected to better improve the space environment."}, "docdt": "1998-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
