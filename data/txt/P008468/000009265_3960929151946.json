The\n            objectives of the project are to combine physical expansion\n            and modernization of the network with institutional\n            strengthening through technical assistance and training. The\n            specific focus will be finalization of a strategy and\n            implementation plan for digitalization and automatization of\n            the network together with implementation of the first phase\n            of that program.  The main elements of the project are: (a)\n            construction of a digital overlay long-distance network with\n            attendant connections to local networks and, directly, to\n            large-volume customers; (b) strengthening of the commercial\n            orientation and capacity of Magyar Tavkozlesi Vallalat (MTV)\n            (e.g., by implementing the Management Information System\n            (MIS), developing and implementing modern accounting\n            systems, reorganizing operations along commercial lines,\n            etc.); and (c) introducing a regulatory framework to\n            encourage competition in selected portions of the\n            telecommunications sector."}, "docdt": "1990-09-12T00:00:00Z"}
