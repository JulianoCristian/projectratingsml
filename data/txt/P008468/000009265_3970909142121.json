The two loans and projects for telecommunications\n            in Hungary were made with the continued development\n            objectives, adapted to the operational and institutional\n            content evolving with time, of (i) assisting the\n            country's main telecommunications (TC) operating entity\n            in modernizing and expanding the systems under two\n            successive enlarged development programs, and (ii)\n            simultaneously ensuring the transition, in feasible steps,\n            from government type operation of a monopolistic utility\n            toward autonomous and efficient commercial type operation of\n            the services, with separate authorities for the service\n            provision and regulatory functions. Overall Bank performance\n            has been satisfactory under the project. The Borrower's\n            performance has been highly satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned are as follows: (a) the decade-long participation of\n            the Bank in the Hungarian Telecommunications sector had a\n            major and profound impact on its development, organization\n            and institutional evolution; (b) the first and second\n            telecommunications projects, which had about three common\n            years of implementation, can be considered as continuous\n            operations with complementary and interrelated objectives\n            and results; (c) the timing of the second project made it\n            possible to take best advantage of the new digital\n            technology in the planning, construction and operation of\n            modernized and expanded networks, digitalization strategy\n            prepared under the first project being applied in the design\n            of the second project and some procurement items being\n            redistributed to best benefit from the falling costs of\n            equipment; (d) to utilize alternative financing esources\n            rather than the Bank loan resulted in a partial disbursement\n            of Loan; (e) the continuity in the staff involved in the\n            dialogue with the Hungarian authorities and the two-pronged\n            support from the Bank and IFC in strengthening Matav's\n            capabilities and the opening up of part of the TC sector to\n            liberalized activities and competition, facilitated the\n            progress of the ongoing sector reform; (f) the\n            determination, persistence and consistency of Government of\n            Hungary(GOH) resulted in major steps being taken towards the\n            deregulation of the sector, the establishment of private or\n            privatized players in the TC market and the gradual\n            liberalization of the sector in line with current worldwide\n            trends; and (g) how the strengthening and development of the\n            main TC operator through traditional investment lending to a\n            government-owned public utility can be instrumental to the\n            actual privatization of the sector when there is the\n            political will and the Government is determined to\n            effectively engage and implement an in-depth reform of the\n            whole sector."}, "docdt": "1997-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
