A. 
Program Purpose and Project Development Objective 
1. 
Program 
purpose 
and 
program 
phasing: 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
Bahia 
Health 
System 
Reform 
Project 
is 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
of 
Bahia 
in 
its 
efforts 
to improve 
the 
health 
status 
of 
the 
Bahian 
population 
and 
to 
improve 
access, 
equity 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
health 
sector. 
The 
program 
design 
is 
based 
on 
the 
national policies 
for 
the decentralization 
of 
health 
care 
and 
on 
the 
state 
policies for 
poverty 
alleviation. 
These 
policies 
were 
reviewed 
by 
the 
Bank 
on 
a 
study 
(“Decentralization 
of 
Health 
Care 
in 
Brazil 
- 
A 
Case 
study 
of 
Bahia); 
the 
main 
recommendations 
of 
the 
study 
have been 
discussed 
with 
the 
incoming 
Governor 
of 
Bahia 
and 
are 
incorporated 
into 
the 
program. 
The program 
is 
described 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
(Annex 
1A). 
The 
Program 
complements 
numerous Government 
actions 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
and 
in 
other 
sectors 
with 
the potential 
to 
improve 
the 
health 
of 
the 
population (including 
education, water 
and 
sanitation 
and 
others). 
The 
integration 
of 
the 
Program 
with 
other 
Government 
actions 
is 
described 
in 
the 
Bahia 
State 
Assistance Strategy 
(Annex 
12 
of 
the 
PAD).  The 
program 
is 
designed 
as 
a seven-year 
effort, 
with 
a 
first 
phase 
(APL1: 
4 
years) 
of 
US$50 
million 
and 
a second 
phase 
(APL2: 
3 
years) 
of 
US$50 
million. 
Activities 
planned 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
APL2 
are a 
natural 
continuation 
of 
those 
financed 
under 
APL1. 
2. 
Project 
development objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
development 
objectives 
of 
the 
Bahia 
Health 
System 
Reform 
Project 
are 
to 
implement 
the 
national 
policy 
of 
health 
care 
decentralization 
seeking 
to: 
(i) 
improve 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
Basic 
Health 
Care, 
as 
measured 
by 
10 
Performance 
Indicators 
that 
measure 
the coverage 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
health 
interventions 
with 
the 
greatest 
influence  over 
child 
mortality, 
maternal 
mortality,  and 
the  incidence 
of 
diseases 
prevalent 
among 
the 
poor; 
(ii) 
reduce 
inequities 
in 
the 
allocation 
of 
publicly 
funded 
health 
care 
services, 
as 
measured 
by 
differentials  between per-capita 
regional 
budgets; 
and 
(iii) 
improve 
the eflciency  and 
quality 
in 
the 
use 
ofpublic 
resources, 
as 
measured 
by 
the 
implementation 
of 
regulation 
systems 
mandated 
by 
national 
policies.

Information 
on 
health 
outcomes 
is 
produced regularly  and 
with 
an  internationally 
recognized 
methodology; 
The 
proportion 
of 
federal 
and 
state 
spending concentrated 
in 
Salvador’s 
population 
is 
reduced 
from 
40% 
to 
30% 
of 
the total; 
Multi-municipal 
health 
micro-regions 
operate 
as 
purchasers 
of 
services, 
audit 
the 
provision 
of 
care 
and 
are 
accountable 
in 
the 
way 
they 
provide 
access 
to 
health 
care 
to 
the 
municipalities 
in 
their 
area; 
High 
complexity 
care 
is 
regulated 
with 
transparent 
rules 
for 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources 
to 
interventions 
and 
to 
patients 
and 
high 
complexity providers 
are 
subject 
to 
audits; 
The 
role 
of 
the 
State 
Health 
Secretariat 
as 
a 
provider 
of 
services 
is 
reduced 
by 
limiting 
the 
number 
of 
small 
hospitals  under 
its 
direct  control 
to 
no 
more 
that 
5, 
by 
transferring 
the 
responsibility 
for 
management 
of 
secondary 
health 
services 
in 
Salvador 
to 
the 
municipal 
government, 
and 
by 
providing 
new 
forms 
of 
autonomous management 
to 
the 
tertiary-level 
referral 
hospitals. 
B. 
Strategic Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) 
goal 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
24182-BR 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
March 
6,2000; 
CAS 
Update 
May 
20,2002 
The 
overall 
CAS 
goal 
is 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
long-term 
growth,  alleviate 
poverty 
and 
reduce 
income 
inequality 
in 
Brazil, 
while 
the  specific 
health 
sector 
goals 
of 
the 
CAS 
are 
to 
reduce 
child 
mortality, 
improve 
maternal 
health 
and combat 
HN/AIDS 
and 
other 
diseases. 
The 
CAS 
update 
report 
of 
May 
2002 
concluded  that 
CAS 
goals 
were 
being 
implemented effectively 
and  the 
goals 
remain 
appropriate 
- 
specifically, 
infant mortality 
fell 
from 
47.8 
per 
thousand 
in 
1990 
to 
29.6 
per 
thousand 
in 
2000. 
A 
new 
CAS 
will 
be 
discussed 
with 
the 
new 
government that 
took power 
in 
January 
2003 
and 
it 
is 
expected 
to 
lay 
out 
how 
Bank 
assistance 
would 
help 
Brazil 
achieve 
a 
set 
of 
social 
indicator 
targets, 
properly 
adapted 
from 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs). 
The 
proposed 
Bahia 
Health 
System 
Reform 
Project 
is 
in 
line 
with 
CAS 
goals 
in 
its 
emphasis 
on 
improving 
health 
outcomes 
and 
providing 
expanded 
access 
to 
Basic 
Care 
and reducing 
health 
inequalities. 
The 
CAS 
update  emphasized 
the 
role 
of 
the 
new 
operational 
norm 
of 
2001 
(NOAS) 
on 
health 
decentralization, 
and 
this 
program 
supports 
implementation 
of 
the 
policies reflected 
in 
that 
norm. 
The 
program 
also 
adheres 
to 
CAS 
goals 
in 
its 
geographic focus 
on 
Bahia 
-- 
a 
poor 
state 
in 
the Northeast, one 
of 
Brazil’s 
least 
developed regions. 
Bahia 
is 
home to 
an 
estimated 
four 
million 
people 
living 
below 
the 
poverty 
line. 
The 
program 
is 
also 
in 
line 
with 
the 
integrated 
development  approach 
proposed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
coordinated 
with 
the 
State 
government. 
This 
approach 
seeks 
to 
integrate 
all 
Bank 
projects 
in 
Bahia, 
regardless 
of 
sector, 
under 
a 
single  coordinated 
vision 
centered 
on 
four 
key 
lines 
of 
action: 
fighting 
poverty, 
improving 
governance, 
increasing 
competitiveness, 
and 
preserving the environment. Workshops 
held 
in 
October 
and 
December 
2002 
gathered 
government 
stakeholders 
from 
each 
of 
the 
State Secretariats 
to 
discuss 
integration 
across 
sectors 
along 
these 
lines 
of 
action. 
From 
these 
meetings 
it 
was 
clear that 
projects 
in 
the 
human 
development 
sector 
(education 
and 
health) 
correspond 
to 
the 
priorities 
of 
the 
state. 
This 
project 
will 
assist 
in 
furthering 
the 
development 
of 
the 
state’s 
integrated 
approach 
by 
devoting 
funds 
of 
institutional 
development 
to 
activities 
targeted 
at 
sharpening the state-level 
integrated 
strategy and 
for 
activities 
to 
disseminate 
lessons 
from 
the 
Bahia 
experience. 
A 
central 
pillar 
of 
such 
coordinated 
approach 
to 
development 
has 
been 
called 
“Gente 
da 
Bahia” 
and 
it 
focuses 
on 
combating 
poverty 
and inequality 
by 
placing 
emphasis 
on 
education, culture,  health, 
public 
safety, 
and 
access 
to 
water 
and 
sanitation. 
This 
project, 
and 
a 
simultaneous 
education 
project 
being 
prepared, 
are 
at the 
heart 
of 
the 
Gente 
da 
Bahia 
strategy 
and 
respond to the 
key 
interest 
of 
the 
state 
of 
8 
Page  9
improving 
quality 
of 
schooling. 
In 
addition, 
through 
this 
project 
the 
state 
is 
raising 
the  capacity 
in 
municipalities 
to 
increasingly 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
basic, 
primary 
education 
(grades 
1-4).

Main

Tssues 
This 
section 
summarizes 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
Bank 
Report 
“Decentralization 
of 
Health 
Care 
in 
Brazil 
- 
A 
Case 
Study 
of 
Bahia. 
While 
Bahia, 
(and 
more 
generally 
Brazil) 
have obtained 
significant 
improvements 
in 
the 
health 
status 
of 
the 
population 
in 
the 
last 
decade, 
key 
indicators such 
as 
infant 
mortality, 
maternal 
mortality 
and 
the  incidence 
of 
diseases 
typical 
of 
the 
poor 
remains 
high. 
Brazil 
has  a 
complex 
and 
sophisticated 
health 
sector 
that 
must 
respond 
to 
the 
basic demands (such 
as 
those measured 
by 
the 
MDGs) 
and 
to 
higher 
level 
demands 
typical 
of 
a 
middle 
income country. 
This 
section 
describes 
key 
aspects 
of 
the 
health 
system 
that 
must 
be 
understood 
to 
place 
the 
Govemment’s 
strategy 
in 
context. 
The 
efforts 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
most 
basic 
needs 
are 
then 
described 
as 
part 
of 
the 
wider 
strategy. 
Decentralization 
In 
an 
effort to improve 
access 
and 
equity, 
the 
Constitution 
of 
1988 
proclaimed 
a 
universal 
right 
to 
health 
care, 
unified 
the 
health 
services 
of 
the 
social 
security 
with 
those 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
(creating the 
Sistema 
Unico 
de 
SaGde 
or 
Unified 
Health 
System 
- 
SUS), 
and 
emphasized 
a 
role 
for 
municipalities 
in 
the 
management 
of 
health 
care. 
These 
principles 
were 
implemented through  legislation 
and  regulations 
(known 
by 
their 
Portuguese 
acronym 
as 
NOBs 
-Normas 
Operacionais Basicas) 
issued 
in 
the 
1990s. 
The 
NOBs 
introduced 
two 
reforms 
that 
had 
a 
significant 
impact 
over 
access 
to 
Basic 
Care 
and 
that began 
to 
improve 
the large 
existing 
inequities that 
characterize 
the 
Brazilian 
health 
system. 
The 
first 
reform 
consisted 
of 
the 
municipalization 
of 
Basic 
Care 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
PAB 
(Piso 
Assistencial 
Bhico), 
a 
basic package 
of 
services 
that 
must 
be 
provided 
by 
municipalities 
to 
their population 
and 
is 
financed 
by 
the  federal 
government 
through 
a 
fixed 
payment 
per 
capita 
(“capitation”). 
Participating municipalities 
must 
qualify 
for 
these 
transfers 
by 
meeting criteria 
that 
include 
signing 
of 
a 
Pacto 
de 
AtenqZo 
Bcisica 
(Basic 
Health 
Care  Agreement) 
with 
annual 
targets 
for 
the 
coverage 
of 
Basic 
Care 
programs 
in 
the 
municipality. 
The 
second 
reform 
consists 
of 
granting 
qualifying 
municipalities 
GestZo 
Plena 
do 
Sistema 
Municipal, 
a 
status 
that  entitles 
municipalities 
to 
receive 
block 
transfers 
directly 
from 
the  federal 
government 
to 
finance 
all 
levels 
of 
care 
for 
their 
population. 
For 
municipalities 
in 
this 
status, 
the 
state 
no 
longer 
channels 
the 
federal 
transfers 
(as 
it 
does elsewhere). 
While 
the 
municipalization 
of 
Basic 
Care 
is 
now 
virtually 
universal 
and 
is 
generally 
judged 
to 
be 
irreversible and 
successful, 
the 
municipalization 
of 
complex 
care 
covers 
a 
small fraction 
of 
municipalities 
and remains controversial 
on 
efficiency 
grounds. 
There 
is 
a 
growing 
concern that decentralizing 
Complex 
Care 
to 
municipalities 
is 
creating 
inefficiencies 
due 
to: 
(i) 
a 
loss 
of 
the economies 
of 
scale 
that characterize the 
production 
of 
most complex medical 
services;’ 
(ii) 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
risk-pool 
used 
to 
finance 
complex 
care; 
and 
(iii) 
a 
large 
increase 
in 
transaction 
costs associated 
with 
the 
need 
to 
replicate administrative 
functions 
in 
all 
municipalities. 
In 
order 
to 
retain 
the  benefits 
of 
devolving 
decision-making 
power 
to 
municipalities 
and 
to 
overcome 
the 
problems 
of 
excessive  fragmentation,  the 
Federal 
Govemment 
and  the 
Govemment 
of 
Bahia 
are 
supporting 
the 
creation 
of 
multi-municipal 
health 
micro-regions 
(described 
below). 
Financing 
of 
health 
care 
and 
inequality 
‘ 
This 
is 
not 
a 
significant 
problem 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
Basic 
Care, 
which 
can usually 
be 
efficiently 
provided 
at a 
lower 
scale.

The 
history 
of 
SUS 
includes 
a 
series 
of 
attempts 
to 
achieve 
sustainability 
by 
introducing 
cost 
controls 
in 
health 
expenditures 
and 
by 
attempting 
to 
secure greater 
financing 
from 
sub-national 
governments. 
Upon 
its 
creation, 
SUS 
allocations 
to 
each 
provider 
in 
the 
country 
were decided 
by 
the 
federal government 
and 
costs 
were 
kept 
under 
control 
by 
allowing inflation 
to 
erode 
the 
value 
of 
the 
fee 
schedule 
used 
to 
reimburse 
services 
(the 
tabela 
SUS). 
A 
fiscal 
crisis 
in 
1993 gave 
the 
impetus 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
an 
explicit 
system 
of 
cost 
controls 
that consisted 
of 
dividing 
the 
federal 
health 
budget 
into 
state 
budgets 
and 
giving 
state 
governments 
the 
authority 
to 
allocate 
these 
budgets. 
The 
granting 
of 
budgetary 
power to 
state 
governments 
was 
conceived 
as 
a 
transitional 
phase, 
as 
the 
constitution 
gives 
this 
responsibility 
to 
municipal 
governments. 
State 
governments 
maintained--and 
sometimes 
increased--the 
concentration 
of 
federally 
funded 
health 
expenditures 
in 
few 
geographic 
locations 
within 
the 
state 
and 
within 
these 
locations allocated 
the 
funds 
to 
individual 
providers 
without 
the 
benefit 
of 
transparent 
allocation 
rules. 
Since 
1996, 
there 
have  been 
attempts 
to 
shift 
the 
authority 
over 
federal 
resources 
from 
the 
state 
governments 
to 
municipalities. 
Since 
2001 
there 
is 
an 
additional 
attempt 
to 
create 
multi-municipal 
health 
microregions 
that 
would 
manage 
part 
of 
these 
resources. 
On 
the revenue 
side 
and 
following 
on 
the 
steps 
of 
the 
education 
sector, 
in 
2000 
Congress 
approved 
Constitutional Amendment 29 
requiring 
states 
and 
municipalities 
to 
earmark 
respectively 
12% 
and 
15% 
of 
their 
revenues 
for 
health. 
[PCl] 
In 
2000, 
Bahia 
spent 
the 
equivalent 
of 
6.7% 
of 
the 
state 
GDP 
on 
health 
care. 
The 
public 
sector finances 
45% 
of 
this 
expenditure. 
The 
Federal Government 
was 
the largest 
contributor, 
with 
57% 
of 
the 
total; 
its 
transfers 
were 
earmarked 
to 
Basic 
Care 
(27%), 
medium 
complexity 
care 
(63%) 
and 
high 
complexity 
care 
(10%). 
Federal 
transfers 
for 
Basic 
Care 
go directly 
to 
municipalities 
under 
the 
PAB 
system. 
Nineteen 
of 
the 417 
municipalities 
of 
the 
state 
have 
qualified for 
Gestdo 
Plena 
do Sistema 
Municipal, 
and 
receive 
9% 
of 
the 
federal transfers 
to Bahia 
for 
Medium 
Complexity 
Care. 
The 
state 
government 
in 
Bahia 
continues 
to 
handle 
two 
thirds 
of 
the 
federal 
transfers 
for 
health. 
The 
state 
government finances 
roughly 
one quarter 
of 
public 
expenditures 
in 
health, 
nearly 
80% 
of 
that 
is 
spent 
on 
medium 
complexity 
procedures 
provided 
by 
the 
state 
government’s 
directly-owned 
network 
of 
hospitals. 
The 
state 
government 
assigns 
only 
a 
small 
proportion 
of 
its 
budget 
to 
Basic 
Care. 
The Municipalities 
finance about 
20% 
of 
total 
public 
sector 
health 
spending 
in 
Bahia 
from 
their 
own 
resources. 
Roughly 
forty 
percent 
of 
this 
is 
spent 
on 
Basic 
Care, 
with 
the 
remainder devoted 
to 
medium 
complexity 
procedures. 
There 
are 
substantial 
variations 
in 
health 
spending 
among 
individual 
municipalities, 
this 
is 
not 
surprising 
given 
that 
they 
range 
in 
population 
(from 
2,987 
to 
2.25 
million) 
and 
in 
status 
(with 
19 
certified 
for 
gestdo 
plena). 
There exist 
major 
inequalities 
in 
the geographic 
distribution 
of 
public 
health 
resources 
within 
Bahia. 
In 
per 
capita 
terms,  some 
micro-regions 
consume 
six 
to 
ten times 
more 
Complex 
Care 
than 
others. 
Inequity 
in 
the 
geographical 
distribution 
of 
spending financed 
by 
the 
state 
government 
is 
even 
greater 
than 
the 
inequity 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
federal 
transfers. 
As 
the 
state  spends 
mostly 
on 
the 
payroll 
of 
its 
own 
hospitals, the 
localities 
where 
these 
hospitals reside 
obtain 
the 
largest 
benefits. 
The 
largest 
single 
problem 
of 
inequality 
is 
the 
concentration 
of 
health 
resources 
in 
Metropolitan 
Salvador.  Estimates 
of 
the 
benefits 
received 
by 
the 
local population 
suggest 
that 
with 
around 
18% 
of 
the 
state 
population, 
Metropolitan 
Salvador 
consumes 
30% 
of 
the 
federal  transfers 
for 
complex 
care 
and 
57% 
of 
state-financed 
health 
expenditures 
- 
this 
is 
equivalent 
to 
about 
40% 
of 
combined 
federal 
and 
state-government 
funds.3 
Despite 
the 
constitutional 
right 
to 
free 
and 
universal 
health 
care, 
households 
pay 
55% 
of 
the  cost 
of 
care. 
Households assign about 
7% 
of 
their 
total 
expenditures 
to 
health 
care. 
These 
estimates 
refer 
to 
the 
consumption 
of 
services 
by 
a 
population, 
and 
not 
to 
the 
production 
of 
services 
by 
the 
providers. 
The 
difference 
between 
these 
concepts 
is 
the 
use 
of 
referrals. 
Internationally, health 
expenditures 
are 
always 
concentrated 
in 
a 
few 
locations where 
services 
are 
concentrated 
and 
people 
from 
small 
locations 
are 
referred 
to 
the 
large cities 
to 
obtain 
complex 
health 
services. 
Referrals 
in 
Bahia 
account 
for 
a 
very small 
part 
of 
public 
health 
expenditures.

Government 
Strategy 
Following 
a 
long 
and 
participatory 
political 
process, 
the 
Government 
in 
2001 
issued 
its 
Norma 
Operacional 
de 
Assistincia 
de 
Saude 
- 
NOAS, 
which 
builds 
on 
the 
NOBs 
by 
expanding the 
use 
of 
per 
capita 
payments 
to 
cover 
a 
wider 
package 
of 
services 
and 
by 
completing 
the transfer 
of 
the 
management 
of 
federal 
funds 
to 
micro-regions. 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
NOAS 
is 
the 
promotion 
of 
greater 
equity 
and 
access 
to 
all 
levels 
of 
health 
care. 
It 
attempts 
to 
achieve 
this 
objective 
by 
breaking 
with 
the 
tradition 
of 
having 
State 
Governments 
allocate 
funds 
to 
health providers and  allocating 
them  more 
directly 
to 
populations. 
The 
municipalities 
for 
Basic 
Care 
and 
multi-municipal 
health 
micro-regions 
for 
medium 
complexity 
care 
will 
be 
“fundholders” 
for 
their  populations. 
The 
main 
features 
of 
NOAS 
are 
the 
following: 
e 
Mandates  an 
expansion 
in 
the  basic  package 
and 
in  capitation 
payments. 
It 
requires 
municipalities (who 
will 
remain 
in 
charge 
of 
Basic 
Care) 
to 
provide 
a 
wider 
array 
of 
services 
(now  called 
PAB-ampliado 
or 
PAB-A) 
to 
their  populations. 
Services 
must 
now 
include 
interventions 
for 
the 
control 
of 
tuberculosis,  Hansen’s 
disease, 
hypertension, 
diabetes, 
child 
health 
services, 
maternal 
care, 
and dental 
care, 
plus 
a 
list 
of 
specific 
diagnostic 
and 
treatment 
services. 
It 
also 
increases 
the 
share 
of 
funds 
that 
are 
distributed automatically 
on 
a 
per-capita 
basis 
to 
municipalities, 
by 
increasing the 
value 
of 
capitations 
associated 
with 
PAB-A, 
and 
by 
creating 
a 
new 
per-capita 
payment distributed 
to 
micro-regions 
to 
provide 
M1 
services. 
Creates micuo-regions 
and 
mandates 
the 
use 
of 
transparent 
systems 
for 
the 
distribution 
of 
federal 
resources 
for 
Complex 
Care. 
It 
requires 
states 
to 
divide 
their territory 
into 
multi-municipal 
health 
micro-regions  and 
to 
allocate  federal 
funds 
for 
Complex 
Care 
to 
these 
micro-regions 
using 
a 
participatory 
process 
(Programaq6o 
Pactuada  e 
Integrada 
- 
PPI 
- 
Intergovernmental 
budget 
Programming). 
Budget planning 
would 
be 
based 
on 
needs 
estimated 
using 
the 
size 
and the 
epidemiological 
status[PC2] 
of 
the 
population 
of 
each 
municipality. Micro-regions 
would 
then 
be 
entitled 
to 
manage 
their complex 
care 
budget. 
Investment 
Planning 
(developing 
a 
Plano 
Diretor 
de 
Investimento 
-PDI) 
would 
be 
based 
on 
the 
identification 
of 
supply 
gaps 
by 
micro-region 
and 
would 
assign 
new 
resources 
giving 
priority 
to 
micro-regions  that 
do not 
have the 
minimum 
required 
supply 
of 
medium 
complexity 
services. 
Establishes 
more  transparent 
systems 
to 
manage 
care 
at  the 
local 
level 
based 
on  the 
use 
of 
networks. 
It 
requires micro-regions 
to 
implement 
standardized management 
tools 
to 
improve 
the 
regulation 
of 
medium 
complexity 
care 
(Centrais 
de 
Regulaq6o). 
These management 
tools 
will 
be 
used 
to 
emphasize 
preventive 
care 
and 
to 
rationalize 
the 
use 
of 
complex 
care 
by 
strengthening 
the 
use 
of 
referrals 
from 
Basic 
Care professionals 
to 
prioritize 
access 
to 
complex 
care. 
It 
also requires 
states 
to 
implement 
transparent  management 
tools 
for 
the 
use 
of 
high 
costhigh 
complexity 
interventions. 
Makes the 
state responsible 
for  monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
the 
performance 
of 
municipalities 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
key 
health 
programs. 
States 
become responsible 
for 
ensuring compliance 
of 
municipalities 
with 
the  Basic  Care 
targets 
set 
by 
Pactos 
de 
Atenqco 
Bhsica. 
States 
also 
become 
responsible 
for 
ensuring that 
small municipalities obtain effective 
access 
to 
referrals 
in 
services 
provided 
in 
large 
municipalities 
(and 
financed 
with 
resources 
budgeted 
through 
the 
PPI).

and 
strategic 
choices: 
Basic 
Care 
issues 
Bahia 
achieved 
very  significant 
improvements 
in 
health 
outcomes 
during 
the 
1990s, 
with 
the 
infant 
mortality 
rate 
improving 
by 
20% 
from 
1992 
to 
1998. 
However, 
this 
progress 
in 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
infant mortality 
rate 
was 
slower 
in 
Bahia 
than 
for 
Brazil 
as 
a 
whole (which 
had 
an improvement 
of 
26% 
in 
the 
same 
period). 
The most 
basic 
indicators 
remain 
at 
poor 
levels 
in 
Bahia. 
For 
this 
reason, 
it 
needs 
to 
continue 
strengthening 
primary 
care 
for 
the 
population. 
Two 
innovations 
- 
closely 
linked 
to 
the

introduction 
of 
PAB-- 
are 
improving 
Basic 
Care 
in 
Brazil 
and 
in 
Bahia: 
the 
implementation 
of 
new 
mechanisms 
to 
introduce 
greater 
accountability 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
primary 
care 
(the 
Pacto 
de 
AtenGZo 
Basica 
or 
Basic 
Health 
Agreement), 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
“models” 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
Basic 
Care. 
The 
Pacto 
de 
Atenqio 
Bcisica 
is 
the 
main 
instrument 
of 
accountability 
to 
assess 
how 
municipalities 
are 
performing 
their 
duty 
of 
providing 
Basic 
Care 
to 
their 
populations. 
There 
is 
a 
Pacto 
for 
each 
municipality, 
consisting 
of 
municipal 
targets 
for 
a 
small 
number 
of 
performance indicators and 
listing 
commitments 
to 
support the 
municipality 
by 
the 
state 
and federal governments. 
The 
selection 
of 
the 
indicators 
is 
the 
result 
of 
a 
complex 
process 
that 
identifies 
the 
key 
(intermediate) 
interventions 
needed 
to reach 
the 
main 
health 
priorities 
of 
the nation, 
which 
include 
reductions 
in 
infant 
mortality, 
in 
matemal 
mortality 
and 
in 
the 
incidence 
of 
transmissible 
di~ease.~ 
In 
2000, 
412 
municipalities 
signed 
Pactos. 
An 
evaluation 
of 
the experience 
concluded that 
there was 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
success 
for 
the 
surveillance indicators 
(95% 
of 
municipalities 
reached 
their 
targets), 
but 
there 
were 
low 
degrees 
of 
success 
for 
the 
indicators measuring 
outcomes 
and 
those 
measuring 
coverage 
of 
priority 
health 
programs (fewer than 
40% 
of 
municipalities 
reached 
their 
targets 
in 
these categories). 
When 
all 
indicators 
are 
considered 
together, 
half 
of 
the 
municipalities 
could 
not 
reach even 
50% 
of 
their 
targets. 
By 
law, 
starting 
in 
2001 municipalities 
that 
either 
refuse 
to 
sign 
a 
Pacto 
or 
that 
sign 
a 
Pacto 
and 
fail 
to 
reach 
their 
targets 
may 
be 
penalized 
with 
a 
loss 
in 
their 
eligibility 
to 
receive 
PAB 
transfers, 
however, 
and 
given 
the 
extended 
failure 
on 
reaching 
targets, 
this 
penalty 
has 
been waived. 
Efforts 
are 
being 
made 
all 
over 
Brazil 
to improve 
the 
way 
the 
Pactos 
work, 
by 
improving 
the 
process 
of 
negotiating 
and 
planning 
targets 
and 
by 
more effectively 
linking 
targets 
with 
the 
use 
of 
available 
resources. 
The 
project 
would 
contribute 
in 
fine-tuning 
the 
Pactos 
in 
Bahia. 
For 
clinical 
basic 
services, 
there 
are 
two  new 
models 
in 
operation. 
The 
Family  Health 
Program 
(Programa 
de 
Satide 
da 
Familia 
-- 
PSF) 
was  launched 
in 
1994, 
building 
on 
the 
strengths 
of 
its 
1991 
predecessor, 
the 
Programa 
de 
AtenqZo 
Comunitaria 
-PAC. 
The 
program 
seeks 
to 
develop 
high-quality 
primary 
care services 
that 
serve 
vulnerable populations 
in 
a 
proactive 
manner; 
eventually 
these 
services 
are 
expected 
to 
serve 
as 
an 
entry 
point 
to 
higher-level 
services. 
PAC 
introduced 
the 
use 
of 
paid 
health 
agents 
who 
reach out 
to 
the 
community 
in 
an 
organized fashion 
- 
for 
example, 
by 
creating 
a 
roster 
of 
the 
full 
beneficiary 
population 
in 
a 
given 
zone; 
identifying 
pregnant 
women, 
young 
children, 
tuberculosis 
patients, 
and 
others 
in 
need 
of 
frequent 
attention  and 
follow-up;  and 
providing 
home-based 
care 
or 
actively 
encouraging  patients 
to 
come 
to 
health  facilities 
for 
necessary  services. 
PSF 
organized 
community 
agents 
into 
teams, 
which 
typically 
include 
a 
general 
practice 
or 
family 
health 
physician, 
a 
nurse, 
one 
or 
two 
auxiliary 
nurses, and, 
more 
recently, 
a 
part-time 
dentist 
and/or 
dental technician. 
Each 
team 
is 
assigned the 
responsibility 
of 
providing 
care 
to 
a 
pre-defined 
set 
of 
families. 
Nationally, 
the 
PSF 
covers 
nearly one-fourth 
of 
the 
Brazilian 
population. 
In 
Bahia 
it 
covers 
11% 
of 
the 
population. 
Progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
program 
differs 
by 
municipality 
size 
and 
by 
region. 
Most 
PSF 
teams are 
in 
small municipalities. However, 
because 
there 
are 
so 
many 
small 
municipalities, 
only 
20% 
of 
them 
have 
joined 
the 
PSF 
program. 
Ten 
of 
the 
12 
large 
municipalities 
have inaugurated 
the 
program, 
but 
nine 
of 
them 
have 
just 
one 
or 
two 
PSF 
teams 
and 
consequently 
very 
low 
coverage 
rates. 
Most 
PSF 
teams  are 
located 
in 
the 
better-developed 
and 
more 
accessible 
coastal regions, 
with 
significantly fewer 
teams 
in 
municipalities located 
in 
the 
poorer 
and 
less accessible 
interior. 
Expansion 
of 
PSF 
will 
require  overcoming 
difficult 
challenges. 
In 
rural 
areas 
the 
main 
problem 
is 
attracting 
and 
retaining 
physicians and 
other professionals. 
PSF 
professionals 
in 
the 
country 
are 
hired 
under temporary 
contracts 
and 
are 
highly 
paid 
to 
attract 
them 
to 
difficult 
locations: they receive 
several 
times 
the 
take-home 
pay 
of 
comparable 
professionals 
employed 
as 
civil 
servants. 
Mayors 
from 
small 
municipalities 
claim 
that 
at 
these rates, 
the cost 
of 
PSF 
teams 
is 
several 
times 
higher 
than the 
subsidy 
they 
These 
priorities 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs).

receive 
from 
the 
Federal Government and that they 
cannot 
afford 
to 
expand the program. 
The 
expansion 
of 
PSF 
in 
urban 
locations 
faces 
a 
different 
set 
of 
challenges. 
While 
there 
exist  pockets 
of 
poor 
populations that 
do not 
have 
access 
to 
health 
care, 
in 
urban 
areas 
there 
already 
exist 
significant 
resources 
in 
the 
form 
of 
traditional 
primary 
care 
clinics and hospital 
services. 
These 
services 
suffer 
from 
significant 
inefficiencies 
and 
the 
main 
objective 
of 
expanding 
PSF 
in 
urban 
locations 
is 
to 
introduce 
reforms 
that 
would 
lead 
to 
improvements 
in 
the 
health 
status 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
to 
a 
more 
efficient 
use 
of 
the 
existing 
resources. 
The 
project 
would 
contribute 
(with 
sub-projects 
and 
by 
supporting 
a 
shift 
in 
state-government 
spending) 
to 
expand PSF where 
feasible. 
The 
feasibility 
of 
health 
reaching the desired universal 
coverage 
of 
the 
population 
with 
PSF 
will 
require significant 
increases 
in 
financing 
for 
the 
program 
and 
the 
release 
of 
health 
professionals 
from 
tertiary 
care. 
The 
Bank, 
through 
the 
HD 
adjustment 
loan 
the 
Family 
Health 
Expansion Program 
is 
supporting the Government to 
achieve 
these 
objectives. 
Internationally, 
a 
major 
weakness 
of 
Basic 
Care 
is 
the 
frequent 
lack 
of 
basic 
pharmaceuticals 
at the 
local 
level. 
In 
Bahia 
availability 
has 
improved 
substantially 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Basic 
Pharmaceuticals 
program 
(Assistincia 
Farmaceutica 
Bcisica), 
which 
consists 
of 
a 
[PC3]transfer 
of 
R$2 
per 
person per 
year 
to 
municipalities 
designed 
to 
provide 
a 
basic 
set 
of 
drugs 
for 
the 
population. 
The 
program 
is 
financed 
jointly 
by 
the 
federal 
government, 
which 
contributes 
R$1, 
the 
state (R$0.5), 
and 
the 
municipality 
(R$0.5). 
Municipalities 
can participate 
in 
two 
ways: 
receiving 
the 
funding 
directly 
from 
the 
federal government and 
making 
their 
own 
purchases 
or 
by 
using 
SESAB 
as 
a 
purchasing 
agent. 
While 
this 
program 
has 
improved 
availability 
of 
pharmaceuticals,  there 
remains 
some 
duplication 
between 
several 
sources 
of 
drugs, 
inefficiency 
in 
the 
purchasing 
process 
and 
other constraints 
in 
the 
distribution 
system. 
There 
is 
a 
trade-off 
between 
price 
and 
opportunity 
in 
the 
purchases. 
SESAB 
purchases 
large 
quantities and 
obtains 
lower 
prices than 
individual 
municipalities. 
However, 
some 
municipalities 
opted 
for 
managing 
the 
purchase 
directly 
to  avoid 
delays. 
In 
2002, 
the 
state 
of 
Bahia 
passed 
legislation 
allowing 
the 
use 
of 
E-procurement 
for 
these purchases, 
this 
new 
procedure 
may 
overcome the 
trade-off 
between 
price 
and opportunity. 
Under 
the 
proposed 
system, 
estimates 
of 
need 
will 
be 
made 
locally 
and 
consolidated centrally. 
A 
central 
authority 
will 
then 
invite 
bids 
for 
the 
estimated 
total 
volume 
of 
needs 
and 
suppliers 
will 
compete 
with 
proposals 
that 
include 
price 
and 
cost 
of 
delivery 
to different 
locations. 
The 
winning 
proposals 
will 
be 
valid 
for 
a 
set 
period 
of 
time 
and 
their 
conditions 
will 
be 
posted 
on 
the 
Internet. 
Local 
users 
can then 
make 
the purchase 
directly 
from 
the 
suppliers at 
the 
agreed 
price. 
The 
project 
will 
support  the  basic 
pharmacy 
program 
by 
implementing 
the 
new 
planning 
and 
purchasing 
technology 
and 
by 
solving 
other 
bottlenecks 
in 
the distribution 
chain. 
Capacity Building 
A 
significant 
challenge 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
NOAS 
is 
that 
it 
requires 
substantial 
capacity 
of 
implementation 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
state, 
the 
micro-regions 
and 
the municipalities. 
At 
the 
level 
of 
the 
state, 
it 
requires 
a 
redefinition 
of 
the 
role 
of 
the 
state 
government--from 
manager 
of 
federal 
funds 
and provider 
of 
services 
through 
state 
hospitals 
to 
policy 
maker and 
overseer 
of 
quality. 
In 
its 
new 
role, 
it 
will 
need 
a 
substantial 
improvement 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
data 
it 
possesses--starting 
with 
data 
on 
the 
health 
of 
the 
population, 
which 
is 
at 
present 
of 
dubious 
quality 
(the 
Federal  Government 
estimates 
that 
Bahia 
underestimates 
infant mortality 
by 
66%), 
in 
its 
capacity 
of 
analyzing 
these 
data 
and 
in 
its 
capacity 
for 
policy 
development. 
It 
will 
also 
require 
that 
SESAB 
develops 
new 
models 
of 
regulation, 
moving 
away 
from 
the 
direct 
purchase 
of 
services--which 
for 
basic 
and 
medium 
complexity 
will 
be 
decentralized 
to 
municipalities and 
micro-regions--to 
a 
position 
of 
performance-target setting 
and 
monitoring 
of 
quality 
for 
basic 
and 
medium 
complexity 
care. 
It 
also 
requires that clear and 
transparent 
rules 
are 
developed 
for 
the 
management 
and 
resource-allocation 
in 
high 
complexity 
care. 
A 
second 
significant 
challenge 
is 
the development 
of 
a 
capacity 
for 
management 
in 
the 
municipality 
of 
Salvador. 
As 
described 
above, 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
state 
services are 
provided 
in 
Metropolitan 
Salvador. 
Today, 
these 
services 
are 
provided 
in 
public 
hospitals 
run 
directly 
by 
SESAB 
and 
by 
private 
hospitals 
selling 
services 
to 
SESAB. 
Salvador 
has 
not had 
the 
need 
to 
develop 
its 
capacity 
to 
manage 
health 
care 
13 
Page  14
and 
has 
not 
achieved the 
status 
of 
Gestiio 
Plena--this 
forces 
SESAB 
to 
concentrate 
much 
of 
its 
energy 
on 
the 
direct 
provision 
of 
services 
and 
delays 
the  development 
of 
its 
capacity 
for  policy 
making 
and 
regulation. 
The  next 
section 
describes 
key 
challenges 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
micro-regions 
and 
opportunities 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
new 
forms 
of 
regulation. 
Management 
and Governance of 
Micro-regions 
NOAS 
attempts 
to 
correct 
inefficiencies 
and inequities 
by 
decentralizing 
management 
responsibilities 
currently 
held 
by 
SESAB 
to 
municipalities 
and micro-regions. 
Municipalities 
and micro-regions 
would 
be 
provided 
with 
management tools. 
Specifically, 
NOAS 
introduces 
Regulation 
Centers 
(Centrais 
de 
Regulaqiio 
ou 
de 
MarcaqGo), 
selective contracting, 
and 
systems 
of 
audit and 
review. 
A 
Regulation 
Center 
is 
an 
office 
that 
assigns 
a 
patient 
to 
a 
provider 
for 
a 
particular 
procedure. 
A 
representative 
of 
the patient’s 
primary 
health 
team 
makes 
a 
referral 
request 
for 
these 
specialized 
services. 
The 
Regulation 
Center 
then 
assigns 
the 
patient 
a 
specific 
date 
and 
time 
with 
the 
requested 
provider, 
or 
redirects the 
patient 
to 
another 
available 
provider 
if 
necessary. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
planning, 
this 
system 
offers 
the 
capacity 
to 
manage 
care 
by 
prioritizing 
referrals 
on 
the basis 
of 
need 
based 
on 
a 
review 
for 
appropriateness 
and 
medical 
necessity. 
The 
data 
derived 
from 
Regulation 
Centers 
also 
allow 
planning 
to 
reduce 
waiting 
times 
for 
patients. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
regulation, 
the 
Centers 
also have 
great 
advantages. 
When 
all 
appointments 
are 
made 
by 
the 
Center, 
then 
the Center 
will 
only 
reimburse 
for 
services 
previously 
approved 
by 
it, 
reducing the 
scope 
for 
fraud. 
Also, 
the 
regulation 
centers 
can 
establish 
significant 
improvements 
in 
controls 
and 
audits. 
In 
some 
municipalities 
with 
Gestiio Plena, 
patients 
scheduled 
for 
elective surgery receive 
a 
visit 
in 
their 
home to 
confirm 
that  the 
condition 
matches  the  diagnosis 
and 
that 
the  patient 
is 
a 
resident 
of 
the 
municipality. 
Site 
visits 
are 
scheduled 
to 
high-volume  providers  and 
clinical 
laboratories. 
As 
a 
complement 
to 
the 
regulation 
centers, 
municipalities 
in 
GestGo 
Plena 
are 
empowered 
to 
strengthen the 
terms 
of 
their 
provider 
contracts. 
Only 
a 
few 
municipalities have 
taken 
this 
step, 
but 
there 
are 
already 
examples 
where 
strategies 
such 
as 
selective 
contracting 
have 
been 
used 
successfully 
to improve 
provider 
performance and 
to 
control 
price 
and 
supply. 
While 
NOAS 
is 
very 
detailed 
in 
some 
areas, 
the  governance 
system 
for 
the 
micro-regions 
remains 
undefined. 
This 
is 
a 
significant vacuum 
as 
there 
needs 
to 
be 
an institutional 
arrangement 
that provides 
incentives 
for 
municipalities 
to 
pool 
resources 
to 
obtain 
better 
services 
for 
their 
population 
giving-up 
some 
of 
the 
political 
clout 
and 
patronage 
that come 
from 
directly 
managing 
resources. 
Three models 
are 
being 
tested 
in 
different 
parts 
of 
Brazil. 
In 
Ceara, 
the 
micro-regions 
are 
managed 
mainly 
by 
the 
regional 
outposts 
of 
the 
state 
health 
secretariat 
with 
varying 
degrees 
of 
participation 
by 
municipalities. 
In 
some 
areas 
of 
the country, 
micro-regions 
are 
formed 
by 
consortia 
of 
municipalities 
that 
create 
an 
ad 
hoc 
agency 
for 
managing 
health 
care 
with 
no 
participation 
of 
the 
state. 
In 
other 
states 
(including 
Bahia) 
the 
prevailing 
model 
is 
to 
allow 
a 
municipality 
in 
Gestiio 
Plena 
(“municipio-polo”) 
to 
manage 
part 
of 
the budget 
of 
neighboring 
smaller 
municipalities 
(“satellites”) 
with 
varying 
participation 
of 
the satellites 
and 
of 
the 
state 
in 
the

Strengthening 
management 
and governance 
of 
micro-regions. 
To 
strengthen the 
role 
of 
the 
micro- 
region 
as 
a 
purchaser 
of 
health 
care 
services, 
the 
project 
will 
support: 
(i) 
technical 
assistance 
for 
the 
deployment 
of 
performance 
based contracts 
between 
the 
micro-regions and 
their 
local 
providers, 
(ii) 
TA, 
works 
and 
equipment 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
Regulation 
Centers; 
and 
(iii) 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
for 
the 
adaptation 
of 
SUS 
card technology 
to 
the 
local 
conditions  and 
the 
implementation 
of 
applications that 
address 
the 
needs 
of 
microregional 
management. 
To 
strengthen the 
capacity 
of 
micro- 
regions 
to 
conduct 
clinical, 
environmental  and 
financial 
audits 
of 
providers 
and 
to 
initiate 
a process 
of 
accreditation, 
the 
project 
will 
support: 
(i) 
turn-key 
contracts 
to 
develop 
auditing 
and  accreditation 
systems; 
(ii) 
technical 
assistance 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
Medical 
Waste 
Plans 
in 
health 
care 
facilities and 
implementation 
of 
existing 
local 
environmental 
assessment 
and licensing 
of 
health 
centers; 
and 
(iii) 
training 
to 
teach audits 
and 
accreditation 
techniques. 
Micro-regions 
must 
develop 
governance 
systems 
that balance the 
priorities, 
needs 
and capacities 
of 
large 
municipalities, 
their 
small 
surrounding 
municipalities and the 
state. 
No 
firm 
blueprint 
exists 
for 
this 
system 
of 
governance, 
and 
they 
will 
need 
to 
evolve 
based 
on 
trial 
and 
error. 
The 
systems 
will 
be defined 
during 
implementation. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
this 
process 
by 
financing: 
(i) 
the 
initial

detail 
in 
the 
operations 
manual 
of 
the subprojects 
and 
is 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
2 
and 
6. 
While 
project 
contents 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
demand, 
SESAB 
expects 
an 
emphasis 
on 
the 
following 
areas: 
(i) 
Strengthening 
the 
supply 
of 
basic 
services 
by: 
remodeling 
of 
health 
centers 
(including 
the conversion 
of 
small 
municipal 
general 
hospitals 
into 
outpatient 
facilities 
with 
limited 
24 
hour 
emergency 
service); 
procurement 
of 
basic 
medical, 
transport 
and 
communications 
equipment; 
and 
the 
hiring 
of 
incremental 
health 
care 
workers 
(these 
workers 
would not 
be 
hired 
as 
civil 
servants). 
(ii) 
Institutional modernization and 
strengthening 
of 
information 
systems 
by 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
and training 
directed 
to 
addressing 
the  mandatory 
municipal 
health 
management programs; 
and 
(iii) 
Training 
and 
supervision. 
Subprojects 
will 
be 
based 
on 
a 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Plan 
which 
will 
include 
targets 
for 
each 
of 
the 
10 
indicators 
of 
the 
Pacto 
de 
Atenqio 
Bdsica, 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
status 
of 
implementation 
of 
municipal 
health 
management 
programs  mandated 
by 
the  federal 
and 
state 
governments, 
a 
local 
environmental 
health 
plan,  estimated 
costs 
of 
the 
sub-project,  a 
sustainability 
proposal 
including 
the 
use 
of 
municipal 
and 
state 
funds 
that 
will 
be 
phased-in 
as 
project 
funds 
face  out,  a 
procurement 
plan 
for 
sub-project 
implementation and 
a 
disbursement 
plan. 
In 
order 
to 
overcome  capacity 
constraints, 
the 
project 
will 
finance technical 
assistance 
to 
interested 
municipalities, 
and 
the 
regional 
outposts 
of 
SESAB 
will 
receive 
special 
training  to 
support 
municipalities 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Plans. 
Also, 
the 
participating 
municipalities 
will 
be 
clustered 
together 
in 
a 
few 
micro-regions 
during 
the 
initial 
years 
of 
implementation 
favoring 
cross-leaming 
and 
making 
it 
easier 
to provide them 
with 
technical 
assistance. 
The 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Plans 
will 
form 
the 
basis 
for 
subproject 
Implementation 
Agreements 
between  the 
municipalities  and 
the 
State, 
which 
will 
set 
forth 
the 
respective 
obligations 
regarding 
subproject 
implementation. 
If 
in 
any 
year the 
municipality 
fails 
to 
achieve at least 
6 
of 
the 
10 
targets, 
SESAB, 
in 
coordination 
with 
the Bank, 
may 
decide 
to 
suspend disbursements. 
There 
will 
be 
minimum 
criteria 
for 
eligibility 
and 
a 
system 
of 
points for 
the 
final 
selection 
of 
municipalities. 
Eligibility 
of 
subprojects, 
of 
implementing 
municipalities  and 
of 
expenditures 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
subprojects 
as 
well 
as 
implementation 
arrangements 
(procurement, 
disbursement, 
selection, 
approval, 
environmental 
requirements, 
monitoring 
and 
supervision) 
will 
be 
detailed 
in 
an 
operational  manual. 
Subprojects 
estimated 
to 
cost 
US$500,000 
equivalent 
or 
more 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
prior 
review 
by 
the 
Bank 
before the 
Term0 
de 
Compromisso 
is 
signed.

In 
the event 
that 
subprojects 
submitted 
for 
financing 
under 
the 
Basic 
Care 
component 
are 
located 
in 
a 
municipality 
where  Indigenous 
Peoples reside, 
the 
municipality, 
with 
SESAB 
’s 
assistance 
will 
work 
closely 
with 
FUNASA 
to 
ensure 
its 
active 
participation 
in 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
subproject 
level 
IPDPs, 
in 
the  consultation 
process 
with 
the 
Indigenous  Groups 
involved, 
and 
in 
the  design 
of 
activities that 
address 
the 
health 
care needs 
of 
the 
affected 
group. 
To 
ensure adequate 
cooperation, 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia 
will 
enter 
into 
a 
cooperation 
agreement 
with 
FUNASA 
prior to 
providing 
project 
support 
to 
municipalities 
with 
an

Benefits and 
target 
population: 
The program 
is 
designed 
to improve 
health 
outcomes 
of 
the 
population 
of 
Bahia 
by 
expanding 
access 
and 
quality 
of 
care 
and 
to 
improve 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
public 
resources. 
Most 
of 
the 
improvement 
in 
Basic 
health 
outcomes 
is 
expected 
from 
the expansion 
of 
Basic 
Care 
that 
will 
result 
from 
a 
combination 
of 
improved 
policies 
for 
Basic 
Care 
and 
investments 
financed 
by 
municipal 
subprojects. 
Basic 
Care 
policies 
will 
be 
improved 
with 
project 
support 
for policy 
development, 
for 
strengthening 
the Basic pharmacy 
program 
and 
for 
information, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
This 
support 
will 
increase 
the 
impact 
of 
existing 
resources and 
may 
also 
result 
in 
redirecting additional 
municipal 
and 
state-government 
resources 
to 
Basic 
Care 
and 
would 
benefit 
the 
entire 
population 
of 
Bahia. 
Municipal 
sub-projects 
are 
expected 
to 
benefit 
the 
population 
of 
around 
100 
municipalities 
during 
the 
two 
phases 
of 
the 
APL 
covering 
around 
5 
million 
people 
(around 
40 
municipalities  covering 
around 
2 
million 
people 
in 
APL1). 
Targets 
for 
improvements 
in 
outcomes 
and 
in 
intermediate 
programs 
are 
described 
in 
Annex 
1. 
Increased 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
public 
resources 
will 
result 
from 
improved 
management 
of 
the 
health 
system. 
These 
improvements 
will 
occur 
at: 
(i) 
the 
municipal level 
as 
a 
result 
of 
strengthened 
Basic Care 
agreements 
and 
(in 
participating 
municipalities) 
as 
a 
result 
of 
municipal 
subprojects; 
(ii) 
the 
micro-regional 
level 
as 
a 
result 
of 
implementing 
new 
forms 
of 
governance and management 
of 
systems 
and 
as 
a 
result 
of 
greater 
transparency 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
audits; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
state 
level 
as 
a 
result 
of 
improved 
management 
of 
high 
complexity 
care 
and 
of 
freeing 
SESAB 
from 
the 
responsibility 
of 
managing the 
demanding 
health 
care 
system 
of 
Metropolitan 
Salvador. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
The Bahia 
Health 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
implemented over 
a 
4 
year 
period, 
from 
July 
2003 
through 
June 
2007. 
The 
program 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
regular 
evaluations 
every 
six 
months, 
with 
yearly 
evaluations 
that 
will 
include an 
assessment 
of 
progress 
towards 
all 
performance 
triggers. 
SESAB 
(Secretaria 
de 
Sazide 
da Bahia) 
will 
be 
the 
principal 
executing 
agency 
for 
the 
program 
through 
a 
project coordination 
unit 
(PCU), 
created 
in 
2002. 
Its 
responsibilities 
will 
include: 
(i) 
financial 
oversight 
of 
the  program; 
(ii) 
coordination 
with 
line 
agencies 
and 
departments, 
regional  offices 
and  external 
agencies 
responsible 
for program 
activities; 
(iii) 
coordination 
with 
municipal 
governments 
participating 
in 
the program; 
and 
(iv) 
overall 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation activities. 
Responsibility 
for 
program 
activities 
will 
be 
coordinated 
by 
the 
PCU 
and  implemented 
by 
SESAB 
line 
agencies 
and 
by 
participating 
municipalities. 
All 
participating municipalities 
will 
sign 
performance 
agreements 
with 
SESAB. 
Procurement 
and financial 
management 
arrangements  are 
described 
in 
Annex 
6. 
Procurement 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by: 
(i) 
SESAB’s 
specialized procurement 
department 
and 
its 
regional 
offices; 
(ii) 
the 
State 
Secretariat 
of 
Administration 
(for 
vehicles  and 
civil 
works); 
and 
(iii) 
participating municipalities (for 
subprojects). 
SESAB 
will 
strengthen 
the procurement 
and financial 
management 
capacity 
of 
the 
PCU 
by 
not 
later than 
three 
months 
after 
effectiveness. 
A 
procurement 
plan for 
the 
first 
year has 
been prepared 
and 
detailed 
arrangements 
will 
be 
described 
in 
the 
operational 
manual 
of 
the 
project.  Financial 
management 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
financial 
team 
of 
the 
PCU 
according 
to 
the 
detail 
described 
in 
annex 
6. 
This 
team 
will 
also 
carry 
out 
risk 
assessments 
of 
the 
participating municipalities. 
An 
integrated 
information 
system 
is 
being 
developed 
for  SESAB 
based 
on 
the 
highly 
rated 
system 
in 
use 
in 
the 
Secretariat 
of 
Education 
of 
Bahia. 
The 
Tribunal 
de 
Contas 
do 
Estado 
da Bahia 
(TCEBA) 
will 
carry 
out 
the annual 
financial 
audits 
of 
the 
project 
accounts. 
The 
project 
will 
report 
in 
the 
format 
of 
Financial 
Management 
Reports 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis.

Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
Lending 
instrument: 
APL 
versus 
SIL. 
The 
APL 
was chosen 
given: 
(i) 
the 
long 
term 
horizon 
needed 
for 
meeting 
the 
project’s  development 
objectives; 
(ii) 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
sound 
sector 
reform 
program 
developed 
by 
the 
state 
and 
the 
federal govemments; 
(iii) 
the 
need 
for 
phasing 
the 
reform 
program 
because 
of 
the 
level 
of 
complexity 
of 
some 
project 
activities, 
the 
relatively 
weak 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies, 
and 
the need 
for 
testing 
new 
interventions. 
The 
APL 
will 
facilitate 
the 
“leam 
as 
you 
go” 
approach 
when implementing 
some 
of 
the 
project 
activities. 
Lending directly 
to 
the state 
versus 
lending 
to 
the 
federal 
government. 
All 
the 
previous 
13 
World Bank 
loans 
for 
health 
in 
Brazil 
have been 
with 
the Federal 
Govemment. 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
be 
the 
first 
health 
operation 
with 
the 
state 
level. 
Other 
sectors, 
such 
as 
education, 
have 
already 
followed 
this 
strategy 
and 
with 
good 
results. 
The 
rationale 
is 
the 
following: 
(i) 
decision 
making, 
management 
and financing 
of 
health 
services 
haws 
been decentralized 
to 
the 
state 
and 
municipal 
levels; 
(ii) 
the 
size 
of 
the 
country and 
its 
Fgreat 
regional diversity 
requires 
different 
approaches 
to solving 
regional 
and 
local 
health 
problems; 
I 
(iii) 
it 
facilitates investments 
to 
the poorest regions 
of 
the 
country. 
Investing 
only 
in primary 
care 
versus 
investing 
in 
integrated 
services. 
Investing 
only 
in 
primary 
care 
is 
not 
an 
effective 
option 
since 
Bahia’s 
epidemiological 
profile 
requires 
services 
of 
higher 
levels 
of 
complexity. 
Investment 
in 
primary 
care 
without 
effective 
support 
of 
referral 
levels 
runs 
the 
risk 
of 
providing 
ineffective 
treatment 
of 
important 
pathologies 
and eventually 
damages 
the 
prestige 
of 
the 
primary 
care 
network.

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
The 
project 
preparation team 
carried out 
extensive research 
on 
lessons 
learned 
from 
other 
projects 
to 
improve project 
design 
and implementation 
strategies. 
Various 
sources 
of 
information 
were consulted 
including 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
operational and evaluation 
work. 
The 
team 
also 
reviewed 
technical 
and 
evaluation 
work 
done 
by 
other development 
agencies 
and 
looked 
at 
relevant 
experiences 
produced 
in 
the 
Brazilian 
context. 
Lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
Bank’s 
operational and 
evaluation 
work, 
The 
project 
lessons 
were 
extracted 
from 
several types 
of 
documents: 
i) 
ICRs 
from 
the 
following 
Brazilian 
projects: 
Second 
Northeast 
Basic 
Health 
Services 
(98), 
AIDS 
and 
STD 
Control 
(98), 
Amazon 
Basin 
Malaria 
Control 
(97), 
and Endemic 
Disease 
Control 
(97); 
ii) 
Mid-tem-review 
of 
the 
ongoing 
REFORSUS 
project 
(99); 
and 
iii) 
OED’s 
reports: 
Investing 
in 
Health: Development 
Effectiveness 
in 
the 
Health, 
Nutrition, 
and Population 
Sector 
(99), 
and 
The 
Brazil 
Health 
System: 
Impact Evaluation 
Report 
(98). 
The 
main 
lessons 
from 
these 
documents 
are 
summarized 
in 
the table 
below. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
above, 
the  project 
preparation 
team 
looked 
at 
project 
documentation 
and 
implementation 
arrangements 
(SARs/PADs and 
Operational  Manuals) 
from 
the 
following 
World 
Bank 
Projects: 
Bahia 
Municipal 
Infrastructure 
Development  and 
Management  Project  (PRODUR), 
Bahia 
Education 
Program, 
Brazil  VIGISUS 
Project, 
Cearh 
Urban 
Development 
and 
Water 
Resource 
Management 
Project, 
Brazil 
Rural 
Poverty 
Alleviation 
Project, 
Saint 
Lucia 
Poverty Reduction 
Fund 
Project, 
and 
Honduras 
Fourth 
Social  Investment 
Fund 
Project. 
Special 
design 
features 
from 
these 
projects  (specially 
the 
procedures 
for 
managing 
the 
investment 
fund, 
drafting 
the 
Program Adhesion 
Agreement, 
and 
making 
the 
transfers 
to 
the 
beneficiaries) 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
for 
the elaboration 
of 
the 
operational manual. 
Lessons 
learned 
from 
relevant 
local 
and 
international 
experience. 
The 
project 
also 
considered 
the 
Country’s 
experience 
in 
shaping 
its 
design 
and implementation 
strategies. 
There 
is 
a 
group 
of 
project 
interventions that 
already 
have 
a 
fair 
amount 
of 
evidence 
that 
support 
their 
inclusion 
in 
the program. 
This 
group 
includes 
the 
Community 
and 
Family 
Health 
Programs. 
Evidence 
suggests 
that 
these 
programs 
have 
21 
Page  22
been 
successful 
in 
reducing infant mortality, 
improving 
registration 
and 
notification 
of 
infant 
deaths, 
and 
decreasing the 
volume 
of 
hospital 
admissions. 
In 
addition, 
these 
programs 
are 
highly 
valued 
by 
the 
population 
(World Bank 
June 
2000). 
On 
the other 
hand, there 
is 
a second 
group 
of 
project 
interventions 
with 
promising 
outcomes that 
have 
not 
been 
fully 
developed, 
implemented 
or 
evaluated 
yet 
in 
the 
country 
context. 
This 
group 
of 
interventions includes the 
implementation 
of 
health 
microregions.

of 
borrower 
commitment and ownership: 
The 
government’s 
commitment 
to 
and 
ownership 
of 
the 
project 
are 
high. 
The 
project 
has 
been prepared

a 
wide 
range 
of 
key 
sector 
players 
including 
from 
the 
federal 
government,  the 
state 
government, 
the 
municipality 
of 
Salvador 
and 
the association 
of 
municipal 
health 
secretaries. 
The 
final 
months 
of 
project 
preparation were 
combined 
with 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
Bank 
Report 
“(“Decentralization 
of 
Health 
Care 
in 
Brazil-A 
Case 
Study 
of 
Bahia). 
The 
results and recommendations 
of 
the report 
have 
been 
discussed 
with 
government 
officials 
and 
with 
the Governor-elect. 
The 
project 
has 
strong 
support 
from 
the 
State 
Governor and the 
Planning 
Secretariat. 
The 
project 
is 
viewed 
as 
an important 
part 
of 
a 
broader government 
effort. Indications 
of 
the 
SESAB’s 
commitment 
to 
the 
project 
are 
the 
inclusion 
of 
all 
necessary 
counterpart 
funds 
in 
the 
budget 
for 
2003 
and 
the 
approval 
of 
a 
special 
decree 
that 
establishes 
the 
PCU. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
Bank’s 
value 
added 
to 
the 
project 
can 
be 
summarized 
as 
follows: 
i) 
Global 
intemational 
experience 
and 
expertise; 
ii) 
Broader 
strategic 
perspective 
on 
the 
sector 
and 
state-focused 
policy 
advise; 
iii) 
22 
Page  23
Coordination 
with 
other donors 
and developmental institutions 
to 
support 
the 
project; 
and 
iv) 
Ability 
to 
mobilize 
large 
financial 
resources. 
The 
Bank 
will 
bring 
worldwide 
experience 
to 
enrich 
policy 
dialogue 
with 
state 
authorities and 
improve 
project 
design and 
implementation. 
The 
Bank 
will 
also 
foster 
study 
tours 
and 
field 
visits 
to 
other 
relevant international 
and 
national 
experiences. 
The 
Bank 
will 
encourage 
communication 
and 
collaboration 
among 
key 
government 
agencies 
and ministries, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
other 
developmental 
agencies 
and 
donors. 
The 
Bank 
will 
facilitate 
collaboration 
with 
Brazilian 
states 
implementing 
similar 
reforms. 
E. 
Summary Project Analysis 
(Detailed 
assessments 
are 
in 
the 
project 
file, 
see 
Annex 
8) 
1. 
Economic 
(see 
Annex 
4): 
Cost 
benefit NPV=US$394 
million; 
ERR 
= 
85 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
This 
section 
presents 
the 
summary 
results 
of 
the 
cost-benefit  analysis 
of 
annex  4. 
The 
project 
will 
potentially 
save 
over 
16,000 
lives 
through 
improvements 
in 
the 
health 
care 
system 
and 
reductions 
in 
disability 
and 
mortality 
will 
contribute over 
400,000 
productive 
life 
years 
(DALYs) 
to 
the economy. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
project 
costs 
of 
$168 
million, 
the 
analysis 
includes  investment 
costs 
and  recurrent 
expenditures 
related 
to 
improving 
access 
to  primary 
health 
care  services, 
strengthening  emergency 
services, 
and restructuring 
the 
hospital network. 
In 
summary, 
the 
project 
would yield 
a 
present 
value 
of 
net 
benefits, 
after investment and recurrent 
costs, 
of 
over $138.5 
million 
and 
produce 
an 
intemal 
rate 
of 
return 
(IRR) 
above 
84% 
over 
ten 
years. 
The Bahia 
health 
sector 
reform 
project 
will 
produce 
substantial 
savings 
for 
the 
sector, 
primarily 
through 
reductions 
in 
hospitalization 
costs. 
The 
cost-benefit 
analysis, 
gives the 
project 
a 
BenefiKost 
Index 
of 
3.84. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
Projected recurrent 
expenditures 
generated 
by 
the 
project 
and 
the 
estimates 
of 
future 
health 
care 
spending 
show 
that  the 
project 
would 
be  financially 
sustainable. 
Based 
on 
the  current  projections 
for 
health 
expenditures, 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
will 
cost 
less 
than 
2% 
of 
the 
public 
expenditure 
on 
health 
care 
services 
in 
Bahia 
starting 
from 
the 
seventh year 
of 
the 
project.  Recurrent 
costs 
attributable 
to 
recurrent 
costs 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
represent 
additional 
costs 
of 
approximately 
5% 
above 
public 
health 
expenditures 
during 
the 
first 
six 
years 
of 
the 
project. 
These 
costs 
range 
fi-om 
8% 
above 
base 
expenditures 
in 
the 
first 
year 
to 
a 
minimum 
of 
3% 
in 
the 
sixth 
year. 
In 
the 
following 
years, 
additional 
costs due 
to 
the 
project 
represent 
only 
an 
average 
of 
1% 
increase 
over 
normal 
expenditures. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
project 
will 
have 
a 
phased approach 
to 
implementing 
technical 
solutions, 
which 
are deemed 
to 
be 
best 
practices 
on 
an 
intemational 
basis. 
This 
approach 
will 
guarantee 
that the project’s technical 
solutions 
are 
viable 
on 
the 
Bahian 
context. 
Some 
of 
the 
new 
technical  solutions 
included 
under the proposed 
project 
are 
the 
following: 
i) 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Pacto 
de 
AtenqEo 
Bdsica 
- 
this 
is 
assessed 
as 
feasible 
given 
that the 
Pacto 
is 
already 
in 
place 
and 
the strong federal 
and 
state 
commitment 
to 
make 
them work. 
The 
use 
of 
similar 
performance 
agreements 
has 
been 
successfully 
supported 
by 
Bank 
projects 
in 
Bolivia 
and 
Peru; 
ii) 
organizing 
procurement/distribution 
of 
drugs 
through 
new 
arrangements 
that 
optimize 
price 
and quality 
of 
drugs 
with 
low 
administrative/transactional 
costs 
based 
on 
e-procurement. 
Assessed 
as 
feasible based 
on 
the successful experience 
of 
Brazil 
at 
the 
federal 
level 
and 
the 
experience 
of 
a 
similar 
Bank-supported 
program 
in 
Chile; 
iii) 
promoting 
municipal 
collaboration 
to 
improve 
equity 
and 
efficiency 
of 
local 
health 
systems. 
This 
is 
assessed 
as 
risky, 
but 
feasible 
given 
the 
high 
commitment 
by 
the government 
to 
this 
model; 
and 
iv) 
implementing 
family 
health 
approaches 
to 
providing primary 
care 
(already 
discussed 
on 
lessons 
leamed).

Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
In 
1999, 
the 
State 
Secretariat 
of 
Health 
(SESAB)  began 
a process 
of 
self-restructuring 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
new 
sector  challenges. 
A 
new 
structure was 
put 
in 
place 
comprising 
a 
General 
Directorate 
and 
four 
Superintendencies. 
The 
organizational 
structure 
was 
simplified 
and 
its 
main 
functions 
are 
expected 
to 
change 
from 
service 
provision 
to 
policy 
making,  regulation,  technical 
assistance 
to 
municipalities, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
and 
permanent  education 
and 
communication 
on 
health 
related 
matters. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
an institutional 
assessment 
was 
carried out 
to 
determine 
if 
the 
Government, 
in 
particular 
the 
SESAB, 
have the 
required 
capacity 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
project. 
The 
assessment 
included 
analysis 
of 
the 
regulatory, 
procurement, 
financial,  and organizational 
aspects 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
main 
conclusions 
of 
the 
assessments are 
the 
following: 
i) 
there 
is 
strong 
coherence 
and 
consistency 
between 
the  proposed 
project 
and 
the 
SESAB’s 
new 
institutional 
objectives  and priorities; 
ii) 
the 
regulatory 
instruments 
required 
for 
project implementation 
are 
already 
in 
place; 
and 
iii) 
the 
SESAB 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
lead 
the 
project 
to 
a  successful 
conclusion 
provided 
it 
addresses 
some 
current  technical 
and 
administrative 
weaknesses. 
Specialized 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
included 
in 
the 
project 
will 
be 
key 
to 
strengthening 
these areas. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
A 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
was created 
in 
2002 
to 
support 
project 
preparation. 
No 
later 
than 
three 
months 
after 
effectiveness 
it 
will 
hire 
additional 
staff 
needed 
for 
project 
implementation. 
Execution 
of 
project 
components 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
directly 
by 
the 
SESAB’s 
line 
agencies 
and 
by 
participating 
municipalities. 
The 
PCU 
will 
establish the 
project policies 
and 
make 
key 
decisions 
as 
needed. 
It 
will 
be 
staffed 
with 
high 
level 
professionals, 
especially 
in 
areas 
where 
SESAB 
is 
more 
deficient. 
A 
financial 
management system 
is 
under development 
to 
report 
expenditures 
and 
progress 
of 
project 
activities. 
In 
accordance 
with 
arrangements 
for 
Bank-financed 
projects 
in 
Brazil, 
annual 
audits 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
“Tribunal 
de 
Contas 
do Estado da 
Bahia”. 
Supervision missions 
will 
be 
carried out 
twice 
a year. 
The 
Project’s operational 
manual 
will 
describe the procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
if 
subprojects 
are 
requested 
by 
any 
of 
the 
16 
municipalities 
with 
indigenous populations. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
A 
procurement capacity 
assessment 
of 
SESAB 
was 
carried out 
in 
August 
2002 
and 
rated 
the procurement 
risk 
as 
average. 
The 
analysis 
did 
not 
detect 
any 
critical 
deficiencies that 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
before 
project 
launch 
except 
for 
setting 
up 
of 
a 
procurement 
unit. 
The preliminary 
procurement 
plan 
reveals the 
need 
to 
procure 
more 
than 
100 
significant 
contracts; 
this 
contracting 
activity 
would 
require 
at least 
three 
full 
time 
procurement 
staff. 
SESAB 
appears 
to 
be 
very 
consistent 
on 
the 
application 
of 
the 
rules 
for 
the 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
services. 
Since the 
state 
secretariat 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
the goods 
necessary 
for 
the 
operation 
of 
100 
health facilities 
there 
is 
a 
good tradition 
on 
government procurement,  stock 
management 
and 
distribution 
of 
goods 
throughout 
the 
state. 
One 
annual 
ex-post 
review 
of 
procurement 
is 
recommended. 
The 
risk 
on 
procurement 
is 
increased 
by 
the Basic  Care 
Expansion 
subcomponent 
that 
will 
require 
a 
closer 
supervision 
by 
the 
Bank 
and  independent  reviewers. 
The 
actual 
needs 
of 
the 
beneficiary 
municipality 
will 
be 
defined 
on 
a 
procurement 
plan 
accompanying the 
Basic 
Care 
expansion 
plan. 
It 
is 
expected that 
a 
substantial 
share 
of 
the 
transfer 
to 
the 
beneficiary municipalities 
would 
be 
to 
finance 
incentives 
of 
the 
family 
health 
teams. 
There 
are 
several 
regimes 
for 
hiring 
these 
workers,  cooperative, 
24 
Page  25
CLT, 
etc. 
All 
of 
them 
would 
qualify 
as 
hiring 
of 
individuals 
below 
<US$35,000 
or 
in 
accordance 
with 
par. 
3.19 
of 
the Consultants 
Guidelines 
as 
explained 
in 
the 
Annex 
6 
of 
the 
PAD. 
Based 
on 
the 
finding 
of 
the 
assessment, 
an 
action 
plan 
was agreed 
with 
the 
borrower 
in 
eight 
areas 
that 
cover 
matters  such 
as 
exceptions 
to 
local 
law 
in 
the 
loan 
agreement, 
staffing, 
organization, 
training, 
record 
keeping, 
and 
independent 
reviews. 
This 
action 
plan 
is 
part 
of 
the 
project  implementation 
documentation. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
A 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
was 
conducted 
in 
August 
2002. 
While 
the 
country 
specific 
risk 
and 
the 
state 
of 
Bahia 
risks 
are 
medium, 
and 
while 
SESAB 
has 
participated 
as 
collaborating 
agency 
in 
three 
Bank 
projects,  the 
assessment 
rated 
the 
project 
risk 
as 
high, 
based 
on: 
(i) 
SESAB’s relative 
inexperience 
with 
Bank 
procedures; 
(ii) 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
PCU 
was  established 
only 
in 
2002, 
(iii) 
the 
information 
system 
had 
not 
been 
created, 
and 
(iv) 
the 
Bank’s 
lack 
of 
experience 
with 
the proposed mechanism 
of 
disbursements 
for 
subprojects. 
An 
action 
plan 
was agreed 
with 
the 
Borrower.  The Bahia 
project 
may 
benefit 
from 
the  experience 
gained 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
supervising 
the 
Family 
Health 
Extension 
Project, 
which 
is 
initiating 
the 
use 
of 
SOTS 
for 
subproject 
disbursements. 
The 
FM 
assessment 
recommends that 
FM 
staff 
supervise the 
project 
three times 
a year. 
By 
law, 
the annual 
financial 
audit reports 
of 
the 
project 
accounts 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Tribunal 
de 
Contas, 
this 
was 
found 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
signiflcant 
issues 
and their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
Environmental 
Category: 
B 
(Partial 
Assessment) 
An 
environmental 
assessment 
was 
conducted 
in 
August 
2002 
in 
order 
to: 
(i) 
carry 
out 
an 
environmental 
review 
of 
the 
project 
ant 
its 
institutional 
arrangements; 
(ii) 
assess 
local 
environmental 
guidelines 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
medical 
waste 
management; 
(iii) 
compile 
existing 
documentation 
pertaining 
local 
norms 
and 
legislation  regulating 
medical 
waste 
management; 
and 
(iv) 
draft 
an 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
(EMP) 
for 
the 
project. 
The 
assessment 
concluded  that the 
State 
of 
Bahia’s  environmental regulations and 
norms 
contain 
clear procedures 
and 
guidelines 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
of 
health 
services, 
proper 
handling 
of 
medical 
wastes, 
proper 
final 
disposition 
of 
such 
wastes, 
and proper 
monitoring 
guidelines 
for 
reducing 
health 
risks. 
State 
and 
municipal 
roles 
are 
clearly 
stated 
as 
well. 
In 
addition, 
results 
from 
field 
visits 
to 
health 
centers 
in 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia 
indicate 
that 
local 
sanitary 
and environmental 
practices 
for 
proper 
handling 
and 
disposal 
of 
medical 
wastes 
are 
applied; 
however, 
implementation 
of 
these 
norms and 
standards 
in 
poor 
rural 
municipalities 
may 
be 
weak. 
Some 
concern remains 
as 
these 
municipalities 
do 
not 
have 
the technical capacity 
to 
design 
and carry out proper 
waste management plans, 
including 
the 
proper 
management 
and 
final 
disposal 
of 
medical 
wastes. 
Based 
on 
these 
findings 
the 
EA 
recommended 
an Environmental 
Category 
B 
rating. 
Most 
of 
the 
potential 
environmental 
impacts 
associated 
with 
the 
project 
are 
considered positive. 
Project 
components 
are 
aimed 
at 
increasing 
efficiency 
of 
hospital 
care, 
reducing 
wasteful 
health 
care 
practices 
and 
better 
use 
of 
resources. 
However, 
even 
though 
the 
proposed Project 
does 
not 
have 
a 
direct 
impact 
on 
the 
environment, 
the 
implementation 
of 
health 
services 
and 
the 
generation 
of 
medical 
wastes 
as 
these 
health 
centers 
provide 
better 
services, 
might 
have 
a 
direct 
connotation 
with 
environmental implications. 
During 
pre-appraisal, 
the 
Bank 
and 
SESAB 
teams 
discussed 
the 
main 
findings 
of 
the 
EAR 
and 
agreed 
with 
the 
proposed 
EMP. 
Counterpart 
team 
agreed 
that  the 
Project’s 
Operations 
Manual 
and Project 
Implementation 
Plan 
would 
include 
the 
Environmental 
Management Plan. 
All 
actions 
are 
considered 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
project’s components and 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
SESAB. 
No 
additional 
staff 
25 
Page  26
is 
required 
for 
the 
monitoring 
of 
the 
plan. 
For 
the 
provision 
of 
municipal 
assistance, 
it 
was 
agreed 
the 
project 
would 
reserve 
up 
to 
10% 
of 
the cost 
for 
component 
2 
of 
the 
Project. 
No 
additional 
studies 
are 
needed 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
project. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
The 
Project's 
EMP 
will 
strengthen the 
environmental 
management 
capacity 
of 
SESAB 
as 
well 
as 
the 
environmental 
management capacities 
of 
participating 
center 
municipalities. 
EMP 
activities include: 
(i) 
Implementation 
of 
existing 
procedures 
for local 
environmental 
assessment 
and licensing 
of 
health 
centers; 
(ii) 
Preparation 
of 
Medical

and 
(vi) 
Implementation 
of

How 
have 
stakeholders 
been consulted 
at the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report on 
the 
environmental 
impacts 
and proposed environment 
management 
plan?  Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that 
were 
used 
and 
which 
groups were 
consulted? 
The 
assessment 
included 
field 
visits 
to primary 
health 
centers 
and 
to 
medium 
and 
large capacity 
hospitals 
in 
the 
Salvador 
and 
Camaqari 
urban 
areas, 
and 
to 
a 
municipal 
sanitary 
landfill. 
Interviews 
were 
held 
with 
officials 
from 
SESAB,  Environmental 
Resources 
Center  (Centro 
de 
Recursos 
Ambientais 
- 
CRA), 
Divisiio 
de 
Vigilgncia 
Sanithria, 
Salvador's 
Municipal Health 
Secretariat, 
and 
contractors 
for 
the 
waste 
management 
facilities 
in 
Salvador 
and 
Camaqari. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms 
have been 
established 
to monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment'? 
Do 
the 
indicators reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP'? 
Environmental  Management 
Plan 
implementation  and 
monitoring 
will 
require 
close 
supervision, 
particularly 
during 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the Project. 
SESAB 
will 
include 
in 
the 
Project's  Operation 
Manual 
detailed 
procedures 
and criteria 
according 
to 
the 
activities 
and 
scope 
of 
the 
EMP. 
Project 
implementation 
unit 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
reporting 
implementation 
of 
the 
EMP. 
Progress reports 
will 
include: 
(i) 
Progress 
in 
the 
execution 
of 
each one 
of 
the activities 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and investment 
proposed 
in 
the 
plan; 
(ii) 
The impact 
indicators 
by 
component 
will 
be defined 
in 
function 
of 
the 
number 
of 
activities 
of 
each 
component 
performed 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
this 
environment 
management 
plan. 
Number 
of 
health 
centers 
with 
simplified 
environmental 
licenses at 
end 
of 
year 
1, 
year 
to 
and 
year 3 
plus 
number 
of 
municipalities 
with 
solid 
waste 
management 
plans 
at 
end 
of 
the project should 
be 
reported. 
These 
indicators 
will 
be 
applied 
on 
the 
evaluation 
phase, 
time 
at 
which 
real 
impact 
will 
be 
identified, 
positive 
as 
well 
as 
negative, 
accomplished 
and 
ones 
not 
foreseen, 
to 
finally 
make 
the 
necessary 
recommendations; 
(iii) 
In 
addition, 
the 
proposed 
Implementation 
of 
environmental criteria 
in 
the 
audit 
of 
health 
services, 
according 
to 
existing 
guidelines 
in 
the 
DivisZo 
de 
Vigildncia 
Sanitaria,on 
years 2 
and 
3 
of 
the Project, 
will 
reflect 
results 
from 
including 
the 
environmental criteria 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
health 
care 
services.

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and 
specify  the  project’s 
social 
development 
outcomes. 
A 
social 
assessment 
(SA) 
was 
carried 
out 
as 
a 
joint 
effort 
of 
SESAB 
and 
the 
World 
Bank 
as 
an 
iterative 
process 
of 
systematic 
stakeholder consultations 
and 
participation 
to 
be 
continued through 
implementation. 
Several 
instruments commissioned 
by 
SESAB 
were used 
for 
the social analysis 
of 
the proposed project. 
Two 
large-scale 
field 
reviews 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Family 
Health 
Program 
were conducted 
by 
the 
Federal 
University 
of 
Bahia 
in 
2000 
and 
2001. 
A 
team 
of 
anthropologists 
from 
the 
Collective 
Health 
Institute carried 
out 
a 
Study 
of 
Social 
Aspects 
of 
the 
Health 
Reform 
Program 
in 
the  State 
of 
Bahia 
(Beneficiary 
Assessment). 
A 
Gender 
Issues 
and 
Recommendations 
(April 
2000) 
and 
a 
Brazil 
Gender 
Review 
were carried 
out 
by 
LCSPR, 
World 
Bank 
(January 
2000). 
Field 
visits 
and further  consultation 
with 
Municipal 
Health 
Secretaries, 
Municipal 
Health Council 
members, 
members 
of 
the 
Community 
Health 
Agents 
Program 
(PACS) 
medical 
doctors, nurses 
and 
PSF, 
were carried 
out 
during 
field 
visits 
at 
the 
time 
of 
project 
preparation. 
Although 
still 
in 
infancy,  PSF 
is 
widely 
accepted 
by 
State  Secretariats, 
mayors, 
Municipal 
Health 
Councils, 
medical 
doctors, 
nurses 
and beneficiaries. 
Some 
of 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
PACS/PSF 
implementation 
are: 
(i) 
Access 
to 
services 
is 
not 
adequate 
as 
most 
PSFs are 
in 
urban 
areas 
while 
over 
60% 
of 
the 
population 
is 
in 
rural 
areas, 
(ii) 
Infrastructural 
arrangements 
must 
be 
in 
place 
at 
time 
of 
staffing 
health 
units 
under 
PACUPSF, 
(iii) 
Incentives 
to 
attract 
medical 
staff to 
work 
in 
rural 
areas 
must 
include 
training 
in 
community mobilization 
and 
health 
maintenance, 
(iv) 
Competition 
of 
nurses 
and 
community 
health 
agents 
is 
due 
to 
salary 
inequity, 
(v) 
There 
are 
varied 
opinions  among beneficiaries 
about 
the 
desirability 
of 
traditional 
methods 
of 
healing(such 
as 
“rezadeiras”, 
traditional 
“rezadores” 
of 
Catholic 
influence, 
“curadores” 
oriented 
by 
Afro-Brazilian 
cults, 
“espiritas” 
(spiritual 
counselors, 
mediums). 
Many 
of 
these 
practices 
are 
part 
of 
Candomble‘, 
Macumba 
or 
other 
Afro-Brazilian 
healing 
tradition). 
It 
is 
recommended that 
traditional 
approaches 
to 
health be 
included 
in 
the 
initial 
household 
survey 
and 
the 
original 
diagnosis 
of 
the regions. Participatory 
processes 
and 
systematic consultations 
need 
to 
continue 
through 
implementation 
to 
ensure 
high 
impact 
on 
health 
indicators. 
Care 
must 
be 
taken, 
though, 
to 
not 
engage 
project 
activities 
with 
specific 
political 
agendas. 
Gender 
Issues 
and Recommendations 
(April 
2000) 
and the 
Brazil 
Gender 
Review 
(January 
2000) 
present 
important 
data 
and recommendations 
related 
to 
women’s 
and child’s 
health. 
These 
studies 
point 
out 
that 
inadequate 
pre-natal 
care 
persists 
and  the 
proportion 
of 
at-risk 
pregnancies 
and 
matemal 
mortality 
continues 
to 
be 
elevated, 
which 
suggests 
serious 
problems 
with 
the 
health 
care 
system 
in 
the proposed 
project 
area. 
It 
recommends 
the 
inclusion 
of 
men 
in 
reproductive health 
programs 
to 
educate 
males 
on 
the 
risk 
of 
contracting 
AIDS 
and 
other 
STDs. 
Among 
other 
recommendations, 
it 
suggests 
that 
the 
project 
look 
at general 
public 
health 
issues 
in 
a 
gendered 
way, 
which 
includes 
men 
participation 
in 
family 
and 
reproductive health 
programs. 
The 
social  development 
outcomes 
of 
the 
project 
will 
consist 
of 
increased 
access 
to 
health 
care 
by 
previously 
excluded 
populations and reduced 
inequality 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
public 
resources. 
The 
state 
of 
Bahia 
comprises 
4 
17 
municipalities 
out 
of 
which 
14 
include 
Indigenous 
Peoples clustered 
in 
12 
ethnic 
groups, 
numbering 
around 
13,000 
people. 
They 
are 
located 
in 
the 
north, 
west 
and 
south 
of 
the 
State. 
They 
represent 
a 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
the 
state 
total 
(less 
than 
0.1%), 
though they 
rank 
among 
the 
poorest 
segments 
of 
this 
population. 
Within 
Brazil’s 
legal 
framework, 
health 
care 
of 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
is 
under 
the 
Federal Government’s 
jurisdiction, 
to 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
through 
FUNASA 
with 
the 
States 
and 
27 
Page  28
Municipalities 
only 
in 
a 
complementary 
role. 
The 
Bank 
is 
currently  supporting 
FUNASA 
through 
the 
VIGISUS 
Project, 
an 
APL 
whose 
first 
phase 
has 
been extended 
until 
December 
31, 
2003, 
and 
whose 
second 
phase 
is 
currently 
under 
preparation. 
During 
preparation 
of 
the 
VIGISUS 
project 
a 
nationwide 
Indigenous 
People’s 
Development 
Plan 
was prepared 
and 
discussed 
with 
Indigenous Groups and 
peoples. 
The 
project 
includes 
an 
Indigenous 
Health 
subcomponent that 
finances 
health 
care 
adapted 
to 
the 
needs 
and culture 
of 
the 
Indigenous 
people. 
FUNASA’s 
progress 
and 
plans 
for 
the 
state 
of 
Bahia 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
www.funasa.gov.br/ind/pdfs/dsei09.pdf., 
which 
includes 
a 
description 
of 
investments 
in 
staff, equipment 
and works 
by 
indigenous district. 
The 
proposed 
Bahia Health 
Project includes 
a 
component 
to 
finance 
Basic 
Health 
Care 
subprojects 
at the 
municipal 
level. 
Given 
their  small 
representation 
and 
their 
existing 
basic 
care 
and 
epidemiological 
coverage 
offered 
by 
FUNASA 
and 
VIGISUS 
outside the Project, 
it 
is 
highly 
unlikely 
that Indigenous 
peoples 
will 
need 
to 
opt 
for 
basic coverage 
under 
this 
operation. 
Hence 
OD 
4.20 
is 
deemed 
not 
to 
apply. 
Nevertheless, 
in 
the 
remote 
future 
eventuality 
that a 
subproject 
in 
an 
area 
with 
an 
Indigenous 
Population 
could 
be 
submitted 
for 
financing, 
an 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Framework 
(IPDF) 
(Annex 
11) 
sets 
the  process 
for 
the 
actions  that 
would 
need 
to 
be 
followed. 
Within 
this 
framework, 
whenever 
Indigenous 
People 
are 
to 
be included 
as 
possible beneficiaries 
of 
the 
activities financed under 
this 
Project 
(as 
determined 
by 
the existence 
of 
Indigenous 
People 
in 
the 
subproject 
area 
of 
the 
municipality 
submitted 
for 
financing),  the 
Municipality 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
FUNASA 
and 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
State 
will 
prepare 
a 
subproject 
level 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Plan 
(IPDP) 
that 
will 
address 
the 
health 
needs 
of 
those 
people 
in 
a 
culturally 
adequate 
manner 
as 
required 
by 
OD 
4.20. 
The 
PDF 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
Operational 
Manual, 
and 
will 
describe 
the specific procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
in 
the event 
that 
a 
proposed 
subproject 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
an 
area 
where Indigenous People 
reside.  These 
will 
include 
the 
need 
for 
consultations 
with 
affected 
groups 
and 
arrangements 
for 
working 
with 
Federal 
agencies, 
especially, 
FUNASA 
to 
cover the 
health 
care needs 
of 
this 
population. 
The 
subproject 
level 
IPDP 
will 
include 
a 
description 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
addressing 
Indigenous 
People’s 
issues 
at the 
local 
level, 
an implementation 
schedule, 
the need 
for  monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
subproject 
activities 
benefiting 
FUNASA 
groups, 
if 
any, 
and the relevant 
cost 
estimates 
and 
financing 
plan 
(including 
Bank 
loan 
proceeds) 
and 
for 
disclosure 
of 
the 
IPDP 
in 
accordance 
with 
Bank 
policy. 
Bank 
approval 
of 
the 
subproject 
level 
IPDP 
and related 
institutional 
agreements 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
disbursement 
against 
subprojects 
benefiting 
Indigenous 
Groups.

28 
Page  29
By 
contrast 
to 
other 
Latin 
American 
countries, 
the 
Brazilian 
health 
system places 
a 
great 
emphasis 
on 
participation 
by 
civil 
society. 
The 
organization 
of 
SUS 
includes 
Health 
Councils 
at 
every 
level 
(National, 
State, 
Municipal 
and 
Local). 
These 
Health 
Councils 
include 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society (providers 
and 
users) 
and have 
the 
authority 
to 
approve 
all 
plans 
and 
budgets 
and 
to 
request any 
information 
about 
the 
management 
of 
health 
budgets. 
The 
Councils 
will 
have 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
the 
project, 
by 
approving 
all 
sub-project  proposals 
and 
by 
making 
part 
of 
the 
govemance 
of 
micro-regions. 
Councils 
have 
a 
relatively 
short 
existence, 
and  their 
impact 
on 
decision 
making 
in 
the 
sector 
is 
not 
yet 
sufficiently 
understood;  a 
study 
on 
the 
ethnic, 
social and 
gender 
composition 
of 
the councils 
is 
under 
way 
and 
its 
results 
(expected 
in 
mid-2003) 
may 
conclude 
that 
some 
project 
activities  should 
be 
used 
to 
further 
develop 
participation 
in 
Bahia. 
Also 
in 
contrast 
to 
other 
Latin 
American 
countries, 
Bahia 
has 
seemingly 
no 
studies 
about the 
health 
status 
and 
the 
level 
of 
access 
and 
satisfaction 
of 
its 
ethnic 
groups. 
The 
household 
surveys 
will 
provide 
a 
baseline 
and 
a measure 
of 
progress 
in 
this 
account. 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have  been 
provided  to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes'? 
Municipal 
Health 
councils 
will 
review--and 
may 
veto--all 
subproject proposals. 
The 
state 
Health 
Council 
will 
approve the 
annual 
budget 
for 
the 
project,  and 
may 
request 
any 
additional 
information 
about 
the 
annual 
plan 
of 
operations. 
The 
ongoing 
study 
on 
the make-up 
of 
these 
councils 
will 
make additional 
recommendations 
conceming 
ways 
to 
give 
a 
voice 
to 
vulnerable 
groups 
of 
the population. 
In 
the event 
that 
subprojects 
submitted 
for 
financing 
under 
the 
Basic Care component 
are 
located 
in 
a 
municipality 
where 
Indigenous 
People 
reside, 
the 
municipality, 
with 
SESAB's 
assistance 
will 
work 
closely 
with 
FUNASA 
to 
ensure 
its 
active 
participation 
in 
the 
design and 
implementation 
of 
subproject 
level 
IPDPs, 
in 
the  consultation 
process 
with 
the 
Indigenous  Groups 
involved,  and 
in 
the 
design 
of 
activities that 
address 
the 
health 
care 
needs 
of 
the 
affected 
group. 
To 
ensure 
adequate 
cooperation, 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia 
will 
enter 
into 
a 
cooperation 
agreement 
with 
FUNASA 
before commencing 
preparation 
of 
any 
IPDP. 
The 
process 
in 
the 
IPDF 
will 
be 
followed 
(Annex 
11). 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social development 
outcomes? 
Increased 
access 
will 
be 
monitored 
with 
the 
10 
key 
performance 
indicators 
of 
annex 
1. 
While 
there 
will 
be 
no 
periodic 
way 
of 
monitoring 
that 
the 
improvement 
in 
these 
indicators 
is 
reaching 
the 
previously 
excluded 
populations,  there 
is 
a 
strong 
presumption 
that  any 
progress 
in 
these 
indicators 
will 
be 
concentrated 
among the 
excluded 
(because 
the rest 
of 
the 
population 
already 
has 
access 
to 
basic 
services, 
hence 
any expansion 
will 
happen among 
the 
excluded). 
Furthermore, the comparison 
of 
the 
first 
and 
second surveys 
will 
allow 
an 
evaluation 
to 
confirm or 
reject 
this 
presumption. 
APL2 
will 
include 
a 
design 
that responds 
to 
the results 
of 
this 
evaluation. 
It 
should 
be 
noticed 
that 
the proposed 
approach 
monitors 
outputs 
and 
not 
processes. 
However, 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
the 
proposed 
outputs, 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
use 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
previous 
paragraphs 
(conceming 
stakeholder 
participation, 
traditional 
practices 
and 
gender 
features). 
Improved 
equity 
will 
be 
measured 
on 
a 
yearly 
basis based 
on 
data 
from 
executed budgets.

The 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
policy 
does 
not 
apply 
because 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
the 
municipalities 
where 
indigenous peoples 
are 
residing 
(of 
which 
there 
are 
very 
few) 
will 
opt 
for 
basic 
health 
care 
under 
the 
mechanisms 
put 
in 
place 
by 
the 
project. 
The 
indigenous 
peoples 
of 
Bahia 
are 
being 
served 
by 
an existing 
targeted 
national 
indigenous 
health 
care 
structure managed 
by 
FUNASA. 
As 
a 
precautionary 
measure, 
in 
the 
event 
any 
of 
these 
municipalities 
proposes 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
basic 
care 
subproject 
that 
could 
affect 
the 
indigenous peoples 
living 
there, 
an 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Framework 
(mentioned 
in 
section 
6 
and 
described 
in 
Annex 
11) 
will 
apply, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
the subproject 
is 
prepared and

in 
a 
culturally 
appropriate 
manner.

F. 
Sustainability 
and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
Brazilian 
health 
expenditures 
have been 
growing 
at a 
rapid 
rate 
and 
are 
now 
at a 
high 
level for 
Latin 
America. One 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
decentralizing 
health 
care 
in 
Brazil 
is 
to 
improve 
the sustainability 
of 
the 
health 
system 
by 
imposing  hard 
budget 
constraints 
on 
budget 
holders  (previously 
the 
state- 
government, 
today 
municipalities 
and micro-regions) 
and 
by 
increasing the 
share 
of 
financing 
provided 
by 
sub-national 
governments  (to 
be 
achieved 
by 
a 
combination 
of 
federal 
matching 
grants 
and 
other 
incentives 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
Constitutional Amendment 
29 
which 
mandates 
minimum 
levels 
of 
spending 
in 
health). 
The 
APL 
will 
contribute 
to 
implementing 
these 
policies, 
hence; 
the 
APL 
would 
contribute 
to 
the  sustainability 
of 
the 
Bahian 
health 
system. 
The 
main 
risk 
at 
this 
level 
is 
that  the 
Municipality 
of 
Salvador 
(which 
today 
assigns 
to 
health 
only 
a 
third 
of 
what 
it 
is 
required 
according 
to 
Constitutional Amendment 
29) 
refuses 
to 
take 
charge 
of 
its 
local 
health 
system 
and 
that 
Salvador 
continue 
to 
absorb a 
growing 
share 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
At 
a 
more 
micro-level, 
one 
must 
consider 
the sustainability 
of 
the 
specific activities 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
APL, 
and 
here, 
there 
are 
significant 
risks. 
Multi-municipal 
micro-regions 
are 
intrinsically 
unstable 
because 
municipal 
politics lead 
to 
a 
desire 
for 
local 
level 
investments. 
APLI 
is 
designed 
to 
support 
the 
exploration 
of 
governance 
systems 
to 
overcome 
those tendencies. 
An 
additional 
challenge 
at 
this 
level 
is 
the 
likely 
cost 
of 
implementing 
management structures 
- 
internationally, 
these 
are 
known 
to 
have 
the 
potential 
for 
increased 
efficiency, 
but 
to 
require 
high 
administrative 
costs 
in 
the 
range 
of 
10% 
to 
20% 
of 
30 
Page  31
health 
expenditures. 
The 
APL 
will 
finance 
the 
initial 
cost 
of 
these 
management 
structures 
(including 
substantial up-start counterpart 
financing 
from 
the 
state 
government), 
but 
their 
future 
cost 
is 
unknown. 
Most 
municipal 
sub-projects 
for 
the expansion 
of 
Basic 
Care 
will 
lead 
to 
higher 
recurrent 
costs. 
For 
most 
municipalities, 
this 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
sustainable, 
given 
that 
Constitutional Amendment 
29 
requires 
a 
higher allocation 
of 
resources 
for 
health 
than 
what 
is 
presently 
available 
-- 
hence 
the 
sub-project 
will 
finance 
a 
rapid 
increase 
in 
the 
level 
of 
expenditures  that 
will 
then 
be 
sustained  based 
on 
local 
contributions. 
There remains 
a 
special 
concern 
about the 
sustainability 
of 
Family 
Health 
teams 
- 
as 
explained 
above, 
their 
cost 
per beneficiary 
is 
highest 
in 
remote 
municipalities and 
the 
existing 
federal 
subsidy 
is 
far 
short 
of 
the cost 
--their sustainability 
may 
require 
a 
permanent 
increase 
in 
transfers 
from 
the 
federal 
or 
state-government 
(because 
of 
this 
risk, 
sub-projects 
for  family 
health 
teams 
will 
only 
be 
implemented 
where 
a 
credible sustainability 
plan 
exists).

Possible 
Controversial 
Aspects: 
The municipality 
of 
Salvador 
has 
agreed 
to 
develop the capacity 
to 
acquire 
Gest6o 
Plena, 
and 
APL1 
will 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
to 
this 
end. 
As 
the 
municipality 
is 
autonomous, 
the 
state 
government cannot 
guarantee 
that 
the 
municipality 
will 
effectively 
acquire 
Gestiio 
Plena. 
In 
the event 
that 
the 
municipality 
decides 
not 
to 
make the 
change, 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
government 
will 
have 
to 
decide 
if 
APL2 
should 
still 
be 
implemented 
(i.e. 
if 
the 
program 
development objectives 
can 
still 
be 
reached).

Project Description 
BRAZIL: Bahia Health System 
Reform 
Project 
Component 
I. 
Implementation 
of 
health  micro-rezions 
in 
Bahia. 
(US$ 
18.3 
million, 
including 
con 
tinBen cies) 
This 
component 
will 
strengthen 
the 
management  capacity, 
Govemance and 
resolution 
capacity 
of 
the 
participating 
microregions. 
A. 
Strengthening 
management 
and 
governance 
of 
micro-regions 
Strengthening 
the 
management 
capacity 
of 
the 
microregion 
for 
the purchase 
of 
health 
care 
services, the 
audit 
of 
the 
delivery 
of 
these 
services and the 
initiation 
of 
an 
accreditation 
function. 
To 
strengthen the 
role 
of 
the 
micro-region 
as 
a 
purchaser 
of 
health 
care 
services, 
the 
project 
will 
support: 
(i) 
the 
development and deployment 
of 
performance 
based contracts 
between 
the 
micro-regions 
and their 
local 
providers, 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
contracting 
department 
at 
the 
micro-regional level. 
(ii) 
the 
implementation 
of 
Regulation 
Centers 
with 
the capacity 
to 
authorize referrals 
for 
treatment 
and testing 
based 
on 
medical 
criteria 
and 
on 
transparent 
priorities 
and the 
introduction 
of 
medically-based 
prior 
authorization 
for 
elective 
hospital 
care; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
adaptation 
of 
SUS 
card 
technology 
to 
the 
local 
conditions 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
applications 
that 
address 
the 
needs 
of 
microregional 
management. 
In 
order 
to 
effectively 
serve 
in 
an 
evaluative 
and 
monitoring 
capacity, 
the 
micro-regional Regulation 
Center 
will 
develop 
the 
capacity 
to 
conduct 
detailed 
clinical, 
environmental6, 
and 
financial 
audits 
of 
providers 
and 
facilities 
and 
will 
initiate 
a  process 
of 
accreditation. 
Performance-based 
contracting 
requires 
accurate data 
derived 
from 
these 
audits 
to 
determine 
if 
the 
contracted 
provider 
is 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
contract 
goals. 
Audit 
functions 
also 
serve 
as 
a 
control 
mechanism 
to 
assure 
provider 
accountability 
for 
efficiency 
and 
quality 
of 
care, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
detect 
fraud, 
abuse, 
and ineffective 
practices. 
Accreditation 
will 
be 
based 
on 
standard 
criteria. 
The 
project 
will 
support: 
(i) 
contracting 
specialized 
consultants 
to 
provide 
SESAB 
with 
tum-key 
operations 
of 
the 
auditing 
and accreditation 
functions; 
(ii) 
promoting 
preparation 
of 
Medical 
Waste Plans 
in 
health 
care 
facilities 
and 
implementation 
of 
existing 
local 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
licensing 
of 
health 
centers; 
(iii) 
developing 
courses 
to 
teach 
the 
techniques 
of 
evaluation 
of 
patient 
care 
through 
the 
use 
of 
standards 
of 
care 
and 
clinical 
protocols,  the 
use 
of 
standard 
guidelines 
for 
accreditation 
of 
hospitals, 
and 
the 
techniques 
of 
internal 
quality 
review 
and 
the 
investigation and reporting 
of 
sentinel 
events. 
Developing 
new 
forms 
of 
Governance 
in 
the 
micro-region. 
Micro-regions 
must 
develop 
governance 
systems 
that 
balance the 
priorities, 
needs 
and 
capacities 
of 
large municipalities, 
their small 
surrounding 
municipalities 
and the 
state. 
No 
firm 
blueprint 
exists 
for 
this 
system 
of 
governance, 
and they 
will 
need 
to 
evolve 
based 
on 
trial 
and 
error. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
this 
process 
by 
various 
means, 
including 
by: 
(i) 
financing 
the 
initial 
costs 
of 
implementing 
local 
goveming 
bodies, 
(ii) 
the 
implementation 
of 
microregional 
planning 
and 
budgeting 
tools, 
(iii) 
sponsoring 
meetings and 
seminars 
for 
municipal 
health 
secretaries, 
and 
sponsoring 
field 
trips 
for 
members 
of 
the 
governing 
body 
to 
visit 
other 
states 
that 
have 
successfully 
implemented microregions.

start 
to 
provide 
a 
baseline 
for 
the 
project 
and 
the 
second 
at 
completion 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
APL1. 
Each 
of 
the 
surveys 
will 
cover 
about 
ten 
thousand 
households, 
establishing 
the 
main 
health, 
demographic 
and 
social  and 
ethnic 
characteristics 
of 
the 
population 
with 
a 
questionnaire that 
will 
also 
obtain 
some data 
on 
household

use. 
Support 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
for 
other 
monitoring

This 
sub-component 
will 
strengthen the 
capacity 
of 
SESAB 
as 
a 
purchaser 
and

of 
high

and 
will 
initiate 
accreditation activities 
for 
high 
complexity 
providers. 
Introduce 
Performance 
contracting: 
New 
models 
of 
contracting, 
providing 
incentives 
for 
improved 
provider 
performance  and 
specifying 
penalties 
for 
poor 
performance, 
are 
essential 
to 
a  strategy 
of 
enhancing 
quality 
and 
efficiency. 
Performance indicators 
will 
include 
measures 
of 
access, 
availability, 
patient 
satisfaction, 
quality 
of 
care, 
utilization 
management, 
and  results 
of 
investigation 
of 
patient 
complaints and 
grievances, 
among 
others. 
In 
these 
contracts, 
providers 
and 
facilities 
will 
be 
mandated 
to 
participate 
in 
utilization 
review, 
quality 
improvement, 
and reporting 
activities. 
Deployment 
of 
a 
Regulation 
Center 
for 
High 
Complexity 
Care 
at 
the 
state 
level: 
SESAB 
is 
currently 
implementing 
a 
Central 
de 
RegulaqLo 
for 
high 
complexity 
care. 
The 
center 
will 
regulate 
high 
complexity 
services 
that 
are 
delivered 
throughout Bahia. 
SESABs immediate proposal 
is 
to 
regulate hemodialysis, 
AIDS 
therapies, 
high-risk 
obstetrics/ neonatology, oncology, 
and in-patient 
rehabilitation 
care 
through 
the 
center, 
adding additional 
services 
over 
time. 
This 
center 
will 
evaluate 
requests 
for 
high 
complexity 
services 
and 
will 
distribute referrals 
for 
high 
complexity 
care 
in 
an 
equitable and 
transparent 
manner. 
Strengthen 
audit 
functions 
in 
high 
complexity care. 
Performance-based 
contracting 
requires 
accurate 
data 
derived 
from 
these 
audits 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
if 
the  contracted 
provider 
is 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
contract 
goals. 
Audit 
functions 
also 
serve 
as 
a 
control mechanism 
to 
assure 
provider 
accountability 
for 
efficiency 
and 
quality 
of 
care, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
detect 
fraud, 
abuse, 
and ineffective 
 practice^.^ 
Because 
’ 
Examples 
of 
audits 
include: 
(i) 
monitoring 
of 
provider 
performance 
of 
indicators specified 
in 
contracts. 
(ii) 
hospital 
audits: 
concurrent 
utilization 
review 
of 
hospital 
admissions 
and 
retrospective 
reviews 
of 
selected 
cases 
after

on 
the 
following 
areas: 
(i) 
Strengthening 
the 
supply 
of 
basic 
services 
by: 
remodeling 
of 
health 
centers 
(including 
the conversion 
of 
small 
municipal 
general hospitals 
into 
outpatient 
facilities 
with 
limited 
24 
hour 
emergency 
service); 
procurement 
of 
basic 
medical, 
transport 
and communications 
equipment; 
and 
the 
hiring 
of 
incremental 
health 
care 
workers 
(these 
workers 
would not 
be hired 
as 
civil

of 
the 
local 
demographics 
and 
epidemiology; 
(ii) 
an analysis 
of 
the

A 
sustainability proposal 
including 
the 
use 
of 
municipal 
and 
state 
funds 
that 
will 
be 
phased-in 
as 
A 
procurement 
plan for 
sub-project 
implementation 
with 
details 
for 
the 
first 
year; 
The 
preparation 
of 
these 
plans 
is 
judged 
to 
be 
demanding, 
but 
feasible 
since 
all 
municipalities 
prepare 
annually 
a 
Health 
Programming 
Plan 
that covers 
most of 
the 
information 
listed 
(under 
items 
a, 
b, 
c, 
and 
d) 
above. 
The 
project 
will 
finance technical 
assistance 
to 
interested 
municipalities, 
and 
the 
regional 
outposts 
of 
SESAB 
will 
receive 
special 
training 
to 
support 
municipalities 
in 
the preparation 
of 
the 
Plans. 
Also, 
the 
participating municipalities 
will 
be 
clustered together 
in 
a 
few 
micro-regions 
during 
the 
initial 
years 
of 
implementation 
(per 
eligibility 
criteria shown 
above) 
favoring 
cross-learning 
and 
making 
it 
easier 
to 
provide them 
with 
technical 
assistance. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
subprojects 
submitted 
for 
financing 
under 
the 
Basic 
Care component 
are 
located 
in 
a 
municipality 
where 
Indigenous 
People 
reside, 
the 
municipality, 
with 
SESAB’s 
assistance 
will 
work 
closely 
with 
FUNASA 
to 
ensure 
its 
active 
participation 
in 
the 
design 
and implementation 
of 
subproject 
level 
IPDPs, 
in 
the  consultation 
process 
with 
the  Indigenous  Groups 
involved,  and 
in 
the 
design 
of 
activities that 
address 
the 
health 
care 
needs 
of 
the 
affected 
group. 
To 
ensure 
adequate 
cooperation, 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia 
will 
enter 
into 
a 
cooperation 
agreement 
with 
FUNASA. 
The 
process 
in 
the 
PDF 
will 
be 
followed 
(Annex 
11). 
The 
subproject 
level 
IPDP 
will 
include 
a 
description 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
for  addressing 
Indigenous 
People’s 
issues 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
an implementation 
schedule, 
the 
need 
for 
monitoring 
and evaluating 
subproject 
activities 
benefiting 
these 
groups, 
if 
any, 
and 
the 
relevant 
cost 
estimates 
and financing 
plan 
(including 
Bank 
loan 
proceeds). 
Bank 
approval 
of 
the 
subproject 
level 
IPDP 
and 
related 
institutional 
agreements 
will 
be 
a 
condition of 
disbursement against subprojects 
benefiting Indigenous 
Groups.

Annex 
4: 
Cost 
Benefit Analysis Summary 
BRAZIL:  Bahia Health System 
Reform Project 
This 
annex presents 
the 
summary 
results 
of 
the cost-benefit analysis 
of 
the 
Health 
Project 
of 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia, 
Brazil, 
based 
upon 
the 
program's 
costs 
and 
the measurable 
economic 
benefits 
flowing 
from 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
proposed program. 
The 
project 
will 
potentially 
save 
over 
16,000 
lives 
through 
improvements 
in 
the 
health 
care 
system 
and reductions 
in 
disability 
and 
mortality 
will 
contribute 
over 
400,000 
productive 
life 
years 
(DALYs) 
to 
the 
economy. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
project 
costs 
of 
about 
$167 
million, 
the 
analysis 
includes 
the 
investment 
costs 
and 
recurrent 
expenditures 
related 
to 
improving 
access 
to 
primary 
health 
care 
services, 
strengthening emergency 
services, 
and 
restructuring 
the 
hospital 
network. 
In 
summary, 
the 
project 
would 
yield 
a present 
value 
of 
net 
benefits,  after 
investment 
and 
recurrent 
costs, 
of 
over 
$138.5 
million 
and produce 
an estimated 
internal 
rate 
of 
return 
(IRR) 
above 
84% 
over ten 
years. 
The 
Bahia health 
Sector 
Reform 
Project 
will 
produce 
substantial 
savings 
for 
the 
sector, 
primarily 
through 
reductions 
in 
hospitalization 
costs. 
The 
cost-benefit 
analysis, 
which 
gives  the 
project 
a 
BenefitKOst 
Index 
of 
3.84, 
will 
yield 
significant health 
benefits 
to 
the 
population 
and economic 
benefits 
to 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia. 
Projected recurrent 
expenditures 
generated 
by 
the 
project 
and the 
estimates 
of 
future health 
care 
spending 
show 
that 
the 
project 
would 
be 
financially 
sustainable.

large 
and 
cannot 
be

by

brief 
explanation 
of 
the

is 
warranted, 
e.g. 
"The

benefits 
is 
less 
than 
that 
of 
economic benefits 
because 
of 
controls 
on 
electricity 
tariffs." 
Summary 
of 
Benefits 
and 
Costs: 
The 
cost-benefit analysis 
distributes 
the 
benefits 
over 
this 
time horizon 
into 
two 
major 
groups: 
direct 
and 
indirect 
benefits. 
The 
direct 
benefits 
are 
the 
expected 
tangible 
benefits 
accruable 
to 
the 
project 
from 
the 
reduced 
hospital 
stays, 
eliminating 
unnecessary 
discharges, 
reducing 
consultation 
and 
from 
the 
restructuring and 
downsizing 
of 
hospital facilities. 
Indirect 
benefits 
are 
related 
to 
the 
potential 
life 
years 
saved 
by 
the 
project and 
the 
economic 
and financial value 
of 
increasing 
productivity. The 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
assumes 
that 
the 
strengthening 
and 
changes 
in 
the 
health 
care 
system 
will 
be 
targeted 
to 
4.9 
million 
people, 
equivalent 
to 
38 percent 
of 
Bahia's 
population 
and that 
a 
ten 
year 
period 
is 
required 
to 
reflect 
the 
flow 
of 
costs 
and 
benefits. 
The project 
will 
be 
divided into 
two 
phases. 
45 
Page  46
Among 
the 
most 
important 
direct 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
are 
savings 
in 
hospitalizations. 
Savings 
in 
hospitalization 
costs 
will 
be 
accomplished through 
three 
sources 
of 
savings. 
First, 
the 
project 
will 
result 
in 
reduced hospitalizations 
due 
to 
the 
greater 
capacity 
to 
resolve 
medical 
needs 
at the 
local 
level, 
thus 
reducing 
referrals 
to 
hospitals. 
Second, 
the 
project 
will 
reduce 
risk 
factors 
in 
the target 
population 
that 
increase 
the 
demand 
for 
hospitalizations. 
The 
third 
source 
of 
savings 
comes 
from 
reduced administrative 
costs. 
Another 
probable 
source 
of 
savings, 
not 
explicitly 
quantified 
in 
this 
study, 
is 
the 
reduction 
in 
hospitalization 
costs 
due 
to 
increased 
efficiency 
of 
health 
networks 
as 
a 
result 
of 
improved 
management 
practices. 
The 
project 
will 
shift 
healthcare 
provision 
from 
expensive 
hospitals 
to 
more efficient 
and 
higher quality 
primary 
care 
centers. 
This 
shift 
will 
save 
over 
583 
thousand 
unnecessary 
hospitalizations 
over 
10 years, 
and 
produce 
a 
direct benefit 
of 
$1 
16 
million 
in 
nominal 
terms 
with 
a 
present 
value 
of 
$67.7 
million. 
The 
present value 
of 
savings 
in 
administrative 
costs 
is 
estimated 
at 
$4.86 
million 
for 
a 
total 
present value 
of 
direct 
benefits 
of 
$72.6 
million. 
The 
indirect 
benefits were 
estimated 
by 
analyzing 
the 
effect 
of 
Disability-Adjusted 
Life 
Years 
(DALYs), 
using 
the 
GDP 
per 
capita 
as 
the 
index 
for 
the 
productive value 
one year 
of 
an economically 
active citizen. 
The 
GDP 
per capita 
in 
the 
regions 
of 
interest 
was 
estimated at 
$3,171. 
The 
total 
benefits 
in 
terms 
of 
DALYs 
increase 
as 
the 
morbidity 
and 
mortality 
index 
improve 
over 
the 
first 
three 
years, 
when 
the target 
improvements 
are 
met. 
From 
that 
year 
onward 
the 
mortality index remain 
constant 
throughout 
the 
period 
of 
the 
study. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
the 
project 
will 
potentially 
contribute 
405,422 
productive 
life 
years 
(DALYs) 
to 
the 
economy 
and 
save 
over 
16,000 
lives 
as 
a 
result 
of 
applying 
the 
aforementioned 
assumptions 
to 
the 
pattern 
of 
mortality 
in 
the 
country. 
The reduction 
in 
mortality 
is 
taken 
as 
the 
base 
line 
assumption 
to 
calculate 
the 
indirect 
benefits 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
estimates 
of 
reduced 
mortality 
are 
based 
on 
conservative 
estimates 
based 
on 
historical 
trends 
in 
Bahia, 
intemational 
literature 
on 
cost- 
effectiveness, 
and 
expert's 
opinion. 
To 
calculate the 
indirect 
benefits, 
the discounted 
life 
years 
saved 
attributable 
to 
these 
reductions 
are 
then converted 
to 
monetary 
terms 
by 
using 
estimates 
of 
the 
discounted 
life 
time 
earnings 
lost 
from 
each 
death, 
as 
reflected 
by 
the 
use 
of 
average 
wage 
levels, 
adjusted 
for 
labor 
market 
participation, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
years 
of 
life 
lost for 
each 
death. 
The 
following 
tables 
summarize 
the 
results 
of 
the 
analysis 
for 
each 
of 
the 
two 
scenarios.

Index 
As 
shown 
in 
the 
table, 
benefits 
outweigh 
investments 
nearly 
four 
to 
one. 
Over 
ten 
years, 
the 
net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
project 
would yield 
benefits 
of 
approximately 
US$394 
million. 
With 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
first 
two 
years, 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
generate 
annual 
savings 
to 
the 
system 
that  outstrip 
the 
investment 
cost, 
thereby 
paying 
for 
them. 
The 
internal 
rate 
of 
retum 
(IRR) 
for 
the 
project 
is 
estimated at 
85%, 
reflecting 
the 
extremely 
high 
benefits  relative 
to 
project 
costs. 
This 
ratio 
can 
be 
used 
to 
46 
Page  47
demonstrate 
the 
value 
of 
this 
project 
relative to 
other 
projects 
in 
other 
sectors; 
any 
number 
lower 
than 
the 
discount rate 
(10%) 
would 
imply 
that 
the 
project 
should 
not 
be 
carried out. 
In 
terms 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
implementation, 
the  analysis 
considers 
two 
basic 
elements: 
(i) 
the  external 
investment 
costs 
of 
the 
Bank 
project; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
recurrent 
costs. 
The 
external 
financing 
is 
disbursed over 
seven years 
as 
the 
project 
advances, 
with 
35% 
disbursed 
within 
the 
first 
two 
years, 
10% 
in 
the 
third 
year, 
and 
20%, 
15%, 
10% 
and 
10% 
in 
the 
following 
successive years, 
respectfully. 
The 
recurrent 
costs 
reach 
$4.1 
million 
per 
year 
after 
the 
fourth 
year, 
once 
the 
project 
is 
fully 
operational. 
This 
amount includes 
the 
recurrent 
and 
incremental 
costs 
of 
investments 
in 
infkastructure, 
equipment and 
maintenance, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
cost 
of 
increasing 
the 
coverage 
of 
basic 
health 
services 
through 
the 
primary 
care 
network.  Over 
a 
ten- 
year 
horizon, 
the 
present 
value 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
project 
is 
$138.5 
million, 
while 
the 
present 
value 
of 
the 
total 
benefits 
is 
estimated 
at $532.5 
million, 
thus 
giving 
the 
project 
a 
Net 
Present 
Value 
of 
approximately 
$394 
million. 
The 
Net 
Present 
Value 
of 
the 
project 
over 
a 
six-year 
time 
frame 
is 
estimated 
at 
$154.4 
million, 
thus 
demonstrating 
the 
robustness 
of 
the 
project. 
Cost-Effectiveness 
The 
total 
discounted 
life 
years 
potentially 
saved 
through 
the 
project 
interventions 
are 
based 
on 
rough 
estimates 
of 
the 
potential reduction 
in 
infant 
and maternal 
mortality, 
and 
the 
discounted 
number 
of 
life 
years 
lost 
per 
death. 
While 
there 
are 
no 
detailed 
cost-effectiveness 
studies 
for 
Bahia 
that estimate the 
burden 
of 
disease 
or 
the 
number 
of 
disability 
adjusted 
life 
years 
lost, 
back 
of 
the 
envelop calculations 
are 
made 
using 
the 
mortality 
levels 
and 
coefficients 
on 
the 
ratio 
of 
DALYs 
per 
death 
taken 
from 
the 
Global 
Burden 
of 
Disease 
study. 
While 
this 
is 
not 
an 
exact  figure, 
it 
provides 
a 
guide 
for 
policymakers 
to 
estimate 
the project’s benefits. 
Using 
this 
methodology, 
it 
is 
estimated 
that 
the 
project 
would 
reduce the 
burden 
of 
disease 
by 
approximately 
465,000 
DALYs 
over 
the  10 
years. 
The 
overall 
average 
cost per 
DALY 
saved 
is 
US$342, 
while 
the 
cost 
per 
avoided 
death 
is 
$8,546. 
While 
these 
figures 
may 
seem 
high, 
they 
are 
compensated 
by 
the 
lifetime 
economic 
contribution 
of 
each 
individual. 
This 
is 
particularly 
evident 
in 
the 
case 
of 
reductions 
in 
infant mortality 
in 
a 
region 
where the 
average 
number 
of 
productive 
years 
is 
approximately 
50 
years. 
h 
addition, 
a 
substantial 
portion 
of 
the 
benefits 
will 
not 
be 
observed 
until 
after the 
study’s 
time 
frame. 
For 
example, 
avoided 
mortality 
for 
children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
one 
will 
not 
bear 
fruit 
in 
terms 
of 
economic 
activity 
for 
ten 
years 
or 
more. 
The 
average 
cost 
per 
discounted 
life 
year 
for 
the 
selected 
project 
interventions 
is 
in 
a 
range 
acceptable 
under 
the 
standards 
established 
in 
the 
1993 
WDR. 
This 
is 
in 
line 
with 
other 
project’s 
that 
promote 
system 
wide 
reforms, 
with 
limited 
interventions 
in 
primary 
care. 
Fiscal 
Impact 
and 
Sustainability 
The 
first 
step 
in 
the  analysis 
of 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
project 
was 
to 
establish  the 
base 
level 
expenditures 
prior 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
After 
this 
evaluation, 
estimates 
were made 
on 
the 
additional 
costs, 
which 
result 
from 
this 
project. 
In 
1997, 
total 
health 
expenditures 
in 
Brazil 
account 
for 
6.5% 
of 
the 
GDP, 
or  approximately $64 per 
capita. 
That 
same 
year 
public 
expenditures 
accounted 
for 
48.7% 
of 
total health 
care 
expenditures. 
For 
the 
current 
year 
(2000), 
the 
public 
health 
budget 
for 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia 
(including 
federal contributions) 
is 
R$650 
million 
(US$361 
million). 
The 
health 
expenditures 
of 
the 
Secretaria 
de Saude 
do 
Estado da 
Bahia 
(SESAB) 
account 
for 
1.7 
of 
the 
GDP 
of 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia. The 
federal govemment 
contributed 
$183.7 
million 
of 
the 
total 
SESAB 
budget 
for 
this 
year. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
there 
is 
a 
trend 
toward 
the 
decentralization 
of 
services 
provided 
through 
the 
SUS, 
from 
the 
federal 
level to 
the 
State 
and 
Municipal 
level. 
Besides 
this 
trend 
toward 
decentralization, 
the 
health 
sector 
is 
being 
reformed 
to 
create 
mechanisms 
to 
transfer 
funds 
from 
the 
federal government 
to 
State 
and 
Municipal 
governments. 
Current legislation 
indicates 
that 
the federal 
budget 
will 
increase 
the 
allocations 
to 
State 
and 
Municipal 
health 
budgets 
by 
7% 
47 
Page  48
in 
2000, 
and 
by 
12% 
and 
15% 
in 
2004 
for 
states 
and 
municipalities,  respectively. 
The 
projections 
of 
future 
public health 
expenditures 
are 
based 
on 
figures 
from 
1995 
and 
using 
real 
growth 
rates 
of 
8% 
for 
State 
budgets.

Based 
on 
the current projections 
for 
health 
expenditures, 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
will 
cost 
less 
than 
2% 
of 
the 
public 
expenditure 
on 
health 
care services 
in 
Bahia 
starting 
from 
the seventh 
year 
of 
the 
project, 
which 
is 
the 
starting 
point 
to 
analyze 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
project.  Recurrent 
costs 
attributable 
to 
recurrent 
costs 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
represent 
additional 
costs 
of 
approximately 
5% 
above 
public 
health 
expenditures 
during 
the 
first 
six 
years 
of 
the project. 
These 
costs 
range 
from 
8% 
above 
base 
expenditures 
in 
the 
first 
year 
to 
a 
minimum 
of 
3% 
in 
the 
sixth 
year. 
In 
the 
following 
years, 
additional 
costs 
due 
to 
the 
project 
represent 
only 
an 
average 
of 
1% 
increase 
over 
normal 
expenditures. 
These 
figures 
indicate 
that 
the 
project 
is 
sustainable. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
is 
likely 
to improve 
future 
government 
tax 
revenues 
as 
a 
result 
of 
better 
productivity, 
reduced premature 
morbidity 
and 
mortality. 
However, 
its 
sustainability 
also 
depends 
on 
the 
political 
will 
of 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia to 
raise 
health 
care 
expenditures 
to 
the 
required levels 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
and 
sustain the 
benefits 
of 
the 
project. 
Main 
Assumptions: 
The 
following 
parameters  are 
considered 
relevant 
in 
estimating 
the 
economic benefits 
of 
the 
proposed 
project: 
the 
length 
of 
the 
project 
horizon 
and 
the 
time 
to 
impact 
the 
health 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
size 
of 
the 
target 
population, 
the 
existing 
patterns 
of 
morbidity 
and 
mortality, 
the 
number 
of 
years 
of 
productive 
life 
added 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the percentage 
decrease 
in 
mortality, and 
the 
existing 
cost structure 
in 
the 
health 
sector. 
Given 
the 
medium-to-long-term effect 
of 
the 
changes, 
the 
estimates 
presented 
in 
terms 
of 
reduced 
morbidity, 
which 
assume 
a 
project 
horizon 
of 
only 
10 
years,  are 
very 
conservative. 
The 
additional 
costs 
of 
increasing 
the 
maternal 
and 
child 
health 
care services are 
reflected 
in 
the 
investment 
costs. 
The 
analysis 
of 
the 
Bahia 
Health 
Reform 
Project 
uses 
the 
following 
assumptions 
to 
measure the 
direct and 
indirect 
benefits: 
maternal 
mortality 
would 
be 
reduced 
by 
50%; 
mortality 
from 
malnutrition 
would 
be 
reduced 
by 
3 
1%; 
mortality 
from 
perinatal 
afflictions 
would 
be 
reduced 
by 
14%; 
mortality 
from 
respiratory 
diseases 
would 
be 
reduced 
by 
24%; 
mortality 
from 
CVD 
would 
be 
reduced 
by 
25%; 
mortality 
from 
infectious 
diseases 
would 
be 
reduced 
by 
22%; 
mortality 
from 
diabetes 
mellitus 
would 
be 
reduced 
by 
3 
1%; 
a 39% 
reduction over 
time 
in 
hospital 
discharges 
for 
infectious 
diseases; 
a 39% 
reduction 
in 
cardiovascular 
discharges; 
a 33% 
reduction 
in 
respiratory 
disease 
discharges; 
a 
20% 
reduction 
in 
discharges 
for 
maternal complications 
from 
childbirth; 
a 34% 
reduction 
in 
genitourinary 
discharges; 
and 
discount 
rate 
of 
10%.

In 
the 
following 
sections,  these 
assumptions 
will 
be used 
to 
evaluate 
the benefits 
of 
the 
project 
and 
to 
assess, 
from 
an 
economic 
perspective,  the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
public 
finances. 
All 
target 
reductions 
in 
morbidity 
and 
mortality 
would 
be 
reached after 
three years. 
Sensitivity analysis 
/ 
Switching 
values 
of 
critical 
items: 
While 
the above 
results 
are 
conservative, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
test 
the 
robustness 
of 
the 
results 
with 
regard 
to 
potential 
delays 
or 
reductions 
in 
benefits. 
This 
is 
done 
through 
the 
use 
of 
sensitivity 
analysis assuming 
delays 
of 
2 
and 
3 
years, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
reduction 
in 
benefits 
of 
20%, 
30% 
and 
40%. 
The 
following 
table 
summarizes 
the results 
of 
the 
sensitivity 
analysis.

The 
previous table 
shows 
the effect 
of 
delays 
are 
lower 
than 
expected 
benefits 
on 
the 
NPV 
and 
IRR. 
Overall, 
the 
project 
would 
remain justifiable 
even 
assuming 
a 
3 
year 
delay 
in 
project 
benefits 
or 
a 
40 
% 
reduction 
in 
the benefits 
received, assuming the 
traditional 
parameters 
which 
dictate that 
annual 
rate 
of 
retum 
eamed should 
be 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
the 
discount rate 
of 
the project, 
to 
maintain 
an efficient 
allocation 
of 
Bank 
resources. 
The 
high 
IRR 
also 
underscores 
the cost-effective nature 
of 
the 
program. 
The 
analysis 
highlights 
the 
importance 
of 
focusing 
on 
measurable results. 
If 
the 
total 
benefits 
fall 
below 
the 
50 
percent 
level--in 
comparison 
with 
the estimated 
reductions 
in 
morbidity 
and 
mortality--the overall 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
project 
would 
fall below an 
acceptable 
level.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements 
BRAZIL:  Bahia Health System 
Reform Project 
A. 
Procurement 
Arrangements 
Procurement 
for 
the 
proposed 
project 
would  be 
carried  out 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
“Guidelines: 
Procurement  Under 
IBRD 
Loans 
and 
IDA 
Credits“, 
published 
in 
January 
1995 
(revised 
JanuarytAugust 
1996,  September 
1997 
and 
January 
1999); 
and 
“Guidelines: 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers” 
published 
in 
January 
1997 (revised 
in 
September 
1997, 
January 
1999 and 
May 
2002); 
and 
the 
provisions 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
The 
Bank’s 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents 
and 
Standard Request 
for 
Proposals 
will 
be 
used 
for 
the 
Bank-financed 
ICB 
goods 
and 
consultant 
services, 
respectively. 
For 
NCB 
procurement 
of 
goods, 
PCU 
and 
the 
selected 
Municipalities 
will 
use 
the 
model 
standard 
bidding 
document 
issued 
by 
SEAIN. 
The 
pregiio 
and the 
electronic 
pregiio 
may be 
used 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
shopping 
of 
off-the-shelf 
items 
in 
all 
project 
components. 
1. 
Procurement Responsibility. 
The 
Project 
implementation 
will 
require procurement 
of 
goods, 
hiring 
of 
consultants, 
training 
activities 
and small refurbishing 
of 
existing 
administrative 
and 
warehouses 
facilities 
or 
construction 
of 
small 
new 
health 
care 
facilities 
in 
the 
micro 
regions. 
The 
micro 
regions 
(microregi6es) 
are 
31 
state 
subdivisions 
grouping 
several 
municipalities 
with 
one 
of 
them 
acting 
as 
a 
leader. 
One 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
strengthen 
these 
health 
administrations.  There 
are 
four 
types 
of 
implementing 
agencies 
under 
the 
proposed Project: 
at 
the central 
level, 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
through 
the 
Superintendencias 
and 
the 
Coordenapjo 
de 
Licitaq6es 
da 
Secretaria 
da 
Sazide 
(COLICI) 
will 
carry 
out 
hiring 
of 
consultants, 
and  procurement 
of 
larger 
information 
technology 
equipment, 
furniture  and 
materials; 
the 
procurement centralized 
at 
the central 
level 
is 
possible 
in 
the 
Project 
because 
SESAB 
has 
a 
good 
distribution 
network 
contracted 
out through national 
bidding; 
the 
31 
micro-regi6es 
that 
are 
subject 
to 
strengthening 
under 
the 
Project 
will 
hire 
services 
to 
host 
training 
activities, 
including 
rental 
of 
space 
and 
food 
services, 
in 
small 
amounts 
generally 
using 
administrative 
procedures 
of 
the 
regional 
DIRES 
of 
SESAB; 
the 
participating municipalities 
under 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
subprojects 
component 
will 
carry 
out 
procurement activities 
to 
implement Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Plans, 
including 
hiring 
of 
health 
workers 
and small 
investments. 
The 
disbursement 
mechanism 
to 
be 
used 
for 
these 
interventions 
is 
an 
agreement 
signed 
between 
SESAB 
and 
the 
beneficiary 
municipality 
(hereinafter 
“Term0 
de 
Compromisso”), 
with 
which 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
regulating 
and 
controlling 
the  procurement 
procedures 
as 
to 
be 
shopping, 
ICB, 
acceptable 
NCB 
and 
the 
use 
of 
Consultants 
Guidelines; 
and 
the 
state 
secretariat 
of 
administration 
SAEB 
and the 
superintendence 
of 
administrative 
civil 
works 
SUCAB 
will 
carry 
out 
the  procurement 
of 
vehicles 
and 
civil 
works, 
respectively, 
as 
this 
procurement 
is 
centralized 
in 
the 
state 
of 
Bahia. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
overall 
project 
procurement 
activity, 
including 
compliance 
with 
procedures 
and 
timetables agreed 
with 
the 
Bank. The 
PCU 
will 
hire 
procurement 
specialists 
and 
other 
disciplines 
in 
order 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
supervisory responsibilities and 
to 
assist 
the 
other 
implementing 
units. 
The 
PCU 
will 
organize 
a 
procurement team consisting 
of 
at 
least three 
procurement 
specialists 
using 
terms 
of 
reference 
and 
job 
description 
agreed 
on 
the 
Action 
Plan 
3. 
Procurement 
Plan. 
The 
PCU 
prepared 
a 
procurement 
plan 
for 
the 
tasks 
to 
be carried out 
during 
the 
project 
implementation. 
The procurement 
plans 
of 
the 
selected 
municipalities 
in 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
component 
will 
form 
part 
of 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Plan 
and 
will 
be 
assessed 
by 
the 
PCU 
as 
they 
are 
prepared 
during 
the 
project implementation. 
The 
procurement 
plan 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
RF’A’s 
office 
and 
is 
51 
Page  52
in 
the 
project files. 
The 
procurement 
plans 
consist 
of: 
(i) 
procurement 
plan 
for 
the 
project’s 
goods, 
including 
contract 
packaging, 
applicable 
procedures 
and 
process scheduling; 
(ii) 
a 
consultant selection 
process 
plan 
for 
the 
project’s 
consultant 
services, 
including 
contract  packaging, 
applicable 
procedures, 
shortlists, 
selection criteria. 
The 
procurement 
plan 
and 
consultant selection 
process 
plan 
will 
be 
updated periodically, 
every 
6 
months. 
The 
plans 
include 
the 
(i) 
list 
of 
contracts 
completed, 
under 
execution, 
under 
procurement, 
to 
be 
procured 
in 
the 
upcoming 
calendar 
semester 
and, 
tentatively 
in 
the 
subsequent semester; 
(ii) 
costs 
of 
completed and under execution 
contracts, 
estimated 
costs 
for upcoming 
contracts; 
(iii) 
schedule 
of 
bidding; 
and 
(iv) 
particular 
methods 
of 
procurement 
of 
goods 
or

be 
used 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
shopping. 
The 
aggregate

Procurement 
under 
the 
Basic 
Care Expansion 
subprojects. 
The 
procurement under the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
subprojects 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
beneficiary  municipalities 
pursuant 
Termos 
de 
Compromisso 
signed between the 
SESAB 
and 
the participant 
municipality. 
The 
Basic 
Care 
component 
will 
include 
support 
to 
the 
family 
health 
program 
and 
other  basic 
care 
activities 
at 
the 
municipal 
level. 
The 
participant municipalities 
will 
include 
a 
procurement 
plan 
in 
their 
proposals 
for 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
plan', 
and 
the amount 
of 
the transfer 
will 
be 
determined 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
such 
a 
plan. 
Since 
the 
beneficiary 
municipalities 
are 
not 
identified 
at 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
Project,  and 
its 
selection 
would 
depend 
upon 
the 
application 
of 
the 
selection 
criteria, 
there are 
no 
aggregate 
amounts 
for 
less 
competitive 
procedures 
to 
be 
used 
by 
the 
municipal 
implementing 
agencies. 
The 
procurement 
method 
pregzo 
(reverse 
auction) 
can be 
used 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
shopping 
of 
selected 
off-the-shelf 
items. 
The 
subprojects consist 
of 
the 
following 
actions: 
(a) 
rehabilitation 
of 
small 
facilities; 
(b) 
equipment 
for 
the 
small 
family  health 
facilities; 
(c) 
conversion 
of 
small 
hospitals 
into 
family 
health 
facilities; 
(d) 
administrative 
expenses, 
not 
exceeding 
Reais 
The 
Basic Care 
Expansion 
Plan 
is 
prepared 
by 
the 
Municipality 
under

the 
activities, 
goals, 
health 
targets, 
and 
details 
of 
the 
actions 
to 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Municipality.

Bank-Financed 
Consultant 
Services, 
Training 
and 
Associated 
Procedures. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
finance 
consultant 
services 
by 
firms 
and individuals 
and logistic 
support 
for 
training 
activities 
- 
most 
of them 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
micro-regions, 
including 
printing 
of 
materials. 
The 
activities 
include drafting 
manual, 
protocols, 
procedures, 
studies, 
research, base 
line 
studies, 
software 
development, 
technical 
support 
to 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
micro-regions,  technical and performance 
auditors,  independent 
procurement 
reviews 
under 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
subcomponent, 
and 
advisory 
services. 
This 
category 
includes 
support 
to 
EFTS, 
the 
secretariat 
technical 
school, 
for 
tutorials 
for 
family 
health 
professionals 
in 
an 
amount 
of 
US$250,000 
to 
be 
disbursed 
through

costs. 
The 
hiring 
of 
logistics 
services 
and 
support 
to 
the 
multiple 
training 
activities 
in 
the 
regulatory 
micro-regions 
may 
be 
spent 
by 
the 
DIRES 
using 
administrative 
procedures consistent 
with 
the 
national law, reviewed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
found 
acceptable, 
that 
include 
direct 
purchase, 
rental 
of 
equipment 
and 
facilities, payment 
of 
utilities, photocopying 
and 
printing, 
generally 
in 
service  orders 
in 
very  small 
amounts 
(US$3,000) 
in 
an 
aggregate 
amount 
not to

The 
project's 
selection 
and employment 
of 
consultants 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
under 
arrangements 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
(Table 
A2), 
using 
the 
Bank's 
Standard 
Forms 
and 
Contracts. 
Most 
of 
the 
project's 
studies, 
implementation 
supervision, 
financial 
and  procurement 
audits 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
following 
Quality and 
Cost-Based 
Selection 
(QCBS) 
methods, 
individual 
consultants; 
no 
other exceptional methods 
(other 
than 
for 
Technical 
Services described 
in 
Other Operational 
Costs 
(para. 
10 
below) 
were 
identified 
in 
the 
initial 
procurement plan. 
The 
aggregate 
amount 
for 
hiring 
individual 
consultants 
is 
established 
at 
US$2 
million.

The  Bank's 
procurement 
review 
is 
outlined 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement 
as 
per 
tables 
Al. 
and A.2 
above 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
Appendix 
1 
of 
the 
Guidelines 
for 
Procurement. 
In 
respect 
to 
the 
Sub-projects,

required 
under the 
participant Municipalities’ 
procurement 
plans 
are 
the 
same 
as 
in 
goods 
and works 
under 
the 
other 
project 
components; 
for 
consultant 
firms 
the 
prior 
review 
under 
the  sub-projects 
is 
above 
US$lOO,OOO. 
Individuals 
and 
Technical 
Services 
for 
which 
contracts 
are 
estimated 
to 
cost  above 
US$35,000  are subject 
to prior 
review. 
These 
prior 
review 
thresholds 
will 
be 
stated 
in 
the 
Operational 
Manual. 
The 
procurement 
documents 
for 
all 
ICB 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
Bank’s 
prior 
review, 
irrespective 
of 
the 
estimated 
amount 
of 
contract. 
9. 
With 
regard 
to 
consultant 
services, 
prior 
to 
issuance 
of 
any 
requests 
for 
proposal, 
a 
complete 
plan 
for 
selection 
of 
consultants 
under 
the 
project 
should 
be 
prepared 
by 
participant 
Municipalities 
in 
the sub-project 
proposal. 
The 
Bank’s 
review 
of 
selection 
of 
consultants 
will 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
Appendix 
1 
of 
the 
Guidelines 
for 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
and 
the 
provisions 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
Consultant  contract 
documents 
to 
be 
reviewed 
will 
include 
TORS, 
shortlists, 
evaluation 
reports, 
and contract forms. 
A 
review 
process 
similar 
to individual 
consultants, 
will 
apply 
to 
training and 
workshops. 
Since the 
beneficiary municipalities 
are 
not 
identified 
and 
its 
selection 
would 
depend 
upon 
the 
application 
of 
the 
selection criteria, 
there 
are 
no 
aggregate 
amounts 
for 
less 
competitive 
procedures 
to 
be 
used 
by 
the 
municipal implementing 
agencies. 
10. 
Incremental 
Operational 
Costs. 
Incremental 
operational 
costs 
refers 
to 
the 
management 
and 
supervision 
of 
the 
Project, 
including 
PCU 
staff, 
administrative 
expenditures 
for 
the 
PCU 
and 
for micro 
regional 
offices, 
supplies, 
communication 
services, 
office 
equipment 
and 
vehicles, 
as 
well 
as 
operation and 
maintenance 
of 
computing, 
medical 
and laboratory equipment 
(M 
1). 
It 
may 
include travel 
and 
subsistence 
expenses 
for 
SESAB’s 
staff. 
These services are 
estimated 
to 
cost 
US$2,300,000 
million 
equivalent, 
to 
be 
financed 
in 
accordance 
to 
bi-annual 
plans 
approved 
by 
the 
Bank. Identification 
of 
suppliers 
of 
sundry 
items 
and 
minor 
services 
will 
be 
made 
through market inquiries 
in 
the 
local 
market 
as 
in 
shopping. 
Once the 
suppliers 
are established, 
who 
will 
be 
generally 
the 
suppliers 
offering 
the 
lowest 
cost 
of 
lists 
of 
items, 
a 
purchase 
order 
will 
be 
issued 
using 
regular administrative 
procedures. 
The 
market inquiries 
will 
be 
updated 
periodically. 
The 
incremental 
costs 
also 
include 
the 
costs 
of 
technical 
services 
provided 
by 
medicals, 
pharmaceuticals, 
health workers 
and 
auditors at 
the 
micro-regional 
level 
in 
an 
amount 
of 
US$500,000 
hired 
through 
various 
modalities 
(NGOs, 
cooperatives, 
individuals, 
short 
term 
contracts, 
etc.) 
representing 
the 
amount 
needed 
for 
one 
year 
of 
project 
implementation; 
the 
following 
years, these 
services 
will 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
counterpart 
funds. 
11. 
Advertising. 
A 
General Procurement 
Notice 
for 
hiring 
of 
consultant 
services, 
and 
the 
ICB 
goods 
and 
consultants 
services 
should 
be 
published 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
Development 
Business, 
no 
later than 
August 
2003. 
The 
Notice 
will 
be 
updated 
Hnnually 
for 
outstanding consultant 
services 
and 
ICB 
goods. 
In 
addition, 
detailed 
consultant 
services 
and 
assignments 
will 
be 
advertised, 
as 
they become 
available, 
in 
at 
least 
one 
national 
newspaper 
of 
a 
large circulation. 
Furthermore, 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
may 
also 
advertise 
some 
of 
the 
project’s 
studies 
in 
an intemational 
newspaper 
or 
a 
technical 
magazine. 
The 
agencies 
may 
also 
seek 
“expressions 
of 
interest” 
by 
contacting 
embassies, 
professional 
organizations, 
or 
firms 
that 
it 
knows 
or 
that 
are 
registered 
in 
DACON 
(paragraph 
1.15 
of 
the 
Guidelines 
for 
Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants). 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
information 
required 
would 
be 
minimum, 
limited 
to make 
a 
judgment 
on 
the 
firm’s 
suitability. 
Sufficient 
time 
(not 
less 
than 
15 
days) 
will 
be

any 
other 
useful 
information. 
14. 
There 
is 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
(CPAR) 
for 
Brazil 
dated 
1993. 
A 
federal 
review 
is 
under way. 
The 
preliminary 
results 
of 
this 
review 
indicate that 
the 
judicial 
protests 
or 
recurso 
continue 
to 
be 
a 
major 
difficulty 
in 
the 
government  procurement. 
Another 
finding 
indicate 
that the 
use 
of 
pregtio 
and 
other 
modem 
procurement 
methods 
will 
add 
efficiency and 
transparency 
to 
the 
government 
procurement. 
The 
municipalities 
will 
be 
required 
to 
carry 
out 
procurement 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Guidelines 
and 
a 
Manual 
for 
the 
sub-projects 
component. 
There 
are 
plans 
in 
place 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
state 
procurement 
review 
in 
early 
2003. 
The 
findings 
of 
such 
a 
review 
may 
strengthen the 
proposed 
procurement 
arrangements, 
supervision and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
various 
components 
under 
the 
Project 
as 
they 
are 
implemented. 
The 
risk 
assessment, 
selection 
of 
thresholds 
for prior 
review, 
use 
of 
independent 
reviews 
and 
the 
supervision 
plan 
are 
justified 
in 
the agency's 
capacity 
assessment 
presented 
and approved 
to 
the 
RPA 
concurrently. 
Procurement  Risk 
Assessment. 
15. 
In 
early 
2002, 
a 
team 
of 
procurement 
staff 
of 
the 
Bank 
visited 
SESAB 
on 
a 
ex-post 
review 
under 
VIGISUS 
and 
AIDS 
I1 
projects; 
their 
findings 
point 
out 
difficulties 
in 
shopping. 
Some 
of 
the 
difficulties 
arise 
from 
the 
little 
or 
null 
procurement supervision 
given 
by 
the federal 
projects 
with 
many 
de-centralized 
implementing 
agencies 
that 
rarely 
receive  support 
from 
the 
PCU 
at the 
center. 
SESAB's 
risk 
was 
rated 
average 
provided 
that 
it 
implements 
the 
action 
plan 
in 
files. 
The 
main 
problems 
identified 
in 
the 
assessment 
include: 
(a) 
the 
procurement  team 
is 
not 
satisfactorily  staffed  and 
trained; 
(b) 
no 
technical 
staff  for 
preparing 
accurate 
technical 
specifications, 
and 
evaluating  technical 
part 
of 
proposals; 
(c) 
lack 
of 
substantial 
knowledge 
on 
the 
Bank's 
procurement 
procedures; 
(d) 
insufficient  Bank's 
official 
language 
skills; 
and 
(e) 
lack 
of 
information 
system 
that 
issues 
procurement 
reports. 
The 
plan 
to 
address 
such 
deficiencies 
includes 
(a) 
hiring 
procurement 
and 
technical 
experts 
for 
the 
team, 
preferably 
with 
foreign 
language 
skills; 
(b) 
promoting 
training 
(after  the 
procurement team 
is 
completed); 
and 
(c) 
preparing an 
Operational 
Manual 
in 
Portuguese 
language 
drafted 
pursuant 
to 
TOR 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank; 
and 
(d) 
adapting 
the 
existing 
Bahia 
Education 
infomation 
system 
to 
fulfill 
the 
procurement 
module 
requirement 
under 
the 
Project. 
The 
action 
plan 
was agreed 
during 
the 
negotiations. 
16. 
Independent Procurement 
Reviews. 
For 
investments 
under 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Subprojects, 
carried 
out 
through 
Termos 
de 
Compromisso, 
the 
PCU 
will 
provide 
the 
Bank, 
no 
later 
than 
six 
months 
after 
the 
end 
of 
each 
year, 
the 
reports 
of 
the 
independent 
procurement 
reviews 
audited 
by 
procurement 
experts, 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The reviews 
will 
made 
on 
sample 
basis 
and 
may 
include 
the 
small 
expenses 
by 
the 
DIRES. 
The 
terms 
of 
reference 
for 
the 
procurement 
reviews 
should 
be 
based 
on 
intemationally 
accepted 
standards. 
18. 
Frequency 
of 
procurement 
supervision  missions: 
The 
Bank 
will 
carry 
ex-post 
and 
supervision 
mission 
on 
procurement 
once 
a 
year. 
The 
supervision 
plan 
proposes 
a 
frequency 
of 
post-review 
missions 
as 
follows: 
one ex-post 
supervision 
each 
year 
during 
the 
project implementation 
plus 
one 
supervision 
within 
six 
months 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Sub-projects 
at 
the 
municipal 
level 
covering 
at 
least 
5 
municipal 
beneficiaries.

19. 
Use 
of 
SWAP-model 
in 
the 
subprojects. 
During 
the 
project 
preparation 
it 
was considered 
that 
the 
sub-project 
component 
may 
have 
certain 
characteristics 
of 
a 
SWAP 
model. However, 
there  was 
not 
sufficient 
experience 
and 
lessons 
learned  available 
from 
the 
Family Health 
Expansion program 
as 
to 
introduce the 
use 
of 
incentivos 
for 
the basic 
care 
and 
family 
health 
interventions 
in 
the 
proposed 
project 
from 
the 
on 
set. 
The 
Bank 
will 
consider 
introducing 
changes 
in 
the 
subprojects 
component 
once 
four 
conditions 
are 
fulfilled: 
(i) 
there 
is 
a 
positive 
experience 
with 
the 
SWAP 
arrangement 
in 
the 
FH 
project, 
(ii) 
there 
is 
a 
good 
implementation 
with 
the 
Bahia Health 
Project, 
(iii) 
the 
Bahia 
state 
level 
CFAA 
and 
State 
Procurement 
Review 
are 
completed; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
conditions 
for pooling 
resources are 
appropriate 
to 
allow 
for 
the 
use 
of 
the 
local 
procurement 
regulations, 
for 
the 
use 
of 
SOT 
type 
of 
disbursement; 
and 
to 
develop 
adequate 
remedies. 
B. 
Financial 
Management 
and 
Disbursement Arrangements 
20. 
County 
Issues. 
The 
Country Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
concluded 
that 
Brazil 
has a 
well 
developed and centralized 
system 
of 
public 
financial 
management. 
Overall 
it 
is 
able 
to reliably 
track 
budget 
expenditures. 
However 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
and 
processes 
are 
complex. 
While 
good 
results 
are 
achieved 
in 
terms 
of 
aggregate 
fiscal 
control, the government 
is 
less 
successful 
in 
achieving good 
expenditure 
prioritization 
and operational 
efficiency. 
The 
Brazilian 
system 
of 
public 
financial 
management 
yields  reliable 
information 
and 
adequate 
management 
and 
tracking 
of 
the  receipt 
and 
use 
of 
funds 
at 
national 
level, 
and 
is 
able 
to 
support 
Bank’s lending 
programs. 
2 
1. 
Strengths  and 
Weaknesses. 
Although 
SESAB 
has 
participated 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
several 
Federal projects 
and 
several 
of 
its 
staff 
has 
experience 
with 
Bank 
procedures, 
it 
has 
never been 
a 
Central 
Implementing 
Agency 
for 
Bank 
financed projects. 
This 
project 
is 
quite 
complex 
and 
it 
will 
demand 
a great 
deal 
of 
commitment 
from 
SESAB’s 
managers. 
An 
action 
plan 
was 
prepared 
based 
on 
the 
financial 
management 
assessment 
and 
SESAB 
has 
been 
working 
on 
the  actions 
agreed 
to 
develop 
the 
required 
management capacity. 
Additionally, 
there 
exists 
a 
home-grown 
initiative to 
strengthen 
FESBA 
(the 
Fundo 
Estadual 
de 
Salide), 
by 
improving 
its 
internal control 
mechanisms. 
22. 
Implementing Entity. 
The 
implementing 
entity 
of 
this 
project 
will 
be 
SESAB 
through 
its 
four 
SuperintendSncias 
and 
Diretorias 
Regionais. 
To 
implement 
this 
project 
SESAB 
will 
have 
to 
formally 
establish 
a 
Unidade 
de 
Gerenciamento 
de 
Projeto 
- 
UGP. 
Although 
SESAB 
has 
already been 
working 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
this 
UGP, 
the 
proposed  organizational 
structure 
will 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
following 
arrangement 
: 
The 
Unidade 
de Gerenciamento 
do 
Projeto 
(UGP) 
will 
carry 
out 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
project 
as 
whole, 
where 
the 
financial/administrative 
team 
will 
be 
located. 
There 
will 
be 
articulators 
working 
directly 
with 
the 
Superintendecies 
and 
DIRECs. 
The 
Diretorias 
Regionais 
- 
DIRECs 
will 
monitor 
the 
3 
1 
micro-regions, and 
SURAPS 
will 
monitor 
the 
participating municipalities 
under 
the 
basic 
care 
expansion 
component. 
The 
UGP 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
complying 
with 
the 
procurement 
and 
financial 
proceduresh-equirement agreed 
with 
the 
Bank. 
The 
UGP 
will 
hire 
financial 
and 
procurement 
specialists 
and 
other 
staff 
as 
per 
project implementation 
progresses 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
supervisory 
responsibilities 
and 
to 
assist 
the other 
implementing 
units. 
23. 
Staffing. 
SESAB 
will 
recruit 
a 
full 
time 
financial 
and administrative team 
with 
a 
manager 
and 
at 
least 
two 
financial 
management specialists 
(FMS) 
to 
be 
located 
at 
the 
PCU. 
The 
two 
FMSs 
will 
articulate 
with 
SURAPS 
and 
the 
Health 
Fund 
to 
monitor 
the 
Termo 
de Compromisso 
agreed 
with 
the 
participating 
Municipalities 
for 
the subprojects component. 
The 
financial and 
administrative 
manager 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
overall 
accounting 
and 
financial  activities related 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
TOR 
containing 
the 
job

of 
the 
financial  and 
administrative 
manager  has 
been

with 
SESAB, 
any

will 
be 
in 
place 
by 
three 
months 
after 
effectiveness.

25. 
Reporting and 
Monitoring. 
It 
has 
been 
agreed 
that the 
project 
will 
report 
in 
the 
format 
of 
FMRs 
Financial 
Management 
Reports, 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis 
as 
per models (Diretrizes para 
os 
Mutuhrios 
- 
OPCS 
Nov 
2001) 
that have been made available 
to 
the 
Project. 
The 
reports 
will 
be 
generated 
directly 
from 
the 
financial 
management 
information 
system 
which 
is 
already 
under development 
and 
will 
be 
up 
and 
running 
before project 
effectiveness. 
The 
FMRs 
will 
be 
considered 
as 
the 
annual 
Financial 
Statements 
of 
the 
Project 
to 
be certified 
by 
the 
Auditors. 
Although, 
it 
is 
an 
option 
for 
the 
client 
to 
choose 
the 
disbursement method, 
based 
on 
the 
risk 
analysis conclusion, 
it 
is 
not 
advisable 
at 
this 
time 
that 
disbursement 
be 
made 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
FMRs. 
26. 
Information 
System. 
SESAB 
is 
not 
equipped 
with 
good information 
systems 
which would 
allow 
speeding 
up 
information 
among 
the 
Superintendencies 
and 
FESBA 
which 
this 
project 
could 
benefit from. 
In 
this 
regard, 
SESAB 
has 
hired 
an 
IT 
firm 
to 
develop 
a 
financial,  procurement and 
monitoring 
systems 
to 
improve 
the 
flow 
of 
information. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
information 
system 
will 
consider 
that the 
flow 
of 
information 
will 
work 
through 
the  system 
which 
will 
have the 
Central 
Station located 
at the 
PCU, 
and 
working 
stations 
installed 
at  each 
of 
the 
participating 
Superintendencies 
and 
DIRES. 
Each 
of 
these 
Superintendencies 
and 
DIRES 
will 
feed the system 
with 
their 
respective 
working 
plans 
where they 
will 
be 
able 
to monitor 
project 
implementation. 
SURAPS 
(the 
Superintendency 
responsible 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Basic Care 
component) 
will 
also 
be 
linked 
to 
the system, 
The 
system 
will 
be 
extended 
to 
FESBA 
and 
procurement 
units 
so 
that 
they 
can 
also 
be 
involved 
in 
all 
phases 
of 
the 
processes 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project activities 
and easily 
detect 
any bottleneck 
during 
the 
implementation 
processes. 
Hardcopies 
of 
the 
documentation 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
from 
the 
executing 
agencies 
in 
the 
flow 
of 
information 
which 
will 
allow 
the 
PCU 
to 
validate the 
information. 
27. 
Supervision 
Plan. 
This 
project 
will 
need 
at least 
three supervisions 
missions 
during 
the 
first 
year. 
If 
after 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project 
implementation, 
the 
PSR 
rates 
are 
satisfactory, 
the 
frequency 
of 
supervision  missions 
should 
be 
reduced. 
Supervision 
missions 
will 
include 
a 
financial 
management 
specialist. 
PSRs 
will 
be 
updated 
after each 
mission. 
The 
major 
responsibility 
for 
procurement and 
financial 
management 
supervision 
and client 
assistance 
in 
these areas 
will 
be 
provided 
through 
the 
CMU 
Brasilia- 
based 
Implementation 
Team 
that 
is 
fully 
staffed 
to 
carry 
out 
these 
functions. 
28. 
Financial 
Covenants. 
The 
Project 
will 
have 
to 
(i) 
have 
in 
place 
financial 
management 
systems 
capable 
of 
generating 
records,  accounts 
and 
financial 
statements, 
the 
records 
and 
accounts 
for 
the Special 
Account 
for 
each 
fiscal 
year 
will 
58 
Page  59
be 
audited, 
in 
accordance 
with 
auditing 
standards 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank, consistently 
applied, 
by 
public 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank; 
furnish 
to 
the 
Bank 
as 
soon 
as 
available, 
but 
in 
any 
case 
not 
later than 
six 
months 
after 
the end 
of 
each such year: 
(A) 
certified 
copies 
of 
the 
financial 
statements 
audited; 
and 
(B) 
an 
opinion 
on 
such 
statements, 
records 
and 
accounts 
and report 
of 
such audit, 
by 
said 
auditors, 
of 
such 
scope 
and 
in 
such 
detail 
as 
the 
Bank 
shall 
have reasonably 
requested; 
and 
furnish 
to 
the 
Bank 
such other 
information 
conceming 
such records and 
accounts, 
and 
the 
audit, 
enable the 
Bank's  representatives 
to 
examine  such 
records; 
and 
ensure 
that 
such 
records 
and 
accounts 
are 
included 
in 
the 
annual 
audit. 
(iv) 
The 
package 
of 
FMRs 
referred 
to 
above, 
covering 
expenditures 
and 
disbursements, 
procurement and 
contracts, 
and 
information 
related to 
financial 
audits, 
will 
be 
up 
to 
date 
each 
quarter 
, 
and 
will 
be 
available 
to 
the 
Bank 
supervision 
team 
as 
needed. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
29. 
Accounting 
Policies 
and 
Procedures. 
FESBA 
reports 
directly 
to 
the 
Health 
Secretary 
and 
is 
the 
financial 
unit 
where 
all 
accounting and 
financial 
operations 
are 
practiced 
in 
SESAB, 
The 
conclusion 
is 
that 
FESBA 
is 
organized 
with 
experienced 
accounting 
staff 
and 
equipped 
with 
the 
minimum 
financial 
management 
control 
mechanisms. 
FESBA 
will 
benefit 
substantially 
from 
the 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
which 
consider 
basically 
the strengthening 
of 
the 
reporting 
information 
system 
and 
allocation 
of 
financial and 
administrative 
staff 
to respond 
to 
the projects 
needs. 
The 
budget 
financial 
execution 
occurs 
via 
the 
Integrated 
Financial 
And 
Accounting 
Systemn 
of 
Bahia 
(SICOF) 
when 
FESBA 
decentralizes 
the 
funds 
to 
the executing 
agencies (Superintendencies, 
DIRES, 
Hospitals 
and 
Reference 
Centers), 
so 
that 
these 
executing 
agencies 
can 
spend  the 
funds 
accordingly. 
The 
executing 
agencies 
of 
FESBA 
(e.g. 
Superintendencies, 
DES, 
Hospitals, 
Emergency 
Units 
and 
others) 
have 
the 
responsibility 
to 
account 
for 
the 
funds 
also 
via 
SICOF. 
The 
system 
complies 
with 
the 
Public 
Sector 
Budgetary 
Law, 
and 
has 
its 
structure 
based 
on 
a 
chart 
of 
accounts 
which 
allows 
FESBA 
to 
monitor 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
expenditures. 
FESBA 
keeps 
separate 
bank 
accounts 
for 
the 
sources 
of 
funds 
which 
are 
reconciled 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
and 
provide 
instructions 
to 
the 
executing 
agencies 
by 
informing 
them 
from 
which 
bank 
account 
they can 
spend 
the 
funds 
from. 
FESBA 
is 
establishing 
information 
system mechanisms 
to 
allow 
the 
executing 
agencies 
to 
access 
directly  their 
bank 
accounts. 
This 
system 
can 
generate 
accounting reports 
(e.g. 
trial 
balances, 
general 
ledger), 
however  financial 
reports 
are 
prepared 
in 
excel 
spreadsheets. 
The  information 
system 
under 
development 
for 
the 
project 
will 
have an 
accounting 
module 
to 
generate 
FMRs 
and 
other 
financial 
reports 
as 
per 
their 
needs. 
FESBA 
has 
designed 
the 
first 
draft 
of 
the chart 
of 
accounts 
reflecting 
the 
design 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
alternatives 
to 
interface 
with 
SICOF 
has 
been 
also 
considered.

The 
chart

proposed

of 
funds 
which 
identifies 
the 
key 
financial 
management 
control 
over 
the 
Bank's and 
Counterpart 
fund 
that 
will 
be 
exercised 
by 
SEFAZ 
(Secretaria 
de Fazenda) 
and 
FESBA. 
They 
are 
as 
follows 
: 
Two 
Special 
Accounts 
will 
be 
opened 
in 
Banco 
do Brasil 
- 
New 
York 
office 
by 
the 
Borrower 
which 
will 
receive 
the 
funds 
transferred 
from 
the 
Loan 
account. 
Two 
operational 
accounts 
in 
R$ 
will 
be 
established 
by 
FESBA. 
One 
to 
receive the 
Bank's 
funds 
transferred 
from 
the Special 
Account, 
and 
the other 
to 
receive 
counterpart 
funds 
directly 
from 
the  Treasury  Single Account, 
this 
will 
avoid 
funds 
being 
commingled. 
According 
to 
the 
Project 
financial 
needs, 
FESBA 
will 
withdraw 
fiom 
the 
Special 
Account to 
the 
operational 
account 
in 
Reais 
(R$) 
amount required 
to 
pay for 
the 
Bank's 
eligible 
expenditures 
portion. 
Based 
on 
the 
expenditures incurred, 
SESAB 
through 
the Project 
Implementation 
Unit 
will 
prepare 
the 
SOEs 
and 
will 
submit 
to 
the 
Bank  for 
replenishment 
of 
the 
Special 
Account. 
The 
transfer 
to 
the 
participating

will 
be 
against  the

actual  expenditures

Table

shows 
the 
allocations 
of 
the proceeds 
of 
the 
loan. 
The 
proceeds 
of 
the 
loan 
will 
be 
disbursed over 
a 
48 
month 
project life 
span, 
ending 
September 
2007. 
The 
annual estimated 
disbursements 
are 
indicated 
in 
Table 
C: 
Schedule 
of 
Disbursements. 
As 
per 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment, 
by 
effectiveness, 
the 
project 
will 
not 
be 
ready 
for 
report- 
based 
disbursements. 
Therefore, 
disbursements 
will 
be 
made 
using 
transaction-based 
mechanisms, ie. 
direct 
payments, 
special  commitments, 
reimbursement  and 
two 
special 
accounts. 
The 
expected 
Project 
Completion Date 
is 
March 
3 
1, 
2007. 
The 
loan 
closing 
date 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
September 
30,2007. 
Retroactive 
financing 
will 
be 
available 
for 
Goods 
and  Consultant 
Services, 
procured 
in 
a 
satisfactory 
fashion 
and 
paid 
after

2003 
(appraisal 
date) 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
10% 
of 
the 
loan. 
It 
is 
recommended 
that, once the 
loan 
is 
declared effective,  such expenditures 
be immediately claimed 
from 
the 
Bank, 
on 
a 
reimbursement 
basis.

Thus, 
all 
applications 
to 
withdraw 
proceeds 
from 
the

NCB 
for 
works 
and 
goods, 
regardless 
of 
the 
estimated 
cost, 
as 
well 
as 
procurement under 
the subprojects 
for 
individuals 
items 
exceeding 
the 
above  thresholds 
will 
also 
be 
subject 
to 
prior  review 
and 
full 
documentation. 
With 
regard 
to 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Subprojects, 
and 
taking 
into 
account that the 
project 
was 
rated 
"high 
risk" 
on 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment, 
disbursements 
will 
be 
made 
as 
follows: 
eligible 
subprojects, 
ie 
approved activities 
which 
fulfill 
the 
selection 
criteria 
as 
laid 
out 
in 
the Operational 
Manual, 
will 
be 
advanced 
a 
first 
tranche, 
from 
an 
Operational 
Account 
(Counterpart 
funds), 
the 
equivalent 
to 
up 
to 
3 
months 
of 
expenditures 
but 
no 
more than 
25% 
of 
the 
total 
subproject amount, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
disbursement 
plans. These 
funds 
will 
be 
deposited, 
in 
local 
currency, 
in 
a 
specific 
"Termo 
de 
Compromisso"/ 
subproject 
account, 
at 
the 
Municipal 
level. 
Upon 
documentation 
of 
the 
initial 
advance 
or 
first 
tranche 
by 
the 
municipalities, 
which 
will 
happen 
within 
3 
months, 
SESAB 
will 
consolidate 
SOEs 
andor 
Summary 
Sheets, 
as 
applicable, 
and 
(i) 
reimburse 
itself 
from

Account 
A 
(ii) 
claim 
replenishment 
of 
the 
Special 
Account 
A 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Funds 
will 
be 
withdrawn 
from 
the  Special 
Account 
A, 
for 
reimbursement 
of 
expenditures 
incurred 
and paid, 
with 
counterpart 
funds, 
fkom 
the 
Termo 
de 
Adesao/  subproject  account 
under 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Subproject 
category, 
will 
be 
documented 
with 
SOEs 
and/or 
Summary 
Sheets. 
In 
addition,  the 
adoption 
of 
performance indicators to 
ensure 
minimum 
physical 
and documental 
evidence 
of 
activities 
being 
carried  out 
is 
recommended. 
The 
Project  Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU), 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
municipalities, 
will 
keep 
track 
of 
expenditures 
to 
date 
and the 
bank 
balance 
for 
each 
"Termo 
de 
Compromisso". 
Special 
account 
and 
Counterpart 
funds 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
timely 
provision 
of 
funds 
available 
to 
finance the 
costs 
of 
the 
project, the Government 
will 
establish, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
project, 
two 
Special 
Accounts 
in 
US 
dollars 
, 
in 
a 
commercial 
bank 
under 
terms 
and conditions 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
One 
Special 
Account 
(Special 
Account 
A) 
will 
be 
exclusively 
for 
the 
Basic Care 
Expansion 
subprojects component, 
and, 
as 
previously 
said, 
funds 
will 
be 
drawn 
from 
the Special 
Account, 
as 
strictly 
needed, 
to 
reimburse the 
state 
for 
payments made 
for 
eligible 
expenditures 
under 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Subproject 
disbursement category. 
A 
Second Special 
Account 
(Special 
Account 
B) 
will 
be 
available 
for 
components other 
than Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Subprojects. 
Funds 
in 
an 
estimated amount equivalent 
to 
4 
months 
of 
the 
Bank's 
share 
of 
project 
expenditures 
will 
be 
deposited 
in 
each 
of 
the Special Accounts, 
of 
the 
credit 
as 
follows: The 
authorized 
allocation 
for 
Special 
Account 
A 
is 
US$1,500,000; 
however, 
this 
Special 
Account 
will 
be limited 
to 
US$750,000 
until 
cumulative 
disbursements 
under the Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Subprojects 
category reach 
US$1,500,000 
equivalent. 
The 
authorized 
allocation 
for 
Special 
Account 
B 
is 
US$1,500,000, 
which 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
US$750,000 
until 
cumulative 
disbursements 
for 
all 
other  categories 
reach 
US$2,000,000 
equivalent. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
submitting 
regular 
replenishment, 
preferably 
monthly, 
applications 
with 
appropriate 
supporting 
documents 
for 
the 
actual expenditures. 
Management 
of 
the 
funds 
will 
be 
guided 
by 
procedures 
detailed 
in 
the 
Operational 
Manual.

Counterpart 
Funds 
and 
Municipal "Termo

accounts: 
To 
agree 
on 
the 
FMR 
format 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
the 
timely 
provision 
of 
counterpart 
funds, 
the 
borrower 
will 
open 
and 
maintain, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
Operational Account 
exclusively 
for 
Bank 
funds, 
an 
Operational Account, 
in 
Reais, 
for 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia's 
share 
of 
expenditures. 
Given 
the 
decentralized  nature 
of 
the 
Basic 
Care 
Expansion 
Subprojects subcomponent, 
there 
is 
an equal need 
to 
decentralize disbursement procedures and 
financial 
management 
responsibilities 
to improve 
accountability. 
Therefore, 
municipalities 
will 
open and 
maintain 
new 
separate 
accounts, 
specifically 
for 
each 
"termo 
de 
compromisso", 
in 
commercial 
banks, 
in

the

Annex

: 
Indigenous 
Peoples Development Framework 
BRAZIL: 
Bahia Health System Reform Project 
Introduction 
The 
State 
of 
Bahia 
comprises 
417 
municipalities  out 
of 
which 
14 
include 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
clustered 
in 
12 
ethnic 
groups, 
numbering 
around 
13,000 
people. 
They 
are 
located 
in 
the 
north, 
west 
and 
south 
of 
the 
State. 
They 
represent 
a 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
the 
state 
total 
population 
(less 
than 
0.1%), 
though 
they 
rank 
among 
the 
poorest 
segments 
of 
this 
population. 
In 
1999, 
a 
subsystem 
within 
SUS 
for 
indigenous 
health 
was 
established 
by 
Law 
9836  and 
its 
regulations'. 
Law 
9836 
modified 
the 
1990 
Health Law, 
adding 
a 
new 
Chapter 
V 
within 
Title 
I1 
(SUS) 
of 
such 
Law 
to 
establish 
the 
subsystem". 
Law 
9836 includes 
in 
the 
health 
subsystem, 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
Federal 
Govemment, 
all 
actions 
and 
services 
for 
indigenous 
peoples 
health 
within 
the 
territory 
of 
Brazil.  The 
local 
and 
cultural 
specificity 
of 
the 
different 
indigenous 
groups 
need 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
Subsystem, 
in 
a 
comprehensive 
way 
that 
includes 
health, sanitation, 
nutrition, 
housing, 
environment, 
sanitary 
education, 
land 
demarcation 
and 
institutional 
integration' 
' 
. 
Indigenous health 
is 
a 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Federal Government, 
without 
prejudice 
to 
the 
actions 
arried 
out 
by 
States 
and 
Municipalities 
under 
SUS. 
The 
services 
so 
provided 
at 
the 
different 
levels 
of 
care 
must 
follow 
the directives 
set 
forth 
in 
Law 
9836 
and 
its 
regulations 
in 
Decree 
315612. 
At 
the 
federal 
level 
the 
agencies 
responsible 
are: 
0 
0 
MOH 
is 
to 
set 
the 
policies and 
directives 
for 
the 
promotion, 
prevention 
and 
recovery 
of 
the 
health 
of 
indigenous 
peoples. 
Fundacao 
Nacional 
de 
Saude 
- 
FUNASA, 
a 
health 
foundation 
with 
juridical 
personality 
linked 
to 
the 
MOH 
is 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
promotion 
and 
protection 
of 
indigenous 
health13. 
The 
State 
and 
Municipal 
Health 
Secretariats 
are 
required 
to 
act 
in 
a 
complementary 
manner 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
health 
services, 
in 
coordination 
with 
MOH/FUNASA. 
The 
Bank 
is 
currently 
supporting 
FUNASA 
through 
the 
VIGISUS 
project. 
The 
first 
phase 
of 
this 
APL 
has 
been 
extended 
until 
December 
2003, 
and 
phase 
2 
and 
3 
are 
currently 
under 
preparation. 
The 
Bahia Health 
project 
includes 
a 
component 
to 
finance 
municipal 
subprojects. 
As 
subprojects 
are 
demand 
driven, 
the 
PAD 
cannot 
determine 
ex-ante 
if 
Indigenous Groups 
will 
benefit 
from 
subprojects (or 
from 
this 
project). 
Instead, the 
PAD 
includes 
this 
framework 
that 
sets 
the 
process 
for 
the actions 
that 
would 
be 
required 
if 
a 
municipality 
with 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
is 
included 
under 
this 
component. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
that  whenever 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
of 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia

Background 
Information 
The 
VIGISUS 
project 
prepared 
an 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Plan Nation-wide 
which 
addressed: 
“(i)

A 
workshop 
took 
place 
in 
October 
1997 
that 
brought 
together representatives 
of 
indigenous 
groups 
and 
indigenous 
NGOs 
to 
launch 
the 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Plan 
and 
discuss 
further 
activities

The 
VIGISUS 
PAD 
describes: 
the 
alternative 
chosen 
(Le. 
a 
surveillance 
system 
at 
the 
national 
level, 
disease 
control 
in 
the 
Amazon 
region, 
and  indigenous 
health 
nationally) 
represents 
a 
compromise 
that 
is 
considered 
feasible 
and 
in 
line 
with 
the 
present 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
FNS, 
states, 
and 
municipalities, 
and 
that 
to 
be 
developed 
under 
the 
project. 
(VIGISUS 
PAD, 
p.

The 
Framework 
To 
design 
an 
indigenous 
health 
plan 
or 
enhancement 
from 
scratch 
or 
to place 
responsibility 
for 
indigenous 
health 
on 
a 
less-well 
equipped 
agency 
or institution 
in 
Bahia 
would 
likely 
skew 
or 
undermine 
the healthcare 
delivery 
design 
already 
in 
place and 
would 
not 
be 
an 
effective 
use 
of 
resources 
when 
something 
well-planned 
and thought 
out 
already 
exists. 
Bahia’s indigenous 
groups 
are 
being 
served 
by 
the 
national 
agencies 
who 
have 
the 
most 
current 
information 
and 
experience 
to 
meet 
their 
needs. 
Due 
to 
all 
of 
these 
considerations 
and 
consistent 
with 
OD 
4.20,  para. 
14h14, 
this 
project 
will 
financially 
support 
those 
municipalities 
with 
indigenous 
peoples that 
within 
the 
demand 
driven 
framework 
established 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
basic 
care 
are 
elected 
for 
receiving 
the 
benefits 
as 
described 
in 
the 
PAD 
(Annex 
2- 
Component 
111). 
This 
support 
will 
finance  the 
consultation 
process 
require 
by 
OD 
4.20 
as 
well 
as 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
IPDPs 
and 
their 
implementation. 
This 
support 
will 
ensure 
that 
these 
incremental 
costs 
do 
not 
act 
as 
disincentives 
which 
could 
end 
up 
promoting 
social exclusion 
in 
municipalities 
that 
have Indigenous 
Peoples 
among 
their 
inhabitants. 
Institutional 
Arrangements 
Since 
FUNASA 
is 
the 
federal 
agency 
that 
has 
the 
mandate 
to provide 
primary 
care 
to 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
the 
operational 
manual 
will 
state 
that 
those 
municipalities 
with 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
that 
l4 
“14(h) 
Where effective programs 
are 
already 
functioning, 
Bank 
support 
can 
take 
the 
form 
of 
incremental 
funding 
to 
strengthen 
them 
rather 
than 
the development 
of 
entirely 
new 
programs.”

become beneficiaries 
of 
this 
project 
establish 
all 
necessary 
institutional 
arrangements 
to 
ensure 
the 
active 
participation 
of 
FUNASA 
in 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
IPDPs 
and 
the 
consultation 
process 
with 
the 
Indigenous 
Groups 
involved. 
Approval 
of 
subprojects 
for 
the 
14 
municipalities 
with 
IP 
will 
be 
conditioned to 
the 
appropriate 
preparation 
of 
IPDPs, 
when 
needed, 
and 
to 
consultations 
with 
FUNASA 
and 
will 
require 
the 
Bank's non-objection. 
The 
IPDPs 
The 
following 
prerequisites 
need 
to 
be 
met 
before 
an 
IPDP 
is 
prepared and 
implemented: 
1. 
The 
institutions 
responsible 
for 
government 
interaction 
with 
indigenous 
peoples 
should 
possess 
the 
social,  technical, 
and 
legal 
skills 
needed 
for  carrying 
out 
the 
proposed  development 
activities. 
Implementation 
arrangements 
should 
be 
kept 
simple. 
They 
should 
normally involve 
appropriate 
existing 
institutions, 
local 
organizations, 
and 
nongovernmental 
organizations 
(NGOs) 
with 
expertise 
in 
matters 
relating 
to 
indigenous 
peoples. 
2. 
Local 
patterns 
of 
social 
organization, 
religious 
beliefs, 
and 
resource 
use 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
plan's 
design. 
3. 
The 
plan 
should 
avoid 
creating 
or 
aggravating 
the 
dependency 
of 
indigenous people 
on 
project 
entities. 
Planning 
should 
encourage 
early 
handover 
of 
project 
management 
to  local 
people 
whenever 
feasible. 
As 
needed, 
the 
plan 
should 
include 
general  education  and 
training 
in 
management 
skills 
for 
indigenous people 
from 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Plans 
that 
would 
need 
to 
be 
prepared 
if 
a 
municipality 
with 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
is 
elected 
for 
Component 
I11 
(Basic Care 
Expansion 
Subprojects) 
will 
include 
the 
following 
elements 
as 
needed: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Institutional 
Capacity. 
The 
government 
institutions 
assigned 
responsibility 
for 
indigenous 
peoples 
are 
often 
weak. 
Assessing the 
track 
record, capabilities, 
and 
needs 
of 
those 
institutions 
is 
a fundamental 
requirement. 
Organizational 
issues 
that 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
through 
Bank 
assistance 
are 
the 
(i) 
availability 
of 
funds 
for 
investments 
and 
field 
operations; 
(ii) 
adequacy 
of 
experienced 
professional 
staff; 
(iii) 
ability 
of 
indigenous  peoples' 
own 
organizations, 
local 
administration 
authorities, 
and 
local 
NGOs 
to 
interact 
with 
specialized government institutions; 
(iv) 
ability 
of 
the 
executing 
agency 
to 
mobilize 
other 
agencies 
involved 
in 
the  plan's 
implementation; 
and 
(v) 
adequacy 
of 
field 
presence. 
Implementation 
Schedule. 
An 
implementation 
schedule 
with 
benchmarks 
by 
which 
progress 
can 
be 
measured 
at 
appropriate 
intervals. 
Pilot 
programs 
are 
often 
needed 
to provide 
planning 
information 
for 
phasing 
the 
project 
component 
for 
indigenous 
peoples 
with 
the 
main 
investment. 
The 
plan 
should 
pursue 
the 
long-term 
sustainability 
of 
project 
activities 
subsequent 
to 
completion 
of 
disbursement. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation. 
Independent 
monitoring 
capacities 
are 
usually 
needed 
when 
the 
institutions 
responsible 
for 
indigenous 
peoples 
have weak 
management histories. 
Monitoring 
by 
representatives 
of 
indigenous 
peoples' 
own 
organizations 
can 
be 
an 
efficient 
way 
for 
the 
project 
management 
to 
absorb 
the 
perspectives 
of 
indigenous beneficiaries and 
is 
encouraged 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Monitoring 
units 
should 
be 
staffed 
by 
experienced 
social 
science 
professionals, 
and 
reporting 
formats 
and 
schedules 
appropriate 
to 
the 
project's 
needs 
should 
be 
established. 
Monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
reports 
should 
be 
reviewed 
jointly 
by 
the senior management 
of 
the 
implementing 
agency 
or 
agencies 
and 
by 
the 
Bank. 
The 
evaluation reports should 
be 
made 
available 
to 
the 
public. 
78 
Page  79
4. 
Cost 
Estimates 
and 
Financing  Plan. 
The 
plan 
should 
include 
detailed 
cost 
estimates 
for 
planned 
activities and 
investments. 
The 
estimates 
should 
be 
broken 
down 
into 
unit 
costs 
by 
project 
year 
and 
linked 
to 
a 
financing 
plan. 
Whenever 
an 
IPDP 
is 
prepared, 
it 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
for 
review 
and 
clearance together 
with 
the 
institutional 
agreements 
entered 
into for 
implementation 
of 
such 
IPDP. 
The 
approved 
IPDP 
and 
related 
agreements 
will 
be 
complied 
with 
by 
the 
agencies 
identified 
for 
implementation 
(FUNASA/State/Municipality 
as 
applicable) 
in 
accordance 
with 
their 
terms 
and 
will 
include 
clear 
benchmarks that 
can 
be 
monitored 
during 
supervision. 
No 
disbursements 
will 
be 
made 
from 
Loan 
proceeds 
allocated 
for 
Subprojects 
in 
a 
Municipality 
with 
Indigenous 
Peoples, 
unless  the 
IPDP/agreements 
are 
approved 
by 
the 
Bank. 
The 
borrower’s 
commitments 
for 
implementing 
the indigenous 
peoples 
development 
plan 
should 
be 
reflected 
in 
the 
loan 
documents; 
legal  provisions  should 
provide 
Bank 
staff 
with 
clear 
benchmarks that 
can 
be 
monitored 
during 
supervision.

OF 
BAHIA 
- 
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT 
PLAN 
Summary 
VISION 
STATEMENT 
BAHIA: 
A 
SOCIALLY 
JUST 
AND 
COHESIVE SOCIETY 
It 
is 
imperative 
to 
build 
a 
society that 
is 
capable 
of 
ascertaining 
the 
full 
rights 
of 
citizenship, 
including 
ample 
access 
to 
quality 
basic 
services 
and 
equipment 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
education, 
health, 
housing,  sanitation  and 
public 
safety, 
as 
well 
as 
information, 
culture,  sports 
and 
leisure. 
The 
strategy 
aims 
at 
improving 
income 
distribution 
coupled 
with 
a 
reduction 
in 
poverty 
and 
social 
exclusion 
indices. 
In 
a 
scenario 
of 
increasing alienation 
of 
part 
of 
the 
global 
society 
from 
the 
development 
process, 
it 
is 
crucial 
that 
Bahia 
set 
goals 
for 
reducing 
inequalities 
at 
the 
state 
level 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
social 
cohesion. 
BAHIA: 
A 
DIVERSIFIED 
AND 
COMPETITIVE 
ECONOMY 
The 
increasing 
competition 
among 
firms 
requires 
incentive  policies 
focused 
on 
a 
better 
harmonization 
of 
production 
chains, 
including 
improvements 
in 
technology 
and 
labor 
skills, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
production 
costs 
of 
intermediary 
goods 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
inter- 
sectoral 
links 
by 
deepening and 
vertical integration 
of 
the 
existing production 
chains. 
In 
addition, 
it 
should 
be 
possible 
to 
innovate 
and develop 
a 
knowledge 
and 
infrastructure 
network 
that 
would 
reinforce 
the 
dynamic 
competitiveness 
of 
Bahia’s 
economy. 
It 
is 
envisioned 
that 
small 
and 
medium 
enterprises 
will 
become 
more 
competitive, 
generating 
new 
job 
opportunities and fostering 
the 
development 
of 
a 
network 
of 
intersectoral 
relations. 
BAHIA: 
A 
SPATIALY 
INTEGRATED 
SOCIETY 
The 
spatial integration 
of 
the society 
and 
the 
state 
economy 
is 
key 
for 
keeping 
it 
united. 
Given 
that 
the 
Salvador 
Metropolitan Region 
has 
already 
consolidated 
its 
position, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
pursue 
a 
deconcentration 
of 
economic 
activities. 
This 
implies 
the 
availability 
of 
an 
adequate 
level 
of 
infrastructure  and 
logistics 
for 
the 
different 
regions 
within 
the 
state 
and 
the 
position 
of 
these 
regions 
vis-a-vis 
the 
national 
and 
intemational 
trade 
flows. 
Medium 
size 
cities 
that 
are 
strategically important should 
be 
strengthened 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
serve 
the 
integration 
function for 
the 
regional 
economy 
by 
providing 
a 
more 
sophisticated 
set 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
including 
public 
services. 
The 
integration 
of 
dynamic 
areas 
located 
near the 
perimeter 
of 
the 
state’s 
territory 
is 
key 
for 
addressing 
the development 
of 
the 
semi-arid 
region 
that 
is 
located 
in 
the 
central 
part 
of 
the 
state. 
The 
integration 
process 
would 
simultaneously 
create 
agglomeration 
economies 
and 
population 
densities 
that 
would 
more efficiently 
support 
the 
production 
and 
trade 
of 
goods 
and 
services. 
80 
Page  81
BAHIA: 
AN 
ENVIRONMENTALLY 
CLEAN 
STATE 
It 
is 
important 
that  a 
new 
environmental 
consciousness 
applied 
to 
business 
and 
public 
decision 
making 
processes 
be 
promoted 
that 
makes 
the 
appropriate 
use 
of 
natural 
resources 
for 
economic 
growth 
while 
minimizing 
the 
risks 
of 
environmental 
degradation. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
future 
generations, 
Bahia 
has 
to 
embrace sustainable 
development 
model 
that 
is 
based 
on 
harmonious, 
socially 
just 
and 
environmentally 
sound 
growth. 
Modem 
society 
increasingly 
demands 
a 
new 
balance 
between 
human 
activities 
and the 
environment, 
with 
natural 
resources 
and cultural, artistic 
and 
architectural 
heritage 
becoming 
progressively 
more 
important. 
Consumers  themselves 
are 
demanding 
goods 
and 
services 
that 
are 
produced 
by 
environmentally 
clean 
processes 
and socially 
responsible 
companies. 
It 
is 
envisioned 
that 
technological 
progress 
will 
accompany  a 
greater 
conservation 
of 
the 
natural 
and 
cultural 
environment, 
making 
it 
possible 
to 
arrive 
at 
an 
intervention 
model 
that 
will 
help 
to 
preserve, 
recover, 
and 
make 
a 
rational 
and 
sustainable 
use 
of 
natural 
resources. 
It 
is 
also 
envisioned 
that 
instruments 
will 
be 
available 
for 
a 
more 
adequate 
management 
of 
environmental 
issues, 
especially 
those 
conceming 
water 
resources.

Dear 
Mr. 
De 
Ferranti: 
Re. 
: 
Proposed 
Bahia 
Health 
System Reform 
Project 
I 
am 
writing 
to 
confirm 
that 
the 
proposed 
Bahia Health 
System 
Reform 
Project 
is 
an integral 
part 
of 
the 
Strategic 
Development 
Plan for 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia, 
a 
summary 
of 
which 
is 
attached 
for 
information. 
While 
the 
Plan 
focuses 
on 
human 
development  and 
competitiveness, 
it 
aims 
at 
increasing Bahia’s 
Human 
Development 
Index 
(HDI-M) 
above 
the 
national 
average 
by 
the 
year 
2020. 
Hence, 
the above-referenced project, 
through 
its 
objectives 
of 
improving 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
basic 
health 
services, 
the 
distribution 
of 
public 
services 
and 
the 
efficiency 
and 
quality 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
is 
fully 
consistent 
with 
Bahia’s 
Strategic 
Development 
Plan 
I 
take 
this 
opportunity 
to 
convey 
to 
you 
my 
most 
sincere 
regards.

Letter 
dated January 
22, 
2003 
Mr. 
Vice 
President: 
I 
have 
the 
honor 
of 
sending 
you 
this 
letter 
outlining 
the 
policies 
relating to 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
Health 
System 
in 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia. 
The 
Secretariat 
of 
Health 
of 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia 
acts 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
basic 
legislation 
of 
the 
Sistema 
Unico 
de  Saude 
- 
SUS 
(Laws 
nos.  8.080/90 
and 
8.142/90, 
Decrees nos. 
99.438/90, 
NOBi96, 
NOAS 
2001/2002 and 
E.C. 
29/2000), 
formulating 
and 
carrying 
out 
the 
state 
health 
policy 
with 
the  objective 
of 
guaranteeing 
efficient 
and 
equitable 
universal 
access 
to 
services. 
For 
this, 
the 
following 
policy 
guidelines 
are 
proposed: 
0 
Policy-management 
reform 
of 
the 
Secretariat 
of 
Health 
of 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia 
- 
SESAB, 
through 
the 
modemization 
of 
its 
structure 
and 
work 
processes; 
89 
Page  90
0 
Regionalization 
in 
terms 
of 
quantitative-qualitative  expansion 
of 
access 
to 
basic 
health 
services 
and 
procedures 
of 
medium 
and 
high 
complexity, 
promoting 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
resources 
in 
the 
sector 
and 
an 
equitable 
distribution 
between 
regions 
in 
the 
state, 
creating 
conditions 
for 
balancing 
the 
relation 
between 
supply 
and 
demand 
for 
health 
services, 
which 
would 
permit 
an 
effective 
organization 
of 
assistance 
provided, 
including 
correcting 
processes 
that 
lead 
to 
a 
fragmentation 
of 
services, 
loss 
of 
scale, 
weakening 
of 
central 
structures, 
inequities 
and 
inefficiencies; 
0 
Decentralization 
of 
health 
care 
actions and 
services, 
with 
integration 
between 
the 
municipal, 
state 
and 
federal 
spheres 
of 
the 
Sistema 
Unico 
de 
Saude 
- 
SUS 
and 
the 
consequent 
redefinition 
of 
functions and 
responsibilities 
of 
SESAB, 
principally 
for 
the 
technical cooperation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
Municipal Health 
systems; 
0 
Reverting 
to 
a service 
model, 
through 
the 
reorganization 
of 
health 
assistance, 
based 
on 
the 
establishment 
and 
strengthening 
of 
a 
high 
quality 
level 
of 
universal 
primary 
attention, 
which 
should 
be 
responsive 
to 
more 
than 
85% 
of 
the 
population’s health 
problems, 
leading 
to, 
as 
a result, a 
reduction 
in 
the demand 
for 
higher 
cost, 
higher 
complexity 
procedures. 
It 
is 
proposed 
that 
an 
efficient 
strategy 
be 
adopted 
to 
fulfill 
this 
objective, 
based 
on 
intemational 
experience 
- 
that 
has 
already 
been 
tested 
in 
Bahia 
- 
based 
on 
the performance 
of 
teams 
from 
the 
Family 
Health 
Program, 
with 
the 
consequent 
strengthening 
of 
basic 
health 
services; 
0 
Strengthening 
the 
regulation 
function, 
allowing 
SESAB 
to 
redefine 
its 
role 
as 
regulator, 
emphasizing 
the 
improvement 
in 
quality 
and 
access 
to 
health 
services; 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Regulation 
entity 
that, 
based 
on 
experience, 
would 
lead 
to 
health 
changes 
in 
medical 
practices 
(defining 
and 
making 
public 
above 
all 
the 
guidelines 
for 
establishing 
priorities), 
which 
should  contribute  greatly 
to 
an 
expected 
reduction 
in 
avoidable 
expenses, 
through 
the 
decrease 
in 
unnecessary 
hospitalizations, 
tests 
and 
treatments; 
0 
Incentives 
to 
the 
social 
monitoring 
of 
the 
health 
system, 
through training 
of 
various 
social groups 
and 
the 
consolidation 
of 
groups 
defined 
in 
national 
legislation, 
such 
as 
the 
Health 
Conferences 
and 
Health 
Councils; 
These 
efforts  to  redirect 
the 
health 
care 
model, 
by 
focusing 
on 
promotional 
activities 
and 
preventive 
actions, 
without 
neglecting  curative 
health 
services 
and 
the 
improvements 
in 
the 
managerial 
framework 
and 
capacity, 
can 
be 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
a 
reduction 
in 
infant 
mortality 
from 
41.5 
per 
thousand 
live 
births 
in 
2003 
to 
37.7 
in 
2006 
and 
37.5 
in 
2009, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
10% 
yearly reduction 
in 
moderate and 
severe 
malnutrition 
of 
children 
5 
and 
under 
attended 
by 
SISVAN. 
In 
its 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation, 
the 
State 
aims 
to 
evaluate 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
under 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health’s 
Indicators 
for 
Basic 
Health 
Services, 
selecting 
10 
indicators 
from 
within 
this 
framework, 
to 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
project interventions 
on 
basic 
health 
services 
in 
Bahia. 
90 
Page  91
In 
this 
respect, 
the 
State 
Government 
will 
make 
its 
utmost 
to 
accomplish 
the 
goals 
mentioned below, 
over 
the 
next 
four 
years, 
in 
tandem 
with 
advances 
in 
the 
regionalization 
and 
reorganization 
of 
the 
health 
care 
model 
through 
the 
strengthening 
of 
Basic 
Health 
Services 
: 
9 
Increase 
in 
the 
10 
basic 
health 
indicators 
selected; 
9 
Establishment 
of 
5 
microregions, organized 
according 
to 
health 
assistance services, 
health 
surveillance 
and 
management. 
P 
No 
state 
hospitals 
with 
less 
than 
50 
beds 
under 
the 
direct administration 
of 
SESAB; 
9 
Compliance 
by 
SESAB 
of 
actions 
proposed 
in 
the 
Work 
Plan for 
the 
Municipality 
of 
Salvador’s 
qualification 
for 
in 
Gestao 
Plena 
do 
Sistema 
Municipal; 
9 
Reduction 
by 
10% 
in 
the 
concentration 
of 
state  resources 
between 
the 
capital 
(Salvador) 
and 
other 
regions; 
9 
Programming 
for 
per 
capita 
distribution 
of 
federal 
resources 
and 
financial allocation 
based 
on 
the 
programming 
agreed 
with 
the 
municipalities; 
9 
Establishment 
of 
a 
system 
for 
regulation 
(Central 
de 
Regulacao) 
for 
high 
complexity 
procedures. 
I 
emphasize the 
important 
accomplishments 
made 
by 
the 
state 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
over 
the last 
years, 
recognizing 
that several 
adjustment that 
allow 
the 
consolidation 
of 
a 
decentralized,  integrated, 
and equitable 
system, 
principally 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
organization 
of 
services 
and 
the 
health indicators 
of 
the 
population, 
are 
still 
necessary. 
To 
consolidate 
its 
responsibility 
of 
conductor 
and regulator 
of 
Health Policy 
in 
the 
State, 
the 
State 
counts 
on 
the 
support 
of 
the 
IBRD, 
to 
facilitate 
financing 
of 
the 
STATE 
OF 
INEQUALITIES, 
which 
has 
as 
its 
main 
objectives 
to 
eliminate 
deficiencies 
in 
health 
services 
in 
critical 
areas 
in 
the 
State 
of 
Bahia 
and 
increase 
the 
overall efficiency 
on 
the 
Sistema 
Unico 
de 
Saude 
(SUS), 
making 
it 
fully 
operational, 
to 
carry out 
the 
legal 
mandate 
of 
universality, 
integrity 
and 
equity 
in 
the 
access 
to 
health 
services 
and 
resources.
