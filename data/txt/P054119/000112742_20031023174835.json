Although the project does not have a direct\n            impact on the environment, the implementation of health\n            services and the generation of medical wastes as these\n            health centers provide better services, might have a direct\n            connotation with environmental implications.  The final\n            disposition of medical and solid waste may impact\n            surrounding natural resources and could generate negative\n            effects.  Negative effects of the Project are related to\n            construction; operation and maintenance of health centers,\n            particularly in municipalities with limited resource to\n            implement proper management; and final disposal of medical\n            wastes.  The major mitigation measures proposed include\n            implementation of existing environmental assessment and\n            licensing of health centers; mandatory preparation of\n            medical waste plans; technical assistance for solid waste\n            management plans; incentives for proper solid waste\n            management plans; implementation of environmental criteria\n            in the audit of health services, construction, and\n            supervision of infrastructure; and implementation of basic\n            sanitation information."}, "docdt": "2002-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
