national\n            policy of health care decentralization seeking to improve\n            access of the poor to Basic Health Care, with improved\n            coverage and quality of those health interventions with\n            greatest influence over child mortality, maternal mortality,\n            and the incidence of diseases prevalent among the poor,\n            reduce inequities in the allocation of publicly funded\n            health care services, and, improve efficiency andquality in\n            the use of public resources, Project components will : 1)\n            strengthen the management, and governance of micro-regions,\n            by enhancing the role of the micro-region as a purchaser of\n            health care services. Technical assistance (TA) will be\n            supported, for the deployment of performance based contracts\n            between the micro-regions and their local providers,\n            including TA, works, and equipment for the implementation of\n            Regulation Centers. Furthermore, training, and TA will be\n            provided for the adaptation of a unified health system card\n            technology. The capacity of micro-regions will be\n            strengthened in the conduct of clinical, environmental and\n            financial audits, and to initiate as well, a process of\n            accreditation, and, TA would support the preparation of\n            Medical Waste Plans in health care facilities; 2) conduct\n            and analyze health, demographic and social household surveys\n            to provide a baseline for the project, and, support\n            monitoring and evaluation requirements Likewise, policy\n            studies will support implementation of payment systems\n            reforms, and improvements in environmental management of\n            medical waste. This component will finance technical\n            assistance, and training for the introduction of performance\n            contracting, the deployment of a Regulation Center for High\n            Complexity Care at the state level, the strengthening of\n            audit functions, and, accreditation of health care\n            providers; and, 3) expand basic care, by strengthening the\n            Pacto de Atencao Basica, i.e., Understanding on Basic Health\n            Care provision. This sub-component will strengthen the\n            state's role in planning, negotiating, monitoring and\n            evaluating the \"Pacto\" through technical\n            assistance, training, and equipment supply for the\n            implementation of a state-level system of planning municipal\n            targets, and, development of a system of consistency checks\n            between the various databases pertaining to basic care."}, "docdt": "2003-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
