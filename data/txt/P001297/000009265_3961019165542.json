   Report (ICR) for the National Agricultural Research Project\n            in Kenya. The main objectives were to: (i) focus on priority\n            research programs with a significant likelihood of high and\n            early returns to investment; (ii) develop technologies hat\n            contribute to increased productivity, particularly of\n            smallholdings; (iii) intensify producer participation in\n            research program formulation; and (iv) strengthen linkages\n            between research and other agricultural services such as\n            extension, as well as between the new agricultural research\n            establishment and other institutions involved in\n            agricultural research. Bank and borrower's performance\n            were satisfactory. The main lessons learned from\n            implementation include: (a) While it is important to\n            identify up-front the longer-term national Program\n            objectives, it is also necessary to design and manage the\n            time-slice interventions as phased process projects, with\n            specific immediate objectives (as subsets of the program\n            goals), achievable over a shorter initial time horizon; (b)\n            In a country as diverse as Kenya, prioritization of\n            commodities and factors of production is useful if\n            undertaken within a broad agro-climatic framework and after\n            prioritization of therelative importance of each major\n            production zone; (c) A farming system approach is useful\n            (perhaps essential) in promoting research/extension liaison\n            and ensuring relevance in research, where there is high\n            variability in resource base and population pressure; (d)\n            Staff rationalization and retrenchment is extremely\n            difficult in countries where public sector employment is\n            used as a means of social security. (e) A clear memorandum\n            of understanding between the agencies responsible for\n            research and extension, with arrangements for provision of\n            funds by the recipient extension agency directly to the\n            Regional Research Centres' (RRCs) for joint activities,\n            can lead to good cooperation and a successful outcome; and\n            (f) Multi-donor projects need strong coordination from one\n            source within the Government."}, "docdt": "1995-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
