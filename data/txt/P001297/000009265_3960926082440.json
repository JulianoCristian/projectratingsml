Institute (KARI) organization and management, including\n            establishment costs, construction of a headquarters\n            building, training and external expert assistance for\n            research planning and management, budgeting and information\n            systems; (ii) rehabilitation and provision of equipment and\n            operating funds to Regional Research Centers and (iii)\n            support to key national crop, livestock, factor and\n            disciplinary research programs.  IDA seeks to provide\n            funding for incremental non-salary operating costs,\n            vehicles, equipment, civil works, the research information\n            and reporting system, and some training and consultancy\n            services.
