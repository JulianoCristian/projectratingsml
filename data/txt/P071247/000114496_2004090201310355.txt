General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of SDR 800,000.
2.

(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the

Association, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Association: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Association may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, 
if the Association shall so request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount of 
such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Association shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association into the Special Account shall be made

be.
