Lessons learned included: the\n            working relationship between the Bank and the implementing\n            agency seems to have been severely strained at times and any\n            future projects would need to be accompanied by strong\n            efforts to rebuild mutual trust at leadership level. The\n            project was also destabilized by the turnover in key\n            personnel within the project management unit and at the\n            Bank. The project was aligned with and supported declared\n            government reform objectives at the time of appraisal.\n            However, the appraisal team misjudged the government's\n            commitment to implement the reforms advocated by the Bank.\n            The Bank should have had a better understanding of the\n            government reform agenda as outlined in the Strategy to\n            rationalize the civil service (2001) and the National\n            Program for Administrative Reform (2000 and 2004). There is\n            now, by several accounts, a limited need to increase the\n            supply of generic training opportunities for the public\n            sector. Where training support is considered necessary, a\n            better strategy for the future would be to focus efforts on\n            the specific job requirements in individual ministries and\n            reform processes. Additionally, there is the potential for\n            Council for Administrative Reform (CAR) to develop its role\n            as a coordinator of civil service training. In the case of\n            this project, compliance with Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E), particularly progress reporting, needed to be of\n            a higher standard. An operational project advisory board and\n            a better functioning reporting system may have identified\n            emerging problems and led to adjustments to the project at\n            an earlier stage."}, "docdt": "2008-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
