secessionist\n            crisis, and will address immediate social needs in the\n            Comoros, particularly on the island of Anjouan. Priority\n            expenditures in the emergency program, will support the\n            creation of decentralized institutions, and the\n            implementation of the national reconciliation agreement. The\n            project aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability, and\n            addressing urgent social needs, by financing imports,\n            including petroleum, agricultural equipment, construction\n            materials, and capital goods, while, foreign exchange will\n            be provided to finance increased import requirements arising\n            from the spending, generated by the economic recovery\n            program. The program will target urgent public expenditures\n            needed to alleviate poverty, and support the process of\n            national reconciliation. Nonetheless, risks include a) the\n            possibility that the national reconciliation process, could\n            stall, or be reversed, though careful monitoring of the\n            process, and the strong support by stakeholders, development\n            partners, and international mediators has been confirmed,\n            and, b) the Government's weak capacity to sustain\n            economic recovery efforts, but technical assistance\n            provision in expenditure management will mitigate this risk."}, "docdt": "2001-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
