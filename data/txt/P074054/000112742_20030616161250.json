CIVIL SERVICE REFORM", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Emergency Economic Recovery Credit\n            (EERC) for the Comoros had a satisfactory outcome, unlikely\n            sustainability, moderate institutional development impact,\n            and satisfactory performance by both Bank and Borrower.  The\n            EERC was designed as a one-off operation, and no follow-up\n            of this type is planned.  The major factor affecting\n            implementation was ongoing political instability and\n            disagreements between the central and island governments.\n            Lessons learned concerning the ICR process: 1. The standard\n            ICR format may not be best suited to an emergency project.\n            2. In the changeable context, the process of generating and\n            drafting the ICR has been as valuable as the final report.\n            Lessons for Comoros: 1. There remains no shared\n            understanding of what the political transition out of the\n            crisis and national reconciliation mean in practice.  2.\n            Service delivery and infrastructure investments can be\n            carried out effectively if the credit implementation and\n            governance meet the highest level of standards. 3. Improved\n            communications between development agents on the different\n            islands of the country are needed.  Lessons for the Bank: 1)\n            This kind of credit involves a number of trade-offs,\n            promising high gain but is entered at high risk. 2) The\n            relationship between the Bank's operations and the\n            Bank's country strategy needs to be continuously\n            monitored and evaluated. 3) An instrument is needed allowing\n            rapid and flexible disbursement of funds, while maintaining\n            some control over the way the funds are spent.  4) Where a\n            credit is linked to an emergency recovery program, it is\n            important that it is made explicit how and to what extent\n            the activities are expected to contribute to the overall\n            objective and that suitable indicators and procedures are\n            defined. 5) A complex and flexible project carried out in a\n            volatile political environment requires regular supervision\n            and attention, coming at a heavy price in variable costs to\n            the Bank."}, "docdt": "2003-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
