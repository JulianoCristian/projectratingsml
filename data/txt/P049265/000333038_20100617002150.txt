                            RESTRUCTING PAPER

SUMMARY
This Restructuring Paper responds to the request of the Government of the State of
Pernambuco (the Borrower) to amend the Loan Agreement for the Recife Urban
Upgrading Project (4690-BR) to encompass the following changes: (i) extension of the
Closing Date by five months to March 2, 2011; (ii) reallocation of loan proceeds and
changes to the disbursement percentages among categories; and (iii) revision of the
Project scope. These proposed changes would allow the implementing agency Agência
Estadual de Planejamento e Pesquisas de Pernambuco (CONDEPE/FIDEM) and other
implementing agencies to finalize construction of ongoing and already contracted
subprojects and to complete the corresponding implementation of resettlement action
plans. In addition, the Restructuring Paper also proposes several updates to the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) to reflect the modifications to the Project scope and
indicators to ensure that the description of the project in the PAD is consistent with the
description in the Loan Agreement.


PROJECT STATUS
The Project was approved by the Board on April 24, 2003 in the amount of US$46.0
million, and following the signing of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements on July 23,
2003, the Project became effective on October 9, 2003. There have been three
amendments to the Loan Agreement thus far: (i) the first to create a second disbursement
category for goods and expand the Project description for Part E of the Project, dated
January 23, 2004; (ii) the second to create an additional subcategory for works and
reallocate loan proceeds among disbursement categories, dated October 13, 2006; and
(iii) the third, dated March 6, 2009, to include new activities to be financed for
engineering designs for Unidades de Esgotamento (UEs, wastewater collection micro-
basins), to incorporate electronic bidding among the procurement methods acceptable to
the Bank, to reallocate loan proceeds and disbursement percentages among categories and
extend the Closing Date for a period of 18 Months. At present, the Loan's Closing Date is
September 30, 2010.

While the high level of Project complexity initially delayed implementation and
disbursement, the overall performance of the Borrower, has consistently been rated
satisfactory in the past two years. As reported in the last ISR, dated May 18, 2010,
implementation has proceeded at a steady pace, with disbursement totaling US$39.09
million as of April 19, 2010, corresponding to about 85 percent of the loan amount. The
situation is expected to improve further as a result of the number of major works
contracts that are under way and generating disbursements. Following extensive
discussions with the implementation unit during the last mission (February 8-12, 2010),
the team is confident that these remaining works will be completed by the proposed
revised Closing Date of March 2, 2011. In addition, the team strongly believes that the
extension is necessary to ensure that the Project continues to satisfactorily follow Bank
safeguard policies when completing these complex works.

The letter signed by the Governor of Pernambuco on the proposed amendment to the
Loan Agreement, dated February 26, 2010, requests the following: (i) extension of the
Closing Date to complete works already in execution; (ii) reallocation of loan proceeds
and change in the disbursement percentages among categories to account for the changes
in the exchange rate and the priorities in the use of loan proceeds; and (iii) revision of the
Project scope and indicators. The Guarantor's approval of the extension of the Closing
Date was granted by the Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional (STN), on the basis of the
Comissão de Financiamentos Externos (COFIEX) Recommendation N.569 of April 9,
2010.


PROPOSED CHANGES
   ·   Results/indicators. The Team proposes to modify several indicators in the PAD to
       better reflect expected results, as follows:

       (i)     Modify percent change in conduction capacity of drainage as the result of
               drainage interventions. This is more effectively captured by the "number
               of kilometers of drainage construction or rehabilitated" which is already
               included in the PAD and measured in the ISR;
       (ii)    Remove indicator on number of new retaining walls constructed as this
               activity was excluded from the Project; and
       (iii)   Remove indicator on adoption of a streamlined process of land tenure
               regularization in the informal settlements as this is outside of the scope of
               the State functions since the Municipalities of Recife and Olinda have
               departments which are responsible for land tenure regularization.

       In addition, the restructuring proposes to better specify how certain indicators will
       be measured, namely:

       (i)     Measure of the changes in property values pre and post project will be
               based on a Cities Alliance survey for the baseline and a similar
               methodological study for the end of Project measurement; and
       (ii)    Measure of improvements in cost recovery of OM&R of investments will
               measure only water supply and sanitation tariffs as other variables are
               irrelevant for low income areas (the actual indicator will be the ratio of the
               number of new connections built by the Project and the number of active
               connections).

   ·   Components. Although the Borrower and the implementing municipalities of
       Olinda and Recife have increased their counterpart financing to ensure that the
       Project's development objective is substantially realized, the significant
       appreciation of the Brazilian Real, coupled with inflation in the construction
       sector, has meant that some of the originally envisioned activities could not be
       undertaken under the scope of the Project. For these reasons, the description of


                                              5
       the project under Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement will be revised in the
       following manner:

       Part A: Beberibe River Investments. Remove the reference to the ecological park
       along the margins of the Beberibe River. Include clarification that the small parks
       within each of the UEs, improvements in macro drainage and improvements in
       the transport systems of sewage to be treated by the Peixinhos wastewater
       treatment plant, currently under Part A, were actually implemented under Part C.

       Part C: Low Income Investments. Include clarification that only the engineering
       designs for the UEs 04, 08, 17 and 19 (Recife) and 12, 13 and 15 (Olinda) were
       completed as part of the Project (the actual works will be financed through the
       Growth Acceleration Program (Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento, PAC)
       investments. As such, these items should be removed from Part C and added to
       Part D, where reference is made to engineering design services for Subprojects.

       Part D: Complementary Urbanization Activities. Remove the reference to the
       micro credit program for housing improvement and small business development
       in the Beberibe River Basin.

   ·   Financing. The Borrower has requested adjustments to Schedule 1 to account for
       changes in the exchange rate and revised subproject costs which require a
       reallocation of loan proceeds and changes in disbursement percentages in all
       categories. The requested changes are justified by the significant appreciation of
       the Brazilian Real, coupled with inflation in the construction sector that has been
       higher than the Consumer Price Index (IPC-A) during the last several years of
       implementation. These changes have already required the Borrower to
       significantly increase its contribution of counterpart funds from US$38 million to
       a total of US$74.3 million. The objective of the revised Schedule 1 is to achieve
       100 percent disbursement of the Loan by the new Closing Date. The proposed
       changes in Schedule 1 have been developed by the Borrower in consultation with
       the Team, and approved by the Guarantor, thus the Team believes that they are
       justified.

    ·   Closing Date. The project is very complex ­ subprojects require environmental
        licensing, involuntary resettlement, participatory planning and coordination
        among different municipalities and utility companies. In addition, counterpart
        funds were also designed to be provided by the municipalities as well as by the
        Borrower. These factors help to explain why the Project was relatively slow in
        implementation during the first three years of execution. However, upon taking
        office in January 2007, the actual Governor made the Project one of his
        administration's top priorities, resulting in changes in staffing and implementation

                                                 7
    arrangements that greatly improved the pace of implementation. These facts,
    which are well documented in the archived ISRs, were the main reason behind the
    Bank's decision to approve the third amendment to the Loan Agreement which
    extended the Closing Date by 18 months to September 30, 2010. Although
    implementation has made steady progress since then, the Borrower is now seeking
    a further extension of the closing date by five months to ensure that works
    contracts already under way have sufficient time to be completed. As about
    US$39.09 million, or about 85 percent of loan proceeds, has already been
    disbursed, and 100 percent are expected to be disbursed by the proposed revised
    Closing Date, the team believes that the Borrower's request is justified and that
    the extension should be granted. The risks involved with approving the extension
    are low, as disbursements are directly tied to the completion of ongoing works
    contracts. Moreover, the proposed extension conforms to Bank policies. The
    Borrower is not subject to a suspension of disbursements and the performance of
    the implementation agency has consistently been rated satisfactory for the past
    two years. No audit reports are presently overdue.

·   Revisions to the Loan Agreement. The proposed amendment would make
    relatively minor alterations to other sections of the Loan Agreement to reflect
    previously approved amendments and ensure timely delivery of fiduciary
    documents for the supervision of the Project, namely:

    (i)     Article III Project Execution 3.06 (b) (i) and (ii) will be removed as the
            referenced technical and legal studies related to the installation of macro
            meters and associated works required to isolate the water distribution
            network within the UEs were deleted as a remedy of the Bank (Article V
            Remedies of the Bank, Section 5.01 (e)) as a result of the third amendment
            to the Loan Agreement.
    (ii)    Schedule I Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds Paragraph 3 (d) (ii) and (iii) will
            be removed as these studies were removed as a remedy of the Bank as
            mentioned above; and
    (iii)   Article III Project Execution 3.10 (a) will be revised to read "not later than
            45 days after the end of each calendar quarter" to ensure that the Borrower
            has sufficient time to complete the progress reports and that they are
            delivered to the Bank on the same schedule as the Financial Management
            Reports.

·   Revisions to the Project Appraisal Document. The proposed amendment to the
    Loan Agreement would also be reflected in a modified description of the Project
    in the PAD to ensure that it is consistent with the Loan Agreement. These
    relatively minor changes are limited to removing the references to: (i) an
    independent operator to manage the pilot water distribution system, under
    Component 2; and (ii) the micro credit program for housing improvement,
    business development and small-scale community investments, under Component
    4.
