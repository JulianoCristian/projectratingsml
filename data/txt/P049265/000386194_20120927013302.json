Some lessons\n            learned includes: integrated urban upgrading, Water Supply\n            and Sanitation (WSS) and housing approach. The integrated\n            urban upgrading approach used during the project improved\n            efficiency, reduced project risks, promoted synergies\n            between the various upgrading activities and increased the\n            magnitude of the results. It allowed the implementing\n            agencies to build their capacity to work in a coordinated\n            manner. In addition, the project found the division of the\n            targeted areas into Sanitation Collection Unit (UEs) to be\n            immensely useful. Reducing design complexities: the\n            involvement of the municipalities as both implementing\n            agencies and co-financiers proved to be important for the\n            outcomes of the project and for future sustainability.\n            However, this management model also led to difficulties in\n            implementation and coordination. Issues such as municipal\n            autonomy, distinct technical and managerial capacities and\n            financial constraints contributed to project delays and\n            required high level intervention from the Governor and\n            Mayors. Enforcing clear cut-off dates for resettlement. The\n            Bank's resettlement policy recommends setting a cutoff\n            date at the same time that the census is completed. After\n            this date, no entitlements should be offered to people who\n            settle in the area or make improvements to their homes or\n            businesses. Under the project, resettlement was carried out\n            in stages, and the project did not enforce the cutoff dates\n            for resettlement eligibility. Rebalancing pre and post\n            construction activities: the project focused on improving\n            the living conditions of the residents of the basin through\n            infrastructure and housing upgrades. The project did not\n            place equal emphasis on how to sustain its results and\n            promote the autonomy of the families. Slum upgrading\n            projects usually have more intensive social and community\n            development at the planning and implementation stages than\n            at the post-implementation stage."}, "docdt": "2012-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
