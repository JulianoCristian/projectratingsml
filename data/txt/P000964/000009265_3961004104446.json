the government\n            in increasing learning achievements and enrollments in\n            primary schools throughout the country.  In order to\n            accomplish this, the project will have the specific\n            objective of improving the amount and quality of teaching\n            and learning time in primary schools, particularly, as far\n            as 1,983 of the least well endowed primary schools are\n            concerned.  The project, which concentrates on those\n            schools, combines the implementation of key policy and\n            management changes with investments in physical\n            infrastructure.  In key policy and management changes, the\n            inputs will be:  (a) increasing official teaching hours from\n            4 hours a day to at least 5 a day; (b) ensuring that\n            District Education Officers do not arrange any functions or\n            activities for schoolteachers during official teaching\n            hours; (c) eliminating all fees and levies that are not\n            officially endorsed by the Ministry of Education and that\n            are currently imposed on primary school students; (d)\n            involving communities in the selection of headteachers; (e)\n            training and re-training of circuit monitoring assistants;\n            and (f) strengthening the Ministry of Education's\n            implementation, monitoring and planning capacity. In\n            investments in physical infrastructure, the inputs will be:\n            (a) constructing 10,977 classrooms; (b) constructing 1,983\n            headteachers houses; (c) re-roofing of 1,546 classrooms; (d)\n            employing construction supervision and technical auditing\n            consultants; and (e) mobilizing communities to clear and\n            prepare the sites and rapidly clad the pavilions and make\n            cement wall blackboards."}, "docdt": "1993-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
