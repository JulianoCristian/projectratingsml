Primary School\n            Development Project is unsatisfactory, although performance\n            was mixed. Project outcomes are rated as satisfactory with\n            respect to learning outcomes and enrollment in project\n            schools. In all other areas, such as institutional\n            development, community partnerships outside SIF schools,\n            improved teaching, and improved supervision, the outcomes\n            are unsatisfactory. Lessons were learned in the following\n            areas: a) focus on the school and teachers - teachers must\n            be given a chance to contribute to the design of education\n            initiatives; b) community participation - increased\n            involvement in the community in the development of the\n            school and the establishment of partnerships between the\n            community and school staff is linked to positive performance\n            on all indicators; c) link between program design and\n            institutional capacity - this relationship needs to be\n            carefully assessed and adjustments made to phase\n            implementation while building capacity; d) teacher\n            incentives - little evidence to show these worked; e)\n            strategies to increase enrolment - more adapted targeted\n            nonformal approaches need to be developed; and f)\n            prioritization of goals and strategies - persistent\n            attention need be accorded to reaching all primary school\n            aged children."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
