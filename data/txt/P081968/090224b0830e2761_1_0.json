The Government of Nepal\u2019s Poverty\n            Alleviation Fund (PAF) has integrated community driven\n            development methodologies with feedback mechanisms supported\n            by local radio as well as telephone and web platforms to\n            empower communities to design, implement, and manage their\n            own development projects that serve the poorest of the poor.\n            PAF identifies the poorest of the poor in communities\n            throughout Nepal and then partners with local government and\n            Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to provide community\n            mobilization and facilitation services, establish community\n            organizations, and elect a committee representative. Regular\n            community organization meetings ensure good communication\n            regarding finances and setting project priorities. This\n            ensures that the project closes the feedback loop and that\n            the voices of communities are heard. In addition to\n            financial assistance, the World Bank provides technical\n            assistance, drawing upon its extensive experience in\n            community driven development projects around the world and\n            in other conflict-affected countries in South Asia such as\n            Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. While PAF has instituted several\n            mechanisms to encourage interaction between community\n            members, the future will focus on connecting communities to\n            share learning and experiences so that they become fully\n            aware and able to engage with the opportunities available to them."}, "docdt": "2012-10-31T09:18:01Z"}
