F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

The Project Development Objective is to support the Government of Nepal in implementing a new, targeted
instrument ­ the Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) ­ for reaching poor and excluded communities. It aims to
improve access to income-generation projects and community infrastructure for the groups that have tended to be
excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity and caste, as well as for the poorest groups in rural communities.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design:

1.1   Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance):

Original Project. While the original project was identified, prepared and appraised, Nepal faced
serious political turmoil and uncertainty, the result of escalating violence associated with
longstanding domestic conflict between the Government of the time and a Maoist insurgency.
The Parliament had been dissolved in May 2002 amidst intensifying conflict activity, a cease-fire
between the Government and the Maoists signed in January 2003 lasted only seven months, and
political influence of the King was on the increase.

The preparation team noted that the fundamental challenge in Nepal was to break out of a trap of
poverty, slow growth, poor governance, social exclusion, and deep inequalities, all of which
were interlinked and fuelling the political crisis and conflict situation. Reform-minded leaders in
government at that time had begun pushing for more sustained and equitable economic and
social development, as articulated in Nepal's 10th Plan (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,
2002-2007). One of the main issues identified in the 10th Plan was the plight of the
marginalized segments of Nepal's highly socially stratified population. These were more often
than not women and people from Dalit or Janajati backgrounds, living in remote areas, who
faced multiple economic handicaps and social biases. The Government considered that more
direct and quick interventions were required to help these marginalized people, as well as a need
to send a clear signal that the exclusionary practices of the past were unacceptable. It was
acknowledged that addressing the grievances of the marginalized groups would be essential in
order to change the situation in the rural areas that had tended to fuel the escalating insurgency.

The proposed solution involved the creation of a new entity (the Poverty Alleviation Fund, PAF),
which would employ a demand-driven development strategy, with target beneficiaries playing
the lead role in setting their own development priorities, managing resources and implementing
sub-project activities. GON turned to the World Bank for support because of the Bank's
extensive cross-country experience with community-driven development (CDD) and with the
delivery of programs to address poverty and social exclusion, including in conflict-affected
settings. The Bank was also perceived as having the ability to support a scaling up of PAF, if the
project proved successful.

The Bank engaged in an extended dialogue about the scope and role of such an institution,
including the degree of autonomy, extent to which focus of activities should be set from above
or truly demand-driven, and the relationship with Nepal's decentralization agenda. As originally
suggested by GON in 2000, PAF would have been autonomous in principle but with heavy
government control in the Board structure. The Bank pressed for greater independence. By the
time project preparation began in 2003, Government had come to agree, and this is reflected in
the 2004 Ordinance which created PAF. Originally it was also thought that PAF might play a
significant role in decentralization, and this was reflected in a 2002 Policy Note by the Bank,
and in the 2003 PRS and CAS documents. However, by the time of project appraisal in 2004,
the political situation on the ground was deteriorating from the conflict point of view, with
representative local government virtually disappearing, on the one hand, and the Bank engaged
in discussion of a separate decentralization intervention, on the other. Therefore, the Project


                                                8
Appraisal Document (PAD) set out a more modest objective: while PAF would support some
capacity building for local governments, the project would focus first and foremost on social
exclusion and capacity-building of beneficiaries and their own institutions. In that regard, while
the Policy Note, PRS and CAS had envisioned PAF more as a social fund with priority to
addressing infrastructure and service delivery, the final project design had a stronger CDD
emphasis; the PAD included an indication of the type of sub-projects to be financed (in part
based on experience from other countries), but with the understanding that these were only
indicative figures and not targets, as communities would have the freedom to set their own
priorities. The challenge for PAF would be to actually reach poor and traditionally
marginalized groups and to respect the decision-making by these beneficiaries.

Finally, cross-country experience suggested that addressing a legacy of severe discrimination,
exclusion and poverty would take many years to achieve, starting with recognition of the
problem in the country's own policy dialogue, allocation of resources, capacity building and
creation of institutional arrangements for the victims of poverty and exclusion to access those
resources, and reordering of power relationships at various levels of society and government,
accompanied by gradual closing of differential economic and social gaps. The project would
focus on the inital phase of this social inclusion process.

Additional Financing. Although domestic tensions and conflict, particularly in rural areas,
continued during the early years of project implementation, PAF's institutional arrangements,
participatory methodology and early track record in getting resources out to the poorest and most
excluded groups met with broad acceptance, which allowed it to operate even in areas where
other programs could not. By 2006, PAF was about to commit all available resources, some two
years ahead of original schedule. At the same time, a significant political transition occurred in
April 2006, bringing to a halt the period of increasing royal control. The new Government which
was formed faced the central challenge of establishing its credibility in delivering results on the
ground, and it therefore made a set of community-based programs the centerpiece of the effort to
extend rapidly its developmental reach throughout the country. In this context, the Bank and
Government agreed to accelerate processing of Additional Financing for PAF, and the Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) foresaw a possible larger PAF II if the program continued to prove effective.
The core PDO of the original project, which focused on the first phase of the social inclusion
process, as discussed above, continued to be relevant and remained unchanged.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

Table 1 below summarizes the PDO and key performance indicators in the PAD.

The Project's development objective is to
                                                       Number of beneficiary households
support the Government of Nepal (GoN) in
                                                       including female-headed, poor, Dalit or
implementing a new, targeted instrument ­ the
                                                       Janajati

and community infrastructure for the groups            Increase in incomes of beneficiary
that have tended to be excluded by reasons of          households
gender, ethnicity and caste, as well as for the        Increase in food security
poorest groups in rural communities.                   Percentage of quality groups (regular
                                                       meetings, access to services) and increased
                                                       beneficiary participation and voice in
                                                       community decision-making
                                                        Donor support for the PAF to expand its
                                                       program



The Project Agreement for the original grant included the following quantitative targets for these
performance indicators in its Schedule 4:

     -  Number of sub-projects: 1,000
     - Number of groups of beneficiaries: 1,000
     - Percentage of women membership in groups: 30%
     - Percentage of indigenous membership in groups: 30%
     - Number of villages covered:100
     - Amount of contribution of communities: US$50,000
     - Number of beneficiaries:10,000
     - Number of beneficiaries trained:10,000

Implementation Supervision Reports (ISRs) focused particularly on the number of beneficiary
households headed by women, poor, Dalit and Janjatis, as the main indicator of progress
towards the core development objective of the project of employing a new instrument to reach
traditionally poor and excluded communities.

1.3    Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification: While the PDO remained
the same, the Project Agreement (in its Schedule 3) for the Additional Financing raised the
above quantitative targets, bringing the cumulative total for the project to the following:
       -      Number of sub-projects: 2,500
       -      Number of groups of beneficiaries: 2,500
       -      Percentage of women membership in groups: raised to 40%
       -      Percentage of indigenous membership in groups: 30%

      -       Number of villages covered: 300
      -       Amount of contribution of communities: $150,000
      -       Number of beneficiaries: 160,000
      -       Number of beneficiaries trained: 160,000


1.4   Main Beneficiaries:

Consistent with the PDO, the main beneficiaries of the project were expected to be the most
socially and economically disadvantaged rural households in the project area, namely women,
Dalit and Janajati (indigenous population) and the poor. Targeting would take place at three
levels: district, village and community. Six districts were selected to pilot the new PAF
approach, on the basis of `needs, diversity and security conditions' and the National Planning
Commission (NPC)'s district-level socio-economic indicators. Specifically, a set of 28 district-
level socio-economic indicators were used to rank all districts in Nepal. The six project districts
were selected from among the lower third of all districts according to this ranking, with
attention to the security situation and geographic distribution, and included two in the Terai, two
in the hills and two in the mountains. Within each district, PAF selected 25 villages based on
the respective DDC poverty ranking. This was then followed by a participatory process of
wealth-ranking by the village communities themselves to identify target groups/beneficiaries.
This participatory wealth ranking considered criteria including caste, ethnicity, gender,
accessibility to services and indicators of poverty such as level of assets, food security and
income. Findings were verified in public meetings at community level, and substantiated by the
formal evaluation survey data.

1.5   Original Components:

The project comprised five components: 1. Income Generation Sub-projects Targeted to the
Poorest and Excluded Groups; 2. Small-Scale Village and Community Infrastructure; 3.
Innovation and Special programs; 4. Capacity Building; and 5. Administration of PAF.

 Component 1 of the project would provide grants for income-generation activities, selected on
a demand-driven basis, to groups of poor and excluded people based on objective criteria
including ethnicity, caste, gender and poverty level. Communities would contribute 10% of the
sub-project cost in cash. A proportion of the grant would be reserved for technical assistance.
Partner Organizations (POs) would be contracted to assist the communities in participatory
processes, group formation and development of sound sub-project proposals.

Component 2 would provide grants for small-scale infrastructure sub-projects, also to groups of
poor and excluded people, as under Component 1, and also on a demand-driven basis with
communities identifying priorities themselves from an open menu; the same POs would
facilitate the process of community organization and preparation of sub-projects; communities
would contribute 10% of the sub-project cost and prepare and commit to a credible O&M plan.
Consideration would be given to sub-projects already included in Village Development
Committee plans and/or where the District or Village Development Committee (DDCs/VDCs)
would provide matching funds.



                                               11
    Component 3 on Innovative and Special Programs would support innovative proposals to
    address poverty, reach target groups and finance sub-projects outside the six pilot districts if
    they merited special consideration because of exceptional circumstances of the community.
    This component would allow PAF to conduct activities outside the core project area and/or
    support innovative proposals that might arise during implementation and contribute to the PDO,
    but that could not be determined at the time of appraisal.

    Component 4 would support capacity building and social mobilization in five areas: (i) capacity
    of POs to mobilize target beneficiaries and develop sub-projects; (ii) capacity building for
    VDCs in financial management, budgeting, social assessments, and evaluation of impacts, and
    to enable Local Bodies to assist targeted groups to access PAF resources; (iii) capacity building
    for target groups to implement their sub-projects; (iv) support to micro-finance intermediaries to
    increase their lending capacity to target communities and enable these communities to access
    finance schemes; and (v) support on information, monitoring, and evaluation to monitor and
    evaluate progress, processes, and results of the program.

    Component 5 was to finance PAF administration including various operational costs and human
    resource development activities for the PAF staff.

1.6       Revised Components: N/A

1.7       Other significant changes:

    Scaling Up. Additional Financing in the amount of SDR 16.9 million (US$25 million
    equivalent) was approved in December 2006 to scale up project activities by expanding the
    geographic coverage of the project from 6 to 25 districts (adding 19 districts).1

    Shift in Composition of Community Demand. Reallocations of the original grant were made
    twice (in June 2006 and May 2008) and once for the additional grant (May 2008). The main
    impact was to increase financing of income generation and program innovation activities, and
    decrease financing of infrastructure sub-projects, reflecting evolving demand from beneficiary
    groups. Financing for consultant services, training and knowledge sharing was reduced.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry:

Background analysis, lessons incorporated and rationale

    The original project was well aligned with GON's poverty reduction strategy (PRS) and the
    Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2004 ­ 2007,2 although it set more modest
    objectives and targets than either of these, given the deterioration in the conflict situation

  The original six districts were: Darchula, Mugu, Kapilvastu, Pyuthan, Ramechchap and Siraha. The 19 additional
districts were: Achham, Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, Dadeldhura, Dailekh, Dolpa, Doti, Humla, Jajorkot, Jumla,
Kalikot, Mahottari, Rasuwa, Rautahat, Rolpa, Rukum, Sarlahi and Sindhuli.

    (between the drafting of the PRS and CAS in 2003 and project appraisal) and virtual non-
    existence of representative local governments. The CAS envisioned the project as supporting
    one of its expected outcomes ­ `increased public funds used by disadvantaged groups for
    services' ­ in line with the third pillar of PRS which advocated social inclusion and targeted
    programmes for the poor and the socially excluded and the project clearly focused on this by
    supporting a mechanism to reach the poor and excluded (PAF) and employing a CDD approach,
    which the project team felt was the best means of tackling exclusion and the conflict/political
    context. However, the project objectives and content de-emphasized the work with local
    governments, including only capacity-building where possible. The CAS also foresaw a follow-
    up operation for PAF, which was achieved through the Additional Financing. A World
    Bank/DFID study published in 2006 (`Unequal Citizens: Gender, Caste and Ethnic Exclusion in
    Nepal (Summary)') confirmed higher poverty incidence among Dalit and Janajati, and social
    inclusion remained a strong theme in the Bank's June 2007 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
    Nepal.3 The ISN foresaw a potentially larger follow-up PAF II operation, which is now under
    implementation.

    Key lessons identified in the PAD and incorporated in the project designed included: (1)
    strength of the autonomous entity model for project implementation, especially in the areas of
    transparency and results; (2) recognition that the poor can identify, plan and implement their
    own priority activities, and manage funds responsibly, if they are in the driver's seat and
    appropriate support and facilitation are provided; and (3) the need for a participatory mechanism
    to identify social and economic stratification within the community. These were all relevant
    lessons, and usefully informed the project design. In particular, beneficiaries were given wide
    discretion in the selection of sub-project priorities, and were given the lead role in managing
    financing and implementation of sub-projects. The importance of standardized operational
    modalities and practical tools (such as manuals and MIS) for a project to finance a numerous
    sub-projects in a wide geographical area was recognized and also articulated in the design.

Project design

    The overall project design was straightforward and uncomplicated. Strengths included a simple
    and clear component structure and standardized implementation modalities for limited types of
    foreseen activities; clarity about the project objective, and realistic and valid target selection
    methods (districts, villages and beneficiaries); a lean implementation unit with staff
    competitively recruited; and emphasis on local POs' experience and demonstrated track record
    in the area of operation.

    The design also focused appropriately on a manageable number of (six) districts, to allow PAF
    the opportunity to develop its institutional capacity and gain experience in implementing
    interventions under very difficult circumstances (conflict, extreme poverty and a legacy of
    severe social exclusion). At the same time, the design provided flexibility by allowing PAF to
    conduct activities under Component 3, outside the six districts and/or in support of innovative
    proposals that might arise during implementation and contribute to the PDO. The PAD clearly
    anticipated the possibility that PAF would be scaled up if it proved successful, but the initial
    PAF operation was manageable in size and scope, and adopted a learning-by-doing approach

consistent with the PDO's aim to test the new instrument. In the event, significant scaling up
has taken place, first with Additional Financing and subsequently under a second stage PAF II
operation (as also foreseen in the Bank's Interim Strategy Note).

With regard to the distribution between income generation and infrastructure sub-projects,
although the PAD set some indicative estimates, it did not enforce top-down targets, given the
program's demand-driven nature, and responded instead to the priorities of the target groups.
Over the life of the project, communities selected relatively more income generation than
infrastructure sub-projects, reflecting the importance which extremely poor beneficiaries, in an
insecure environment, assigned to food security/family consumption needs. In many areas, more
`mature' communities, having first opted for income-generating activities, have since moved on
to implement infrastructure projects as their confidence in PAF as a government instrument, in
the security of their locales, and in themselves as capable planners and implementers has
increased. The project has supported an important cohort of infrastructure activities as detailed
in the Borrower's completion report and other annexes. It is acknowledged, however, that the
limited functionality of local government bodies (with whose plans PAF infrastructure sub-
projects were supposed to coordinate), the operational complexity of some infrastructure
implementation, quality of PO mobilization and/or limited technical support in more remote
areas may also have contributed to lower initial demand for this kind of activity.

The one area where experience during implementation has departed from expectations at
appraisal, largely for reasons exogenous to the project, concerned capacity building for local
bodies. The project design envisaged some capacity building to help VDCs perform their core
functions, through training on various topics. As decentralization was not occurring on any
meaningful scale and with dissolution of elected bodies and the functional/technical body of
most VDCs having only one staff (secretary), whose mandate did not include activities for
which project training would have been relevant, this training did not take place. With the
political transition in recent years, the Government is actively exploring decentralization options
and the scope for PAF cooperation in this area is potentially stronger under PAF II. Similarly,
capacity building for microfinance intermediaries did not prove feasible in light of their very
limited outreach in the rural areas, an issue which might have been better foreseen at appraisal.
In the circumstances, during implementation the Bank and PAF focused instead on alternatives
(mainly revolving funds and the linking/federating of groups of COs) as precursors to eventual
microfinance support for beneficiaries. This issue is being more systematically addressed under
the follow-on PAF II operation.

Government's commitment

GON had agreed on the establishment of an autonomous PAF, and promptly issued an
ordinance and subsequently an act to establish the PAF, approved by Parliament. The Board and
the Secretariat were appointed prior to implementation. In addition, essential implementation
arrangements were elaborated, and key guidelines and manuals were developed under the
coordination of the Secretariat prior to project commencement. Government commitment has
remained strong throughout project implementation, despite periods of intense political unrest
and turnover. There have been some delays in appointment of new Vice Chairmen and Board
members during these periods of transition, but strong continuity in operational management
and staff has allowed project implementation to proceed largely on schedule (see 2.2 below).


                                               14
Assessment of risks

Most of the high and substantial risks identified in the PAD were related to the conflict and
future uncertainties arising from it. The preparation team made an appropriate and pragmatic
decision to rely on local POs from the area, who were considered to be capable of operating
despite the ongoing insurgency activities. Its assessment that the project's targeting of excluded
and marginalized groups in a participatory manner would reduce the risk of security threats was
also sensible, and turned out to be the case on most occasions.

2.2   Implementation:

Despite the conflict situation prevailing in the country, project implementation was not
disrupted - with the exception of Pyuthan District, where implementation was suspended for
about one year in 2006/07 because of opposition from Maoist district cadres. This in itself is
noted as a remarkable achievement, given the development landscape at the time, in which most
donor and government programs were forced to cease operations, as a result of the armed
campaign.

Political instability and uncertainty, however, did not deter GON's commitment to PAF as
indicated by their timely allocations of adequate annual budgets. At one stage, Government
changes affected the Board membership with the PAF Vice Chairperson's (VC) post being
vacant for about 10 months and appointment of Board members also delayed. While key staff
in the Secretariat, including Executive Director, continued to stay in office, with their
accumulated experience and knowledge having positive impacts on the performance of the
implementing agency, the absence of a VC and functioning Board did lead to some bottlenecks,
such as delays in staffing decisions. More recently, during the last Government transition, a
similar situation has occurred, with a delay in appointment of a new VC and Board members,
indicating that the governance structure of the PAF is not immune to political change. To avoid
any serious impacts on implementation in the longer-term, it would be useful to critically
review this structure and PAF's governance arrangements for senior Board appointments going
forward under PAF II to prevent any further governance risks to the institution and its
effectiveness.

Implementation of the PAF took an important turn around the second year (2005/2006), when
activities started in other districts (outside the six pilot districts) under the innovation
Component 3. This reflected the Government's assessment that PAF was succeeding in
reaching target beneficiaries (poor and excluded groups) and that Additional Financing would
eventually be forthcoming from the Bank. The PAF Board meeting in July 2005 formally
decided that 19 more districts would be included in the project, judging that a preparatory
period of about one year should precede actual sub-project implementation in the new districts.
As the Additional Financing was approved only in December 2006, Component 3 also
supported implementation of a number of sub-projects in these 19 districts. This was consistent
with the original project design, which did allow PAF the flexibility to operate under
Component 3 outside the six pilot districts.




                                               15
Implementation of regular sub-projects under Components 1 and 2 involved formation of COs
at the settlement level, and members' identification of sub-projects of their own choice. The
process was facilitated by POs. Selection of CO members was based on a participatory well-
being ranking which used household food sufficiency as a proxy for poverty category. This
implementation arrangement proved very effective in reaching the poorest and most
marginalized groups and in prioritizing their needs. An initiative of PAF to adopt direct transfer
of the grant to the COs' accounts also worked well (despite initial delays due mainly to poor
communication with the Rastriya Banijya Bank in remote areas) and served to enhance
transparency at the community level. A total of 189 POs were selected in the 25 districts, each
covering several VDCs, and provided technical and managerial assistance to members of COs.
Emphasis was placed on selecting POs with strong presence in the districts, reflecting
importance paid to local knowledge, especially given the high political tension and instability.

Monitoring and evaluation data show that the targeting mechanism proved highly effective:
households selected to be CO members were exclusively poor: 68% hardcore poor, 24%
medium poor and 8% poor. Inclusion of the socially excluded was also achieved as shares of
Dalit, Janajati and others are 32%, 44%, and 24%, respectively (their percentage shares in the
total population are 12%, 19% and 69%). Females accounted for 67% of the total number of CO
members.

The PAD allocated about 83% of total project resources to sub-projects and indicated that about
30% of these might go to income generation and 70% to infrastructure ­ based on global
experience. Owing to the demand-driven concept underpinning the project, no attempt was
made to impose targets on communities. By the end of the project period, disbursement for
sub-projects actually totaled about 89% of all project resources, of which 72% went to income
generation and 17% to infrastructure. The main reason for the preponderance of income
generation activities was the extreme poverty of beneficiaries and critical importance they
placed first on improving family consumption and food security (with produce generated often
going to satisfy those needs rather than to markets per se), amplified by the prevailing conflict-
related instability, where private assets were more easily convertible/transportable and where
publicly financed works could be a target for insurgent attention. Other factors which may have
influenced some communities included the scarcity of technical experts that POs could engage
for infrastructure activities in remote areas, and the fact that infrastructure tends to have higher
unit costs while PAF employs the same per capita investment and sub-project ceilings.
Variability in the quality of social mobilization may also have been a contributing factor.

Grants to COs for income generating sub-projects became revolving funds the groups owned
and managed, at the initiative of the COs themselves. Although not initially foreseen in the
PAD, this arrangement was supported by the Bank and PAF. Specifically, based on experience
in other countries, the Bank helped to develop rigorous rules in order to make the revolving
funds sustainable, including compulsory weekly meetings of all members and appropriate
bookkeeping. In 2007, the Bank brought in a finance specialist to analyze the readiness for
linking these funds to micro-finance institutions, and reached the conclusion that some time
should be allowed to further develop the community financing mechanism before moving to
this stage. Under PAF II, explicit provision for these linkages is reflected in the design. An
encouraging development was observed in networking of CO members around same activities,
which in some places has led to formation of cooperatives or other forms of federation. This


                                                16
was also not specifically set as a target in project design, but was encouraged by the Bank and
PAF as a mechanism for sustainability and is similar to experiences in other rural CDD projects
in the South Asia region.

In addition to serving as a precursor to greater access to micro-finance, the revolving funds have
served several further purposes, which became especially important given the strong demand
from beneficiaries for income-generating sub-projects. First, they ensured that sub-project
resources would not be limited to one-time asset transfers to (private) individuals but rather
would remain in the (public) domain, available for COs to support other investment priorities.
Secondly, the revolving fund mechanism also seems to have enhanced cohesiveness among CO
members. For example, in many instances, CO members went on to set up a separate fund
through savings that can be drawn at the time of emergencies. Finally, the revolving fund
arrangement may have also served as an extra tool, in addition to the formal appraisal
mechanism, to exclude nonviable activities.

Although most of Component 3 went to finance sub-projects outside of the original six districts,
it also financed winning proposals of the Bank's Nepal Development Marketplace (NDM),
which was consistent with the innovation objectives of that component. It is observed,
however, that little attempt has been made to widely disseminate or scale up any of the
innovations ­ a shortcoming, given the lesson learning intent of the component.

As mentioned earlier, under the capacity building Component 4, no activities were undertaken
for local governments or microfinance intermediaries. Support to local bodies could not take
place as originally envisaged because the overall political situation in the country did not
support decentralization to proceed. Local elected councils that were dissolved in 2002 were not
reconstituted during the life of the project. However, in 10 districts a unit within the DDC
(called Local Development Fund) was selected as PO and received the same capacity building
support in relation to social mobilization as given to NGOs.               In addition, a formal
Memorandum of Understanding was signed between PAF and the Ministry of Local
Development in 2008, to formalize their information sharing and co-planning commitments,
with respect to local public works. More important, from the longer-term perspective, the
experience which community groups are acquiring in resource management and participatory
decision-making will be extremely important as decentralization of government roles and
responsibilities eventually unfolds in Nepal, with PAF beneficiaries in a much stronger position
to hold local government bodies accountable and engage in meaningful citizen-government
interactions than would have been the case absent the opportunities provided by the project.
Finally, capacity building of microfinance institutions did not prove feasible since their outreach
in the rural areas was very limited. The very small volume of resources originally allocated for
local government and microfinance intermediaries were reallocated to sub-project
implementation.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Monitoring

Design. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Secretariat designed and operated a useful
Management Information System (MIS) to monitor project progress and key outputs. As COs


                                               17
were established, each member's information on ethnicity/caste and gender was entered into the
MIS, which proved crucial to enable PAF and the Bank to track progress in meeting the core
project development objective (using a new instrument ­ PAF ­ to reach poor and traditionally
excluded groups in rural communities). The project MIS also monitored physical progress and
key outputs, and the design incorporated a checking system of automatic markers to catch when
project rules were not conformed with (e.g. caste/ethnicity and gender representation in COs).
While the MIS included some key performance indicators (see Table 1 above), the project relied
mainly on the formal evaluation system to track PDO outcomes. One area where the MIS could
have been improved during implementation would have been to incorporate monitoring
indicators relating to the revolving funds, once this practice emerged on the ground, as this
would have assisted PAF and the Bank team to more systematically track the use of the funds
and therefore secondary project impacts. PAF's Finance Unit operated a separate recording
system (Finance MIS) which was not cross-referenced with the main MIS (although the two
systems are now being brought together under PAF II). Finally, PAF has also placed
considerable emphasis on participatory/social monitoring at the community, PO and DDC levels
as detailed below and in Section 11.1 of the Borrower's ICR.

Implementation. At the CO level, a monitoring sub-committee tracked each development
activity implemented in the community, and findings were presented in CO regular meetings at
least once a month, for discussion and recommendations of corrective measures to improve
implementation. Some 16,590 CO members were directly involved in such monitoring work. At
the PO level, one social mobilizer was allocated for each VDC. A field supervisor also regularly
oversaw the work of each CO and provided instant feedback with necessary support including
information and link up with technical assistance. Information on physical progress of each CO
was collected by POs according to standard formats. Portfolio Managers (PMs) consolidated the
data and passed it to the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit for entry into the MIS. PMs oversaw
operations at district level with one PM assigned to each district. All PMs were based in
Kathmandu, but frequently traveled to the districts. In addition, monitoring of the project also
took place periodically by district stakeholders (DDCs, line agencies, representatives of political
parties, journalists), and the central government through reporting to the Prime Minister's
Office, the Minister of Finance and through visits to the field by representatives of these two
offices and of the National Planning Commission. The project has also been subject to a
performance audit by the Office of the Auditor General of Nepal.

    Use of Information. MIS data was used to produce regular Quarterly Progress Monitoring
    Reports (PMRs) and the monthly reports to the Prime Minister's Office and the NPC. These
    reports covered progress and process monitoring (e.g. milestones in sub-project activity), as
    well as key project outputs. In addition, key output data from the MIS was disclosed on the
    internet. Besides delivering timely information to the management team, the system generated
    automatic alerts and sent back cases for review by the PMs and Technical Appraisal Committee
    (TAC) in cases where rules were not observed4. This helped reduce the risk of the project's
    benefits going to the non-targeted groups.


4
 For example, the system alerted when: any CO registered fewer than the required targeted population (30% of
women members, 30% of Dalit membership and 30% of indigenous groups (Janjatis) membership, including their
occupation of key decision-making positions such as CO President, Secretary and Treasurer; any sub-project


                                                     18
Evaluation

The project supported a formal impact evaluation process, which included a baseline survey in
2006 and follow-up survey in 2008/09, as described below. A fuller description of the evaluation
process, methodologies, analysis and findings is provided in Annex 5. This ICR has drawn on
these surveys, the project MIS, some case study findings, and other information available from
PAF. The evaluation findings suggested that initial impacts on targeting and welfare levels were
statistically significant. PAF interventions were systematically reaching poorer villages,5 and
within those villages, PAF was covering poorer households,6 and a larger share of Dalit, Janajati
and females.7 In terms of change in welfare between the two rounds of data, PAF households
recorded a 47 percent greater increase in consumption than did non-PAF control households.8
This net impact (termed as difference-in-difference effect in the evaluation literature) was
statistically significant. Results from sensitivity analysis of using different methodologies to
correct for initial conditions and endogenous program selection are even stronger. As PAF was a
poverty targeted instrument, data analysis also explored closely the income growth of the poorest
of the poor within the samples. The improvement in consumption for the poorest half of PAF
beneficiaries was even higher than for the overall PAF beneficiary sample.

 Design: The task team at the outset placed a high value on instituting a rigorous impact
evaluation for PAF. The impact evaluation was conceived as a long-term process, including
initial baseline survey of treatment and control areas and households, subsequent follow-up
surveys, and analysis of data from multiple rounds to measure impact and assess results.

 Implementation: The Bank team supported the PAF secretariat with design of the evaluation,
 including sampling, drafting of questionnaires, piloting them and supervision of the actual
 surveys. The data collection task was contracted to the Central Department of Population
 Studies at Tribhuvan University (TU) through competitive selection, to undertake both the
 baseline survey (2006) and the follow-up survey (2008/9) on a sample of about 1500
 households in 115 villages from six districts located across different geographic regions of the
 country.

 In an effort to assure quality and build capacity of the counterparts in the PAF secretariat, an
 approach was adopted that brought together Tribhuvan University as responsible for the field-
 based data collection and a Bank team to provide technical inputs in the design and supervision
 of surveys, and data analysis. This was possibly the first instance where GON, the Bank and
 private sector (in the form of TU) jointly initiated a rigorous evaluation effort in the country.
 Because of a steep learning curve for the counterparts, initial procurement delays, compounded

exceeded per capita expenditure norms; and any internal TAC reports, internal memos for release of tranche, sub-
project extension were not completed within the norms for processing period.
5
  Within the six pilot districts, per capita consumption in villages selected for PAF interventions was on average 9
percent lower than in non-PAF villages at the time of the 2006 baseline survey.
6
  Within PAF villages, beneficiary households were 8 percent poorer than those not selected into PAF at the time of
the 2006 baseline survey.
7
  Close to 70 percent of all Dalit and Janajati households, and a similar share of female headed households, within
PAF villages were selected to participate. This coverage was significantly higher than the coverage for other
population groups.
8
  PAF households reported a 22 percent increase in per capita consumption v. a 15 percent increase for non-PAF
control households.


                                                         19
by seasonal weather conditions and the rural conflict, the process was, however, delayed with
the baseline not completed until 2006 and resulting consequences for the overall timeline and
findings. While the 2008/09 survey generated valuable data, the analysis carried out by TU
themselves and reflected in their report had some critical methodological weaknesses (e.g., it
produced results for `program areas' which included both PAF participants and non-
participants, and compared these with overall results for control areas that included both the
poorest segments of the population and other segments who were not the poorest). Therefore,
the ICR used the data, but made revisions to capture results for only PAF participants in
program areas and compare these with results for the poorest segments of the population in the
control areas. Additional analysis of significantly higher quality was conducted by the Bank
team, however this has resulted in summary findings covering key indicators, but not a full
length report (see Annex 5).

Lessons learned and next steps: Lessons have been learned on a number of levels, including
that proper impact evaluation is a time and resource intensive process and that capacity building
of counterparts is an essential and worthwhile part of the process. With the institutional demand
for findings to inform future policy and planning decisions, it certainly should have been a
priority for the full impact evaluation report to be completed in line with the ICR timetable.
The exceptional experience of the Bank team in this field brought significant technical benefits,
but also limits in terms of multiple demands on their time ­ an institutional learning for the
Bank in terms of how systems could better enable the prioritization of technical support to
impact assessment for lending operations, with requisite resources. The next version of the
impact analysis will be a full report planned for early 2010. It will use two rounds of survey
data on a larger sample of households, villages and districts. It is anticipated that the expanded
impact evaluation should provide even more robust results, and also include additional
indicators on empowerment and voice.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance:

Compliance with environmental and social (indigenous peoples) safeguards was ensured by
incorporating these aspects in the manuals and sub-project appraisal criteria, and the Bank has
monitored their use during supervision. No significant issues have been observed.

PAF has complied with all fiduciary requirements with some delays in timing of submission
of annual procurement plan, trimester and annual reports and audits. During the initial period,
PAF has developed and adopted for implementation the combined operational and
implementation manual and guidelines, including all planning, management, finance,
procurement and monitoring aspects at various levels. This combined manual has been
periodically modified to address problems encountered under project implementation. The
manual was found to be sufficient and facilitated project operations well. Subsequently, a
financial management manual together with FinAppl software was developed and adopted for
financial management. Financial management information system became operational at an
earlier stage of implementation and the system appears to work satisfactorily. The Finance and
Procurement Units have suffered from a shortage of experienced staff during some periods of
implementation, especially following the scaling up after Additional Financing, although the
issues have been resolved.



                                               20
2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase:

PAF II (financed by an IDA grant of US$100 million, plus US$ 4 million of IFAD co-
financing) became effective before the PAF closure. The same Board and the Secretariat were
maintained to continue their functions under the PAF II. While PAF II would expand
geographically in phases, it continues to operate in the 25 districts which were covered by the
first PAF, but the current focus is to enter into new settlements in each VDC. In the Secretariat,
PMs in the first PAF have also been maintained.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

The PDO was, and still remains relevant to Nepal's development needs, as detailed in the third
pillar of the PRS which advocated social inclusion and targeted programmes for the poor and the
socially excluded. This was endorsed by the Bank's Interim Strategy Note (ISN), dated January
2007, which emphasizes the need for targeted support to the socially excluded groups and
women. The ISN proposed scaling up of PAF, and PAF II was approved with no major design
change, with this objective.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objective:

The Project Development Objective was to support the Government in implementing a new,
targeted instrument ­ the Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) ­ for reaching poor and excluded
communities. It aimed to improve access to income-generation projects and community
infrastructure for groups that had tended to be excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity and
caste, as well as for the poorest groups in rural communities. The following section assesses
achievements for the various dimensions of this PDO, indicating how the overall rating was
arrived at.

       (a) Implementing a new, targeted instrument for reaching the poor and socially excluded.
       With Bank support, which included several years of pre-project dialogue with the
       Government of Nepal on the appropriate institutional framework and mandate of the new
       instrument, PAF was created in 2004 as an autonomous body with strong leadership and
       has translated into an effective operational program in the midst of a very challenging
       environment. The quality of the institutional arrangement at the center, and the
       operational partnerships with local providers, has ensured delivery on the ground at a
       more rapid pace than planned and with high quality targeting and efficient delivery of
       services - despite a turbulent political economy. In this sense, the project has succeeded
       overwhelmingly in its objective of building and testing a very important institutional
       instrument that can continue to serve the needs of poor people in Nepal ­ and that has
       managed to do so, even in a fragile, conflict affected environment.




                                               21
(b) Actually reaching communities that had tended to be excluded by reasons of gender,
ethnicity and caste, as well as for the poorest groups in rural communities.

Overall, 159,777 households participated directly in 5,530 COs and benefited directly
from implementation of 6,596 sub-projects, which they had self-identified as their
priorities and took the lead in managing finances and implementation. Moreover,
considering non-members of COs, who also benefited from infrastructure sub-projects,
the total number of beneficiary households was 194,560. These achievements exceeded
targets.

The project also exceeded specific targets for reaching poor and traditionally excluded
groups. Among beneficiaries of income generation sub-projects under Component 1, 41%
were Dalit and 27% were Janajati. Beneficiaries of income generation sub-projects
under Component 3 included 26% Dalit and 66% Janajati. For infrastructure, where
beneficiaries included both CO and non-CO members, under Component 2 some 25%
were Dalit and 18% Janajati; and beneficiaries of infrastructure sub-projects under
Component 3 included 14% Dalit and 72% Janajati. Overall, of the total of 194,560
beneficiary households, 37% were Dalit and 44% were all indigenous groups.

Women represented 67% of total members of the COs established, 30% of total
chairpersons, 43% of total secretaries, and 60% of total treasurers. In addition to targeting
and ensuring representation of the typically excluded in leadership positions, the project
has had associated impacts on voice and empowerment of those groups. While this is
qualitatively more difficult to verify and is an outcome more readily reported based on
field visits and beneficiary consultation or using proxy indicators such as those above, the
evaluation data nonetheless attempts to benchmark changes utilizing an indicator of
decisions made by household head alone, versus decisions made in consultation with all
household members, thereby indicating greater voice of women in the household. The
data show a 100% increase in the decisions made by all household members (rising from
16.4% to 33.5%).

(c ) Improving access to income-generation projects by target groups.

The project MIS and evaluation activities, as well as the ICR exercise, indicate the
following findings with respect to incomes, consumption and employment.

While it is not possible to produce an aggregate economic return for a demand-driven
project comprising a wide range of sub-projects of different kinds, the ICR carried out an
assessment of incremental annual income, financial and economic viability of a small
sample of selected popular sub-projects (income generation and infrastructure) on the
basis of data collected during the mission through interviews with beneficiaries in
Kapilvastu and Pyuthan Districts. The analysis shows that all selected sub-projects are
financially and economically viable, and generate FRRs ranging from 21% for water
storage pond (60% vegetables and 40% wheat) to 847% for grocery shop (see Annex 3).
Household incremental annual incomes range from NRs. 4,500 for goat fattening to NRs.
25,650 for milking buffalo. ERRs of sub-projects range from 18% for goat fattening and
water storage pond (60% vegetables and 40% wheat) to 94% for check dam (20%


                                         22
      vegetables and 80% wheat). NPV ranges from NRs. 934 for household goat fattening to
      NRs. 6,005,012 for check dam sub-project (20% vegetables and 80% wheat). FRR and
      ERR of check dam are much higher if benefits beyond COs were to be included.
      Given the scale of livestock investments, the project could have made greater efforts to
      coordinate with private and public sector agencies to secure extension and veterinary
      support, develop insurance arrangements, etc. While evaluation shows that most
      individual investments were nevertheless productive, sustainability of such gains could
      be further increased with greater technical support.

      With regard to consumption, analysis by the ICR mission indicates a 47% greater
      improvement among beneficiaries of the PAF project compared with non-participants.
      This is especially significant given that the majority of PAF beneficiaries have been the
      poorest and traditionally most marginalized and excluded people within their
      communities. With regard to food security, evaluation data show that gains in food
      security have been made for project beneficiaries, with a reduction of 16% in those
      suffering from food security of less than 3 months and a rise of 9% in those who have
      food security of 10-12 months or more.
       
      The project had two impacts on employment. First, PAF analysis indicates that average
      hours worked per week of beneficiaries increased by 18 percent (from 29.9 to 35.4 hrs.
      per week) between the baseline in 2006 and end of project survey in 2008/09. Although
      this gain was less than for control group communities, this could be because households
      in the project area gained time savings, for instance, for collection of fodder, fuel wood
      (used of improved stove) and drinking water. Second, it is important to note that the rate
      for migration from the project area was lower than from the control area.

      (d) Improving access to community-infrastructure for target groups.
      As previously noted, owing to the demand-driven nature of the operation, the high
      poverty and food insecurity amongst target beneficiaries, and the circumstances of
      political conflict and associated (dis)incentives, uptake of infrastructure activities was
      much lower than for income generation. While the project did not set targets in this
      regard, and does not consider the lower number of infrastructure projects to be a failure,
      the number of sub-projects was lower than the indicative figures in the PAD. While the
      task team drew from global experience, they may have better anticipated the demand for
      productive assets over common infrastructure, given the target population and ongoing
      conflict. Greater technical efforts could also have been made to ensure that any
      operational constraints to infrastructure delivery were explored and addressed (e.g.,
      availability of technical assistance in remote areas; provision of rate banks/appropriate
      unit costs; quality of social mobilization).

The six key performance indicators to benchmark achievements under the PDO are outlined
earlier in Table 1 (p.10) and detailed in the Datasheet Section F (pp.iii-iv).

3.3   Cost Effectiveness




                                             23
      The PAD had asserted that unit costs for small-scale local infrastructure were lower when
      delivered through a community-based model than through central government agencies. The
      ICR mission referred to several studies in Nepal which showed that public investments and
      service delivery in which line ministries and central government planned, financed and
      executed indeed performed less well than did demand-driven participatory investments. The
      reasons may relate to factors such as the greater sense of ownership and more careful
      stewardship of resources which beneficiaries view as their `own', better knowledge of local
      prices and quality of local service providers than central agencies could reasonably possess,
      etc. Recent analysis of unit costs of selected infrastructure executed by central government
      and community organizations confirms that the latter are between 13% and 47.5% lower than
      the former, as summarized in the Table below:

3.4       Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

Rating: Satisfactory.

The rating is based on relevance, PDO achievement and efficiency, and reflects PAF's
successful results in implementing a new instrument to address the related problems of rural
poverty and social exclusion, reaching intended beneficiaries, both in terms of overall numbers
and participation by traditionally excluded indigenous groups, the poor and women.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered
or to amplify discussion above):

(a)       Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development



                                                     24
As noted earlier in this document, Nepal is a highly stratified society with acknowledged
exclusion of certain social groups, namely women, Dalit and certain Janajati groups, and
association between these social markers and wide economic disparities.9 These groups are much
more likely to have low incomes and assets, low human development indicators and to be largely
absent from decision-making at the community, local (VDC/DDC) and national levels.

The main social development outcome that the project has therefore sought is to begin to reverse
the exclusionary pattern of Nepal's previous development approaches. There is no question that
Nepal is a country of diversity on many dimensions. The 2001 census in Nepal identified 103
social groups based on caste, ethnicity, religion, and language. Caste groups accounted for 57.5%
of the population, ethnic groups or Janajati10 for 37.2%, religious minorities for 4.3%, and other
groups for the remaining 1%. With the majority of the population Hindu, there are deep caste
divisions in Nepalese society, with associated discrimination and abuses of lower-castes, such as
the Dalit.11 There is also linguistic diversity with only about 60% of the people speaking Nepali.
Low economic development, landlessness and poverty are widespread, particularly in remote
rural areas, and recent studies have highlighted the correlation between indicators of deprivation
and the conflict.12

Before initiating activities and selecting target VDCs in each district, the PAF carries out a
district-level social assessment to evaluate and map markers of exclusion and poverty. At the
village level, POs work with communities using participatory methods to identify and involve
the poor and socially disadvantaged. Results have been successful: 67% of household members
of COs were women, while there has been a high proportion (over-representation) of Dalit and
Janajati, in excess of project targets, as already noted. For Janajati, the success in targeting is
partly due to the geographic distribution of the chosen project districts. More impressive has
been the degree to which Dalit have become members of COs. The difficulty in reaching Dalit is
that they typically do not live geographically separate from other castes. Therefore, to reach them
it is necessary for the communities themselves to identify the lowest caste members as well as
the poorest. The social mobilization feature of the PAF has been particularly successful in
achieving this.

This focus on participation has been replicated from the grassroots up to Board level, with
representatives of excluded groups steering the PAF. The baseline and M&E system were
designed to collect qualitative and disaggregated quantitative data to assess the degree to which
the project is meeting its objective of improving the lives of rural people whose poverty,
location, caste, ethnicity or gender have excluded them from development benefits. In addition
to more tangible benefits, PAF also sought to change the way decisions are made in participating
communities and local bodies, so that in the longer term, women, Dalit and Janajati will have
more say in defining their needs and influencing decisions that affect them. Although more
difficult to measure, there are indications that PAF has also had an impact on empowerment, in

9
   e.g., the incidence of poverty amongst Dalit as a whole is nearly 50% higher than the national average (Unequal Citizens:
Gender, Caste and Ethnic Exclusion in Nepal, DFID/World Bank 2006)
10
   Indigenous peoples of Nepal. More than 50 different indigenous groups are known across the Himalayan, Hill and Terai
regions.
11
    The term dalit ­ meaning the oppressed ­ has been adopted by former `untouchable' caste groups, the lowest of the social
caste order. Although caste-based discrimination was outlawed in Nepal in 1963 it is still present in Nepalese society.

terms of the ability and opportunity for poor people to participate in, negotiate with, influence
and control the institutions that affect their lives and livelihoods. As indicated above, partial data
collected by PAF shows that excluded groups (Dalit and JJanajati) are strongly represented in
the leadership structure of COs. The same is true of women, who account for over one-third of
Chairpersons, 43% of Secretaries, and 60% of Treasurers (the latter's signature is required to
open a CO bank account). This early evidence of social change is also noted in the Borrower's
own ICR appended in Annex 5.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development): As already noted, the ICR finds that the project
has provided an opportunity for investment in an important institutional instrument that can serve
the needs of poor and typically marginalized people in Nepal, addressing both social and
economic priorities. It is also commendable that the operation deliberately partnered with local
NGOs in implementing activities in the field.

Section 1.1 has also described the lengthy engagement by the Bank with the Government,
during project preparation, and the value of such a dialogue in agreeing the optimal institutional
arrangements for PAF, giving it the flexibility and autonomy to actually reach poor and
traditionally marginalized groups and to respect the decision-making by these beneficiaries.
The institution has managed to institutionalize transparent and objective criteria for grant
making to the neediest groups, largely avoiding the elite and political capture that typically
threatens such operations.

(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative): (i) Community
finance: The original PAF design planned only for matching grants to COs, as instruments for
asset creation and seed capital investment for the poor, not for any kind of community financing
activity. However, in the early stages of implementation, COs themselves, supported by POs,
began to revolve the grant funds, enabling them to `stretch' and serve the needs of group
members in a much more sustainable manner. The Bank and PAF responded by putting in place
rules of operation to build community capacity in handling these funds, and to cultivate them as
future clients of financial services. Lessons from across the region indicate that it is important to
focus on building broader systems for capital development in the rural areas, expanding access to
financial services for livelihoods enhancement that include savings mobilization and credit
through community-based finance and with effective linkages to banks and micro-finance
institutions. While PAF was unable to directly address the very thin supply-side of micro-
finance ­ and perhaps could have made greater efforts to engage here ­ it did nonetheless
succeed in laying the foundations for community-based finance that will prove important in
attracting service providers to these rural areas in the future ­ now planned under PAF II. (ii)
Innovations Component: This was intended to support proposals meriting special consideration
owing to exceptional needs in a given context, or demonstrating innovative ways to improve
livelihoods development and reach targeted groups. As early take-up was slow, PAF decided to
use some of these resources to support the `Nepal Development Marketplace', as a venue to
attract innovative proposals. Greater attention could, however, have been paid by the Bank and
PAF to sharing/disseminating lessons or scaling up more successful innovations supported under
this sub-component.

Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes): N/A

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

 This rating reflects the fact that PAF II, which supports a very significant scaling up of the
 original project and Additional Financing, has been approved and is being implemented, and
 this will support PAF outcomes.

 Sustainability of income generating activities is best assessed in terms of economic viability and
 technical capability of the beneficiaries. Economic analysis shows reasonably high financial
 rates of returns on investments, while beneficiaries' technical capability seems to vary. Efforts
 have been underway to federate CO members into cooperatives, which would in turn serve to
 enhance market opportunities and technical capacity through learning. As the majority of
 income generation sub-projects are related to livestock production (dairy, goats and poultry) 13,
 animal mortality is a critical factor for sustainability. While mortality has not been a significant
 issue in PAF experience ­ there have been isolated disease outbreaks among goats in a couple
 of PAF districts during implementation ­ the Secretariat has nonetheless acknowledged best
 practice would be to reduce risks to beneficiaries choosing such investments as far as possible.
 They are therefore in the process of conceptualizing a livestock-insurance scheme14, but
 considerable work will be needed to field test its feasibility.

 Infrastructure sustainability depends on the quality of civil works, risk of physical damages (e.g.
 disasters), strength of O&M arrangements, provision for staff salaries in the case of schools and
 health clinics, and sense of ownership of beneficiaries which plays a major role in their
 willingness to maintain. To date no major issues have been observed, but the vast majority of
 sub-projects are still only a few years old and therefore will require monitoring over a longer
 period of time. It is notable, however, that, as reflected in the Borrower's own ICR (appended
 in Annex 6), setting up of an O&M committee by CO members including funds is a mandatory
 part of the infrastructure sub-project process.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and
outcome issues)

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:


13
   72 per cent of IGA subproject investments were in livestock-related activities; 12 per cent trade-related; 10 per
cent agriculture and forest-related; 3 per cent in services and 3 per cent in manufacturing. Out of total households
involved in livestock, about 30 per cent engaged in milk production through buffalo and cow raising; 64 per cent in
meat production (goats, pigs, poultry); 4 per cent in ox / buffalo raising either for farming or breeding purposes; and
the rest 2 per cent for transportation purposes.
14
   There is, however, already good experience in the region (e.g., India) and beyond (e.g., Mongolia's innovative
index-based livestock insurance program).


                                                          27
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Targeting the poorest and socially excluded groups in very disadvantaged rural areas was, and
remains, central to Nepal's poverty reduction objectives. The choice of a CDD type of
operation with an autonomous implementation entity was strategically valid for this purpose,
and the Bank rightly engaged in close dialogue with the Borrower on the appropriate
institutional framework and mandate for this entity before launching into detailed project
preparation. Once consensus on this had been developed, the preparation and appraisal period
was relatively short, and the quality of the key preparatory work enabled a smooth start-up,
which was commendable in light of the political tensions and conflict prevailing in the country.
The scale of the project was appropriate to a start-up operation in a country lacking experience
with demand-driven operations with direct financing to the community level; the design was
fairly simple and drew on Bank experience with CDD operations elsewhere; and it included a
sound balance between well defined components and a flexible window which allowed PAF to
move into new geographic areas and/or support innovative proposals as conditions would
warrant. The emphasis on placing beneficiaries in the driver's seat, both in setting priorities and
managing resources and sub-project implementation, as well as on transparency and information
dissemination, were critical elements that enabled this project to succeed in a conflict situation
while other less/non-participatory approaches did not. The project design included some
capacity building activities which would have made a contribution to decentralization of
government functions if political conditions had made this possible. The ICR considers that it
was a reasonable decision to include modest resources for this purpose given the political
uncertainties at the time. One area of weakness, however, was the preparation team's
assessment of the demand from beneficiaries in the areas of infrastructure and income
generating activities (IGAs). While the project did not seek to impose targets, implementation
support was originally organized on the basis of anticipated greater demand for community
infrastructure sub-projects. This left the project slower to react to the higher demand for IGAs
and associated support needed for optimal viability of economic activities, in terms of access to
finance, market linkages, etc. This may have been better diagnosed from the outset, given the
vulnerability of target groups and prevailing insecure environment.

(b) Quality of Supervision:

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank was challenged with providing implementation support to a community-based
program operating in dispersed, remote and conflict-affected areas. Extraordinary efforts were
made by team members, both headquarters and field-based staff, to cover remote areas and
verify first-hand the quality of project interventions. Bankwide expertise from outside the
South Asia Region was also brought in on issues of implementation in conflict settings,
evaluation, and CDD delivery mechanisms. There was an adequate number of formal
supervision missions, supplemented by shorter field visits by individual team members, as well
as supervision work carried out in the context of preparing Additional Financing and PAF II.
Collectively, Bank missions visited most of the project area, including numerous locations
accessible only by trekking. This was a major accomplishment given the CDD nature of the
operation, with activities in dispersed, remote and conflict-affected environs. Ten ISRs were
filed, averaging one every six months; overall DO and IP ratings were satisfactory throughout.


                                               28
A mid-term review was initially envisaged for early 2007; in the event, stocktaking took place
slightly earlier in 2006, as an integral part of the work of preparing the Additional Financing,
thereby precluding the need for a freestanding mid-term exercise. The task team worked closely
with PAF to continuously refine and strengthen project operational and delivery mechanisms,
e.g. the revolving fund approach for selected income generation activities. The fact that PAF, a
new institution charged with very challenging objectives in a difficult setting using, was able to
scale up at a strong pace to the point where it is now the largest poverty reduction program in
Nepal also speaks to the close partnership between the national and Bank teams throughout the
life of the project, in which Bank missions focused not only on supervision per se but
constructive implementation support as well.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This rating reflects high relevance of the project and generally appropriate design, especially in
relation to project institutional arrangements, choice of CDD approach and targeting, as well as
sound project supervision. The overall Moderately Satisfactory rating reflects, however, the fact
that quality at entry could have been stronger in relation to (i) assessment of possible strong
beneficiary demand for income generation activities and hence a need for related support
arrangements, and (ii) the M&E framework which focused relatively more on expected outputs
rather than outcomes. Both design issues were subsequently addressed well through supervision
support during implementation, the first through close Bank attention to revolving funds for
income generation sub-projects, and the second in the context of the project evaluation activities.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

The Government actively supported the concept of PAF as a tool to reach formerly excluded
groups in remote and extremely poor rural areas afflicted by longstanding conflict. It agreed to
establishment of an autonomous entity and promptly enacted legislations, showing a long-term
commitment to the PAF.

Despite the changes in political regimes and overall instability which prevailed in the country,
GON continued its commitment to PAF as demonstrated by its timely and adequate allocation
of counterpart budget. It by and large respected the PAF Board's autonomy although lesser
control over certain administration and procedural matters would have been conducive to
somewhat more efficient performance of the Secretariat.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory



                                                29
 The PAF Secretariat performed well throughout implementation. It has strong leadership and
 qualified technical personnel, which contributed to uncompromised targeting and effective
 delivery of project services to the beneficiaries. Staff turnover rate remained very low
 throughout the project period (12 out of 75 over five years); the quality, motivation and
 continuity of PAF staff contributed significantly to the success of the project, as well as to
 PAF's ability to implement the original project ahead of schedule and scale up significantly
 through Additional Financing.

 PAF's efforts were also commendable in actively seeking collaboration with different agencies
 to enhance sub-project performance at the community level. This is reflected in a considerable
 number of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed with NGOs and other agencies on
 topics such as poverty alleviation near protected areas, provisions of scholarship provisions,
 introduction of alternative energies, etc. Further, PAF's proactivity and innovation in working
 with the commercial banks to channel the funds directly to the beneficiaries also contributed to
 effective delivery of services to the beneficiaries.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

This rating reflects the continuous support of the Government to the PAF concept and institution,
from the design stage through completion (and subsequent launching of PAF II), and the quality,
integrity and commitment demonstrated by the PAF Board, Secretariat and staff throughout the
implementation of the project.


6.     Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wider general application)

 The following are the key lessons from the project:

           Getting the institutional basics right from the start. Investing sufficient effort in
           developing a consensus on the appropriate institutional set-up for a major new
           government initiative, before agreeing to support a project and launching into detailed
           preparation, is extremely important. In this case, close dialogue on the institutional
           framework and mandate of PAF, before the start of preparation, helped to ensure
           strong client buy-in which has extended through the life of the original project and its
           scaling up.

           The importance of continuity, local knowledge and continuing to perfect
           institutional arrangements. Staff continuity, both of counterpart and Bank teams,
           and the engaging of POs with intimate local knowledge and good track records have
           contributed to successful project implementation during a period of rapid scale up of
           the PAF program, even during periods of political transition and associated delays in
           some senior appointments at Board level. Going forward, it would be useful to
           review governance arrangements for such appointments as one of the options for
           further institutional strengthening under PAF II.


                                               30
    The special role which a CDD strategy and delivery mechanisms can play in
    conflict settings. A CDD approach may be appropriate to address extreme poverty
    and social exclusion in many situations, but it can be especially helpful in a conflict
    setting where traditional government interventions are not able to function.
    Beneficiary leadership in setting priorities and managing resources, very clear and
    simple operational rules of the game, and a strong emphasis on transparency and
    information dissemination are key CDD features which allowed this project to move
    forward despite conflict conditions on the ground. In addition, explicit targeting of
    typically marginalized and poorest groups in a setting where a stated grievance of the
    insurgents was the established practices of exclusion was an additional facilitating
    factor. Going forward, continuing to monitor closely the factors which enable PAF to
    operate in a conflicted and fragile environment may generate lessons of broader
    cross-country relevance.
 

    The importance of allowing beneficiary demand to drive investment choices,
    while monitoring carefully the factors/incentives which may be driving choices.
    In the case of Nepal, extremely poor and marginalized households have tended
    initially to prioritize fairly simple income generation activities over infrastructure
    investments, in order to improve family consumption and food security. Going
    forward under PAF II, cultivating demand for infrastructure may require innovative
    options for technical assistance and partnerships which reflect the extreme scarcity of
    these services in many of the more remote areas of the country. It may also be useful
    to review the standard per capita/CO allocation formulas which PAF has used to date,
    to assess whether these tilt incentives away from infrastructure and/or more costly
    income generation investments.

    Piloting and knowledge exchange in the process of scaling up. When there is intent
    to scale up a program significantly, it can be useful to carry out in advance some
    activities in the area to which the program will be extended, before the full scaling up.
    It is also important to take advantage of experience in the original `pilot' districts and
    mechanisms for regular skill-sharing, dissemination of lessons and knowledge
    exchange formalized in implementation, e.g., enabling POs and/or communities to
    peer learn from one another and ensure more consistent quality of social mobilization
    across geographic areas; to enable better scaling up of successes under the Innovation
    sub-component, etc.

    The challenges of developing appropriate M&E arrangements. Measurement and
    impact assessment of quantitative indicators, using a large statistical sample and
    rigorous methodology, requires significant time and resources and a process of
    technical support and capacity building. Challenges of topography, climate and
    political context in Nepal may compound and should be anticipated as far as possible.

    Using matching grants for income generation by the extreme poor, in a phased
    approach, as a bridge to sustainable market linkages and microfinance. Finally,


                                         31
         in a CDD project in which income generation sub-projects are supported through
         matching grants, a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the issue of linkages
         with markets and longer term transition to sustainable finance. PAF has approached
         these challenges through the institution of revolving funds and support for the
         emergence of co-operatives and producer federations, which have allowed
         beneficiaries to gain experience that, in later phases, will enable them to interact more
         effectively with regional and national market actors and microfinance institutions.
         These institutional arrangements have also ensured that matching grant resources
         remained in the public domain, rather than serving only as one-time private asset
         transfers. Going forward, this work needs to be intensified under PAF II and should
         benefit from knowledge exchange with other countries in the Region.

2.      The project was approved on June 1, 2004 with the objective of helping GON to
implement a new targeted instrument (PAF) for reaching poor and excluded communities in six
pilot districts. It was anticipated that if PAF proved successful, it would be scaled up in
subsequent phases. After two years of successful pilot implementation and owing to the rapid
pace of execution (PAF committed its available resources for the 6 districts two years ahead of
schedule), the Board of PAF decided to request Additional Financing to expand the program to a
further 19 districts. The Bank task team assessed that implementation arrangements were
working well in the initial six districts and supported GON's request to replicate the model in 19
other districts. In late 2006, the Bank approved this scaling up, expected to cost US$28.11
million equivalent.

1.           A total of 6,596 sub-projects were implemented by in 25 districts. They included
5,099 income generation sub-projects, 1,216 infrastructure sub-projects, and 281 innovation
activities. The ethnic composition and district distribution by type of sub-project are summarized
in the Table above. Some 5,530 COs participated, in 656 VDCs throughout the 25 districts
reached by the original project and Additional Financing. Overall, 159,777 households
benefitted directly as members of the COs. In addition, some non-CO members also benefited
from infrastructure sub-projects, bringing the total number of beneficiaries to 194,560 (122% of
the combined targets for the original and additional financing).

2.          Regarding social exclusion, central to the PDO, of total beneficiaries of income
generation sub-projects, 41% were Dalit and 27% Janajati. For combined sub-projects, 37% of
beneficiaries were Dalit and 34% Janajati. For infrastructure sub-projects, 16% of beneficiaries


                                                     36
were Dalit and 11% Janajati. Under the innovation program, Dalit accounted for 24% and
Janajati 66% of the total income generation beneficiaries. The corresponding figures were 14%
and 72% for infrastructure and 28% and 57% for the combined sub-projects.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      At appraisal, PAF was to focus on the rural poor by targeting disadvantaged and
marginalized groups, expanding their access to income generation and small-scale infrastructure
sub-projects, using a community-driven development (CDD) strategy, and helping to build the
capacity of various stakeholders, including beneficiary groups and local bodies. Due to its
demand-driven nature, the project did not lend itself to aggregate cost-benefit and rate of return
analyses. Beneficiaries would have wide discretion to prioritize their needs, and it was not
possible ex ante to predict the type or distribution of sub-projects communities would select.
Experience with CDD-type projects in some countries had been that poor communities first
prioritized infrastructure to meet essential basic needs (e.g., water supply in drought-prone
Northeast Brazil) and tended to opt for income generation sub-projects only in subsequent phases
of support. In Nepal, on the other hand, the majority of participating communities opted first for
income generation projects to help improve family consumption, improve food security and
reduce the need for migration.

2.      Targeted Poor and Excluded Groups. At project completion, 5,530 COs had been
formed and registered with PAF in 656 VDCs in 25 districts with a total of 159,777 members.
All six pilot districts and additional 19 districts were specifically chosen on the basis of the
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) aggregate welfare index of 28 different socio-economic
indicators. The 25 districts rank 51 to 75 among the 75 districts in total, and are the most
deprived in their respective geographical-climate zones. Of the total members of COs, the project
reached 68% hardcore poor, 24% medium poor and 8% poor. Similarly, CO memberships
included 40% Dalit, 29% Janajati, 20% Chhetri and 11% others, compared with the proportions
in the total population of 11% Dalit, 19% Janajati and 70% others.

4.     Voice and Empowerment. Gender-wise, women represented 67% of the total CO
membership. Women and excluded groups were represented in the leadership structure of COs:
30% of all chairpersons were women, 43% of secretaries and 60% of treasurers were also
women. In PAF Secretariat, among 71 staff, women represented about 11% of total, 3.6% each
are Dalit and Chhetri, and 21.4% Janajati.

5.    Beneficiaries.    At project completion, the 5,530 COs benefited directly from
implementation of 5,099 income generation sub-projects and 1,216 infrastructure sub-projects.
Considering non-member of COs who also benefited from infrastructure sub-projects, the total
number of beneficiary households is 194,560. All members of the 5,530 COs participated in a
community saving scheme for emergencies.

6.      Cost Effectiveness and Service Delivery of Infrastructure. As stated earlier, due to its
demand­driven nature, the project did not lend itself to aggregate cost-benefit analysis and rate
of return calculations. However, the ICR mission referred to several studies in Nepal which
showed that public investments and service delivery in which line ministries and central
government planned, financed and executed perform less well than participatory investments
centered on community organizations. Recent unit costs of selected infrastructure executed by
central government and community organizations confirm that the latter are between 13% and

7.     Interviews conducted by the ICR mission in 12 COs indicated that due to ownership in
construction and maintenance, community driven infrastructure has provided better service
delivery than that provided by public agencies.

8.     A survey conducted in early 2009 showed that per capita consumption in the project area
increased by 50% more than in the control area. Extracting only those sub-projects completed in
2006, and analyzing impacts on a longer time horizon, the findings suggest higher increases of
household expenditure (by 29%) and income (19%).

9.      Employment (number working hours per week) in the project area increased by 18%, but
this was lower than the 27% recorded in the control area. This could be because households in
the project area gained time savings, for instance, for collection of fodder, fuel wood (used of
improved stove) and drinking water. It is also important to note that the rate for migration from
the project area was lower than from the control area.

10.     Regarding food security, the number of households with less than three months of food in
the project area decreased by 3.2%, while the number increased by 5% in the control area.

11.     Incremental Annual Income, Financial and Economic Rates of Return. Efforts have
been made to assess incremental annual income, financial and economic viability of selected
popular income generation sub-projects and infrastructure sub-projects investments. Cost and
benefit data were collected by the ICR mission during field visits to both terai and hill areas in
Kapilvastu District and Pyuthan District.

goat fattening and water storage pond (60% vegetables and 40% wheat) to 94% for check dam
(20% vegetables and 80% wheat). NPV ranges from NRs. 934 for household goat fattening to
NRs. 6,005,012 for check dam sub-project (20% vegetables and 80% wheat). FRR and ERR of
check dam are much higher if benefits beyond CO have been included.

income generation and infrastructure have been calculated for a production cycle of 5 years
based on economic life of buildings, 10 years for water storage pond and 20 years for check dam.

Annex 5: Impact Evaluation of the Nepal Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) program

1.   Introduction

Nepal Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) is an IDA-supported targeted instrument to reach the poor
and the excluded population groups with an aim to increase their access to income-generation
and community infrastructure. The three main indicators of this demand-driven and community-
centered program were: 1) reaching the poorest and traditionally excluded, 2) increasing their
incomes, and 3) enhancing their voice and participation in community decision-making.

PAF at the outset emphasized on the need to institute a rigorous impact evaluation. The impact
evaluation was designed as a long-term partnership in an effort to assure quality and build
capacity of the counterparts in the PAF secretariat, an approach was adopted that brought
together Tribhuvan University as responsible for the field-based data collection and a Bank team
to provide technical inputs in the design and supervision of surveys, and data analysis. This was
possibly the first instance where GON, the Bank and private sector (in the form of TU) jointly
initiated a rigorous evaluation effort in the country. The process would involve conducting initial
baseline survey of treatment and control areas and households, subsequent follow-up surveys,
and analysis of data from multiple rounds to measure impact and assess results.

The Bank team supported the PAF secretariat with design of the evaluation, including sampling,
drafting of questionnaires, piloting them and supervision of the actual surveys. The data
collection task was contracted to the Central Department of Population Studies at Tribhuvan
University (TU) through competitive selection, to undertake both the baseline survey (2006) and
the follow-up survey (2008/9) on a sample of about approximately 2000 households in about 150
villages (also the primary sampling units, PSU) from nine districts located across different
geographic regions of the country. While the baseline was conducted in the summer of 2006, the
follow-up survey took place in the winter of 2008/2009 and for reasons related to weather and
accessibility, the follow-up was carried out in four treatment districts and two control districts, a
total of six (instead of the nine in the baseline).

This note provides preliminary results on the impact of PAF program on welfare increase from
an analysis of two rounds of survey data from a panel sample of households from six districts.

2.   Data Description

Both the baseline and follow-up surveys used multi-module household and community
questionnaires. The first step involved conducting a census of all households in the primary
sampling units (villages) and the in the case of the follow-up survey also gathering basic
information on the identification of treatment and non-treatment households in the villages with
PAF interventions. The second step administered a multi-module detailed household
questionnaire to the household selected for the survey. The questionnaire was adapted from
Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS) and included detailed information on socio-economic
and demographic issues, including education, health and nutrition, housing conditions and

with the NLSS survey based welfare measures, PAF surveys included a very similar

consumption module and followed the exact same methodology to compute the aggregate
consumption data at the household level. The follow-up survey included additional section on the
details of households' engagement in and benefits from PAF activities. Finally, there was a
community questionnaire administered in each PSU to gather information on basic services,
accessibility and other development activities.

The sample of households and villages in the analysis are as follows:

3.   Methodology

The analysis uses difference-in-difference method to estimate the impact of PAF by comparing
the growth in per capita consumption during 2006-2008, between the treatment group and the
control group. Consumption is considered to be a better measure than income since it captures
the family's expectations of a more permanent change in future income than current income
alone. The treatment group consists of households in the panel sample who directly benefited
from PAF interventions and the control group, for the purpose of this preliminary analysis,
consists of panel households from the non-PAF villages.




                                                45
For two periods of data, this can be estimated using the convenient regression:


                ln( y i )     Pi   i

where  ln( yi ) denotes growth in per capita consumption for household i, P is the categorical
variable that takes a value 1 for PAF households and 0 otherwise. The coefficient  measures
the net impact of the PAF program, while the standard error of the coefficient would provide the
statistical significance. The main identification assumption in the simple difference-in-difference
(DD) estimator is that outcomes in treated and control groups would have followed a parallel
path in the absence of the program. In other words, growth in per capita consumption would have
been the same in both groups had there been no PAF program introduced.

However, this assumption may not be fully satisfied because of the fact that PAF program was
not randomly assigned but targeted to poor villages and in particular poor households. This
implies that the targeting criteria itself may be influencing subsequent growth rates, leading to
selection bias and posing an important evaluation problem (Ravallion, 2005). In other words, the
success in reaching the poor makes the challenge of evaluating the impact more difficult since
we would expect, based on the literature, that PAF CO members are not the most likely to make
good use of the funds. Therefore, the initial conditions of the sample households must be
carefully controlled in order to counter this natural tradeoff. Jalan and Ravallion (1998) illustrate
this point in their impact assessment of poor-area development programs in China.

The analysis here uses two ways to correct for this complication: regression of growth in per
capita consumption between the two rounds controlling for a number of initial family conditions,
and by using propensity score matching on key household characteristics so that both treatment
and control households are made equally likely to participate in the program. "Panel structure" of
the sample (same households interviewed in before and after the program was in place) makes
the correction easier. The independent variables, other than the treatment variable ("was this
household part of a PAF CO?") included the household size, gender of the household head,
whether the household is dalit or janjati and education attainment of household head.

4.   Results

Table 2 presents the results of the simple DD estimation and modified DD estimations using both
augmented regression method and propensity score matching method to control for initial
conditions. Specification (1) provides the simple DD estimate for the full panel sample, (2)
denotes the propensity score matched estimate, and (3) refers to the DD regression with other
correlates controlling for key baseline characteristics. Columns (4) through (6) provide the same
estimates for the poorest half of the sample in each of the treatment and control groups.

Notes: 1. T-statistics in parentheses and * p-value<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001
       2. Propensity score matching estimates average treatment effect on the treated using radius matching. In
addition to the other correlates in specifications (3) or (6), propensity score matching method matches on baseline
per capita income measure as well.

As reported in table 2, the estimates indicate that on average, the net impact of PAF was about 7
percentage points in the growth rate of per capita consumption. This result is statistically
significant at conventional levels as seen from t-stats and p-values reported in the table. While
the sample as a whole enjoyed a 19.5 percent increase on average in per capita consumption, the
6.9 percentage points difference (specification (1) of table 2) on PAF participation means that
PAF CO households gained about 21.5 percent per capita consumption over the period in
contrast to 14.6 percent in non-PAF households.




                                                        47
These results are robust across methods that correct for potential selection bias using propensity
score matching method (specification (2)) and augmented regression that controls for initial
conditions (specification (3)).

Because PAF targets the poorest households, the analysis also looks at the impact on the poorest
of the poor (the poorest half of the sample in each of the treatment and control groups). The
estimates as reported in specifications (4) to (6) suggest that the net impact in the growth in per
capita consumption was even higher at 11 percentage points. The results are again robust across
different methodologies.


5.   Next Steps:

The next round of analysis with full evaluation report, scheduled for 2010, will use two rounds of
survey data on a larger sample of households, villages and districts. The second round survey of
this large sample, whose baseline was conducted in 2007, is planned for late 2009 or early 2010.
It is anticipated that the expanded impact evaluation should provide even more robust results,
and also include additional indicators on empowerment and voice.

1.     Background:
Poverty Alleviation Fund is an initiative to support the third pillar of 10th plan, which is also
known as Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The third pillar is aimed at ensuring social
and economic inclusion of the poor, marginalized groups and less developed regions, through
targeted Programmes.

2. Project Development Objective:
The project development objective is to support Government of Nepal in implementing a new
targeted instrument to improve access to income-generation sub-projects and community
infrastructure for the groups that have tended to be excluded by reasons of gender, caste and
ethnicity as well as for the poorest groups in rural communities. It intends to improve income,
employment, food security and voice and influence in decision making of the target groups (i.e.
those who are poor and excluded: the women, Dalit and Janajati).

3. Project Components:
The following are original project components as described in Project Appraisal Document
(PAD)
 Income Generation Sub-projects targeted to the poorest and excluded groups
 Small Scale Village and Community Infrastructure Sub-projects
 Innovation and Special Programme Window
 Capacity Building on:
          o Social mobilization,
          o Local bodies,
          o Target groups,
          o Micro-finance intermediaries,
          o Information monitoring and evaluation
  PAF administration

4. Quality at Entry:

The project was well designed (i.e. demand driven, directly working in the community through
partners and direct funding) to ensure transparency and community institution building. The
design has its own relevancy in the context of political instability coupled with insurgency
situation.
Manuals on operation and financial management were prepared before the project becomes
effective. However, social mobilization approach and community organization formation part
were not clear in the beginning such as the size of the Community Organization (CO) groups, the
lowest operational unit. Based on above manuals, Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) secretariat,
prepared detailed a social mobilization and implementation manual for Parter Organization (PO)
and Community Organization (CO). This exercise also helped for team building and motivating
secretariat staff to implement the program with a sense of ownership.



                                               49
Though infrastructure investment share is expected to be high than that of income generation in
the PAD, the case has been different since the communities have demanded Income Generating
(IG) activities in their first cycle of demand.
Capacity building of the local bodies (DDC, VDC) as envisaged in the PAD was important for
the long term sustainability and ownership of the PAF program. Unfortunately PAF could not
work much in this part because of political unrest and insurgency. There are no elected
representatives in Village Development Committee (VDC) and District Development Committee
(DDC) for the last 7/8 years. VDC has been run solely by a secretary, who would stay in the
district head quarter to run the administration. However, the situation has now improved after the
restoration of peace in the country. Consultation between all political parties is underway to
establish local bodies.
Capacity building of Micro-finance institutions (MFIs) is another important component
mentioned in PAD. But in practice, it was found too early to work in this front at the initial days
as outreach of MFIs was not in the rural areas. With the 4 years of implementation on the
ground, now PAF COs are federated at the VDC level and furthermore they are forming
cooperatives among themselves. PAF support to COs and cooperatives formed by the COs are
of significant important for the long run as the revolving fund created by the COs will certainly
require financial linkages with MFIs. In this context, capacity building of MFIs will be quite
relevant for linkage development between CO or CO's cooperatives and MFIs in the days to
come.
The approach adopted to mobilize more local Partner Organizations (PO) and Service Agencies
(SAs) was appropriate in light of the country's situation. It was a valuable asset that provided an
opportunity to tap their local work experiences and social capital with the community and other
stakeholders in the districts.

5. Outcome/Achievement:
5.1             Outcome
The Government of Nepal has given high priority for implementation of targeted program
through "Poverty Alleviation Fund", thus established it through separate Act after the
reinstatement of parliament.

PAF was also able to attract qualified and motivated staff sensitive to the poor. The turn over rate
also remained very low i.e. 12 out of 75 in five years time period.
As PAF gained experience and demonstrated its ability to reach targeted groups effectively with
sound mechanism, the program was expanded from initial six districts to 25 poorest districts
after about two year of implementation. The IDA (WB-World Bank, International Development
Agency) additional financing supported for this expansion.
PAF targeting mechanism ensured to include poor in Community Organization especially
focusing on most disadvantaged and excluded groups such as dalit, janajati and women. They are
empowered involving and developing capacity in planning, implementing and managing their
schemes. Of the 159,777 poor House Hold (HHs) members representing in COs, 39.48 per cent
are Dalit, 29.09 per cent are janajati and 67 per cent are Women. Among these CO members
68.21 per cent belong to hardcore poor ("Ka"), 23.59 per cent medium poor (Kha), 7.92 per cent
poor (Ga) and 0.28 per cent marginal non-poor. Out of 159,777 HHs total CO members,
155,636 HHs are benefiting from different sub-projects support by PAF. Income Generating
sub-projects benefited 143,058 HHs and 33,376 HHs are benefited by the Small Scaled
Infrastructures. Of these beneficiaries 39 per cent are Dalit and 28 per cent Janajati. Among
these beneficiary HHs, 67 per cent are women.
When percentage beneficiery of PAF by ethinicity compared with district percentage ethnicity
composition, as shown in the Figure 1, it is clear that PAF is focusing on socially excluded
groups such as Dalit and Janajati. In the overall scenerio of 25 districts, PAF-I benefited 37.8 per
cent of poor households in 25 districts (155,636 Poor HHs out of 412,220 poor HHs in 25
districts).
PAF is implementing demand driven program with open menu. The COs first choice of
investment is found to be on income generation activities that help to enhance food security,
improve the condition for children to attend school and reduce household migration. In total,
5,099 income generation and 1,216 Infrastructure sub-proejcts are implemented by the
communties.
Infrastructure sub-project also includes non-poor non-CO members of the community. Including
non-CO memebers, a total of 194,560 HHs are benefited, among which 37 per cent are Dalit, 28
per cent are janajati and 35 per cent are from other groups. PAF is now working in 48 per cent
of VDCs in 25 PAF districts (617 VDCs out of 1275).
In this endeavor, PAF has made partnership with 179 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
and 10 Local Development Fund (LDF) of District Development Committees (DDCs). Further
PAF made collaboration with numbers of institutions while implementing the program in
districts.

PAF has developed a long term vision document to reach out at least 84 per cent poor of the
country with projected coverage plan, bring them in sustained path out of poverty and estimated
budget up to the Year 2025. It has helped further to continue program and plan to mobilize
resource.
The performance audit was conducted by the Office of the Auditor General, Nepal (OAG) to
ascertain economy, efficiency and effectiveness of PAF programs. Audit report has lauded PAF
for efficient management of its programs and bringing in positive changes in the lives of the poor
and excluded groups. It had audited the grant provided to the COs and reviewed the activities of
partner organizations (POs). The audit covered 52 sub-project agreements of Kapilvastu, 34 sup-
project agreements of Ramechhap, 44 sub-projects of Darchula and 32 sub-project of Jumla
district. Analysis of the OAG revealed that PAF intervension covered most of the poor
communities selected by participatory approach. Practice of collective decision making has
promoted the sense of ownership and maintained transparency. Improvement of income and
savings was noticed, it said.
The findings of the Rate of Return study in 2006 indicates that the CO sub-project schemes are
successful in generating income by and large except in few cases where losses have been mainly
due to external causes like disease and natural calamities. The cost benefit analysis was
computed based on; i) the Return on Investment; ii) the Holding period return; and payback
analysis. The level of earning or return to investment in income generating activity based on
district is positive. All district schemes demonstrate positive returns against gross income.
The case studies conducted in 2008 prepared seventeen different cases covering community
infrastructures and income generating activities. The case studies revealed that Programme
beneficiaries have reaped good benefit from their undertakings. Actual beneficiaries have



                                                                52
expressed in different ways such as "PAF is like the God for the Destitute"; "From Destitution to
Sahuni (i.e. Rich), and "Why go Abroad Now" among other.
Despite the conflict situation in the country Government of Nepal prioritized implementation of
targeted program through PAF and facilitated by releasing the necessary fund and supporting to
access more fund through the donor. PAF is able to attract additional funding from the IDA and
in second project. IFAD (International Fund for Agriculture Development) also joined as a co-
financer in PAF ­ II by providing US$ 4 M for capacity development of CO, PO and PAF.

6. Coordination, Collaboration and Partnership Forging:
Coordination and partnership forging is a major thrust of PAF's working strategy, as a result,
MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) have been made with different agencies and other
development partners to achieve synergy effect. PAF collaborated with different agencies in
implementation of priority programs chosen by the communities. This shows PAF approach has
been well accepted and other programs are showing interest to work with PAF.
As a result PAF entered into MoU and working with the following agencies:
      Department of National Parks and Wild Life Conservation (DNPWC) ­ to implement
      poverty alleviation activities in and around protected areas in PAF program districts as per
      approved management plan of the respective protected areas.
      Jiri Technical School for the vocational trainings particularly Auxiliary Nurse Midwifery
      (ANMs).
      Partnership established with the South Asia Foundation (SAF) and Jiri Technical School
      (JTS), Council of Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) to train ANM
      from the Fiscal Year 2006/07 and 2007/08 channeled Madanjeet ANM scholarship 48 and
      36 in PAF working districts. This partnership continued in the FY 2008/09 to train 80
      ANM students.
      WINROCK ­ International ­ working for V-SAT installation for community tele centre
      establishment and Jatropha promotion as bio-diesel.



                                                    53
     Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) ­ to promote alternative energy such as
     micro-hydro, solar energy and bio-gas plant.
     Partnership forged with ROTARY Club Kathmandu Mid-Town and Kavre Health Training
     Institute (KHTI ­Kavre) ­ to harness the ROTARY Scholarship Program train 4 ANMs in
     FY2007/08 and 18 Auxiliary ANMs .
     ICIMOD ­ for technology transfer.
     World Food Programme (WFP) ­ work jointly for the benefit of PAF target community by
     linking food aid for the community infrastructure sub-projects.
     Bio-gas Support Programme (BSP) ­ to promote bio-gas in poor households.
     Department of Irrigation, GoN ­ to promote irrigation facility to the poor.


6.1 Co-ordination and Partnership with VDC/DDC:
DDCs were involved from the very the beginning of the Pogramme including organizing
orientation to the stakeholders at DDC, PO selection, VDC selection, CO's sub-project proposal
integration in VDC/DDC plan. Stakeholders and VDC secretaries are oriented on Programme in
DDC orientation.
Local bodies (DDC/VDC) have responded positively to the demand of the poor and excluded
communities. DDC/VDC has given letter of recommendation for PAF supported community
sub-projects on income generation and community infrastructures. DDC/VDCs have also started
to provide their financial support to the community infrastructure sub-projects. Local bodies (i.e.
DDC/VDC) have provided a total sum of Rs. 57,192,181 against COs sub-project total cost Rs.
2,938,211,744 for the implementation. PAF POs provided progress reports to the DDCs on a
trimester basis.
The Local Development Fund (LDF) of 10 DDCs have come forward as a direct partner
organizations with PAF in carrying out poverty alleviation activities at the selected VDCs of the
district. They are namely, Bajhang, Dailekh, Jajarkot, Kalikot, Mahotari, Ramechhap, Rasuwa,
Rautahat, Sarlahi and Sindhuli.
A year ago, PAF and the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) entered into a MoU on 1 April,
2008 for sharing of information, cooperation, coordination and monitoring of Programme.

7. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome:
Prevailing conflict situation at the beginning of the project was a challenge for programme
implementation. However, with the direct involvement of communities and high degree of
transparency at the local level helped to implement the program without major difficulties.
Implementation was not disrupted except Pyuthan District, where implementation was suspended
for a year in 2005/06 because of opposition from Maoist district cadres.
Against all odds, government of Nepal maintained its continued support to PAF with the
introduction of PAF Act in 2006 and along with allocation of annual budget to the PAF. By and
large, the implementation is undergoing smoothly across the country.




                                                54
8. Sustainability:
Government of Nepal has entrusted PAF to reach out the poor and excluded groups through
targeted program. PAF has been established as an independent institution to implement targeted
program through a separate Act of Parliament.
Social inclusion and targeting also feature prominently in the Governments' Three Year Interim
Plan also. Government is not only supporting PAF in terms of counter part fund only but also
some separate fund has also been put in the PAF to implement targeted program.. Local
government bodies mainly VDCs and DDCs also contributed in implementation of infrastructure
projects at local level in different districts. The Government funding amounts to US$ 1.6m which
is 698 per cent higher than that of initial design and community contribution is 316 per cent
higher than the initial design (See annex 1).
Community needs to contribute 10 per cent of the fund required for the income generation
activity they have chosen. Further, arrangement is made to remain PAF grant for income
generation with the community as revolving fund under the management of community
organization (CO). These arrangements provided strong incentive to choose and invest in
activities that sustainably contribute to their livelihood. Further, access to fund made at the
community provided chance to enhance their livelihood activities further and increase income
sustainably.
The revolving fund has been created in CO with the accumulating interest and principal amount
re-paid by the IGAs beneficiary HHs. It will help community for access of loan to take income
generating activities constantly. All COs met regularly ­ at least once in a month and even more
as per their needs. Most of the COs are practicing their regular savings. The amounts saved
through their internal savings are used both for consumptive and social purposes. CO meetings
are led by the key position holders including Dalit, janajaties and women. CO members are
largely satisfied with the group decisions. CO meeting covers wide range of local issues /
problems and come-up with the logical conclusion.
PAF has accorded higher priority for transparency at all level of implementation. Information on
plan, budget and progress status are provided to the VDC and DDC on trimester basis including
the budget provided to each PO and CO. Sub-project information including budget are displayed
in the public place and in the project sites. Public audit is carried out by CO at the community
level in the presence of concerned stakeholders. Financial auditing of CO and PO is performed
every year end by the registered auditor.
As the scale of the work increased, considerable numbers of households in different COs are
doing similar activities and they feel the need of collective effort for collection of their
production and marketing for efficiency and cost effectiveness.
Stepping towards institutional development, COs are further organizing into CO Network/
federation ­ a higher order community institution at village level. There are 130 different such
community institutions at present and the trend is increasing. It has helped them to link-up their
plan and project with VDC/DDC plan and demand for service / resources. It also creates an
environment to undertake community infrastructure and market linkages that serve more than
one CO. Basically, these federated COs are actively involved in experience sharing of each ­
other COs, develop common understanding for common sub-projects/activities, advocate
Programme and promote both vertical and transverse coordination, explore resources for their




                                               55
planned activities with DDC/VDC and other development partners. It could be one of a best
option for the CO's institutional development and sustainability.
Realizing their need for market linkages and inputs requirements, COs have also amalgamated in
the forms of cooperatives which in turn has helped them to promote market ­ led economic
activities. There are several such examples--one in Mugu, two in Siraha and two in Kapilvastu
Districts. They have also established marketing centers, which would eventually served to
enhance market opportunities and technical capacity through learning. Efforts are underway to
federate CO members into a cooperative, in other districts as well. This indicates that community
institutional development process is undertaking towards a path of sustainability.
More importantly, 5099 IGAs implemented by 5530 COs are continued on their own even after
the project completion. Majority of CO members have been able to make profits through their IG
enterprises and it has supported them in food security, education and health.
The demand on infrastructure which came mostly on the second stage of mobilization ensured
that they reflect the demand of the poor, who are already organized and they are linked directly
to the livelihood. Most of the infrastructure sub-projects beneficiaries are poor HH and these
infrastructures are managed by the poor HHs. This has contributed in the empowerment of poor
and socially excluded groups. The operation and maintenance arrangements are made in all
infrastructure schemes which indicate its sustainability. Community is taking in charge of
operation and maintenance. In each community infrastructure sub-project, a 3-4 members O & M
(Operation and Maintenance) committee from among the CO members is mandatory together
with the allocation of 5-10 per cent of the total sub-project cost for thee regular maintenance and
operation.
PAF had implemented its program transparently and cost effectively. Of the total expenditure of
US$ 34.33m, 79.37per cent disbursed to community account to COs for implementation of sub-
projects chosen by the community, 12.28 per cent to POs for facilitation and provide capacity
building and technical support to the communities. The rest 3.14 per cent spent for training,
capacity building and monitoring; 1.09 per cent for vehicles, furniture and fixed assets for PAF;
and only 4.12 per cent for PAF operation (see Annex 1).
The above fact clearly demonstrates that PAF and its program are heading towards sustainability.

9. Bank Performance:
World Bank Nepal country office - officials are carrying out regular visit to monitor PAF
activities in the project sites. They independently assess the works of PAF based on wide range
of indicators, issues and provide feedback to PAF and the Bank accordingly. Bi-annual
supervision mission from IDA/WB pay field visit, where they hold interaction with the
community people and collect feedback from them. The Mission report with feedback helps
improve implementation. Occasional field visits and field monitoring/study by the specialists of
the World Bank are also carried out. This has helped improve program implementation, refine
process, policy and strategies.Timely decision, clearances, guidance and feedback are provided
by the WB Nepal office as and when necessary.

10. Monitoring & Evaluation System:
PAF secretariat has a Monitoring Division with Monitoring Chief, along with Research and
Development Officer to look after regular and periodic monitoring/ evaluation. Regular



                                                56
monitoring is carried out in coordination with the Program Division Chief under whom are 25
Portfolio Managers, each one in-charge of coordination and supporting district implementation.
To collect information for progress reports, they spend most of their time in the field; they also
hire local consultants to help them collect and verify information from the PO and COs on
physical and financial progress of sub-projects.

11. Monitoring
PAF has established a Management Information System (MIS) in PAF office. It is a need based,
well developed in due course of time, working in the process mode. Now, PAF MIS has
maintained data and provides all the information and memos related to the contract management,
sub-project information/status including CO, PO and PAF staff. All PAF professional staff has
access to the MIS. The MIS unit is headed by an MIS officer who designed, developed and
maintains the PMIS. MIS unit provides information for all the reports (PMR-Project
Management Report, progress report, and memo for TAC-Technical Appraisal Committee etc).
Regular technical monitoring of each infra sub-project implemented by CO is regularly
monitored by the PO's technical person and PMs of PAF, whereas periodic monitoring of 60 sub-
projects of infrastructure was carried out by PAF Infrastructure Division and DEAN consultants
independently.

11.1 Participatory Monitoring System
PAF is adopting participatory monitoring system to monitor, provide feed-back for
implementation improvement to achieve project objectives. Monitoring start at individual or
beneficiary level and focuses on community itself for regular monitoring, feed-back for
improvement immediately for optimum delivery. Different agencies and individuals are involved
at different levels in monitoring system.
Monitoring by Community-A monitoring sub-committee formed in and within CO at
settlement level, monitors each development activities implemented in the community including
income generating sub-project beneficiary. Findings of the monitoring by the monitoring sub-
committee, presents and discuss in CO's regular meeting ­ at least once a month. Sharing and
discussion in CO recommends corrective measures to improve implementation.
So far five thousand five hundred thirty monitoring sub-committees at settlement level has been
formed where 16,590 members are directly involved in monitoring of the community sub-project
activities. Federated CO helps in monitoring of the CO's work at VDC level for timely feed-
back and effective implementation.
Monitoring by PO- One social mobiliser has been allocated for each VDC. A field supervisor
also regularly supervises the work of each CO and provides instant feed ­ back with necessary
support including information and link-up with technical assistances. Similarly, Programme
Coordinator (PC) of a PO is responsible for day-to-day work monitoring of PO's staffs including
regular reporting. Periodic monitoring by the board/members of the PO, particularly on the CO
sub-project level work progress ensure input-output within the stipulated time as per the
agreement with PAF. This kind of regular and periodic monitoring mechanism is in operation in
25 districts - 5,530 settlements of 656 VDCs being monitored by 189 different partner
organizations.




                                               57
Monthly POs review meeting at the district level has been devised to share experiences among
the POs, help built capacity and thresh out Programme implementation related issues. It has been
proved an effective tool to track what is going on in the field level and harness lesions, act
immediately for effective implementation.
Monitoring by DDC/ Stakeholders - Periodic monitoring by the district stakeholders (DDC,
line agencies, representatives of political parties, journalist) has been taking place regularly for
periodic monitoring and provide feedback at district level. District level stakeholders particularly
DDC / VDCs, line agencies (LAs), other development partners working in the district,
representatives of the political parties, journalists and partner organizations, representatives of
the COs participate in this review.
Monitoring by PAF- PAF is conducting periodic monitoring by its professional staffs and
mobilizing service agencies (SA). Portfolio Manager (PM) is responsible for Programme level
periodic monitoring of their assigned district to ensure timely delivery of PAF services / inputs to
the community through POs. However, this is a daunting task to cover wide range of indicators
related to the process, inputs, and outputs ­ practically a PM may not able to reach each CO of
the district. Hence, PM also mobilized SAs as per requirement.
Each CO, prior to the registration is appraised rigorously on its formation process, inclusiveness,
identification of the poor households, formation of CO, composition of the executives etc.
Before sub-project agreement, each sub-project was appraised rigorously interacting with CO/
beneficiary. Such appraisal covers process indicators and indicators related to the community
ownership/participation for the proposed sub-projects. In the case of infrastructure sub-projects,
technical proposal of each one were scrutinized and appraised in the field for the decision.
Implementation or mid-term monitoring has been devised to monitor each sub-project during its
implementation phase. In this monitoring, inputs (human resources, fund, and material) and
implementation process, technical inputs, community contribution/participation were monitored.
PAF secretariat team with 57 professional staffs including the Vice-Chairperson (VC) and
Executive Director (ED) are involved in periodic monitoring through field visit. It covers a wide
range of indicators related to the process, inputs, output and outcomes; useful to get feedback
from the field.
PAF Programme review workshop has been held among the POs/ staffs in each development
regions to thresh out implementation issues. It is an effective tool to discuss and share what
worked and what did not worked in different geographical and socio-economic conditions. It
helps to track Programme implementation situation, document lessons and explore innovative
ideas and develop different strategies.
Monitoring by GON - PAF directly reports to the Prime minister's Officer (PMO) including to
the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Officials of these two high offices including National Planning
Commission (NPC) periodically pay visit to the PAF operational areas. This has helped to know
operational level strengths and weaknesses of the Programme and suggest accordingly, and also
take stocks for policy formulation on poverty alleviation.
Monitoring by IDA/WB -World Bank country office - officials pay regular visit to monitor PAF
works in the field in a regular interval. They independently assess the works of PAF and provide
feed-back to PAF and the Bank. Similarly, bi-annual supervision mission from IDA/WB pay
field visit for monitoring.



                                                58
11.2 Case Studies and Issue Based Studies:
Case studies of seventeen different cases were done, documented lessons, published and
circulated to the different stakeholders. Similarly, issue based study is devised to take up
contemporary issues related to the poverty. As PAF is working in process approach with flexible
and receptive mode, these studies helps enrich knowledge ­ capture lessons and improve
Programme implementation.

12. Communications and Outreach
Communications is critical to create demand from beneficiaries ensure transparency and foster
partnership and learning across stakeholders. PAF communications and outreach activities are in
consonance with the updated PAF communication strategy, which has clearly prioritized
different, set of activities for different tiers of audiences. PAF communication strategy aimed
to disseminate PAF approach/procedure/rules to the related stakeholders, develop the external
and internal communication capacity of PAF and identify and develop communication messages
for PAF, as well as disseminate best practices and success stories.
Some of the major activities that were initiated and continued during the PAF I include.

Since PAF work is now increased in terms of its coverage and depth, there is a growing need to
generate greater awareness based on the results. A proactive communication and outreach
strategy will be of highly important in this regard. PAF will work with all stakeholders to keep
them abreast of the important developments and disseminating the information at national and
international forums.

13. Reporting:
This information is collected and kept in hard copy by the PMs at PAF secretariat. These records
form the basis of regular Quarterly Progress Monitoring report or PMR, Financial Monitoring
Reports or FMR, and the monthly reports to the Prime Minister's Office and Planning
Commission. This process is working well. It is the mission's assessment that these reports




                                                59
cover Progress, and Process monitoring but do not track Results (monitoring of Intermediate
outcomes).
The PMs mainly enter into the MIS details of specified milestones achieved by each sub-project.
Sub-project disbursements (usually in 2-5 tranches) are made against these milestones. PMs
answer for this information to the Technical Appraisal Committee (TAC) which meets to review
and approve/disapprove each tranche release (in addition to having approved all prior events,
starting with the formation, registration, and agreements with the COs). The FMIS is a separate
recording system and is not reconciled with the PMIS which tracks physical progress.

14. MIS information:
The MIS is set up with automatic markers to catch when project rules are not conformed with.
For instance, the system generates automatic alerts and sends back cases for review by the PMs
and TAC, e.g. when
   - Any CO registers fewer than the required targeted population: 30 per cent of women
       members, 30 per cent of Dalit membership and 30 per cent of indigenous groups
       (Janjaties) membership, including their occupation of key decision-making positions
       such as CO President, Secretary and Treasurer
   - Any sub-project exceeds per capita expenditure norms
   - Any internal TAC reports, internal memos for release of trenches, sub-project extension
       that are not completed within the norms for processing period.

15 PROGRAMME EVALUATION
Monitoring and Evaluation baseline data has been established by conducting sample households
(HHs) baseline survey in Programme intervention and control districts. It forms the basis to see
changes occurred due to Programme intervention at the community/households level. Internal
evaluation "e" or mid-term evaluation devised helps improve implementation. An independent
follow up survey in four pilot districts and two control districts has been completed by an
independent consultant ­ Central Department of Population Studies (CDPS)/ Tribhuwan
University (TU).

16. Lessons Learned:
    Identification of the poor through a participatory method in a small social unit using
    unambiguous but locally acceptable criteria works effectively.
    Poor communities also can handle their program when they are organized and capacitated
    appropriately.
    Demand driven approach is found to be effective to work with the poor and excluded
    communities. It provides flexibility to choose different IGAs options based on their own
    experience/confidence, local needs, potential and opportunities.
    Community contribution in income generating activities and infrastructure activities shows
    poor communities are also willing to contribute when project is implemented transparently
    and it meets their demand.

   When targeting the poor, most of the beneficiaries are illiterate. Hence, the literacy program
   should also go hand in hand to empower the community to enable them to participate
   meaningfully and manage the program
   Community Infrastructure sub-projects covered all the HHs in the community including
   small segment of non-poor households which were left from benefiting by the income
   generation activities. This mechanism helped to bring harmony between poor and non-poor
   in the community.
   Demand driven approach brings varieties of activities for implementation within the income
   generation and different types of need based infrastructures. POs experience and expertise
   may not always match the sub-project support needs. Hence, mechanism to cross support
   between POs based on their experience and necessary external support mechanism needs to
   be established to expedite the enterprises and infrastructure sub-projects.
   Livestock is one of the big activity opted by the community, the project should support and
   promote to establish community livestock insurance system.
   The innovative sub-projects implemented under the PAF-I could not be replicated to a
   desired level. A clear strategic mechanism needs to be developed to expand and replicate
   successful innovative sub-projects. PAF intervened areas such as System of Rice
   Intensification (SRI) ­ replicated in Siraha, Kapilvastu, and Mahotari districts. Similarly,
   based on the nature of the innovative Programme implemented in Chepang (one of the
   nomadic community) in Makawanpur and Dhading districts; freed Kamaiyas in Kanchanpur
   district are still continuing as community organization of these community were formed and
   support is required.
   Success of intervention has been witnessed, since the communities have taken full
   ownership of the activities due to demand-driven and community-based programme and
   transparency at all levels.
   The current practice of involving POs for providing social mobilization, facilitattion and
   technical assistance to the COs for their sub-projects implementation with direct funding to
   CO for implementation, if continued, there is no risk of misappropriation of funds.
   Even in complex and conflict situation, intervention is proven to be easily continued, if
   district based POs are partnered to implement the programme activities at the community
   level. POs thus selected are viewed transparent and capable by the district stakeholders,
   since they have good track records in the district.
   POs, however, need to pay more attention to capacity building after completion of sub-
   projects and make strategic milestones for their disengagement assessed in terms of CO
   capacity.
   MIS with computerized contract management system established in PAF enabled to handle
   large numbers of community contracts and partner contracts for direct community funding
   and separate partner funding.
   PAF accounting system become cumbersome when disbursement of fund to Non-Operating
   Account (NoA) is treated as advance for the IDA reimbursement when it is expenditure from
   PAF perspective and accounted as expenditure for the government.

   The PAF rules which includes staffing and staff policies; program implementation rules; and
   financial regulations, needs to be approved by the Government of Nepal. This arrangement
   some time became constraint and took longer time mainly when institution needs to add
   some staff needs to change some criteria and procedure based on experiences and raises
   questions on independency of PAF. Earlier, PAF Ordinance did not have provision to make
   sub-rules by PAF and made practical difficulty. However, this provision has been included
   in the prevailing PAF Act, which will allow making sub-rules, changing the present rules
   and sub-rules providing ample flexibility to the Board of the PAF to decide.
