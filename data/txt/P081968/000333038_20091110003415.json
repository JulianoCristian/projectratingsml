  (PAF) Project for Nepal were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            investing sufficient effort in developing a consensus on the\n            appropriate institutional set-up for a major new government\n            initiative, before agreeing to support a project and\n            launching into detailed preparation, is extremely important.\n            In this case, close dialogue on the institutional framework\n            and mandate of PAF, before the start of preparation, helped\n            to ensure strong client buy-in which has extended through\n            the life of the original project and its scaling up. Staff\n            continuity, both of counterpart and Bank teams, and the\n            engaging of Partner Organizations (Pos) with intimate local\n            knowledge and good track records have contributed to\n            successful project implementation during a period of rapid\n            scale up of the PAF program, even during periods of\n            political transition and associated delays in some senior\n            appointments at Board level. Going forward, it would be\n            useful to review governance arrangements for such\n            appointments as one of the options for further institutional\n            strengthening under PAF II. Measurement and impact\n            assessment of quantitative indicators, using a large\n            statistical sample and rigorous methodology, requires\n            significant time and resources and a process of technical\n            support and capacity building. Challenges of topography,\n            climate and political context in Nepal may compound and\n            should be anticipated as far as possible."}, "docdt": "2009-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
