 Alleviation Fund (PAF) - for reaching poor and excluded\n            communities. It aims to improve access to income-generation\n            projects and community infrastructure for the groups that\n            have tended to be excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity\n            and caste, as well as for the poorest groups in rural\n            communities. There are five main project components.\n            Project Component 1 supports Income generation projects\n            targeted to the poorest and excluded groups. Examples would\n            include micro-irrigation, micro-enterprises, crafts, land\n            productivity, animal husbandry, and others. Project\n            Component 2 supports Small Scale Village and Community\n            Infrastructure: Examples would include engineered trails,\n            footbridges, schools, clinics and other \"public\n            goods\" which are small scale and can be managed by\n            community groups or Village Development Committee (VDCs).\n            Project Component 3 supports innovations and special\n            programs. This component would provide a small amount of\n            finds in a demand-driven window to finance proposals of\n            special merit related to PAF objectives. Project Component\n            4, a capacity building component, comprises five\n            sub-components: Mobilization of Community Group, with\n            particular attention to the needs of marginalized groups;\n            Capacity Building for local bodies focusing mostly on\n            capacity building to help VDCs; Capacity Building of Target\n            Groups focusing on organizing special training and related\n            activities to enhance the skills of target beneficiaries on\n            their chosen areas of activity; Support to Micro-finance\n            Intermediaries; And a Monitoring and Evaluation System for\n            self-learning. Project Component 5 finances project\n            administration, financing project staff, establishment and\n            operating expenses including financial, procurement and\n            environmental management."}, "docdt": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
