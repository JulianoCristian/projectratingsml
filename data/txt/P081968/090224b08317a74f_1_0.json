Nepal is a landlocked country of 28\n            million people with a lowest per capita income in the world.\n            The Poverty Alleviation (PAF) program, financed by the\n            International Development Association, was addressing both\n            income and non-income dimensions of rural poverty throughout\n            the country, with special attention to groups that have\n            traditionally been excluded by reasons of gender and\n            ethnicity. It was a community-driven development program\n            designed to address the root causes of Nepal\u2019s conflict,\n            poverty, inequality, and lack of services. Through\n            income-generating activities and community infrastructure\n            programs, the PAF had reached over one million rural\n            Nepalese. More than 15,600 households had road access and\n            bridges. Water supply and sanitation had been provided for\n            more than 32,000 households. The program improved income\n            generation for rural population, through livestock\n            purchases, increased local employment opportunities, and the\n            rehabilitation of community assets such as trails, foot\n            bridges and tap stands."}, "docdt": "2010-09-15T09:53:04Z"}
