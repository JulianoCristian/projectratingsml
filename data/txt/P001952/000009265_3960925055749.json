One\n            objective of this project was to improve the quality and\n            expand the output of middle-level technicians and extension\n            workers in agriculture and animal production. To achieve\n            this, the project provided for: (i) completion of the final\n            phase of the expansion and upgrading of the existing Rural\n            Development Training Institute (IPDR) at Kolo (40 km from\n            Niamey) \u0096 increasing annual enrollment from 200 to 450, and\n            annual output from 65 to 150; and (ii) construction and\n            equipment of a new Animal Production Training School (ECE)\n            at Kolo - relocating the animal production training from an\n            existing school in Niamey to Kolo, and increasing annual\n            enrollment in such training from 100 to 200, and annual\n            output from 30 to 75. 2. The project also had two other\n            objectives, namely: (i) to improve educational planning and\n            prepare future education projects; and (ii) to formulate\n            policies and programs for upgrading key civil service\n            personnel, in both cases mainly through provision of\n            technical assistance and training. The physical\n            implementation of the main component was well managed and\n            completed ahead of schedule. The quantitative objectives for\n            agriculture and livestock training as defined at appraisal\n            (650 students and 225 graduates) could not be attained owing\n            to the changed economic circumstances. However, the reduced\n            capacity resulting from the restructuring (about 150\n            students and 150 graduates) should be more sustainable after\n            project completion in terms of both meeting effective demand\n            for graduates and the Government's ability to finance\n            operating costs."}, "docdt": "1992-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
