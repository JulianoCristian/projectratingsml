I   OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellenceand independence in evaluation.                      I
 About this Report
       The Operations EvaluationDepartmentassesses the programsand activities of the World Bank for two
 purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank`swork is
 producingthe expected results,and second,to help develop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough
 the disseminationof lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percentof
 the Bank`s lendingoperations. In selectingoperationsfor assessment,preference is given to those that are
 innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which
 Executive Directorsor Bank management have requestedassessments;and those that are likely to generate
 importantlessons.The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluation
 studies.
       A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowing country for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to
 validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
 OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management approval. Once cleared internally, the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


 About the OED Rating System
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
 The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project`s objectives are consistent with the country's
 current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
 goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
 Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy: The extent to which the project`s objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
 opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Sustainability: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstifutionalDevelopment Impact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
 to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
 better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
 better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
 institutional arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
 project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
 supported implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
 for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
 quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
 achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
 Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        Attached is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on three education
projects in Niger.

        The First Education Project (Cr. 1151-NIR)was approved for a US$21.5
million equivalent credit in May 1981.The credit closed on June 30, 1990, after
extensions totaling 30 months; US$3.43 million was canceled. UNDP provided US$4.85
million in cofinancing.

        The Primary Education DevelopmentProject (Cr.1740-NIR)was approved for a
credit of US$20.8 million equivalent in November 1986.The credit closed on December 31,
1995,after extensions totaling 18months; US$0.36 million was canceled.Norway and
Germanyprovided parallel financingof US$4.7 million and US$1.7 million respectively.

        The Basic Education SectorProject (Hybrid) (Cr. 2618-NIR) was approved for a
credit of US$41.48 million equivalent in November 1994.The credit closed on December
31,2001, after extensionstotaling 10months; US$0.57 million was canceled.Parallel
financingwas providedby Germany(KfWUS$10 million), Norway (US$4.8 million), and
Belgium (US$2.6 million).

        The projects in Niger were selected for assessment in order to study the
effectiveness of Bank strategy in a very poor country that has been declared ready for the
Fast-Track Initiative in order to achieve Education for All by 2015. The assessment
contributes to background work for an ongoing Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) study of the Bank's assistance to basic education.

        The PPAR is based on the following sources: Project and Implementation
Completion Reports (ICRs), Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs), Loan Agreements for the
projects, and project files, particularly the supervision reports. An OED mission visited
Niger in May 2004 to interview officials and beneficiaries, observe instruction in schools,
and collect other pertinent information. Field visits took place at the Institut Pratique pour
le Dheloppement Rural, three district education offices, one teacher training college, and
14 schools of areas that had benefited fi-omthe projects. The author thanks the
government officials who received the mission for their extensive cooperation.

       Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
relevant government officials and agencies for their review and comments. The Borrower
comments are attached as Annex E.

Summary

         In the 1970s,Niger had an educational system aimed mainly at a small middle
class. But droughts and financial difficulties reduced the already low enrollment ratio
from 27 percent in 1980to 25 percent in 1984 (of which 36 percent were girls). If the
financing policies remained unchanged, the gross primary school enrollment ratio was
projected to decrease to 14percent in 2000. To increase access to education as fast as
possible (particularly for girls) the Bank recommended a policy framework focused on
doing "more with less": reducing building costs, salaries (employment of cheaper and
less well trained teachers), and instructional time (through multigrade instruction and
splitting shifts) while providing textbooks and teacher training. That framework shaped
the activities of the Primary Education Development Project (Cr. 1740-NIR)and its
follow-on Basic Education Sector Project-Hybrid (Cr. 2618-NIR). (Education I, Cr.
1151-NIR, also provided inputs.) Besides project funds, the primary education budget
was infused with cash transfers from adjustment lending and debt relief.

        The Bank's projects contributed to increased enrollments (from about 25 percent
in 1986to 45.4 percent in 2003.) However, only half the primary-school graduates of a
survey in 2000 reported that they could read easily. Classroomvisits by the OED mission
provided additional evidence of limited learning outcomes, suggesting that the Bank's
strategy has not been very effective in achieving the country's goal of improving human
capita1.

        All three assessed projects aimed at increasing access to education, improving
quality, training teachers, and making educational management more efficient. Most
planned activities were carried out, but the two primary education projects did not focus
sufficiently on improving the quality of teaching to achieve the objective of improving
the quality of primary education. Despite financial difficulties during implementation, the
First Education Project ultimately fulfilled its main objective of establishing
agricultural technician training that would meet labor market needs. The Primary
Education Development Project and the Basic Education Sector Project carriedout most
of their scheduled activities, succeeded in reducing unit costs and increasinggovernment
expenditureson education, and greatlyexpanded access to primary schools,but fell short in
providingbasic skillsto all students who attendedprimary schools.In particular, the last
project in the series failed to take measures to protect educational quality, in spite of the
issues raised during the earlier projects.It was also affectedby extensivemismanagement
and theft of textbooks.

        The outcome of the First Education Project is rated satisfactory because its
access and quality objectives were achieved. Institutional development impact is rated
modest. Sustainability is rated likely because the agricultural training college financed by
the project has since 1986been producing technicians who are in demand by the private
sector. Bank and borrower performance are rated satisfactory. The outcome of the
Primary Education Development Project is rated satisfactory, and institutional
development impact is rated modest. Sustainability is rated likely, while Bank and
borrower performance are rated satisfactory. The outcome of the Basic Education
Sector Project is rated moderately unsatisfactory because, despite the large enrollment
increases, it did not sufficiently help students acquire basic skills and did not improve

management sufficiently. Institutional development impact is rated modest. Sustainability
is rated non-evaluable because the enrollment increases may not be maintained if basic
skills are not acquired. Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory because of the limited
attention given to quality and management issues. Because of serious financial
management lapses, borrower performance for the sector project is also rated
unsatisfactory.

        The policy framework promoted by the Bank has evolved into a 10-year
multidonor program (2002-2012) through the ongoing Basic Education Project (Cr.
4336; FY03). Niger is now among the first countries to receive support under the Bank-
led Fast-Track Initiative that is expected to accelerate progress towards universal primary
school completion by 2015.But to ensure that those enrolled actually learn basic skills,
consideration should be given to address issues regarding national language instruction,
textbooks, instructional time use in schools, and teacher training focused teaching the
poorest.

    Experience with the assessed projects confirms a number of OED lessons:

        A policyframeworkfocused on costs and access is insufficient. The two primary
        education projects emphasized cost savings over instruction on basic skills. Policy
        dialogue and project activities need to focus on student acquisition and knowledge
        of basic skills. Providing mass education under clearly inadequate instructional
        conditions may graduate functional illiterates and benefit only those who are the
        brightest or better-off.

        Access-related indicators may be relatively easy to obtain but may not be closely
        related to learning achievements. Monitoringindicators for the two primary
        educationprojects showcased enrollment increases and improvements in student
        flowsbut not whether studentshad acquired basic knowledge and skills. But the
        administrationof achievement tests is laborious and difficultto carry out regularly
        in low-income countries.Innovative and rapid means must be sought to gauge
        students' likely achievement (such as the proportion of students able to read
        fluently a simple text.)

        Textbooks are crucial contributors to student learning; if they are unavailable or if
        students cannot study from them sufficiently, the rest of the educational
        investments lose their effectiveness. Procurement methods andplans must aim at
        making large numbers of textbooks available to studentsfree, but also available
       for sale at the market. Textbook management is most effective if it takes into
        account the printing strengths of the local private sector and the community
        school associations.

0Though in other countries enrollments in agricultural schools tend to be low and
  labor linkages weak, in Niger there is a demand for the skills provided. Bank
  investments of earlier decades in agricultural education may continue toprovide
 skills relevant to the economy if policy dialogue is focused toward modernizing
 courses, generating income to schools, and catering to the populations likely to be
 interested in agricultural training.

1.        Background

1.1       With a per capita income of US$170,' Niger is possibly the poorest country
among those that have not faced recent conflict. Most of its area is sparsely inhabited
desert; the population of 11.5million is 88 percent rural, is concentrated in the southwest,
and grows at 3.4 percent per year. More than half the citizens are below age 15, and 40
percent of all children are malnourished. Five main languages are spoken, but French is
the official language and the language of instruction in schools.*Illiteracy (age 151)is
estimated at 83 percent though an unknown percentage reads the national languages in
the Arabic script (learned in Koranic schools) and in the Tifanagh script of the Tuareg.

1.2       Low population density makes the supply and monitoring of education difficult
and expensive in many areas. So, gross primary education enrollment is about 45 percent,
up from about 27 percent in 1981.Private primary education accounts only for 4.3
percent of enrollments. Average repetition rate in grades 1-5 is 12percent; only 60
percent of the students starting in grade 1reach grade 6, and of them only 47 percent
passed the grade 6 examinations in 2003. About 27 percent of teachers are untrained, but
the training and support capacities are limited. There is an inspector for every 516
teachers and a pedagogical advisor for every 287.3

1.3       Niger faced bright prospects of development in the 1960s, given its wealth in
uranium ore. However, droughts in the mid 1970s decimated livestock and put food
security at risk. The climate improved in the late 1970s, and Niger temporarily
experienced a boom due to the high price and volume of uranium sales. By the early
1980s,however, the world prices of uranium fell precipitously, and a long-lasting
financial crisis began. The country became dependent on external borrowing,
accumulated arrears in the 1990s and could not repay its debts. It is thus remarkable that
Niger is one of the first countries to receive support under the Bank-led Fast-Track
Initiative that is expected to accelerate progress towards universal primary school
completion by 2015 and attainment of the Education for All (EFA).


Bank Sector Strategy

1.4       In the 1970s,the country had an educational system aimed mainly at the small
middle class. Since few educated persons existed in the country, teachers received

2. There are 39 schools that teach grades 1-3 in local languages with 5,354 students in 2002-2003. There are also 420
schools that divide the time between French and Arabic that had 29,684 students in 2002-2003.

salaries equivalent to about 8.8 times the per capita in~ome.~However, the droughts and
financial difficulties reduced the already low enrollment ratio from 27 percent in 1980to
25 percent in 1984 (of which 36 percent were girls). It was projected that if the financing
policies remained unchanged, the gross primary school enrollment ratio would decrease
to 14percent in 2000, even if the budget grew by 2 percent annually.

1.5        Structural adjustment in Niger started in February 1986with a credit of US$60
million aimed at increasing the efficiency of resource use and improving the balance of
payments. To protect the education sector, the Bank advised the government to initiate a
long-term education strategy designed to: (a) prevent tight financial constraints from
causing further decline to the enrollment ratio and (b) develop trained human resources
for the medium and long term in line with the expected resource availability and labor
market conditions. To do so within the country's budgetary limitations, country dialogue
and three IDA credits focused on policies aimed at doing `more with less', that is cutting
costs while increasing access to education asfast aspossible,particularly for girls. The
policy framework put in place aimed at:

      0    Reducingprimapeducation recurrent costs through (i) multigrade teaching and
           (ii) decreasing teacher salaries from 8.8 times to 3.5 times the per capita income
           by recruiting contract teachers. Starting in 1986, full "instituteurs" were to be
           reduced to 14percent of the teaching force, and "volunteer" teachers with short-
           term contracts and no benefits were to be recruited to staff about 85 percent of the
           classes.

      0    Reducing secondary and higher education student subsidies. The nominal higher
           education scholarship budget was to be reduced by 3.7 percent annually from
           FY88 through FY91 without other compensating subsidies and then maintained at
           these levels.

           Reducing capital costs. Solid school buildings cost five times more than the baked
           mud "banco" constructions that tend to be less durable. Several experiments have
           been made over the years to achieve sustainable but affordable buildings at 30-50
           percent lower costs.

     0    Enabling more students to enter school through (i) increasing class size from 36
           to 45 students per teacher (in 1986) and later to 40 students per teacher; (ii)
           instituting multigrade teaching in rural areas; and (iii) splitting sh$s to
           accommodate more students in grades 1-3, a feature that reduced instruction by 40
          percent (referred to as double shift in Bank documents).'



4. More than half of the country's civil service employees were in the Ministry of Education and accounted for about
21 percent of the government'srecurrent budget. Teachers had 10years of education followed by 2-year teacher
training at the upper secondary level.

5. In many countries, schools have two or even three independent cohorts of students and teachers coming to school at
different times. But in hot areas that also lack electricity there are not enough hours to sustain two independent shifts.
The split-shift concept was conceived because in some western European countries children in younger grades have
fewer class hours. The Bank advised poor countries with large classes to `time-share' the teachers and classrooms (e.g.,
Niger, Senegal, Guinea). Classes of 70 students or more may be split into two pupil groups, each going to school half
of the regular time and on Saturdays, resulting in a reduction of 40 percent of time. Teachers are paid extra for teaching
on Saturdays. The large reduction in instructional time has produced poor outcomes in other countries, such as Guinea

     0    Improving quality through textbooks and teacher training.

          Enabling more students to graduate by reducing repetition rates (14 percent
          average in 1986)and increasing pass rates at the primary school leaving
          examination (20 percent in 1986).More automaticpromotion policies were
          instituted to lower the rate, repetition capped at 15percent for grade 6.

1.6       These policies formed the focus of the Primary Education Development Project
(Cr. 1740-NIR) and its follow-on Basic Education Sector Project-Hybrid (Cr. 2618-NIR).
Since 2000, sector policy has evolved along the same principles into a 10-year program
(2002-2012) financed with multidonor participation through the Basic Education Project
(Cr. 4336; FY03) that is currently under implementation.6Its goal is to reach 290,000
additional rural children and 106,000youth and adults (62 percent female) and to "offer
them an acceptable level of knowledge and skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and
health education."' Specific policy reform goals are related to (a) costs and (b)
institutional strengthening (details in Annex A).

1.7       To facilitate the execution of the 10-yearprogram, two public expenditure
projects have supported educational recurrent expenditures (Table 1).Public Expenditure
Adjustment Credit Project I (PEAC; Cr. 3576-NIR for US$70 million; FYO1) devoted 22
percent of the proceeds for education (Annex A). Fund releases enabled the Ministry of
Primary and Basic Education to spend 90 percent of its budget during 2000-2002. The
Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit Project II (Cr. 3827-NIR for US$65 million;
FY03) is continuing budget support for education and will be closely coordinated with
other external assistance under the Fast Track Initiative. Objectives include reforming the
cash budgeting system of social sector ministries that results in erratic allocations and
hurts services to the poor and monitoring allocations (Annex A).




and Senegal (e.g.,Guinea. Project Performance Assessment Report. 20 Years of IDA Assistance. 2004, Report No.
26245).

6. No formal sector studies were found in the archives or Bank publications until 1999. The 1999 report "Constraints
and Degrees of Freedom for the Development of Quantity and Quality of Education in Niger" formed the basis for the
10-year program. An update of this study with detailed analyses of costs and access indicators was in draft form, and its
data are used in this document. (Mingat, Alain and Ramahatra Rakotomalala. 2004.) With the development of the EFA
Fast-Track Initiative the expenditure and access indicators of Niger have been compared with those of other countries
in various documents. (Mingat, 2002).

privatized textbook distribution, multigrade classes in rural areas, and a pilot low-cost peer tutoring scheme.

 1.8      Funds for education have also come from another source. The IMF approved a
$73 million poverty reduction and growth facility for Niger in 2000 and announced $115
million in debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Since
2001, the funding has been channeled into the Special Program of the President of the
Republic. Plans for the 2003 phase call for 1,000 classrooms, 1,000health units, and
 1,000wells, the construction of which requires the participation of local residents. The
Second Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit will increase the share of HIPC resources
earmarked for primary education from 20 percent to 40 percent and seek the
contributions of other donors. In 2001-2003, resources amounted to about US$10.4
million.'

 1.9      Because of its importance to poverty alleviation, education has received
considerable attention in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).' The 2003
progress report welcomes the formal adoption of the 10-year development plan. It asserts
that the country's good macroeconomic results have been driven by measures to improve
the quality of education and stimulate demand for schooling. Noting that gross
enrollment rates increased from 37.3percent in 2000/01 to 41.7 percent in 2001/02, with

a notably strong increase in rural areas, the report states that major outcome targets were
surpassed in 2002. The government targets have been aligned with the Millennium
Development Goal of universal completion of primary education by 2015.

1.10     How effective has the Bank policy framework been 25 years after its inception in
improving the trained human capital of Niger and alleviating poverty? How likely is
Niger to achieve Education for All in 2015?Are student learning gains likely to
accompany increasing enrollments? This document presents evidence regarding these
questions.


Objectives of the Assessed Projects

1.11     World Bank lending for education in Niger started in 1981. The three projects
under review focused on improving access to education while managing sectoral costs.
As the sectoral strategy developed and evolved, it was reflected in the objectives,
components, and policies of the projects. (Project objectives are integrated in the
implementation discussion of each project, see below.)



2.       Implementation of the Assessed Projects

Education Project (Cr. 1151-NIR; FY81-90;known as Education I)

2.1      Objectives: (a) Upgrading the quality of mid-level technicians and extension
workers in agriculture and animalproduction; (b) improving educational planning and
preparingfutureprojects; and (c)formulatingpolicies andprogramsfor upgrading key
civil service personnel.

2.2     This credit of US$21.5 million became effective in 1981, at a period when the
Bank supported manpower planning and extensive training in vocational and agricultural
education. Though its main objective was to increase the availability of mid-level
agricultural technicians (about 92 percent of expenditures), the project also aimed to
prepare the ground for future lending in primary education (6 percent of expenditures)
and to formulate civil service training policies (2 percent of expenditures).

2.3     The project financed training of mid-level technicians in agriculture and animal
husbandry. The students, who enter the school after 10years of formal education, would
staff the Ministry of Agriculture extension programs at a time when human resources in
the country were very scarce. To achieve this, the project provided for: (i) the expansion
and upgrading of the Rural Development Training Institute (IPDR) at Kolo (40 km from
Niamey) and (ii) relocation of an animal production training institute (Ecole des Cadres
d'Elevage) from its downtown Niamey location to a new Animal Production Training
School at Kolo, next to IPDR.

2.4     The execution of civil works was well managed and completed ahead of schedule,
(largely through foreign contractors) and the schools began operating in their new
facilities in early 1985. About 20 staff members received fellowships for advanced

                                                              6


studies abroad (though only 2-3 returned to IPDR)," and foreign technical assistance was
provided to draft updated curricula (Annex Table B-1). (UNDP provided $4.87 million
for training activities.) Syllabi and loose-leaf textbooks were printed with the printing
facilities provided by the project. However, the macroeconomic deterioration of the
country created severe constraints in the government's ability to recruit all trainees for
public sector employment. Following IDA advice, the government reduced training
capacity at the two institutions by about 50 percent (to about 450 students and 150
graduates) to match the effective demand for graduates, it introduced less specialized pre-
employment training programs to increase graduates' employability, and in 1988 merged
the two schools to reduce recurrent expenditures by about 35 percent. The OED review
of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) rated the project unsatisfactory because
at that time the school could not afford to serve the number of students expected, and
skills demand was in doubt.

2.5        Mission visit to IPDR.             Figure 1. Agricultural Technician Enrollments
About 15 years after project
completion, IPDR has 449
students in two-year                             500 1
programs, of which 37                            400
percent are female (Figure 1).
                                                 300
Unlike the decline that
agricultural colleges have                       200

faced worldwide, there is a                      100
demand in Niger for a
technician-level institution.
The institution admitted two
fee-paying students in 1986
and had 38 by 1989.Fee-
paying students, who accounted for 57 percent of enrollments in 2004, may pay up to
200,000 CFA (US$400) per year to attend, and they getjobs in various NGOs or in the
private sector. (The government hires 40 graduates per year). Loosely bound textbooks
continue to be produced with the printing press provided in the 1980s, so students have
structured material they can study.'' Mission interviews with five faculty members, four
students on campus, and researchers at the International Crops Research for the Semi-
Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) who receive students as interns suggest that students are well
trained and effective in carrying out extension activities. Thus, in the long run, this IDA
investment in agricultural education has been relevant, efficacious, and sustainable.

2.6       Planningfor primary education. The project financed training for two Nigerien
educational planners who returned to the country and worked at the Ministry of



10. Most fellowship recipients returned to Niger but sought jobs in the Ministry of Agriculture and in the NGOs that
had agricultural activities. The Ministry did not enforce its rules to oblige public service for a number of years. Thus,
IPDR has had to rely on temporary professors and has not been able to develop inservice training for agricultural staff
as it had planned.

1 1. The printing presses given by early Bank projects (e.g., in Guinea) are often still functional 20 years later. They
constitute a very useful investment.

Education until retirement. During implementation, the project was also amended to
include the construction of 60 primary classrooms as pilots to test low-cost construction
methods that would be used to build 750 classrooms through the follow-on project. Due
to delays the construction started only in 1989,but experience was useful and resulted in
a unit cost reduction of about 50 percent (see implementation of follow-on projects).


Primary Education Development Project (Cr. 1740;FY87-95; known as PRODEP)"

2.7       Objectives: (a) reducing recurrent unit costs and improving quality and relevance
ofprimary education; (b) reducing capital unit costs and increasing access toprimavy
education; and (c)promoting cost-effective use of existing education resources.

2.8       This project constituted the first large-scale effort to support primary education.
Norway and Germany (through KfW) provided cofinancing for US$4.7 million and
US$1.7 million respectively. (See Annex Table B-2 for project components, targets, and
activities). The project tried to lay the foundation for future development as seen from a
macroeconomic perspective and focused primarily on containing costs and reaching as
many students as possible, albeit with more limited instruction.

2.9       The project engaged in large-scale classroom construction, textbook development
and printing, and teacher training. Without consulting teachers and parents, however, it
promulgated the cost-cutting policies that proved controversial: building a workj6orce of
less qualified teachers at approximately 40percent the cost of regular teachers,
introducing multigrade teaching, and reducing class time by 40percent through double
shzjl schooling in urban areas.I3Teachers' unions resisted the measures and went on
strikes that continued off and on for several years. Reports in the files indicate that the
double shift concept was implemented in 1988-90,was temporarily abandoned due to
social and performance issues, and was restarted at Bank insistence. Parents were
displeased that their children spent so little time in school, and one report referred to this
method as a "poison imposed by the World Bank."14Extracurricular activities had been
expected for children sitting outside classes, but there were no funds to carry them out,
and the only feasible activity proved to be Koranic education. However, most went home
and did not come on Saturdays as expected. Logistics problems were also linked to
delays in starting classes. The reading performance of these students was reported in
project files as "worrisome."

2.10      The Bank informally explored the possibility of instruction in national languages
and was interested in expanding an experimental program with very promising outcomes
that was supported by GTZ in the 1980s and again in 2002. Project documents mention
an evaluation study (Annex Table B-2), but the government had been reluctant to adopt

13.Teachers who taught split shifts received a bonus of 20,000 CFA. The Bank requested in 1988 an experiment with a
rigorous evaluation. Though 12,000 students participated, evaluation was delayed and in fact was never completed.
Though the experiment stopped in 1991, 209 double-shift classrooms opened in urban areas in 1993 and then continued
to increase to about 892 by the end of PROSEF.

national language instruction in the 1980s, and the evaluation was not completed until
1999 (Annex A). Its positive outcomes, however, did not convince the government to
promote literacy in national languages in later projects.

2.11       The project faced other problems as well. Pressure from university students forced
the government to raise the value of scholarships in university education after 1991,
threatening primary education budgets. The maintenance component and studies were
unfinished. Eventually, most project activities were carried out after extensions totaling
18months. For the most part, execution of this project and disbursement were on
schedule throughout the life of the project and covenants were in compliance. Audits
showed no major irregularities.


Basic Education Sector Project (Hybrid) (Cr. 2618; FY94-01; known as PROSEF) l5


Objectives (a) Improving access to and quality ofprimaiy education; (b) Strengthening
sector managerial andplanning capacities.

2.12       Though PRODEP helped increase enrollments, coverage in 1993was only
marginally higher than in 1980due to the high population growth.16The government
established an Emergency Education Rehabilitation Plan, designed to continue the
policies of PRODEP of reducing costs to increase access. The target was to increase the
primary school enrollment ratio from 29 to 35 percent between 1994 and 1999.The
project received parallel financing by Norway (US$4.8 million), Germany (US$10.2
million), Belgium (US$2.6 million), France, UNICEF, and UNDP. Because of continuing
macroeconomic instability, the project included a US$20 million sector reform program;
conditions included the introduction of double shifts on a large scale in urban schools,
and restrictions on secondary and higher education scholarship^,'^ and employment of 85
percent contract teachers. Thus, about 7,381 new teachers could be recruited over six
years while the salary burden to the national budget was minimized. This component
accounts for the `hybrid' name of the project.

2.13       Despite political risk, policy reforms were introduced and sustained. However,
implementation faced considerable problems. There were eight Ministers of Basic
Education over eight years, complicating country dialogue. Though the project
coordination unit (PIU) was located within the ministry, it was perceived as a separate
unit and did not receive full collaboration from other departments. In the later stages,
considerable problems arose, such as the unchecked theft of textbooks. The PIU failed to

16.The Bank executed a population project (Cr. 2630-NIR, FY97), whose outcome was rated unsatisfactory; planned
activities were partially carried out and benefits were not sustainable in the long term.

17. Conditions included recruitment of least 520 additional primary school teachers (85 percent contractuals),
introducing double-shift classes to at least 440 primary schools, admitting at least 720 trainees to the teacher training
colleges, appointing three regional coordinators for construction, signing a contract with UNICEF to deliver
micronutrients to students, redeploying 32 teacher training college instructors to secondary education. A cap on higher
education scholarships was placed at 4.8 billion CFA, 1.Gbillion CFA for secondary schools. A teaching materials
budget was reserved for primary schools and increased from 360 million to 439 million CFA.

coordinate donor efforts, was assigned low-performing staff, and auditors noted many
financial irregularities. Audits were qualified because in the auditors' opinion project
management weaknesses did not permit thorough examination. Questions were raised in
particular regarding the split-shift premiums that were to be paid to teachers.'*Teacher
payments backed up over three months and contributed to unrest resulting from contract
teacher conditions. The strikes ultimately resulted in two lost school years (1993-95).
Nevertheless, most project activities were carried out after a 10-monthextension of the
closing date. (See project components, targets, and activities in Annex Table B-3).

2.14      The projects (particularly PRODEP and PROSEF) had some common
components and implementation problems, which are described in Annex B along with
achievement of specific targets where applicable.


Mission Observations

2.15      The OED mission visited 14 schools unannounced, 9 in rural areas and 6 in semi-
urban areas (including the periphery of Niamey but not in the center of the city).l9 The
schools were about one kilometer from a highway and might therefore have been of
better quality than more remote schools. The visits took place about three weeks before
the end of the school year. The mission carried out the following observations: (a)
instructional activities taking place in class at the moment of OED mission entry (Table
2);(b) the number of students registered according to the teachers versus the number
present in classes on that day; (c) how well 3-4 students chosen at random could read and
answer simple comprehension questions; (d) teacher interviews if class time permitted.
Observations were as follows:

     0    Substantial numbers of enrolled students were not in school on the days the OED
          mission visited. In urban schools about 15percent of the students were absent, but
          in rural schools over 50 percent were absent. Teachers cited reasons such as
          illnesses, visiting relatives, work.2o

     0    There were few textbooks in the schools; some classes had just one book, others
          one textbook per 3-6 students. In the "experimental" schools textbooks in national
          languages were unavailable for grades 1 and 2.




18.Fiduciaire Conseil et Audit, 1997

19.The schools visited were: Ecole centre ville de Kollo, Ccole experimentale de Kollo, ecole franco-arabe de Kollo,
ecole d' application de Tilaberi, ecole communaitaire Gorebio, ecole Jambale, ecole Daiberi, Ccole KohC Garante, ecole
Dakimana, Ccole Say, ecole Lugabanda, ecole Sidi Bewara, ecole experimenale in Peul, Ccole Ballaren (Niamey
periphery). The schools were located about one hour ride from Niamey near main roads. Through field visits, OED
collects qualitative information, which is integrated with quantitative data where available. Missions have a limited
time in the field, and travel to very remote areas is often not possible.

20. The government response to this document mentioned that in May many students leave school for agricultural
work. (Annex E).

                                                           10


          In modestly efficient schools of other countries, students should read relatively
          fluently by the end of grade 1.2' However, Nigerien children in grades 1-2 knew
          mainly individual letters and could merely recite items which the better students
          had read on the board, but when asked to identify specific letters or the same
          words written elsewhere, they could not. About half of those present in grades 5
          and 6 could decode slowly and with difficulty. None could answer reading
          comprehension questions satisfactorily; the better students mainly repeated
          verbatim parts of the text they had read earlier. Only one of the approximately 60
          students interviewed (in the periphery of Niamey) could read fluently.

    0     Most students in the classes visited were unoccupied at the moment of mission
          entry (Table 2).The most common activity was a single student working on the
          blackboard or reading from the seat. The pedagogical advisor accompanying the
          mission clarified that teachers are trained to ask students to practice one by
          one only rather than repeat all together. This way the teachers control the class
          and can correct individual mistakes. They are also instructed to ask the better
          students to read, so that other children can model after them. Teachers were
          consistently observed to work with the few better students and ignore the rest.
          Repeatedly the mission asked a student to read, and a teacher intervened saying
          that that particular student could not, but another one could.

    0     Teachers of all grades who were asked how many of their students could read
          typically reported that most could not. However, they seemed unconcerned with
          their students' limited skills. Three of those interviewed by the OED mission said
          that it is normal for some students not to learn reading. When asked what they
          should do to help the non-reading students teachers made general statements.
          Contract and permanent teachers exhibited the same behaviors. Teachers
          invariably indicated that supervisors rarely visit.

    0     Students in small towns and rural areas displayed minimal understanding of
          French, even at the end of grade 6. Students in lower grades mainly repeated what
          they were told, unable to construct their own sentences. The mission observed
          only one instance where French was actively taught to students. However, the
          textbooks seem written for native French speakers. They include uncommon
          French words early on, and no glossaries exist in local languages.

    0     For advanced subjects such as geometry, a few students could draw designs on the
          blackboard and recite statements whose meaning they did not know, such as "an
          isosceles triangle has two axes of symmetry." Only two students in a 6thgrade
          class could form the simple past tense of French, as the curriculum described.
          Most students whose teachers asked them to solve written problems or write
          paragraphs on a topic merely copied down the texts, unable to deal with them.

       0      The mission visited the teacher training center of Dosso. The students in that
              institution (and reportedly in the four others) had themselves no textbooks or even
              copies of class notes. The instructors dictated the texts to the students word for
              word. Teacher training colleges had not even received library books. Given this
              instructional model it is not surprising that students did not interact more with
              their own students.

       0      School constructions seemed to be of adequate quality. These included semi-
              permanent buildings with metal structures and mud walls.

 2.16         The mission also interviewed government officials and donor staff involved with
 the projects assessed in this report and obtained opinions about actions and outcomes (see
 Annex C and sections on Bank and borrower performance).

3.            Results

3.1           Since the 1980s,the Bank, and the donor community, has financed the expansion
of Niger's education system not only with investment projects but with large-scale cash
outlays as well. A series of conditions to reduce student unit costs shaped the expansion
of the system. How effective has this strategy been in increasing the availability of
trained human resources in the country?

3.2      Enrollments. The strategy has been clearly effective in increasing the number of
students reported as enrolled in schools (Figures 2 and 3) and reducing unit costs of
recurrent and capital expenditures. With its own budget and relatively small-scale donor
support, Niger could only afford enrollment rates of about 25 percent in the 1980s. Given
an annual population increase of about 3.1 percent at that time, the system had to expand
by this amount to continue coverage at the same level. Bank support enabled the system
to expand up from the 25 percent baseline.

3.3      Numerically,               Figure 3. Numbers of Primary Education Students, 1979-
enrollment increases are            2003
impressive. During
PRODEP primary-
school students
increased from 251,000
in 1988 to 445,500 in
1994, a 77 percent
increase, and during
PROSEF, the increase
was accelerated (Figure
3). Between 1993 and
1997, the gross
enrollment rate
increased from 27.8 to 30.1 percent, 0.5 a percentage point annually. Between 1998 and
2002, the rate increased from 30.4 to 41.7 percent, an annual increase of 2.8
percentage points the rate of increase was multiplied fivefold. Thus, in 2002-03, the
                        -
system had about 825,70822students (71 percent rural) officially enrolled. In 2003, the
gross enrollment rate was estimated at 45.4percent (38 percent in rural and 51 percent in
urban areas; Figure 2).

3.5      The hiring of contract teachers was an important reason for enrollment increases.
This mode of employment acquired momentum in 1998 thanks to financing by PEAC I
and 11. Since 1999large numbers have been hired, surpassing targets (8,019 instead of
2,080). Similarly, the number of schools has more than doubled in 20 years. In 2003,
there were 6,770 (5,994 or 88 percent rural), up from about 3,850 in 1994(Annex Tables
B-3, B-4), though more than half the villages of Niger still lack a school.

3.6      Though these figures are encouraging, mission observations raise concerns
regarding actual attendance and participation, particularly in rural areas. Students are
counted on December 15 of every year, and the limited supervision of schools makes it
hard to monitor absenteeism. Project files make repeated references to difficulties in
establishing the institutional strength necessary for school mapping and statistical data
collection. It is possible that principals of rural schools have incentives to overstate
enrollments in rural areas in order to qualify, for example, for school feeding programs.
Given the difficulty in verifying attendance, the large enrollment increases reported in the
last 20 years should be regarded with caution.

3.7      Official student dropout and repetition rates have also been lowered, partly at
least as a result of automatic promotion policies that stipulate a 15percent ceiling in
repetition (Table 3). However, repetition of grade 6 remains high (about 29.3 percent)
because of the high failure rate in the leaving examinations (53 percent in 2003). The
rate may be high because automatically promoted students may lack the knowledge to
pass the examinations. Nevertheless, transition to secondary increased from 23 percent in
the 1980sto about 65 percent in 2001L2'In 2004, it was 48.8 percent (Annex E).

3.8      However, gains in enrollments may only be temporary. Despite repeated efforts,
the Bank has made limited inroads in convincing the government to adopt family
planning and reduce the high rate of population increase. Thus, the need for ever more
schools remains unabated.


Expenditures and Unit Cost Reductions

3.9      The share of education in the government budget decreased from 42.1 percent in
1990to 24.1 percent in 2002 (Annex E). Howeve, the share of primary education in the
education budget has steadily increased over the years from 40 percent in 1986 to 45
percent in 1994 and to over 60.3 percent in 2002 (Figure 5; Annex Tables B-5 and B-6).
At the same time, secondary                  Figure 5. Percentage of Expenditures by Education
and higher education costs                   Level
have been held relatively
constant. However, the
system is strained and, in real
terms, overall less and less is
invested in education (Figure
6). Also, it is unclear how
effectively the funds have
been used to produce student
learning. Studies elsewhere
                                                                 1990  1896  I997  1998   1999  2000  2001  2002

expenditures per student are
not a good predictor of
school performance.26

become the majority (Figure 7; Annex Table B-8); in 2002-2003, there were 10,228 and
constituted 52 percent of all teachers (19,746). In rural areas, they constitute 58 percent
of all teachers (7,972 out of 13,787).27

3.11     Construction unit costs decreased in the 1980s and have remained stable.
Following experimentation in Education I, unit costs (during PRODEP estimated at
US$5400) were lowered by about 30 percent between 1984 and 1994 and have remained
low. The government has changed technology to semi-solid buildings with metallic
structures for rural areas that continue to keep costs lower.

3.12     Werestudent unit costs decreased? Unit cost estimates were mentioned in project
documents as US$60 in 1981 (Education I), and US$77 in 1986 (PRODEP). The
efficiency gains implemented under PRODEP were instrumental in reducing the unit
recurrent cost per primary school student from US$77 to US$62. As a result of
interventions and exchange rate changes, unit costs were estimated at about US$53
(26,819 CFA) in 2002.**When attendance and skills are considered, the real unit costs of
primary education may be substantially underestimated. If, as mission observations
suggest, over half the rural students attend only occasionally or have in effect dropped
out for the year, real unit costs are proportionately higher (US$77 if half the students
attend regularly enough to benefit from education). Furthermore, only 65 percent of all
children are estimated to reach grade 6,29of whom only 53 percent may read fluently.
Thus, the unit cost of one literate graduate may really be about US$154 (US$181 in rural
areas, where 55 percent reach grade 6) rather than US$53 (26,819 CFA).


Institutional Development and Management

3.13     The main benefit of the institutional development efforts has been the ministry's
sustained ability to conduct annual statistical surveys and report results punctually. Public
expenditure reviews have also been conducted. Staff trained through the projects who

made a career at the ministry also strengthened the institution. Nevertheless, the benefit
of all the workshops given under PRODEP and PROSEF is unclear.

3.14      Monitoring and evaluation, an important tool of institutional development, have
been relatively weak. PRODEP had few activities and did not monitor student learning.
The outcomes of the controversial double-shift schools were not evaluated. PROSEF was
able to carry out repeated assessment activities, including the development of an
achievement test and the administration of the UNESCO-UNICEF Monitoring Learning
Achievement tests (MLA; see below) in 1999.This is a considerable accomplishment,
since achievement tests are time-consuming and difficult to construct, particularly in low-
income countries. To show improvements, different tests must be made statistically
equivalent. However, the two tests given in Niger may not score performance the same
way, and they were administered only once.

3.15      After implementing a policy framework over 15 years, it would have been useful
to administer one of the tests again in 2003 and study project impact on the set of schools
assessed in 1999 and a sample of newly opened schools. However, this was not done, and
it is not possible to report on student performance changes over time.


Quality of Education -Very Few Students Learning Basic Skills

3.16    The Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs) of the projects promoting cost-cutting
policies gave little information about baseline learning achievement and no specifics or
evidence about the quality of education they were instituting. Despite specific targets for
enrollments and costs, there were no specific learning targets. The documents do not even
mention that French was the exclusive language of instruction. The PRODEP Staff
Appraisal Report (p. 6) merely expressed the belief that quality would improve through
cost-cutting measures.

3.17    Information to help evaluate achievement changes since the 1980s is indirect and
inadequate because no test scores were available until 1999. The primary-school pass rate
was reported in Band documents at 20 percent in 1985; it increased to 25 percent in 1989,
to 33 percent in 1994 and to 47.2 percent in 2003. However, the increase reflects the
achievement of effort to increase system efficiency by enabling more students to
graduate. Partly automatic promotion was used to lower the repetition rates (14 percent
average in 1986), so it is unknown how well students met graduation standards in1985
and in 2003.

3.18    A locally developed test measured the percentage of students attaining minimum
achievement (50 percent) or meeting a mastery criterion (70 percent) in French, math,
and science in 1999.About 1,387 students were assessed in grades 2,4, and 6 of public
and private schools, half of which were urban; 14 students per class chosen at random
from those in attendance. As is shown in Tables 4 and 5, scores were very low. On
average, studentsfailed to meet minimum criteria; only 10-14percent of students met
French writing mastery criteria. In particular, the items measuring reading and French

writing in grade 2 were correctly answered by only 30.5 and 47.9 percent of the
students.'O

3.19       The UNESCO-UNICEF Monitoring Learning Achievement (MLA) measuring
literacy, numeracy, and life skills were also administered in 1999,in a sample of public
schools, 58 percent rural.3'The results raised even more cause for concern. The average
score in Niger was 40.8 percent, and the international mean was 50.8 percent. Only 3.6
percent of the students exceeded the literacy criterion of the MLA test.32This test has been
given to other countries, and Niger was found to be the third lowest-scoring country
(Annex Table B-9; Figures 8 and 9).

3.20       As low as they are, outcomes may still overestimate achievement. Both tests
oversampled urban schools (constitutingjust 12percent of all schools in 2003) and had to
test only students who were present. None of the documents discusses the absenteeism
rate and choice of students for testing. It is possible that teachers put forth the better
students for testing, as they did when the OED mission asked students to read. Future
surveys should be attentive to this effect.33

33. For example, it may be worth studying and double-checking independently which students took the PASEC tests in
2003. Perhaps the non-readers were excluded. Also, the MEBA team is preparing a new survey and care should be
taken that these non-reading students are not excluded from the new survey.

      3.21                       The tests shed some light on the effects of policies on learning. Multigrade
     studentsperformedpoorly. They scored 37.8percent in MLA tests as compared to 40.7
     percent of regular classes and had the lowest probability of passing primary-school
      leaving examination. The student-teacher ratio was also negatively related to
      achievement. Data analyses by class size, teacher experience, and shift (the cost-cutting
     measures of the Bank's policy) also show a negative relationship with achievement.
     However, the condition of school buildings, for which there was much investment in
     Niger, is not related to student a~hievement.~~

     3.22                        Double-shift classes show a mixed picture in comparison with regular classes,
     because they are in crowded urban areas, where students may get more parental support.
     Thus, the MLA scores were 44.6 for double shift schools vs. a country average of 40.7
     percent. However, students learn little in rural multigrade and urban double-shift
     cla~ses.~'Because they have not been accepted well, by 2003, they accounted forjust 5
     percent of student enrollments.

     Guinea, the double shift was found to reduce scores by 3.6 percentage points in French, 3.4points in expression, and
     5.6 points in math in comparison to average performance. (Barrier Emilie, Sekou Fernandez, Jeannot Saa Tinguiano,

     and pass rates would be if unschooled students instead attended double-shift classes.

 3.24                  The percentage of graduates able to read easily approximates the 50 percent
 estimate given to the OED mission by grade 6 teachers. Those sampled by the Multiple
 Index Cluster Survey were in primary school while PRODEP was being implemented.
 Thus, there appears to be no improvement in basic skills since the 1980s.There are not
 enough data in Niger to estimate the relationship between enrollments and achievement
 over time. It is possible, however, that in 2003 students were learning less than they did

earlier and that the proportion of students made literate has decreased since 1999.During
the 1999MLA tests, half the teachers had over 10 years of teaching experience; by 2004,
half the teachers were new and on a "volunteer" contract. Furthermore, textbooks in
schools may be fewer than during the PROSEF years. Deteriorating quality may be one
explanation for the limited demand for schooling; only 43.5 percent of the children are
enrolled even in areas where there is a school.

Poverty Alleviation and Development of Trained Human Resources

3.25      Both PRODEP and PROSEF aimed at increasing the availability of schooling in
hopes of obtaining trained human resources for sustained economic growth and poverty
alleviation. Strictly speaking, the outcome was schooling; learning was merely implied.
Was the learning provided likely to alleviate students' poverty?

3.26      In the recent sector study3'students who have enrolled in school are considered
"schooled" (scolarises) regardless of performance. However, if they fail to become
literate, the goals for which the projects were implemented are not fulfilled. Furthermore,
one must question why the donor community and government should spend so much
money to send them to school. This is a particularly poignant question for the HIPC
initiative, whose funds have been reserved for poverty alleviation. If students graduate
functionally illiterate, they may have lost the opportunity to earn or to learn their parents'
profession^.^^ Accordingly, the Nigerien press has criticized the country's schools as
suitable only for the most intelligent or financially better off. (See article in Annex A.)3g

3.27      Research suggeststhat instructionaltime availablein the schools of Niger is
insufficientto acquirebasic skills,particularly given the exclusiveuse of a non-native
language, lack of instructionalmaterials, and parents' inabilityto provide private coaching
or other compensatory activitiesfor their children (see Section 5). Reduced repetition rates

through automaticpromotion signifythat some studentsattend higher grades without
knowing the prerequisite material. However, Bank project documents showed little or no
appreciationof these inherent risks. Instructional issues were rarely brought up in the
documentsof PRODEP and PROSEF, and supervisionreports do not include classroom
observationsthat could have brought out the problem. Risks associated with poor learning
outcomes appear to have been downplayedby the Bank. Even in the appraisal document of
the ongoingproject, the discussion of risks is limited to management and financial issues.
Despite test evidence, the failure of the policy frameworkto achieve the development goal
of providing basic skills was not identifiedas a risk. Similarly,the 2003 PRSP progress
report relies on enrollmentindicatorsto suggest that targets are being achieved,without
questioningthe accuracyor implicationsof the data. No reference is made to the very low
test scores of 1999or the self-reportsof illiterategraduates in 2000. In sum, analysis and
evidenceincluded in Bank documents appearto imply that poverty alleviation depends on
mere enrollmentsrather than student learning.



4.      Ratings

Project Outcomes

4.1     The objectives of Education I were substantially relevant to the human capital
development needs of the country. Though efficiency was modest shortly after the project
end, long-term goals regarding the availability and quality of trained technicians were
achieved. The project also helped improve educational planning in primary education.
Thus the outcome of Education I is rated satisfactory.

4.2     In the two most recent projects, quality of education is not stated as an
independent objective; it is linked with access or with cost reductions into one objective.
OED considers an objective achieved when all parts are achieved. The PRODEP
objectives of improving the decreasing enrollment rates and promoting cost-effective use
of financial resources were highly relevant to Niger, particularly at a time of economic
crisis. The project met the access objectives despite enormous challenges and succeeded
in making the system more affordable. However, it failed to improve the quality of
education while reducing unit costs, and its efficiency was modest. Overall, the outcome
of PRODEP is rated satisfactory.

4.3     PROSEF was implemented at a time when it should have been possible to assess
the effects of educational quality provided in Niger given the policies implemented
during PRODEP. It did not. Though its interventions greatly improved access, the cost
cuts hampered improvements in the quality of primary education, so the combined
objective was not achieved. Similarly, planning capacity was strengthened, but
managerial capacity was not. Since the relevance and efficiency of PROSEF were also at
best modest, outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

                                                 23


Institutional Development Impact

4.4       The institutional development impact of all three projects is rated modest. In the
case of Education I, trained teachers left for non-teaching positions, while in PRODEP
and PROSEF many training activities did not have a clear outcome. Overall, however,
some institutional units were put in place that have shown continuity and the ability to
carry out their basic functions.


Sustainability

4.5       The sustainability of Education I is rated likely. The training appeals to paying
students and responds to a labor market need. The sustainability of PRODEP is also rated
likely. Cost-cutting measures were instituted along with policies that have been
maintained until 2004. The sustainability of PROSEF is uncertain. It is unknown whether
contract teachers will continue working at low salaries in the long term and whether they
will provide acceptable skill levels to students. No research is available to assess long-
term benefits to students who acquire few if any skills. Those who graduate functionally
illiterate are at risk of forgetting what little reading they know and lapsing back into
complete illitera~y.~'Also, the large-scale enrollment expansion that this project brought
about is sustainable only with large-scale donor financing. For these reasons, the
sustainability of PROSEF is rated non-evaluable.


Bank Performance

4.6      Bank performance in Education I is rated satisfactory. The Bank was flexible and
gave sound advice to the government regarding the future of the agricultural technician
school.It was also right in including funds in the project to improve planning for primary
education.In PRODEP, Bank performance is also rated satisfactory. The Bank proposed
important measures to reform the system and helped the governmentbring them about.
However, in PROSEF Bank performanceis rated unsatisfactory.Despite considerable
concernsregarding the quality of education,the Bank did not adapt its policy advice
accordingly.

4.7      There seems to have been no established rationale for the effectiveness of the
Bank's `more with less' policy. While it promoted cost reductions, the Bank may have
underestimated the impact on the provision of actual education. The ICR for PROSEF
outlines extensively the savings achieved from the various instructional reduction
measures. In contrast, the ICR expressed little concern regarding the consequences that
some of the savings would have later, either in private rates of return of those who
graduate illiterate, in reduced health outcomes, or in the much costlier adult literacy
programs.

4.8      It appearsthat the Bank vastly overestimatedpoor students' ability to learn a non-
native language and basic skillsthrough severelyreduced timeframes and means. It is



40. For example, Hartley and Swanson, 1986.

                                                            24


unclear how the Bank concluded that it was possible to cut provision of education
without affecting poor students' skills, while going against the findings of published
research on the subject. Seminal studies had already been done on instructional time and
its close relationship to a~hievement.~~Similarly, extensive research was being carried
out on bilingual education conditions and outcomes. Indeed, the government did not
evaluate student outcomes at the end of PRODEP or PROSEF.

4.9       The OED mission heard several critical comments about the neglect of learning in
the Bank's strategy (see details in Annex C). Criticismwas particularly strongwith respect
to the recruitment of untrained and less educated teacherswho teach only until they find
somethingbetter to do and who seem unable to manage classes. Concerns were also raised
about the Bank's excessive focus on the financial aspects of education and disregard of
learningissues. Some donor staff criticizedlending and debt accumulation on the basis of
controversialpolicies.

4.10      The Bank was willing to make lending conditionalon other highly unpopular
policies, like contractteacher recruitment and double shifts,but it did not try to bring
expertise and present a strong case to the government in favor of local-languageinstruction,
even after a clear opportunity came in 2001, when educationin local languageswas
legislated.Country dialoguehas also not includedthe issues associatedwith the
government-financedFranco-Arab schoolsthat split the limited instructional time between
the French and Arabic languages,resulting in particularly low learning                                          (In
other countries,Arabic and Koranic instructionare extracurricular.)


Borrower Performance

4.11      The government showed great willingness to implement the projects. Despite
difficulties and limited human resources with which to carry out the work, most activities
specified in project documents were carried out. For Education I and PRODEP borrower
performance is rated satisfactory.

4.12      Borrower performance deteriorated during PROSEF. Particularly during the
second half of the project, financial management was weak, and the staff assigned were
less well qualified. Financial reports indicated a lack of accountability, and efforts to
resolve discrepancies were limited. The government took no clear action with respect to
the extensive theft of textbooks, which severely limited schools' ability to educate
students. No thieves were ever caught, and it is unclear how diligently the police
investigated these events. Many officials who were interviewed by the mission believed
that the textbooks were stolen from regional warehouses, while others believed that fewer
textbooks had been delivered through high-level complicity. No clear allegations could
be produced to lead to an investigation. Because of the serious financial management
lapses, borrower performance for PROSEF is rated unsatisfactory.



41. Stallings, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1986 and Stallings et al, 1979

42. In Guinea, Franco-Arab schools had significantly lower scores in comparison to average performance: -7.9
percentage points in French, -14.1 points in written expression, and -9.7 in math. (Barrier et al.1998; detailed
evaluation report, p. 74-75).

                                               25


4.13     Some of the officials interviewed were of the opinion that the Bank policies were
at least partly responsible for the limited performance in NigCrien schools. Nevertheless,
they were generally optimistic and reported satisfaction with the progress in expanding
enrollments and the work that had been done. They affirmed their commitment to
improving and expanding education and reassured the mission that obstacles will be
overcome.

4.14     Few of the officials interviewed had spent time observing classroom procedures
or assessing student performance; some had not visited schools in over 10years.
Nevertheless, some repeatedly reassured the mission that teachers were in fact operating
in class as instructed, that is that teachers should speak little and support children, they
should create conditions so that children will learn, they should come half an hour earlier
to write on the board before children come, and that they cover material fast in the
beginning of the year. The decisionmakers' limited contact with classroom processes
may constrain future efforts to improve classroom instruction and basic skills acquisition.



5.      Issues for Future Consideration

Is it Possible to Achieve EFA by 2015?

5.1     Because of good policy performance, Niger received accelerated external
financial support through the Fast-Track Initiative. The country has agreed to meet
annual targets for progress against the indicative framework numerical targets and
monitoring of key outcomes (Annex A for details). How likely is it that it will reach its
goal of universal primary completion by 2015?

5.2     Despite many difficulties, Niger has a record of meeting policy objectives and
numerical targets. However, the targets of the indicative framework (Annex Table A-1)
may not be achievable by 2015. The government has a viable strategy for building semi-
finished schools on metallic structures, but government officials informally state that
about 1500 such structures per year is more likely than 3,000. Lack of a school map and
clear choice criteria may leave construction vulnerable to political abuse and favoritism.
Hiring and training teachers will also present a challenge; the country plans to hire 2500
new teachers per year, while about 27,000 will be needed by 2015 (excluding
replacements of those retiring and leaving the profession; Table 7). Yet, in 2004, Niger
already had 6,500 untrained teachers, and the government was hard pressed to find
enough secondary school graduates willing to work in rural areas for the amounts offered.
And there may not be sufficient supply or demand for secondary education to fill the
posts. One would expect students currently in the system to become teachers in a few
years, but many did not learn to read in school, so they may be unsuitable even if
promotion policies allow them to enter secondary schools.

5.3      Supply-side enrollment projections predict that 350,000 students will reach grade
6 by 2015.43In principle, all children could spend some time in school by that date. But if
most drop out and about half the grade 6 graduates continue to be unable to read well, the
government and the donors may abandon EFA. Thus, there is considerable doubt as to
whether EFA can be achieved by 2015. The doubt is also echoed in Bank documents
(PAD p. 9).

5.4      Quality improvementproblems persist. The current project plans curricular and
teacher training reforms, but in the past these did not by themselves improve quality of
education. These quality improvement elements are reflected neither in the objectives
nor in the indicators. There is no plan to make the French textbooks more readable. The
peer-teaching component included to improve performance is a pilot difficult to finance
or undertake. The better students (to the extent that they can be found) are expected to
tutor those falling behind under the guidance of mothers for no remuneration other than
prizes. This activity, which has not yet started, will only be implemented in three
provinces and needed funds will come from income-generation projects. By contrast,
activities to increase institutional capacity will be financed directly from grant funds.

5.5     How can learning outcomes improve within the country's financial and human
resource limitations? The following options could be explored.


Increasing the Class Time Spent on Instruction

5.6     Information requires classroom time for transmission and consolidation. To
benefit from donor funding, students must be engaged in activities aimed at teaching or
practicing the curricular contents. Efficient use of classroom time may enable many poor
rural students to master math, French grammar, fluent reading in French, and information
through that language.

5.7     The government may consider carrying out extensive training to increase the
amount of time students are engaged in learning activities in class and at home (through
homework). The strategy would partly include feedback to teachers and consciousness
raising of the wastage, which according to research is effective in improving use of

                                                             27


time.44Teachers must also be instructed to change technique and group students to allow
simultaneous practice rather than interact with them individually, as is currently done. In-
service training groups could support each other in organizing classes so that time is used
better. The improved performance that students may exhibit after better time use may be
also have a reinforcing value for teachers in Niger.45

5.8        It may also be important to consider an incentive structure for teachers who spend
more time teaching their students.


Using Local Languages for Basic Children's Literacy

5.9       To learn a new language, young children may require over 600 hours of
interactive engagement reflecting grammatical change patterns and syntax.46 Given the
limitations on instructional time, feedback, and teachers' knowledge, children clearly do
not process enough data in French to reproduce the grammatical patterns. Since teachers
are the only French speakers in rural areas and may not interact with them, most students
simply do not learn enough language to then learn reading or the required subjects in it.

5.10      The disappointing learning outcomes of French-mediated instruction and
encouraging experiments in Niger and elsewhere suggest that to make the majority of
students literate, early reading and basic information must be taught in local languages.
For political reasons, local languages have been considered problematic in many
countries. However, now that a law exists, Government officials state that there are no
political obstacles to their use at this time. The challenges are to teach teachers
themselves how to read and write in the languages they know and to make sure that
students have sufficient numbers of textbooks in local language^.^'

5.11      Another challenge is to convince parents. In Niger and other area countries
parents desire to see their children schooled in a way that will increase their social status.
Illiterate parents who have not been exposed to the difficulties of school sometimes say
that their children already know the local language, and are being sent to school to learn
French. It is important, therefore, to sensitize the population to the rationale for local-
language instruction.

5.12      The government might consider adopting the goal of making all students fluent
readers by the end of grade 2, at least in their local language. Extensive research
suggests that once they become fluent readers, students will be able to read on their own


44. Stallings et al, 1979.How to change the process of teaching basic skills in secondary schools: Phase I1 and 111.
(Final Report for National Institute of Educational.)Menlo Park, CA: SRI International.

45. In response to this document, the government intends to take appropriate measures for better use of instructional
time (Annex E).

46. For example, Krashen, 1981. In second-language acquisition, a college student taking immersion class in a foreign
language for three hours a week would require about four years or about GOO hours of instruction and reading to gain
performance in the new language. To a child encountering a native language, 600 hours of direct-method language
listening could pass in less than one year. Even so, after four years of learning, children often have a smaller
vocabulary compared to any mature student and make grammatical mistakes. (Putnam, H. 1975).

47. Thomas and Collier, 1997.

                                               28


the materials necessary for study in multigrade schools and to learn French faster.
Automatic readers normally do not lapse back into illitera~y.~~     So, if students drop out,
they will be able to decode messages later on and expand skills on their own.


Implementing a Sustainable Textbook Strategy

5.13       EFA depends on children's ability to read fluently early on. To use classroom
time efficiently and bring about reading fluency, textbooks (and if possible other
materials) are needed. They must exist in sufficient quantities and in constant supply so
that students can take them home during the school year, do homework with them, and
obtain enough reading practice.

5.14       Textbooks in class are necessary but not sufficient for learning basic reading.
During the OED mission, young children frequently seemed to be reading words in pages
they had seen before but they could not recognize them on another page or format.
Because of the scarce materials and brief textbooks, they had memorized the words and
were reproducing them based on superficial cues, such as page layout. Clearly, textbooks
are needed for home study and supplemental books are needed to provide more
combinations of words and practice. Also students need dictionaries that explain in local
languages and through illustrations the meaning ofevery French words encountered.
Textbooks and supplementary materials in local languages have been developed, but they
must be printed in sufficient numbers for lower grade students and distributed. Current
calls for bids are for French materials only.

5.15      The governmenthas deliberated extensivelyon strategiesto avert textbook theft.
There are plans to sendbooks directlyto schoolsrather than regional warehouses, and
private schoolswill also receive freebooks (Annex E). However, books will continue to be
printed overseas and imported, and printing books for sale is seen only as a separate
activity.The size of the task involvedin supplying all schoolswith books from abroad
means that the textbooks will continueto be used in class only and that studentswill not
have them available for homework. In fact only one book isplannedfor every twostudents
in geography, history, and grammar, exactly those subjectsfor which homework is
typically considered necessary. The large-scalethefts and bookstore sales suggest that there
is a market of parents who can afford them. To avoid furtherthefts, meet market needs, and
help educate studentswho can affordto buy books, the governmentmight consider selling
textbooks to local bookstores at affordableprices as well as making them free to all
students.

5.16      For the textbooks to be sustained in schools, local publishing and printing might
be encouraged alongside with imports. Thus, the current shortages of overseas prints can
be avoided. However, Niger imposes taxes on imports of paper and ink. A strategy to
support localpublishers might include tax abeyancefor the materials needed toprinted
low-cost books.

                                                            29


5.17      Compared to the other budget items involved in achieving EFA, the amounts for
textbooks and instructional materials are relatively low, 5-9 percent of annual startup
          they could be potentially increased to provide an abundance of the basic tool
needed for education.


Implementing an Effective Teacher Support System

5.18      Teachers are loosely connected to local in-service networks, where they are
expected to learn from their peers. The extent to which peers know more is unclear. The
government has limited communication with these networks due to distances and a lack
of trained supervisors. To make instruction more efficient, sustained, and effective means
of communication are needed.

5.19      One approach is to increase the accountability of school directors. Many do not
teach and have time in principle to supervise teachers, but the OED mission found them
consistently uninvolved. Incentives, including awards, could be given for improved
performance or showing sustained improvement in student performance. The lessons
from experience with such experiments in other countries (such as Kenya") could be
studied and improved. Champions of change could be identified among administrators
who can convince the others to perform better.

5.20      The donor community might consider the provision of telecommunication
equipment to remote inspectorate offices. VHF (very high frequency) radio or satellite
antenna (or the most recent feasible technology) could link regional and offices and use
solar power where there is no electricity. (This option was used successfully in Guinea.)



6.        Lessons

6.1      Experience with the assessed projects confirms a number of OED lessons from
the education sector:

         A policyframeworkfocused on costs and access is insufficient. PRODEP and
         PROSEF emphasized cost savings over instruction on basic skills. Policy dialogue
         and project activities need to focus on imparting information to students and
         teaching them basic skills. Providing mass education under clearly inadequate
         instructional conditions may graduate functional illiterates and benefit only those
         who are the brightest or better-off.

         Access-related indicators may be relatively easy to obtain but may not be closely
         related to learning achievements. Monitoringindicators for the two primary
         educationprojects showcased enrollmentincreases and improvements in student



49. The application for the Fast-Track Initiative estimates the cost of an initial stock of textbooks at about US$1.5
million and annual additional needs at U S 1 million.

  flows but not whether studentshad acquiredbasic knowledge and skills. But the
  administrationof achievement tests is laborious and difficultto carry out regularly
  in low-income countries.Innovative and rapid means must be sought to gauge
  students' likely achievement(such as the proportion of students able to read
  fluently a simple text.)

 Textbooks are crucial contributors to student learning; if they are unavailable or if
  students cannot study from them sufficiently, the rest of the educational
  investments lose their effectiveness. Procurement methods andplans must aim at
  making large numbers of textbooks available to studentsfree, but also available
 for sale at the market. Textbook management is most effective if it takes into
  account the printing strengths of the local private sector and the community
  school associations.

0Though in other countries enrollments in agricultural schools tend to be low and
  labor linkages weak, in Niger there is a demand for the skills provided. Bank
  investments of earlier decades in agricultural education may continue toprovide
 skills relevant to the economy if policy dialogue is focused toward modernizing
 courses, generating income to schools, and catering to the populations likely to be
 interested in agricultural training.

Annex A. Sectoral Information and the Ten-Year Plan

Donor Involvement in the Education Sector of Niger

1.        Niger continues to be highly dependent on foreign grants and loans, which have
on average been roughly equal to domestic fiscal revenues between 1999 and 2002. The
donor community has coordinated efforts to expand education in Niger for the past 20
years, particularly in financing school construction, education for girls, bilingual
education, and school feeding programs. There are about 25 donors and include the
Afi-icanDevelopment Bank, Islamic Development Bank, OPEP, France, Germany,
Belgium, Norway, Japan, Luxemburg, Canada and UN agencies.

2.        According to persons interviewed by the OED mission, the donor community
supports the same objectives, collaborates well, and meets frequently under the
leadership of Canada. The Bank regularly and extensively consults with the donors. At a
forum in June 2003, the donor community endorsed the Bank-supported Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper as the basis for its assistance, supported a gradual transition
from project to program financing, and agreed on the need to further strengthen
coordination and harmonization of donor policies and procedures. A group of donors has
agreed to finance the budget necessary for the Fast-Track Initiative (FTI), which started
in 2003. Norway and Netherlands have committed grants of US$1 million and US$5
million respectively to be held in trust by IDA.

3.        Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit Project I (Cr. 3576-NIR for US$70
million; FY2001-2003) devoted 22 percent of the proceeds for education. The project
executed the budget for the first quarter of FY 2002, in particular for the items listed in
paragraphs 59 through 64 of the Program, as evidenced by ajoint report from the
Ministries of Finance, National Education and Public Health. Specifically, it covered at
2001 budget levels the following: (a) Recruitment and training costs of new contract
teachers; (b) Salaries of all existing contract teachers; (c) Subsistence costs of students
attending the reformed teacher's colleges; (d) Costs linked to the expansion of double-
shift teaching in urban areas; and (e) Costs of monitoring and evaluation of the program,
including the collection and compilation of statistical data, the continuous undertaking of
public expenditure reviews, as well as of an expenditure tracking survey." Project
outcome was rated satisfactory, sustainability as likely, institutional development impact
as modest, and the Bank and Borrower performance as satisfactory.

4.        The Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit Project II (Cr. 3827-NIR for U S 6 5
million has neared completion. As of June 2003, the education and health ministries had
received cash releases amounting to only 33 percent and 18.5percent, respectively of
their total voted budget for 2003, though more was subsequently received. In the case o f
education, these cash releases were largely used to pay salaries, leaving little for other
recurrent expenditures. As a result, some school cafeterias did not receive funding and

 could no longer feed students, with the result that many children stopped attending
 school.52


 Experimental Schools in National Languages

 5.       This experiment has been carried out since 1982.The schools are currently
 supported by the European Union. There are 39 of them with about 5354 students, and
 have been teaching grades 1-3 in local languages since 1982.Parents are under the
 impression that their children should be studying in French, and these schools seem to get
 little attention.

 6.       An evaluation has shown that children in bilingual schools learn to read in
national language fast. At grade 4 they read French better than studentsin traditional
 schools, where half the children in grade 4 of traditional schools do not know how to read
 at all. The difference between the two groups disappears at grade 6. Nevertheless quality
of education in national language classes is as low as that of traditional classes, and 4`h
graders score only 60% in reading5'


The Role of the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund

7.        FTI financing under EFA will support the country's 10-year program, which
largely coincides with EFA timeframe. Program highlights are:

          a. Access:Increasing primary-school gross enrollment rates to 74 percent in
               2012 (70 percent for girls and for rural areas). To achieve these, 2,500 new
               contractual teachers will be hired every year and a similar number of
               classrooms will be built.

          b. Quality:Reducing repetition rate from 13percent in 2001 to 5 percent in 2012
               in grades 1-5 and from 37 percent to 10percent in grade 6; increase primary-
               school completion rate to 79 percent by 2012. To achieve these goals,
               curricula will be revised, a new textbook policy will be implemented, and
               teachers will be trained.

          c. Management: Improve planning and evaluation capacity, decentralize
               management, and involve communities in school management.


8.        FTI involves an initial three-year pledge of support that is extendable to 2015.j4In
May 2004, when the OED mission took place, the FTI activities had not yet started. An

54. To implement the Fast-Track Initiative, donors commit to sustained and predictable financing for countries
committed to EFA indicative framework (Table A-1). The government's request estimates that the total amount needed
the years 2003-2005 is 178.91billion CFA, i.e.,about US$357 million. National resources are only about 35 percent of
the amount, 64.86 billion CFA (US129 million). External aid already available is 48.6 billion CFA (about US97.2).
Thus, the gap estimated by the government for just three years is 65.4 billion CFA, or about $131 million, U S 5 6

Administration Agreement had been signed for the allocation of 2003. It is a single-donor
grant arrangement for budget support (with a negative list) that had not yet disbursed,
pending various agreements between the donors and the government and among donors
as well as a proposal from the government regarding the 2004 allocation. Amounts
committed by that date included a Norwegian grant of US$1 million and a Netherlands
grant of US$5 million. The funds are held in trust by the World Bank. A considerable
financing gap still exists.

9.        The EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund provides two to three year transitional financing to
developing countries to scale up programs to achieve a complete primary education for
all children, and leverage additional and longer term financing to enable them to sustain
the effort. Donors include Netherlands, Norway, Italy, and Belgium. Niger is scheduled
to receive US$5 million for calendar year 2003, US$8 million for 2004, and US$8 for
2005.

10.       The conditions are: (a) The existence of an Endorsed Education Sector Plan in the
country; (b) Demonstrated strong commitment on the part of the country's government;
(c) Strong performance by the country's government towards achievement of the goal of
universal primary school completion for girls and boys by 2015; (d) Capacity to
implement the endorsed Education Sector Plan; and (e) Exceptional limitations in the
external donor funding available for the country's primary education program.

11.       Indicative framework parameters include: (a) Tax effort at least 14-18 % of GDP;
(b) Education spending about 20% of total recurrent budget; (c) Primary education at
least 50% of total recurrent budget; (d) Average teacher salaries about 3.5 times per
capita GDP; (e) Non salary spending (books, materials, teacher training, supervision,
targeted subsidies to HIV/AID orphans, etc.) at about 33% of recurrent spending; (f)
Pupil: teacher ratio about 40; (g) Repetition no more than 10%; (h) class time of at least
950 hours per year.

12.       The objectives of the 10-yearprogram and Basic Education Project are:

          a. Cost-related:(i) Institutionalization of contractual teacher recruitment; (ii) -
               Restructuring and enhancement of inservice training centers (CAPED); (iii)
               Re-organizing primary education into three sub-cycles along with an
               automatic promotion policy within each sub-cycle; limiting repetition in grade
               6 to 15 %; (iv) Privatizing textbook distribution and shifting responsibility of
              textbook management to local leaders and school management committees.
               (v) Training teachers to teach at least two subjects in lower secondary schools.
               (vi) Implementing a rolling three-year program budget and a results-based
              budgeting and execution. (vii) Allocating at least 50% o f the education
              budget to primary education.




million per year. Just teacher training and construction supervision costs amount to about USs1.2 million per year. The
government will devote each year 28 percent of recurrent expenditures (aside from debt) to education in general; 50
percent of education expenditures to primary education, and 40 percent of debt relief funds for universal primary
education.

        b. Institutional strengthening. (i) Restructuring the MOE through the adoption
            of a new charter and the timely appointment o f staff to key positions. (ii)
            Partly decentralizing the MOE recurrent budget decisions to the regional
            level. (iii) Strengthening fiduciary management and oversight of
            deconcentrated financial personnel. (iv) Empowering local entities and
            communities to manage schools (project component to be financed entirely
            through an IDA grant)

13.     In terms of quality, the 10-year plan and associated project include the following
activities to improve access and student performance:

    P Expansion of one-teacher (multigrade) schools as an alternative education model
        for remote areas;

    >   Peer-tutoring programs for underperforming students, overseen by community
        mothers; tutoring students will receive awards financed by local income-
        generating activities through small grants provided by the project (to be
        implemented in three regions);

    >   Program evaluation.

Access indicators include:

     i Increasing access to grade 1 from 40 percent in 2001 to 74 percent en 2012 and in
        rural areas from 39 to 72.5 percent ;

    ii Increasing gross enrollment rates in primary school from 37 percent en 2001 to 74
        percent en 2012 and for girls from 29,6 to 70 percent ;

   iii Increasing primary gross enrollment rates in rural areas from 32 percent en 2001
        70 percent en 2012 ;

14.     Attaining these objectives will require the recruitment of 27,323 new teachers for
primary schools and the construction of 25,448 classrooms to place 1,926,495 students.

Quality indicators include:

   i Reducing the mean repetition rate in primary school from 13percent en 2001 to 5
     percent in 2012;

  ii Reducing the mean repetition rate in grade 6 from 37 percent en 2001 to 10percent
      in 2012;

 iii Raising primary-school completion rate from 23.7 percent en 2001 to 79 percent in
      2012.

15.     To achieve the qualitative objectives of the program, there will be a curricular
reform for greater relevance and the preservice and inservice training will also be

reformed. Students will receive more textbooks and instructional materials in sufficient
quantity and quality, and methods will be installed to evaluate students.

Policy measures will include:

       resource allocation to education of 28 percent of the recurrent budget (aside from
       debt) ;40 percent of the amount provided for the HIPC debt relief, and (iii) at
       least 50 percent of the education budget dedicated to primary education.

       1. improved resource allocation to maintain the student-teacher ratio at 40 :1 ;
            (b) recruitment of 2500 contractual teachers per year, and (c) school
            construction at reduced costs, (74% of them in durable materials and 26% in
            local materials) ;

       2.   training to prevent HIV/AIDS through integrating health concepts in schools
            and involving school committees;

       3.   improved distribution of textbooks so that they will be available for the
            students;

       4.   stimulation of private education, particularly in secondary education; rental
            and sale of schools, formulation of incentives, etc.

Annex B. Project Activities

The projects (particularly PRODEP and PROSEF) had some common activities and
implementation problems, which are described in this Annex along with achievement of
specific targets where applicable.

Civil works. The projects built schools, surpassing construction targets. Education I
succeeded in lowering costs through experimentation to about US$5000 each and built 60
classrooms. Initially schools were built by the Ministry of Public Works, but the task was
reassigned to the School Construction Bureau, which used low-cost designs. Without
school mapping, determination of school placement depended on the recommendations of
the inspectorates, but most villages lacked schools, so many locations were reasonable.
Thus, PRODEP built about 985 classrooms and PROSEF another 1,770.Altogether,
2,815 classrooms were built, expanding access to about 125,000 new students (15-25
percent of the 2003 enrollments). However, efforts to make communities build schools or
contribute toward construction were not successful because of poverty. Some
communities, however, built reed huts without floors, where instruction takes place. Also,
school refurbishing activities fell below target as more schools were built. Some of the
construction during PROSEF was unprogrammed and the decision criteria unclear.
PRODEP also financed buildings for the development and storage of textbooks and five
inspectors' offices (Tables B-2 and B-3). Overall this component was satisfactoryfor
bothprojects.

Textbookproduction and distribution. PRODEP supported the development of the
National Institute for Pedagogical Documentation, Research, and Promotion and tried to
develop the skills of authors who were employees. Curricula were to become more
relevant, textbooks were to support the knowledge base. After long delays, only 30 of the
44 textbooks were produced; starting in 1992, these were printed in over one million
copies, one for every two                        It is unclear how extensively this lot of books was
used in schools. They are no longer found in classes, so they may have been worn out,
but officials also do not recall reports of theft. PROSEF worked with private-sector
writers, but fewer titles were produced than expected, and only about half the target
number of books were delivered to the government. A large number of these were stolen
from the warehouses and sold in the private market. (Table B-3) Despite the extensive
evidence that could help trace the thieves, no one was arrested. Thus, students were in
schools with few if any textbooks and remain so to this day. The textbook component is
moderately satisfactoryfor PRODEP and unsatisfactoryfor PROSEF.

Teacher recruitment andpre-service training. Both PRODEP and PROSEF emphasized
the recruitment of less expensive teachers who had undergone less training. The four-year
duration of teacher training colleges (attended by students after 10 years of education)
was reduced to three, two, and during PROSEF to one-year training. Hiring of contract
teachers accelerated after 1998with a new framework law governing teacher training                             -
and the Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit I, budget support was given under the



55. The Staff Appraisal Report states that books would be "loaned free of charge," but does not explain how two
students were to share them.

condition that untrained teacher? would receive 30 days of training and be visited by
inspectors four times a year. The follow-on project also stipulated a pilot program of
decentralized block grants at the school level for training. j7 The extent to which these
measures have been taken could not be ascertained during the mission. However, three of
the contract teachers interviewed by the mission stated that they had received training for
six days.

In-sewice training. Many of the contract teachers hired during PRODEP and PROSEF
were untrained, and in-service training became important to help them deliver the
curriculum. Many training activities took place. PRODEP provided training for 420
unqualified assistant teachers, 1,757 teachers, 1,206 directors, and 298 pedagogical
advisors (Table B-2 and B-3). The cost-effective solution devised during PRODEP and
expanded during PROSEF was the formation of teacher groups studying in closely
located schools. Thus, it was expected that newer contract teachers would learn from
trained teachers what they needed to know. Pedagogical advisors could not easily reach
the field due to limited roads and vehicle availability. The government relies on this
model (CAPED-Cellule d'himation Pedagogique) for in-service training, but the
projects never evaluated what teachers learned through it or even how often they met.
The limited evidence of training effectiveness is discouraging; during OED field visits,
no evidence was seen of child-centered methodology, despite training (Annex Table B-
3). To the contrary, teachers had been instructed to work only with the few more
competent students. (See section on OED observations para. 2.15). Overall, teacher
training components were not rateable.

Planning and management strengthening. Activities to increase institutional capacity in
the Ministry of Basic Education included staff training and technical assistance (Tables
B-1, B-2, B-3). The activities were carried out but with considerable delays and bore
limited results. During PROSEF, for example, many pedagogical advisors retired from
service soon after receiving training in planning. Thus, despite technical assistance, a
school map could only be established for one region, and school construction decisions
are still made on the basis of village-level requests and local recommendations rather
than demographic criteria. Statistical data were produced until the school year 1991-92,
but could not be collected in 1994 and 1995 due to teacher strikes. (Enrollment data for
these years presented in this report were interpolated.) An evaluation unit was established
under PROSEF that carried out a sample-based learning assessment in 1999 (see more
detail in section 3 of the main report), but the findings were not used to improve
instruction. The institutional strengthening component ofPRODEP is moderately
satisfactory and of and PROSEF is unsatisfactory.




56. Untrained teachers often do not provide continuity in instructional objectives or evaluate students.Nevertheless,
many studies have not shown a clear benefit for extensive in-service education.

Annex C. Statements and Issues Raised in Mission Interviews

Interviews took place individually or in small groups as the circumstances dictated. The
persons interviewed included:

- teachers, principals, inspectors, regional directors in the institutions of areas visited;
- government officials in the ministries of Agriculture and Education;
- staff of donor agencies residing in Niamey.

 The table below reflects the number of respondents who indicated a view on each
question; persons could raise one or more issues. Not all staff had opinions about all
questions and sometimes only one person in a group expressed opinions, so reply
statistics are approximate. Teachers were only asked questions regarding inputs and
effectiveness, since most did not know who had paid for the inputs they had received.
The questions posed to respondents were:

What were the benefits of the project in your school, geographic or sectoral area?

-   What problems did you face in implementing the project? What were its
    disadvantages?

-   Which components worked best in bringing about results, which did not? (some
    persons interviewed were asked about specific components, as appropriate).

-   How effective were the Bank staff or consultants who worked on the project?

-   What training did you receive through the project? Did it teach you what it was
    supposed to?

-   The project had some qualified audits. What financial irregularities were there in your
    area ofjurisdiction?

-   What would be different in the education sector if the project had not existed?

-   Other issues and observations.

Project benefits
 There was a visible improvement in primary education provision in
rural areas                                                                                     1
Project reached deeply in rural areas and provided schools where it
was not thought possible                                                                        1            1
Project very effective in establishing agricultural technician training


The project was best in classroom construction                                                 3             4

Project foisted untrained teachers on the poor                                                 2             3
Effectiveness of Bank staff, Bank policies
The Bank offered many possibilities but also put severe constraints               1             1            3
Bank staff mainly talked about costs                                              2            3             3
The Bank forced the country to hire unqualified teachers against the              1
Ministry's best judgment                                                                       1             3
The Bank forced the country to open double shift schools against
educators' best judgment                                                                       2             2
The Bank did not pay attention to quality                                         2            4             3
The Bank did not push hard enough to bring culprits to justice or stop                                       2
the textbook abuse
Though it received debt relief Niger is again accumulating debt for                                          1
education on shaky policy advice that leaves most students illiterate
Qualified audits, mismanagement
Textbook thefts had high-level collusion, not merely warehouse staff                                         1

Counterfactual  -if  project had not existed                               I
Another donor would have done what Bank has done, no problem                      1            3             3
There would be fewer students but learning more                                                1             1

The projects were invaluable, education would not be the same                                  1             1

Issues and observations

Earlier the education system had better performance                        I                   1             1
There are difficulties in generalizing project effects, but it is expected
they will be overcome                                                                          2             2
Curricula are not well adapted to student needs, instructional methods
antiquated                                                                                     3             3
Schools have been opened, but now the country must concentrate on
quality                                                                                                      4
Agricultural technicians are well motivated and trained                           3
Agricultural technicians receive good jobs                                       4

No decision-making use of monitoring and evaluation                        I                   1             1
Decentralization needed for textbooks, salaries, hiring                    I                                 3

Ref.               Your letter dated December 9,2004

         We have received the project performance assessment for the three education
projects implemented in Niger between 1998 and 2001. The findings are highly relevant
and could help Niger to fine-tune its strategy in the context of the attainment of the
Millennium Development Goals. However, without questioning the assumptions made in
the assessment, certain clarifications are required in order to give an objective picture of
the situation.

(i) Absence of students during Ms. Helen Abadzi's mission

         The mission took place in the last week of May 2004, which marked the
beginning of the rainy season and the sowing time in Niger. During this period, parents
in rural areas usually take their children out of school to provide temporary help on the
farm.

         The assessment of school performance conducted by the Service de
De`veloppement et d 'Evaluationde Programmes de Formation (SEDEP) [Service for the
Development of Training Programs] of Likge University in the context of the Basic
Education Sector Project (PROSEF) showed the impact of the length of the school year
on children's learning. In particular, it noted that "students in Niger lose one whole
school year over the six years of the cycle, because of late starting and early ending of the
school year."

         In light of the recommendations made in this assessment and in the context of the
implementation of the Ten-Year Development Plan for Education (PDDE), the Ministry
has adopted new measures to increase the number of hours of instruction. These include:

                                                  66                                 Annex E


     0  A better organized start to the school year: assignment and arrival of teaching and
        supervisory staff two weeks before the official starting date; delivery of supplies
        and textbooks to schools within the same time frame.
     0  Rescheduling of school examinations: organization of year-end evaluations for
        classes not having examinations at the end of June and of leaving examinations at
        the beginning of July.
     0  Involvement of School Management Committees (COGES) in the management of
        teaching staff: payment of salaries, performance monitoring, etc.

        In addition to these measures, teaching methods are suggested to ensure that the
allotted school time is in fact used for real school work.

(ii) Management of textbooks purchased under the Basic Education Sector Project
(PROSEF)

        Under PROSEF, about 1,100,000 textbooks were purchased for students in basic
cycle 1(primary). In 2001, as a result of the latest purchase, each student should have an
average of 1.6textbooks for all subjects. In 2004, when Ms. Helen Abadzi's mission
took place, this figure should have been about 1.1textbooks per student for all subjects
with the increase in enrollment. This explains why the mission saw very few textbooks.

        During this entire period, textbooks were of course purchased using the national
budget, but the allocations were onlyjust enough to meet the needs of the new students.
However, losses were noted in the textbook distribution chain, which led the Ministry to
adopt the following strategy for textbook distribution: suppliers are responsible for
textbook distribution. The textbooks are packed separately for each school, inspectorate
and Regional Directorate for Basic Education (DREBA). They are delivered directly to
schools. The COGES receive the textbooks in schools.

(iii) Initial training of teachers

        The assessment mentions shortcomings in the initial training of teachers for basic
cycle 1. Until 2000, teacher training was provided by inspectors, pedagogical advisers
and disciplinary specialists. After 2001, following implementation of the retirement of
civil servants with 30 years of actual service, the staffing of teacher training colleges
deteriorated considerably. Over 80 percent of the instructors at such colleges are primary
school teachers or persons performing national civic service, who do not have the
qualifications to train trainers.

        As part of the current reform, training was started in 2004 for forty (40) inspectors
and pedagogical advisers and forty-five (45) educators to replace these primary school
teachers. This measure, together with curriculum reform in the Ecole Normale
Supkrieure and other teacher training colleges, will help to upgrade the initial training of
teachers.

                                                  67                                Annex E


(iv) Actual primary school enrollment

        The assessment report states "It is possible that principals of rural schools have
incentives to overstate enrollments in rural areas in order to qualify, for example, for
school feeding programs." It should be noted that the enrollments recorded in mid-
December were cross-checked with the figures given in the year-end reports submitted to
the Ministry by each inspectorate. In addition, beneficiaries of school feeding programs
(40,000 students) in 2004 represented only 4 percent of enrollments. The increase in the
number of beneficiaries is the result of strict programming by the World Food
Programme (WFP) and the Ministry.

(v) Rate of transition from primary to secondary school

        The transition rate undoubtedly improved considerably between 1980 and 2002.
In 2004, however, it would have been about 48.8 percent. Under the Fast-Track
Initiative, Niger is committed to reducing this transition rate to about 40 percent by 2010.
Arrangements have therefore been made for students who cannot move on to general
secondary schools to receive vocational training, particularly at community development
training centers (CFDC).

(vi) Expenditure and reduction of unit costs

        Contrary to what is stated in the assessment (page 16), the share of education in
the national budget has declined steadily, from 42.1 to 24.1 percent of national budget
revenue between 1990 and 2002. With regard to the high unit costs, the situation is as
follows: (i) a sharp decrease in unit cost in basic cycle 2 (fi-om 102,000 CFA francs in
1998 to 66,300 CFA francs in 2002) and a significant increase in unit cost in general
secondary education (111,200 CFA francs in 1998 and 214,000 CFA francs in 2002).
This increase is due mainly to the decline in secondary school (lycke) enrollment.

(vii) Classroom construction

        With regard to the establishment of school infrastructures, contrary to what
``governmentofficials informally state ...," current production capacities of the building
and public works sector in Niger are about 1,500 classrooms a year. Measures are being
taken to increase these capacities, in particular by making sufficient qualified staff
available to this sector and by improving capacities for execution and monitoring of
work.

        We hope that you will take these comments into account in the final version of the
report.

                                               Very truly yours,
