It includes:\n            (a) technical assistance and fellowships to assist in\n            educational planning and project preparation; (b) technical\n            assistance to the Ministry of the Civil Service and Labor to\n            establish a training directorate, review the needs for\n            upgrading and formulate pilot upgrading programs for the\n            public administration; (c) the final phase of expansion and\n            upgrading of an agricultural technician training institute\n            at Kolo; (d) the development of a new animal production\n            training school at Kolo; and (e) technical assistance and\n            operating costs for project management. Project risks relate\n            primarily to the implementation of the agricultural and\n            animal production technician training and include possible:\n            (a) implementation delays; (b) inefficiencies in the\n            proposed training programs; and (c) factors affecting the\n            efficient field work of graduates from the project\n            institutions. Measures of minimize risks are included in the project."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
