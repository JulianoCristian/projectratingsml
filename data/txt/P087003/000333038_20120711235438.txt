 F. Results Framework Analysis

 Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The Central Asia AIDS Control Project had the following original development objectives: (i) Reduce the
 growth rate of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Central Asia in the period 2005-10; (ii) Establish a sustainable
 mechanism in Central Asia - the Regional AIDS Fund - that would serve as a vehicle for financing
 HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities in the Region beyond the end of the project; (iii) Contribute
 to better regional cooperation in Central Asia, and effective inter-sectoral collaboration between public
 sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector on HIV/AIDS control in this region.

 Three out of the five original PDO indicators were partially achieved, and two others were not achieved.
 Out of the ten Intermediate Outcome indicators, two were achieved, and eight others were partially
 achieved (see Table 3).

 Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
 The PDOs were formally revised on January 14, 2010. The earlier PDOs were replaced by a single
 revised PDO, which stated:
 The Project will contribute to controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS in participating countries in the Central
 Asia Region by establishing regional mechanisms to support national HIV/AIDS programs.

 All the three indicators for the revised PDO were achieved. Nine out of the twelve Intermediate Outcome
 indicators were achieved, and the remaining three indicators were partially achieved (see Table 4).

  The aggregate amounts of funds planned to be granted in each year are the sums of target amounts of large and
 small grants to be approved (Intermediate Outcome Indicators No.5 and 6). In assessing the achievement of
 disbursement targets by year, an assumption is made that all grant funds approved/granted in a certain year had to be
 disbursed during the same year. This does not seem rational (especially, regarding the 18-month large grants);
 however, this was how the approved grant amounts were actually budgeted.

I. Disbursement Profile
1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     The Central Asia AIDS Control Project was approved on March 15, 2005. The
Development Grant Agreement was signed on May 12, 2005, and the Grant became effective
on November 4, 2005. The beneficiary countries were Kazakhstan (population 16.5 million), the
Kyrgyz Republic (population 5.6 million), Tajikistan (population 7.6 million) and Uzbekistan
(population 28.1 million). It was the first-ever multi-country AIDS project in the Europe and
Central Asia Region (ECA) and was financed by the IDA13 Pilot Program for Regional Projects.
The US$26.9 million equivalent of donor financing included US$25.0 million equivalent grant
from IDA and US$1.85 million equivalent grant from the UK Department for International
Development (DFID).

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.      There was global concern about potentially explosive growth of HIV prevalence in the
four countries of the region. While overall prevalence in the general population in the region was
believed to be quite low (<0.5%), it was clear that these levels might increase, particularly due to
increased transmission from the key high-risk groups of injecting drug users (IDU) and sex
workers (SW). Sector work produced for this project 9 identified IDUs and SWs as the key
drivers of the epidemic for this region (paragraph 25) and also the strategies to reduce overall
growth of HIV prevalence in the population by reducing transmission within and from these
high-risk groups. 10 Complementary strategies required raising general population awareness.
Similar strategies had been adopted in non-African HIV epidemics, such as in India.11

3.       Political and institutional factors hindered direct delivery of services to marginalized
high-risk groups. Indeed, dialogue in the ECA region around HIV/AIDS as a development
priority had faced issues of denial of transmission modes, indifference to high-risk groups, and
weak technical capacity in the regional technical agencies (such as UNAIDS) and countries.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, each country faced challenges including
significantly lower funding for public health, a need to modernize their inherited public health
institutions, and the need to address cross-border issues such as the migration of high-risk groups.
Finally, cooperation in public health across the countries was weak.

4.     The commitment to HIV/AIDS control, especially in addressing controversial issues like
IDU and SW was mixed across the countries. The Central Asia AIDS Declaration signed during
the Central Asian Conference on HIV/AIDS on May 16-18, 2001 between the four governments
represented some regional cooperation. However, open discussion of IDU, SW and sexual

   Project Appraisal Document, Second National HIV/AIDS Control Project in India (Report No: 18918-IN); May
1999.

                                                        1
transmission was lacking. Moreover, a non-governmental organization (NGO) sector to advocate
for such marginalized groups did not exist under the Soviet system.

5.      Rationale for the Bank involvement included: (i) the Bank’s comparative advantage
versus other donors to pull together countries and partners; and (ii) the fact that HIV growth was
a threat to human capital, economic growth and poverty reduction.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.     The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) stated that the overall objective of the project
was to contribute to minimizing the potential negative human and economic impact of a
generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic. The PAD stated that the project would:

       i. Reduce the growth rate of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Central Asia in the period
            2005-10;
       ii. Establish a sustainable mechanism in Central Asia - the Regional AIDS Fund (RAF) -
            that will serve as a vehicle for financing HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities
            in the Region beyond the life of the project; and
       iii. Contribute to better regional cooperation in Central Asia, and effective inter-sectoral
            collaboration between public sector, NGOs and private sector on HIV/AIDS control
            in this region.

7.      The achievement of the original PDOs was to be measured by the following outcome
indicators as identified in Annex 3 of the PAD and Supplemental Letter to the Development
Grant Agreement (DGA) dated May 12, 2005:

       i. HIV/AIDS Incidence Rate (in the PAD) or HIV/AIDS Growth Rate (in the
            Supplemental Letter);
       ii. At least 60% of groups at risk covered by the RAF activities;
       iii. Stakeholders consider RAF performance satisfactory;
       iv. RAF is financed beyond the life of the Project (5 years); and
       v. National Coordination Mechanisms and Regional Project Steering Committee
            (RPSC) integrate representatives of Governments, NGOs and donors and meet at least
            twice a year.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

8.     The original PDOs were formally revised on January 14, 2010 and replaced with the
following: The Project will contribute to controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS in participating
countries in the Central Asia region by establishing regional mechanisms to support national
HIV/AIDS programs.




                                                2
9.      The achievement of the revised PDO was to be measured by the following outcome
indicators as identified in the Restructuring Paper dated December 18, 2009:

           i. Develop institutional framework to inform policies at national/regional levels;
           ii. Establish a Central Asia RAF; and
           iii. Strengthen the capacity and cooperation between public, NGO, and the private
                sectors at the regional and national levels.

10.     The justifications listed in the Restructuring Paper were:
 Unrealistic PDO: the original PDO of reducing the HIV/AIDS incidence/growth rate was a
    higher-level objective which depended on efforts outside the project’s influence and for
    which the project could not be reasonably held accountable.
 Measurement difficulties: relying on trends in the growth rate of the epidemic was
    problematic because the incidence in Central Asia was based on HIV case reporting which
    represented only a fraction of new infections occurring in the region.
 Weaknesses in the Results Framework (RF), which had limited capacity to measure
    performance of project activities or their contribution to the expected outcomes. Specifically,
    several outcome and intermediate indicators were not directly related to Project activities or
    did not have baseline or target values.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The direct beneficiaries of the project investments at appraisal were the highly vulnerable
or vulnerable groups (IDU, SW, men having sex with men [MSM], prisoners, trafficked people,
migrants, truckers, cross-border traders, at-risk youth), people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA),
and families in the general public who benefited from the awareness raising, prevention,
treatment, and care services provided through the RAF grants. Public agencies, NGOs and the
private sector organizations were to benefit from strengthened institutional capacity to counteract
HIV infection, and the four governments were to benefit indirectly from the inter-sectoral and
regional collaboration. The main beneficiaries remained the same after the restructuring.

1.5 Original Components12

12.        The project had three components.

13.    Component 1. Regional Coordination, Policy Development and Capacity Building
(US$7.5 million or 27.8 percent of total project costs). This component aimed to: (i) establish a
legal environment that facilitates the implementation of the HIV/AIDS Regional Strategy,
including prevention work with highly vulnerable groups such as IDU, CSW, MSM, prisoners
and mobile populations; (ii) improve information and decision-making based on good quality
epidemiological data; and (iii) build capacity of public agencies, NGOs and the private sector
engaged in HIV/AIDS control. This component included three sub-components, as follows:




12
     The estimated component costs in this Section include contingencies.

                                                           3
14.     Sub-component 1.1 Regional HIV/AIDS Coordination and Policy Development. This
sub-component was to focus on national and regional coordination of HIV/AIDS programs; and
further establishment of a regional strategic and regulatory framework that would facilitate
prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in Central Asia. It was to finance (i) the activities of the
RPSC, national coordination mechanisms, and establishment of links between the national and
regional coordination; (ii) further strategic and policy development; (iii) necessary local and
international technical assistance to elaborate and/or amend proposed strategies and regulations;
(iv) studies that would inform the policy formulation process and regional meetings for policy
review. Training and technical assistance was to be provided for (i) strengthening national and
regional inter-sectoral coordination mechanisms for HIV/AIDS control, including establishing
the RPSC at the regional level; (ii) reviewing and revising legislation affecting vulnerable groups
(including anti-discrimination and decriminalization laws); (iii) advocating and communicating
about HIV/AIDS; (iv) adopting standardized approaches to diagnosis and treatment of
HIV/AIDS and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs); and (v) facilitating procurement of
commodities.

15.     Sub-component 1.2. Surveillance and Regional Monitoring and Evaluation Systems.
This sub-component was to finance sentinel and second-generation surveillance systems that
track drug use, STIs, HIVAIDS and TB at the regional level. The sub-component was also to
contribute to the development of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems to monitor the
regional spread of the epidemic and the impact of regional epidemic drivers, such as drug use
and migration - and that was to enable evidence-based planning and decision-making. The M&E
system was to be able to provide information on: (i) inputs, processes and outputs of programs
financed by Governments, NGOs and international agencies working on HIV/AIDS prevention
and control; and (ii) outcomes and impact of those programs. Assistance was to be provided to
improve data collection, analysis, and reporting practices; gaps in diagnostic capacity and
training were to be addressed.

16.     Sub-component 1.3. Human Resources Development. This sub-component was to
finance: (i) curriculum development; (ii) development, publication and dissemination of training
materials; (iii) travel and subsistence for regional meetings; (iv) training of trainers at the
regional level; and (v) establishment of the Regional Prevention Resource Network. Training at
the national level was to be financed by developing partners active in the region (DFID, USAID,
GFATM, OSI, etc.). Under the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant, a
consultant was to help prepare a HIV/AIDS Training Plan.

17.      Component 2. Central Asia Regional AIDS Fund (US$16.7 million or 61.9 percent of
total project costs). This component was to establish a demand-driven RAF to finance initiatives
that would contribute to containing the rapidly growing epidemic of HIV/AIDS and STIs. This
grant facility was considered consistent with the regional scope of the Project and was expected
to (i) promote regional cooperation; (ii) allow for better coverage of gaps in AIDS-related
activities; (iii) increase transparency over the use of grant funds; (iv) encourage grant applicants
from participating countries, through evaluation criteria, to target projects in priority areas; and
(v) build local capacity to develop and manage projects. The grant was to finance goods,
consulting services, training, resources for sub-projects, and operating costs. The RAF was to
manage two schemes: a large grants scheme and a small grants scheme. Initially, both schemes

                                                 4
were to be managed by the RPMU; the small grants scheme was to be decentralized to the
country level for management by national coordinating bodies.

18.     Component 3. Project Management (US$2.8 million or 10.4 percent of total project
costs). The Regional Project Management Unit (RPMU) was being contracted to work with the
Kyrgyz Health Reform Project Management Unit (PMU) for the duration of the PHRD Grant,
but was to move to Almaty for project implementation. All RPMU staff had been selected, and
the Project Executive Director was contracted before appraisal. Other key staff were contracted
before effectiveness. This component was to finance 15 RPMU staff, office equipment and
furniture, technical assistance, training and operating costs of the RPMU, support to operating
costs for the RPSC and Technical Working Groups (TWG), and staff time and operating costs
for the Country Project Coordinator/Unit (CPCs). The component was also to finance Project
M&E System and Management Information System (MIS), including Financial Management and
Accounting System, and annual financial audits.

1.6 Revised Components

19.     There were no revisions to the components.

1.7 Other significant changes

20.    Change in Grant Recipient. The original Recipient of the Grant, Central Asia
Cooperation Organization (CACO), was subsumed into a larger political and economic regional
organization, Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC) through a decision taken by the CACO
Council of Heads of States on October 6, 2006. A Grant Assumption Agreement between IDA
and EurAsEC as the new Recipient was signed on November 17, 2006.

21.     Reallocations of funds. There were two reallocations: the first on June 23, 2009 through
the Country Director’s approval and the second on January 14, 2010 as part of the Level I
restructuring approved by the Board of Executive Directors (see Annex 1 Table (d)). The first
reallocation partially compensated for the higher than expected operating costs, and the second
one provided additional support to regional policy and coordination activities under Component
1 and to project management under Component 3.

22.     Restructuring. In addition to the reallocation of funds, the January 14, 2010
restructuring introduced changes to PDO and Results Framework (RF) as described in Section
1.3. Also, RAF processes and manuals were revised twice, in 2007 and 2008 (see Section 2.2).13

23.      Closing date extensions. The closing date was extended twice for a total of twelve
months, from December 31, 2010 to September 30, 2011 and from September 30, 2011 to
December 31, 2011, to: (i) complete final deliverables and payments; (ii) fully utilize savings;
(iii) allow disposal of physical assets and project files; and (iv) help with the ICR preparation.14


13
  There was no requirement to process these revisions as formal restructuring at that time.
14
  Both were Level II restructuring through acting Regional Director’s letter of December 20, 2010 and Regional
Director’s letter of September 28, 2011.

                                                        5
The standard four-month Grace Period did not apply to this operation as the Recipient did not
have funds to finance essential RPMU staff to complete transactions. The project closed on
December 31, 2011.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     Project preparation: The project was prepared in 13.5 months: Concept Review was in
January 2004 and Board approval on March 15, 2005. Project preparation was supported by a
Japanese Trust Fund15 for (i) the design and preparation of Components 1 and 2; and (ii) the
establishment of the RPMU. The original date of grant effectiveness set as August 10, 2005 was
extended at the request of the CACO by 90 days to complete fulfillment of the effectiveness
conditions.

Positive factors that influenced project performance:

25.      Sound epidemiological basis and lessons learnt: An extensive epidemiological and
institutional analysis of the four overlapping epidemics in Central Asia—HIV/AIDS, IDU, STIs,
and tuberculosis—and the pivotal role of IDUs and SWs in driving HIV epidemic was carried
out between 2001-2004 and published in the two well-received main papers: ―HIV/AIDS and
Tuberculosis in Central Asia: Country Profiles‖ and ―Reversing the Tide: Priorities for
HIV/AIDS Prevention in Central Asia‖. The Bank team also tried to reflect important lessons
learnt from analytical work and other projects in the design of this regional project. These
included inter alia (i) advocacy at the highest levels of government and need for an inter-sectoral
approach; (ii) use of early, aggressive prevention interventions targeting vulnerable and highly
vulnerable groups; (iii) stakeholder participation and predominant role of local NGOs; (iv) need
for significant investment in policy and management capacity; (v) effective surveillance and
M&E system; and (vi) outsourcing fiduciary functions for increased efficiency and effectiveness.
While most of these were implemented successfully, efforts to operationalize some others
presented challenges, e.g. targeting highly vulnerable groups and M&E arrangements, in
particular.

26.     Stakeholder involvement and participatory processes: The Bank project team
consulted widely with partners including DFID (co-financier), UNAIDS, USAID, CDC,
GFATM, WHO, and UNODC, among others. The Bank actively facilitated a participatory
process, including organization of a study tour to the Caribbean to learn from the experience of
the Pan-Caribbean Partnership against AIDS. Regional and national-level policy and technical
workshops with government counterparts, donors’ meetings, and NGO roundtables reviewed the
project design and implementation arrangements. A number of workshops and analyses took

  PHRD Grant (TF53750) was signed on September 8, 2004, with an original closing date of March 15, 2005,
which was extended once until June 15, 2005. The delay was due to the establishment of the RPMU and selection of
individual consultants and firms. Of the total amount of US$889,300, US$751,988 (85%) was disbursed. Following
the closure of the PHRD grant, DFID supported the staff costs and RPMU operations for an amount of US$32,700
equivalent.

                                                       6
place within the relatively short and intensive period of time from November 2003 to December
2004.

27.    Regional approach: A strength of the project (but also a challenging feature) was its use
of a novel regional approach, using the IDA13 Pilot Program for Regional Projects. The regional
approach involved high risks of failure, low government ownership from each country and
complex management arrangements (see paragraphs 32-34, 43, 45).

28.      An Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grant,16 implemented by the Republican
AIDS Center of Kazakhstan in consultation with the Republican AIDS Centers in the Kyrgyz
Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, resulted in the following outputs: (i) design and
implementation of a training of trainers program, (ii) handbooks published in local languages for
grant-implementing organizations on planning, implementing, and managing HIV/AIDS-related
activities as well as for government agencies on establishing partnerships and procuring
HIV/AIDS-related services from local NGOs and international organizations; and (iii) strategy
on institutionalization of the training program and evaluation of the program’s impact and
effectiveness. Due to delays by the Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan in signing the grant Letter-
Agreement for nearly 9 months after the Grant approval in January 2005, Grant implementation
was transferred to the Kazakh National Association of Organizations for AIDS-related Service
and implemented in coordination with CAAP capacity building activities.

29.    Adequate attention to project supervision and partnering arrangements: The World
Bank Regional Operations Committee endorsed a detailed Supervision Plan, including
appropriate budget allocations. The Plan took into account the number of countries, sectors, and
organizations involved as well as the complexity of the project design and technical assistance
needs. Additional funds were allocated by DFID to support project supervision.

Less effective factors that influenced project performance:

30.      Project design. The overall objective of the project was consistent with the identified
sector issues and the Bank’s regional assistance strategy for Central Asia, i.e. the need to
urgently address the growing epidemic of HIV in the region. Unfortunately, the project design
was complex and had several weaknesses that constrained its implementation for several years.
The most important ones were (i) the unrealistic PDO of ―reducing the growth rate of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in Central Asia in the period 2005-10‖ and flaws in the underlying RF
(paragraphs 10, 51-52); (ii) the under-specification of technical activities known to be effective
in slowing the spread of HIV, aggravated by unforeseen technical assistance on effective
strategies to support NGO service delivery to high-risk groups; and (iii) complex governance and
institutional arrangements giving rise to considerable risks described below.

31.      The project lacked a strong justification of regional versus alternative approaches
(this issue was also raised by the QER review). The PAD suggested regional character of major
epidemic drivers, economies of scale, common constraints/solutions and sharing of best practices


16
 Signed on October 21, 2005, the IDF Grant (TF054787) was closed on October 21, 2008. Of the total amount of
US$289,000, US$257,342 (89%) was disbursed.

                                                      7
as main justifications for a regional project but those were not fully reflected in the project
design. For example, delineation between national and regional level activities was not entirely
clear. At appraisal, the benefit of a systematic evaluation of several new regional HIV projects
financed by the Bank was not yet available (indeed, the ICR team recommends this as a follow-
up activity, see paragraph 101).

32.     Risk assessment. Project risks were underestimated, in particular, those related to the
political economy of the region as well as the governance and implementation arrangements with
CACO. The Bank had identified the risk of low government commitment to implement the
project. However, rating of this risk as low to moderate appears to have been optimistic in view
of the lack of familiarity of the countries with a regional approach, mistrust among the countries,
a tendency to deny HIV or sexual transmission, and the weak public health agencies in the
countries. Assessment of commitment and ownership should have been based on the level of
commitment to institutional and policy reform and other indicators stronger than the signature of
a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding and attendance at regional fora.

33.     The choice of a new regional organization (CACO), with virtual governance structure
and lack of prior experience with such operations, as a suitable legal framework for
implementation of the project was an important risk. The PAD did not mention this governance
risk explicitly, except in the context of financial management and fiduciary issues as well as in
terms of the low to moderate risk of ―limited experience to fully develop the proposed regional
project‖.

34.     The risk of implementing a novel regional HIV/AIDS operation in Central Asia was
taken by the Bank consciously given the expected benefits and as a best possible alternative to
having four separate legal agreements with the countries. However, most of the stakeholders
interviewed for this ICR suggested that the project governance, management and implementation
arrangements could have been more thoroughly elaborated prior to implementation. For example,
the Project Operational Manual of June 2005 (a condition of effectiveness) contained only basic
information on project steering, management and implementation arrangements. In particular,
this was true with regard to RPSC procedures and its interactions with the Recipient.

35.     Weak anticipation of technical assistance for project implementation. The mentioned
sector work identified that NGO capacity was limited in the region. However, the project
preparation did not adequately seek to envisage and commission a technical counterpart to
ensure that NGOs could work with high-risk groups not only on information campaigns but
behavior change (safe injection practices for IDUs and condom use in commercial sex, both with
peer-education).17 Moreover, it was known during implementation that GFATM funding would
attract more NGOs to HIV/AIDS. It was clear that UNAIDS (which mostly plays an advocacy
and coordination role) could not provide this specific technical assistance. The CDC provided
useful technical assistance for antenatal clinic surveillance, but did not fully cover the gap for
delivery of targeted interventions for high-risk groups. UNODC’s reviews of project activities


17
  For example, the Soros Foundation was commissioned under the Moldova AIDS Control Project to build
technical capacity of small NGOs, which was reported as an effective arrangement (Implementation Completion and
Results Report, Moldova AIDS Control Project (Report No: ICR0000937), April 2009.

                                                      8
and sub-grants aimed at harm reduction among high-risk groups, and the late establishment of
RTCs could not compensate for this kind of practical technical guidance and training. The large
grants program might have been designed for technical assistance to smaller NGOs funded via
the small grants program, but this design was not chosen. Regional models, such as those from
the DFID-funded CARHAP, existed, as well as those in other countries.

36.      Sub-optimal readiness for implementation of a complex regional project. This
regional project was prepared faster than the average preparation time for the region at that time
(the period of 13.5 months from the Concept Review stage to the Board approval vs. an average
of 22 months for country-level projects in the region). 18 The task team invested significant
efforts to ensure quality at entry (see paragraph 37). However, there were a few important issues,
which probably required more time to address properly. These were related to insufficient
elaboration of (i) technical design details (see paragraph 35), (ii) legal framework requirements
to establishing the RPMU in either of the countries (paragraph 44), and (iii) arrangements for
contracting fiduciary support for the project (paragraphs 58-59).

37.     Overall Quality at Entry: Internal Bank reviews (Quality Enhancement Reviews on
May 20 and 27, 2004 and Regional Operations Committee Review on November 18, 2004)
raised concerns similar to those above. Based on the factors presented in this section, the ICR
team rates overall project quality and readiness at entry as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

38.    The project succeeded in delivering most of the outputs under the three components and
mostly achieving or partially achieving its expected outcomes after the formal restructuring of
January 2010 (see details in Annex 2, Section 3.2, and Data sheet). There were positive and
more challenging factors that played a role in implementation:

Positive factors that influenced project performance:

39.     Partnerships, coordination, and communication: Partnership arrangements (Annex 10)
helped coordinate technical activities (e.g., on sentinel surveillance with US CDC, on
strengthening civil society participation with USAID-funded CAPACITY project, etc.),
effectively built institutional and human resource capacity (paragraphs 80-81), facilitated
regional dialogue and cooperation (paragraph 82), and minimized duplication in resource use.
The annual Forum of Partners served as an effective venue for coordinating joint efforts, such as
agreeing on a unified grant application form and evaluation procedures among the grant-
providing projects (CAAP, CARHAP, GFATM, and CAPACITY).

40.   Intensive supervision by the Bank and partners included regular joint missions with
DFID, UNAIDS, CDC and other agencies, participation of the Bank Health Sector Manager and
Country Sector Coordinator in the Mid-Term Review (MTR) and subsequent missions and


18
  Based on ICR authors’ analysis, the average length of preparation of IBRD and IDA investment operations in
Central Asia in the period 2001-2007 was 22 months (Kazakhstan-31.6; Kyrgyz Republic-12.8; Tajikistan-12.7; and
Uzbekistan-31.4).

                                                       9
video-conferences, and candid and reasonably bold mid-term assessment of the implementation
progress and bottlenecks. Due attention was paid to providing specialized technical assistance to
improve project implementation. Especially important was the assistance with streamlining /
simplification of the RAF guidelines and manuals in May 2007. It facilitated implementation of
the large grants program, which was stalled because of the complexity of the RAF guidelines. In
addition, in 2008, DFID seconded to the RPMU a deputy director whose main responsibilities
were to provide organizational and managerial support to CAAP and help build sustainable
management capability of the RPMU team.

41.   Sustaining involvement of Uzbekistan in the project. Despite the suspension in
Uzbekistan’s membership in EurAsEC in November 2008, the leaderships of EurAsEC and
Uzbekistan took the wise decision to sustain involvement of Uzbekistan as project beneficiary.

42.      Strong focus, particularly around the MTR, on project efficiency and grant
disbursement: Decisions and agreements to this effect included (i) increase in the ceiling for
small grants from US$20,000 to US$50,000; (ii) allowing conditional approvals of grant
proposals to encourage improvement of reasonably good ones; (iii) streamlining the grant
process and manuals, actively sourcing proposals to target service delivery to high-risk groups
and extending the implementation of successful sub-grants for increased service coverage; (iv)
budget reallocations within Component 1 to better progressing key activities (such as
surveillance) and use of accumulated savings and cancellations under Component 2 to support
critically important regional activities, such as RTCs (see footnotes in Annex 1).

Less effective factors that influenced project performance:

43.     Political ownership: Together with the RPMU, the Bank team displayed considerable
efforts to build political ownership at the Deputy Prime-Minister level via the RPSC. This led to
high-level visibility of the project. At the same time, the project faced considerable challenges in
securing political commitment from the countries due to their lack of familiarity with a regional
approach and various tensions among the countries. This was partly compensated by good
relations at the technical level.

44.     Delay in operationalizing the RPMU occurred in part because of the mismatch between
the agreed status of the RPMU and the legal framework in Kazakhstan. Resolution of the related
legal and administrative barriers required extraordinary efforts from all the concerned parties and
necessitated several RPSC dedicated sessions, multiple individual meetings and letter exchanges.
Specifically, it took 17 months from the Decision of the CACO Council of the Heads of States
on the establishment of RPMU to its becoming operational (see Table 1). The ISRs of that period
repeatedly mentioned substantial impact of the delays on the overall efficiency of project
operation, procurement and financial planning and management activities.

45.     Unclear roles and responsibilities of the new structures with complex arrangements,
e.g., regional approvals for large grants, but country approvals for small grants. Furthermore,
after the merger of CACO into EurAsEC, involvement of additional member-countries in the
project decision-making contributed to delays. Thus, the signature of a Grant Assumption
Agreement (GAA) took six months after the communication from the World Bank to EurAsEC,

                                                10
and the GAA was declared effective following another nine months (see Table 1). Also, as
mentioned in the QALP report of September 2008, no re-assessment of institutional and
governance arrangements took place following the merger of CACO into EurAsEC. This led to
confusion about the exact role of EurAsEC in project implementation and created unnecessary

46.    Limited initial capacity of RPMU, specifically inadequate staff capacity in management,
procurement and M&E aspects, and in the RAF component. Efforts of the first RPMU Executive
Director were mostly focused on forging consensus on various policy issues among the RPSC
members. Less attention was paid to core project management and implementation mandate.19
However, with specialized technical assistance, accumulated experience and changes after the
MTR, the RPMU capacity had gradually improved, also with the hiring of a full-time Office
Manager/Coordinator in October 2009.

47.    Frequent senior personnel changes within the Recipient representation (Table 2). Even
though the project had little control over this factor, the frequent changes at both the Deputy
Prime-Minister and Minister of Health level of the RPSC affected implementation.

Note: RPSC = Deputy Prime-Minister (or Minister of Health for Kazakhstan); MoH = Minister of Health

48.       Insufficient focus on high-risk groups. The implementation phase did not sufficiently
identify and remedy the design problems, including the under-specification of activities known
to be effective in slowing the spread of HIV, leading to a poor targeting of high-risk groups by
the project. Implementers had very different understanding of who were at risk.20 As a result,
many of the grant activities did not target the most at-risk groups, and did not consist of cost-
effective interventions, especially before the MTR. Annex 3 presents an analysis of the small
grant projects and finds that only a minority of the spending of the total number of sub-projects
was focused on a relatively broad set of risk groups (IDUs, SWs, prisoners, MSM, PLWHA, and
migrants). 21 After the MTR, focus of the small grants scheme on the most-at-risk groups
increased. Indeed, Annex 3 finds a modest improvement in spending on high-risk groups after
the MTR.

49.     Delay in project restructuring. Flaws in the appropriateness of the original PDOs and
the underlying RF became evident in the second year of the project. 22 Subsequently, attempts to
re-formulate the PDO and RF were undertaken (Annex 11). The revisions made in 2007 and
2008 were approved by the RPSC (June 8, 2007 and July 11, 2008), and EurAsEC endorsed the
2007 revisions in the letter dated August 28, 2007. Another round of revisions in 2008 required a
renewed formal approval and request for project restructuring from the Recipient, as the RPSC
decision of July 2008 was insufficient to process an amendment to the DGA. The MTR mission
of October 2008 emphasized the need for a substantial restructuring given the apparent lack of
progress, wide range of pending issues, and only 27-percent disbursement at mid term23. It also
noted that failure to restructure the project may result in partial or full cancellation of the grant.
Despite agreements to restructure the project 24 , internal reconciliation of the request for
restructuring within EurAsEC took almost 8 months. The Bank received the formal request on
September 30, 2009 when 55.5 percent of all the funds had been disbursed. Due process for
restructuring was followed, and the restructuring was approved when a total of 67 percent of the
IDA and DFID grant funds had been disbursed.

50.     The above challenges in implementation were reflected in the QALP report of September
2008 and the later restructuring of the project. The QALP rated the likelihood of achieving the
original PDOs as Moderately Unlikely. It also indicated that some of the ISR ratings were

   Even though youth and migrants constitute two risk groups and were targeted by the project, scientific evidence
suggests that they contribute fewer new infections relative to other risk groups, such as IDUs and SWs. (ref.

unduly positive, but recognized the appropriate and intensive efforts on improving project and
financial management performance.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

51.     M&E Design is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory: The PAD and DGA Supplemental
Letter included five outcome indicators and eight intermediate results indicators. In addition to
the PDO realism and measurement difficulties (see Section 1.3), some outcome indicators were
unrealistic and not easily measurable in the specified format, e.g., ―At least 60% of groups at risk
covered by the RAF activities‖. Even with a known denominator for this indicator, the ambitious
target may not have been realistic. It would have been more appropriate, for example, to specify
this indicator as ―At least 60% of the RAF activities/funds are focused on groups at risk‖.

52.     The lack of observable progress during implementation was conditioned by the following
factors in the project design: (i) missing baseline data for most of the original indicators at
project start up; (ii) the weakness in aligning the project inputs with reductions in HIV
transmission; (iii) the lack of reasonably well-functioning M&E systems and capacity at the
country and regional levels; and (iv) unwillingness of the countries to share accurate data on
HIV/AIDS and associated IDU and SW.

53.     M&E Implementation is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory: Without a formal revision
of the PDO, the extensive efforts to revise the RF and strengthen M&E system were not fully
successful. In particular, there has been large emphasis on process and efficiency indicators and
much less on how project outputs aligned with the outcome of reduced HIV transmission. There
were, for example, no clear indicators that would attempt to provide a ―denominator‖ for
coverage with needle exchange programs and condom programs for high-risk groups. Also, the
choice of some indicators was questionable, e.g., attribution of the number of needles, syringes
and condoms distributed, despite these goods being directly financed by the Global Fund. The
QALP report of September 2008 and the MTR of October 2008 identified the need for more
consistent and relevant indicators.

54.     The work on electronic surveillance system that started in 2007 had delays in consulting
services for software development and testing. The progress on operationalizing the web-based
Grant Management System, the electronic client database, and Central Asia Regional
Information System was also limited until the restructuring. Those systems lacked the capability
to provide complete and relevant information for M&E and decision-making purposes.
Interruptions in staffing of M&E function at the RPMU level also contributed to the general
shortcomings in this area.

55.    M&E Utilization is rated Moderately Satisfactory: The adage that ―what gets measured,
gets done‖ applies here. The weakness of the M&E indicators and their frequent informal
changes in the RF, in turn, contributed to a lack of clarity among NGOs in the small grants
program, and among policy makers as to the most effective ways to reduce HIV transmission.
Moreover, there was insufficient use of sentinel surveillance data to inform subsequent project



                                                13
strategic priorities, regional HIV/AIDS strategy and policy changes, and the small grants
program focus.

56.      On the positive side, funding in support of 18 pilot sites for sentinel surveillance
activities in the four countries helped establish strong ongoing national surveillance systems,
which have the potential to lead to sustained policy changes. Given the lack of surveillance
systems in most of the participating countries, this achievement should not be underestimated.
The sentinel surveillance sites are likely to inform future measurement of HIV in the region, and
will improve the validity and quality of future projections done by UNAIDS. Thus, they
represent an important and sustainable system-wide investment as part of long-term M&E.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

57.     Safeguards implementation is rated Satisfactory. The environmental impact of the
project was rated C, therefore, no environmental assessment was required. The project only
involved minor renovations of the RPMU and CAAP national office premises.

58.     Financial Management (FM) is rated Moderately Satisfactory. In spite of a clear FM
Action Plan at appraisal stage, the project experienced delays in establishing its own automated
FM system until June 200625. This was mostly due to the delay in operationalizing the RPMU
and resulted in a downgrade of FM rating to Unsatisfactory in April 2006. Given the high FM
risk of the project, FM supervision was conducted every six months. After initial delays, the
quarterly FMRs were submitted regularly and timely and found satisfactory by the Bank. On the
other hand, the outsourcing of fiduciary services posed challenges in implementation including:
(i) delays in contracting country-level fiduciary support services due to lengthy negotiations with
UNDP; (ii) problems with timeliness and accuracy of financial reporting by UNDP country
offices and resulting delays in small grant disbursements; (iii) UNDP financial safeguards
causing limitations on actual availability of funds; and (iv) higher than expected operating costs,
including 7 percent in fees paid to UNDP, that required reallocations of funds on two occasions.

59.     Accounting and internal control systems were improved over time, though some
weaknesses in financial budgeting and reporting remained. By 2010, all the issues raised in the
initial management letters were gradually and satisfactorily addressed by the RPMU, and this
was reflected in the upgrade of the rating to Satisfactory in June 2010 up to the project closing.
In 2010, staffing and implementation arrangements between UNDP country offices were further
enhanced, and the contract with UNDP Uzbekistan office was extended to complete
implementation of the fourth round of small grants in Uzbekistan. Owing to these efforts by
RPMU and UNDP and intensive supervision by the Bank, the flow of funds and disbursements
substantially improved over time. In general, withdrawal applications were prepared regularly
with supporting documentation complete. DFID grant was fully disbursed by August 31, 2010,
and IDA grant was almost entirely disbursed by the revised closing date.


25
  The establishment of a FM system satisfactory to the Bank was a Board presentation condition. This was formally
met by contracting the Kyrgyz Health Reform PMU to provide FM support to the project until the RPMU had
established its own FM system. Following its relocation to Almaty in March 2006, RPMU essentially operated
without a functioning FM system until June 2006.

                                                       14
60.      Project audits were conducted annually, with the audit reports submitted to the Bank by
the due dates starting with the audit report for 2008. Subsequent audit reports and management
letters did not raise any major issues.

61.     Procurement is rated Satisfactory. With the exception of a few delayed packages, the
majority of contracts were awarded according to the agreed procurement schedule and provisions.
The recruitment of a specialist experienced in international procurement in early April 2007
significantly improved the procurement capacity and performance of the RPMU. The format of
the Procurement Plan allowed for easy location of all the required information. Procurement
Plans were updated as required.

62.     While UNDP handled procurement on behalf of small grants recipients at the country
level, the large grant recipients handled their procurement themselves. The RPMU’s review of
procurement arrangements for grant proposals before submission to the Bank followed the
provisions of the Grant Recipient Handbook.

63.     By project completion, five procurement ex-post reviews were conducted for the project.
The provided recommendations were usually properly implemented before the next ex-post
review mission. Both the procurement review mission of late 2008 for country-level activities in
Kyrgyzstan and an Independent Procurement Review in March-April 2010 identified no major
issues and rated the procurement performance satisfactory. Only some procurement-related
deficiencies were noted, such as the lack of regular physical inspections to grant recipients’ sites,
which occurred due to the shortage of staff at RPMU and UNDP national offices.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

64.     Funding for HIV/AIDS has continued to grow in the region, mostly from the GFATM.
External assistance for HIV/AIDS has risen for all the four countries. All the countries are
following the regional standards on surveillance. Funding from PEPFAR for AIDS treatment
will include an element of strengthening these M&E systems. Some RTCs receive government
support (e.g., Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan), others are funded with donor resources (GFATM for
Tajikistan); however, their sustained functioning at the regional level in the near future is
questionable. A regional HIV/AIDS strategy document, developed under the auspices of
EurAsEC, has been adopted but is weak on strategies for IDU and SW populations. The Bank
has continued to play a positive role in encouraging various partners to work together at the
country level.

65.     The enhanced managerial capacity of the RPMU allowed it to manage on behalf of
EurAsEC an additional Bank-administered US$3 million equivalent grant for the Central Asia
Regional One Health Project. Implemented between March-September 2011, it focused on
analytical activities and action planning for control of zoonotic and food-borne diseases and
aimed at advancing the intra-regional cooperation arrangements established under the CAAP.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Modest

66.     At the time of the ICR, the relevance of the project’s original (though partially
ambitious) and revised objectives to the current epidemiological challenges are rated Substantial
for several reasons: (i) HIV transmission in the region continues to be driven by IDU and SW.
Indeed, a greater proportion of new infections are now arising from SW (see Annex 3); (ii)
UNAIDS projections suggest that the growth of HIV has not yet stabilized in any of the
countries26 (however, the sentinel surveillance data suggest some plateau patterns from 2008-
2010 for some of the countries); (iii) there is an ongoing need for modern public health structures
in these countries; and (iv) regional HIV control has been a key aspect of poverty reduction and
the Bank’s overall assistance strategy in the region.27

67.     The relevance of the design focusing the bulk of the IDA and DFID grants on a regional
grants program at the time of considerable expansion in country-specific GFATM support is
rated Modest, especially in view of the insufficient focus on high-risk groups, which was out of
alignment with the (ambitious) PDO. Similarly, the design of the RAF envisaged reviews of
large grant proposals by the Regional Technical Evaluation Committee, and of small grant
proposals by National Technical Evaluation Committees, with little strategic synergy between
the two processes. However, in some key areas, such as harmonization of strategies,
standardized sentinel and electronic surveillance, and training, regional approaches remain
highly relevant. Similarly, a design that would build technical capacity of NGOs to provide
specific services, such as needle exchange and condom provision, both with peer education and
social support to high-risk groups, remains relevant in the region. The ongoing technical
assistance by CDC for sentinel surveillance in some of the countries is an example of focused
regional assistance. While the project successfully influenced religious leaders across the region
to consider HIV/AIDS issues, it was difficult to align their support toward greater tolerance of
public health efforts to deliver services to IDUs and SWs.

68.     The relevance of the implementation arrangements is rated Modest. Governance and
implementation arrangements with CACO, as designed, had some inherent risks described in
Section 2.1 above. Moreover, no re-assessment of institutional and governance arrangements
took place following the merger of CACO into EurAsEC prior to effectiveness. EurAsEC, the
new Grant Recipient, has a mandate for regional integration in economic matters and has
political legitimacy. However, it does not have any special expertise in the management of health
projects and even less in the sub-specialized areas of HIV interventions. Given the EurAsEC
Healthcare Council’s policy development and coordination role, it would have been expedient to
consider creating a sustainable specialized regional health structure, perhaps initially within

EurAsEC, or to institutionalize regional TWGs that proved effective, so as to play this role.
Such structure could transform over time into a regional equivalent of Centers for Disease
Prevention and Control and seems feasible given the historical existence of standardized health
agencies under the Soviet era.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Modest for the original PDOs, Substantial for the revised PDOs

69.     Evaluation of outcomes against the original PDOs is not easily possible given the change
in the PDOs, plus the changes in the RF. The project had some partial achievements against the
benchmarks of regional mechanisms prior to the formal PDO revision (Table 3). At the same
time, some of the investments made during the early phase of the project yielded benefits during
the latter two years, especially related to NGO training, regional cooperation and parliamentary
exchanges, and in surveillance. Moreover, despite the delay in revising the PDOs formally as
explained in paragraph 49, there was a dialogue to restructure the project and to identify and
correct certain deficiencies well before formal PDO revision.

attributable to Project

70.     Achievement of the revised PDO is rated Substantial (Table 4) based on the fact that
some regional policy development and coordination efforts occurred, a workable sentinel
surveillance system was established, institutional capacity in the region strengthened, and
because the small grants program adopted a slightly sharper focus on high-risk groups over the
last two years.

Progress not attributable to Project

71.    Revised PDO for Component 1: Regional Coordination, Policy Development and
Capacity Building is rated Satisfactory. This component’s relevance remains Substantial, its
achievement and efficiency are also rated Substantial. By the end of the Project, two of the five
intermediate results indicators for this component were achieved, one was exceeded, and two
other were achieved partially. The indicator for regional support of policies in four areas was

                                               17
achieved fully in two areas (epidemiological surveillance and stigma reduction) whereas it was
not achieved in injection safety and harm reduction as well as SW-based transmission aspects.

72.     Revised PDO for Component 2: Central Asia Regional AIDS Fund is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. The relevance of the RAF is rated Modest (see paragraph 67), but its
achievement and efficiency are rated Substantial. By the end of the Project, two of the three
intermediate outcome indicators (exclusively process indicators) were achieved and one was
achieved partially. The contribution of the RAF, including the large grants, toward stabilization
or reversal of HIV growth was marginal, at best. Commendably, better targeting of high-risk
groups was implemented after the MTR by reducing the number of priority funding areas from
19 to 3.28 At the same time, the streamlined RAF Grant Recipient Manual, extensive training and
practical implementation experience did contribute to increasing capacity of NGOs to obtain and
implement grants (also from other donors), as evidenced by local NGO consortia receiving large
grants in Rounds 2 and 3.

73.    Revised PDO for Component 3: Project Management is rated Satisfactory. The
relevance, achievement, and efficiency are all rated Substantial. With capacity gained over the
course of the project, the RPSC and RPMU performed increasingly well on their project steering
and management mandate. The significant over-spending under this component versus the
appraisal estimate was mainly due to underestimated cost of outsourced fiduciary services at
appraisal (see Annex 1). All four indicators for this component were achieved, and
EurAsEC/RPMU and the Bank made substantial efforts to address remaining deficiencies in
M&E, project and financial management.

3.3 Project Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

74.     The original economic analysis conducted at the appraisal estimated returns on
investment based on reductions in new HIV cases. Given that the project objectives were revised
to no longer measure this outcome, it is possible to update these economic analyses only crudely
(Annex 3). This finds that even modest increases in coverage of IDUs and SWs (about 40,000
and 15,000 respectively) would reduce new HIV infection by about 6,000 cases. This number of
avoided infections, when valued as about 20 years of health life per averted infection, with each
health year of life worth about 3 times regional GDP, together yield a positive rate of return.
Also some of the regional efforts, particularly on sentinel surveillance, harmonization of
strategies and introduction of a (albeit weak) regional HIV/AIDS strategy document, and the fact
that the project has assisted with building capacity of NGOs in the region to expand HIV
prevention services together imply that some efficiencies were achieved. Moreover, the recurrent
costs of the efforts to governments are minimal. Costs, in purchasing power terms, for the
various activities were within norms established for other NGO-based projects.29

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

75.    Based on the detailed analysis above, the ICR rates relevance as Modest, achievement as
Modest, and efficiency as Substantial, yielding an overall outcome rating of Moderately
Unsatisfactory. Further supporting analysis was based on the following quantitative assessment:

76.     As per the standard ICR guidelines for rating the outcome of projects with formally
revised objectives, the ICR team assigned outcome ratings for the original and revised PDOs
based on the achievement status of all the respective indicators. The two ratings were further
weighed by the amounts disbursed prior to restructuring and post-restructuring (67 vs. 33
percent, respectively). Such weighing has a strong impact on the overall outcome rating. The
application of the standard ICR guidelines for weighing achievements by disbursement is
problematic in this case, as the original PDO rating does not capture and reward the extensive
efforts to correct the original PDOs, which were initiated much before the actual date of the
restructuring. For reasons noted in paragraph 49, the formal restructuring was not possible in
2008, which resulted in a larger share of disbursements against the chosen unrealistic original
PDO, thus giving much heavier weight to the respective Moderately Unsatisfactory rating. The
ICR team admits that the ratings are open to interpretation. Simply one change from Modest to
Substantial in any one of the three components of the overall outcome rating would result in an
overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

77.    The clear positive features are sentinel surveillance, mechanisms that were able to initiate
regional dialogue and collaboration on HIV issues in such a multi-dimensional region as Central
Asia, important enhancements in HIV legal framework of the countries ensuing from that
dialogue, standardized training with some of the developed courses institutionalized, transparent
and efficient grant distribution mechanism, and development of NGOs in the region, including
enhanced grant application and management capacity of NGOs. The less effective features deal

   Includes US$16.73 M equivalent of IDA grant and US$0.94 M equivalent of DFID grant proceeds disbursed prior
to the restructuring.

   Includes US$24.86 M equivalent of IDA grant and US$1.55 M equivalent of DFID grant proceeds.

   Includes US$8.13 M equivalent of IDA grant and US$0.61 M equivalent of DFID grant proceeds disbursed after
the restructuring.

                                                     19
with the insufficient focus of the RAF on behavior change among IDUs and SWs that reduces
transmission of HIV, and lack of attention to building technical capacity of NGOs in the region
on HIV prevention and treatment. This is in the context that the HIV prevalence continues to
increase in most of the region (with some suggestion of possible attenuation in at least
Kazakhstan).

78.     Although achievement of PDOs measured through the PDO indicators cannot only be
attributed to the project as other elements are at play, including support from the Global Fund,
CDC, etc., much has been accomplished, and the project has made an important contribution to
the achievements described above.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

79.     Although the project did not have a specific poverty focus, the literature on HIV/AIDS
has established that programs that decrease transmission help reduce the numbers of poor
households who have to resort to more expensive HIV treatments. Similarly, while the project
did not have an explicit gender aspect, empowering of SWs and female IDUs via targeted
interventions does enable better economic opportunities for these women. Finally, the project’s
contribution toward social development was chiefly through the above mechanisms, as well as
helping form the basis for a more inclusive regional HIV/AIDS strategy. Marginalized groups
such as IDUs, SWs and MSMs still face considerable difficulty in the region, but the efforts at
regional dialogue appear to have created a more enabling environment for services to be
delivered to such marginalized populations.

(b)    Institutional development impact

80.     The Project financed significant investments in training and was successful in improving
overall surveillance systems in HIV/AIDS programs, thus contributing to institutional capacity
building. In addition, collaboration with international partners, including the technical agencies
– WHO, UNAIDS, and CDC, as well as the Global Fund helped promote a coordinated effort for
the implementation of HIV/AIDS activities.

81.     By its nature, a regional project will have difficulty identifying and strengthening specific
country-based institutions that remain after the project. Notwithstanding this, some of the efforts,
specifically establishment and support of 4 RTCs, 18 sentinel and 25 electronic surveillance sites,
developed and institutionalized training courses, training of several hundreds of regional trainers
and national specialists, and strengthening of regional NGOs’ capacity to apply for and manage
grants through 229 sub-projects, have all been positive developments. The management capacity
of the RPMU was built to the level that it was able to successfully manage on behalf of EurAsEC
an additional Bank-administered US$3 million equivalent grant for the Regional One Health
Project. The Republican AIDS Centers in each of the countries have also been strengthened in
surveillance, and training aspects.




                                                20
82.      The initiated key regional mechanisms of dialogue will likely be sustained, in part
because of EurAsEC’s presence and interest in regional cooperation. 33 A regional HIV strategy
has been developed but is notably weak on IDU and SW. The regional standards for surveillance
are likely to be sustainable and useful, in part because of demand from forthcoming PEPFAR
funding (and, hence, ongoing technical support from CDC). It is unclear whether the regional
investments will actually shape priorities setting and alignment of country-specific inputs with
reductions in HIV transmission from IDU and SW (e.g., Inter-Parliamentarian Working Group
effort may not specifically support delivering condoms and safe needles to high-risk groups).

83.     Close coordination and synergies with partners have resulted in some efficiency at the
country level, for example, through strengthening the Republican AIDS Centers in at least three
of the countries, and enabling them to benefit from GFATM funding as well as PEPFAR funding
for AIDS treatment.

(c)     Other unintended outcomes and impacts

84.   Azerbaijan revised its HIV legal framework in 2010 as a result of participating in the
CAAP-supported Inter-Parliamentarian Working Group on HIV.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

85.      The risk at the time of the ICR to development outcomes is considered significant for the
following reasons:
 Increasing importance of HIV transmission from SW (away from IDUs) with only limited
    efforts to reduce marginalization, police harassment, and other enabling efforts that might
    change behavior in these groups. Moreover, reliable measurement of the number, mapping
    and scope, practice patterns of SW continues to be a gap and is not covered under the sentinel
    surveillance. There is little technical assistance planned in the region to meet these gaps.
 Increased global funding, including GFATM and PEPFAR, but concern about government
    sustainability (as well as differences in the economic growth prospects of resource-richer
    versus poorer countries in the region).
 Increased political tensions between the countries may decrease cooperation on HIV. While
    better ownership over HIV is now evident across all the countries (largely, due to the CAAP),
    more specific concerns linger about the commitment to focus on high-risk groups and build
    sustained public health institutions that can create scientific and programmatic opportunities
    for HIV prevention and treatment.
 Relatively nascent civil society sector (but one strengthened by the project) and even more
    nascent private sector leadership on HIV prevention and treatment.

5.         Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

86.      The project design built on the findings of earlier sector work and incorporated a number
of important lessons learnt. The preparation was also strong on donor coordination, sensitization
at the prime-ministerial level, and adequate attention to supervision and partnering arrangements.

87.       However, there were important gaps in ensuring readiness for implementation of a new
regional effort (e.g., RPMU establishment, outsourcing fiduciary support), and insufficient Bank
attention to high risks of the project at the outset, related to political economy,
governance/implementation arrangements with CACO, and fiduciary risks. Similarly, no re-
assessment of institutional and governance arrangements took place following the merger of
CACO into EurAsEC prior to effectiveness. Importantly, the chosen PDOs and indicators had
considerable flaws, and baseline data for most indicators were not in place with large gaps at the
outset. Finally, aside from the under-specification of technical activities flagged by the QER,
technical assistance on effective strategies to support NGO service delivery to high-risk groups
was not envisaged, even though this need was identified in the earlier sector work. All these
collectively led to delays in the start up of the project and challenging implementation during the
first three years.

(b)   Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.     M&E technical assistance was inadequate in fixing inconsistencies in the RF effectively
(most indicators chosen were process indicators), and the proposed changes to the RF varied
from mission to mission, with none of them being fully implemented until the restructuring.34

89.      Due to the novelty and complexity of the project, the Bank team closely monitored the
project implementation through regular joint missions with partners, participated in major
consensus-building and dissemination events organized by the project, and involved Bank
management at critical times during implementation. The Bank paid substantial attention to
project management, financial and disbursement issues, and to improving RAF functioning,
including regular fiduciary reviews and adequate mobilization of international technical
assistance in these areas. The 2008 MTR was notably focused, strong, blunt and correctly
identified serious management problems. Subsequent corrective efforts have benefited from a
TTL with public health training, and from the dialogue to ensure project implementation
remained on track. A dialogue was also initiated with the countries on a regional public health
platform, and the Bank helped EurAsEC implement the Regional One Health Project to further
strengthen regional collaboration and support the ―Health in All Policies‖ approach to public
health in Central Asia.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

90.     The overall rating was assigned on the basis of the overall design at entry, ensuing
delays in implementation, substantial efforts around the MTR, and strong supervision at the later
stages. The Bank recognized problems early in implementation and made attempts to improve
performance, even despite substantial delay in the formal restructuring.

5.2 Recipient Performance

(a)   CACO/EurAsEC Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

91.     There were substantial initial delays in legal registration, staffing, tax status, and
accreditation of the RPMU despite agreements by all the CACO-member countries to house
RPMU in Almaty. There was also a significant delay in restructuring the project and in
governance-related issues. Mobilization of technical assistance on effective strategies and
approaches to reach high-risk groups was insufficient.

92.     EurAsEC implemented MTR recommendations on financial and managerial matters
seriously. EurAsEC’s recognition of early implementation problems, follow-up work on project
management after the MTR and efforts to support better performance were all positive features.
Moreover, the leadership of EurAsEC made the decision to sustain involvement of Uzbekistan as
project beneficiary despite the suspension of its membership in EurAsEC.

(b)   RPMU and RPSC Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.     Early implementation, capacity, and management problems were resolved gradually and
satisfactorily over the course of the project. RPMU performed its mandate, which focused on
efficiency and flow of funds and not on technical assistance. The RPSC issued 33 decisions
during the project, mostly focused on policy dialogue and enabling frameworks. Some matters,
such as signing Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) between project and other partners, re-
allocating budget amounts of up to US$100,000, recruiting RPMU support staff, and composing
evaluation committees for procurement of consultants, were appropriately delegated to RPMU.
Within its mandate, RPSC appeared to make mostly sound decisions, but could not compensate
for the design and implementation drawbacks of the project.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

94.     The rating was assigned mostly based on insufficient ownership, delays in project
implementation and restructuring as well as in operationalizing the scientific evidence on
effective strategies to control the growth of HIV in the region, identified also in earlier sector
work.

6.     Lessons Learned

95.     A regional HIV/AIDS project needs to be guided by a regional HIV/AIDS strategy.
A regional HIV/AIDS strategy would provide the strategic framework for a regional HIV/AIDS
project to support. For this reason, ideally, a regional HIV/AIDS strategy should have been
formulated during project preparation or at least during the early phase of project effectiveness to
guide the project implementation. Unfortunately, the regional HIV/AIDS strategy was not
developed and adopted until October 2009, which was one year after MTR.

96.      A regional HIV/AIDS project needs to focus on activities for which the regional
approach has comparative advantages. By definition, the categories of activities for which the
regional approach has comparative advantages include (i) cross-border / trans-boundary issues,
(ii) regional public goods, and (iii) activities which can benefit from the economies of scale. For
the first category, HIV/AIDS is a cross-border issue when (i) there are significant population
movements among the countries; and (ii) the mobile populations are the drivers of the epidemic.
For the second and third categories, the project was more successful with activities for which the
regional approach was appropriate, such as those under Component 1 (more regional public
goods and economies of scale in nature). A lesson for future regional projects should be to
clearly delineate and have the right mix of regional activities, where justified and country-
specific activities where cost-benefit ratio is clear to countries and contributes to increasing
overall ownership.

97.      Realistic assessment of all risks, their adequate mitigation, and robust readiness for
implementation are critical. Risks potentially compromising implementation, including
political economy, institutional/implementation arrangements, and fiduciary risks should be
realistically assessed and properly mitigated at the outset. This is even more crucial for novel and
complex projects facing challenging environments with new institutions and various conflicting
interests.

98.     Realistic objectives and robust indicators are essential to achieve and measure
results. Although the project in many respects was exemplary in its inherent relevance to Bank
policies and country strategies, it proved once again the need for (i) objectives and performance
indicators to be carefully selected; (ii) an adequately designed M&E system to be in place at the
start of implementation; and (iii) appropriate arrangements to be in place to ensure that
information is used strategically for decision making.

99.     Close coordination with development partners at preparation is critical. Close
coordination and collaboration with the key partners at the design stage was useful in enabling
reasonably clear and complementary roles. However, this coordination was less successful at
levering effective changes in HIV/AIDS strategies (e.g., open emphasis on IDU and SW) across
the four countries during project implementation.

100. Appropriate and continuous staffing with skilled technical staff remains important
in high-risk projects. The risks associated with this project were underestimated at appraisal.
The right composition of a task team, including specialized public health and epidemiological
skills for HIV/AIDS projects and strong operational skills, is required to supervise complex

                                                24
projects in challenging environments. Such skills should be a key feature identified during
project preparation and presented in supervision plans.

101. Regional projects are high risks but also have their own rewards. What happened
under CAAP confirms the previous findings on regional projects; namely, they invariably
involve higher risks than country-based projects because of political economy constraints and
ensuing lower ownership 35 , less clear accountability from the counterpart, and usually more
reliance on process versus specific outcome indicators. However, the regional approach also
enables, through peer pressure, changes in laws and policies for each country, which happened to
some extent in this project. Therefore, ongoing efforts are required to bridge standards in public
health in the Central Asia region given the close inter-dependence of the countries, despite
considerable political and economic obstacles. In order to inform future regional operations, this
ICR recommends a Bank-wide review of lessons learned from regional HIV projects, including
CAAP.

7.         Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)        Recipient/implementing agencies

102. Authorities contacted by the ICR mission had mixed comments on the project. There was
near uniform agreement that the early implementation arrangements and delays were
unsatisfactory, and more attention should have been paid to better preparing the project for
implementation. There was praise for the efforts to correct the project in more recent years. The
benefiting country stakeholders also recognized that the project created some regional dialogue
on HIV/AIDS where little existed before, and left behind important components of training,
sentinel surveillance and NGO capacity for managing small grants. All expressed a concern that
aside from PEPFAR and GFATM funding at the country level, there would be no regional
funding/technical support after CAAP.

103. The health authorities of the four countries, UNAIDS (represented in RPSC), and
EurAsEC overall acknowledged the important role of the project in supporting national HIV
programs, developing regional HIV strategy, financing grants and strengthening regional policy
dialogue, capacity and collaboration for counteracting HIV epidemic.

104. In its comments on the draft ICR, the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan: (i)
questioned the sufficiency of time needed for a full-fledged assessment of such a comprehensive
regional project; (ii) regarding the poor targeting of high-risk groups, explained that because of
complementarities with other programs in the country, in particular the GFATM support to
prevention activities among vulnerable groups between 2005-2011 (average coverage of 85
percent for each target group achieved in 2010), the Country Coordination Committee decided to
direct CAAP support to improving HIV-related legal framework, strengthening M&E system,
creating enabling environment for activities of other programs, building local capacity in project
development and management, as well as in epidemiological surveillance and ART treatment;
and (iv) disagreed with the assessment of the project achievements, which should have been

                                                       25
assessed based on comprehensive study of the full set of activities and status of achievement for
each indicator.

105. Commenting on the draft ICR, EurAsEC disagreed with the statements on (a) sources
of project risks, pointing out, instead, to the lack of familiarity with a regional approach in health
care area; (b) weak anticipation of technical assistance for project implementation, referring to
the involvement of AIHA, UNODC, CDC, WHO; (c) poor targeting of high-risk groups,
explaining that the project had to focus at the outset on building capacity of AIDS-servicing
organizations whose number was very low, and on creating enabling environment for
implementation of harm reduction programs with subsequent increase in their funding; (d)
limited contribution of religious leaders to de-stigmatization of IDUs and SWs. It also
questioned (a) the assessment of the project impact and assessment methodology, (b) analysis of
the small grants program, and (c) appropriateness of rating the project based on the increase in
funding from the GFATM. EurAsEC requested that (a) the rating of the RAF Component be
upgraded to Substantial / Satisfactory, (b) the overall outcome rating of the project be revised.

106. In its comments on the draft ICR, UNAIDS expressed some disappointment with the
overall outcome rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory while acknowledging the ―inappropriate
target setting during the project development stage‖, which ―influenced negatively the
performance‖ and led to the project restructuring.

107. The ICR team concurred that the project made an important contribution to
harmonization of strategies and strengthening policy dialogue, collaboration, and institutional
capacity for counteracting HIV epidemic in the region, as recognized in the ICR. The team
further confirms that the statements and conclusions in the document were based on a
comprehensive desk-review of a large amount of documents and data, which were not limited
only to the project. Besides, the assessment presents a balanced synthesis of feedback from all
the stakeholders (including IDU, SW, and MSM groups) in all the four countries36. In order to
respond to the disagreements with the assessment and ensuing ratings, the ICR has been refined
with clarifications on the standard Bank methodology for rating the outcome of projects with
formally revised objectives, which further substantiate the initial ratings. The ICR team also kept
the argument of insufficient focus on high-risk groups as valid in view of (i) the explicit design
of the RAF Component ―to support cost-effective initiatives in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention
and control‖, (ii) the scientific evidence on the most cost-effective strategies reinforced by the
earlier sector work, (iii) the efforts of the project in this direction, and (iv) the facts-based
analysis of the small grants spending in Annex 3.

108. The rest of the comments have been taken into account and incorporated as far as feasible
in the final version of this ICR. The full Recipient’s contribution to this ICR is included in
Annex 7.

  The visits to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan benefitted from additional technical support provided by the Central Asia
Regional HIV/AIDS Advisor whose contribution is gratefully acknowledged by the ICR team.

(b)    Cofinanciers

109. DFID comments on the project during the ICR mission were similar to those from the
Recipient and benefiting countries, and are reflected in this document to the extent possible.
DFID has originally planned a ―silent partner‖ role but was pulled into more of the managerial
aspects with the earlier delays. When provided the draft ICR for comments, DFID raised no
issues and expressed its agreement with the content of the document.

(c)    Other partners and stakeholders

110. CDC played a key role in designing and sustaining the surveillance efforts and also
expressed concern on the changes in the RF and deficiencies in the M&E aspects at the outset.
They praised the coordination of the project at the outset.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Epidemiological context:

The overall epidemiological scenario in the region suggests that the absolute levels of HIV infection will
continue to increase (See review by Thorne et al, cited above). UNAIDS projections for the region, based
on the spectrum model predict ongoing growth in HIV in all four countries.44

The proportions of new infections arising from SWs appear to be gradually displacing the proportions
arising from IDUs. The trends among young pregnant women, as a surrogate for new HIV infection show
some attenuation in Kazakhstan. However, considerable methodological uncertainties exist on
interpretation of these trends. Indeed, a key recommendation of this ICR is for systematic analyses of the
entire sentinel surveillance data to sort out key trends and changes over time.

In the context of overall increases (or at least no demonstrable decreases) in HIV infection in the region,
the impact of the project can best be understood as to whether it decreased transmission in specific groups,
or if it enabled a better response (via surveillance, training, capacity building, leverage of additional funds,
etc.) for the future. The starting point is to look at expenditures from the RAF on various risk groups.

RAF small grants spending:
Analyses of the spending on small grants show the following key features. These data were provided by
RPMU for all countries. Some duplication of numbers is expected as a small proportion of all grants
covered multiple risk groups. The key findings are:

     Only 22 percent of the overall project spending on small grants and 21 percent of all sub-projects
      focused on broad high-risk groups (IDUs, SW, prisoners and MSM). Of these, there is little doubt that
      IDUs and SWs are the ―core‖ high-risk groups, and the spending on these two groups alone was even
      lower.

     Spending on these broad risk groups varied considerably, being highest in Tajikistan (49% of total
      spending) and only 5% in Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan spent over 54% of funds on lower risk groups of
      medical personnel and other general populations.

     The absolute number of IDUs and SWs covered was about 36,000 and 14,000, respectively. Estimates
      of the total number of IDUs and SWs in the region are not known (i.e., denominators), and thus what
      proportion of the eligible population the project might have covered. This is a recommended follow
      up step from this ICR.

     The unit costs per beneficiary vary greatly across the countries. The highest costs per beneficiary
      were generally for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PWLHA).

                                                      35
   The highest absolute numbers of any group covered were migrants (0.5 M) and youth (0.4M), but
    these groups are not likely to contribute many new infections and have low seroprevalence rates (see
    sentinel surveillance data).
   The focus on high-risk groups improved slightly after the MTR and formal restructuring. This focus
    was evident in the adjusted grant spending patterns, increased attention of NGOs to high-risk groups
    and reflected in the various aide memoires. Also, by the later stages, more diffusion of practice in
    reaching high-risk groups with condom provision was available from bilateral organizations’ project
    (e.g. CARHAP) experience and from wider diffusion of the NGO training materials from CAAP.

Economic and Financial Analysis:

The PAD had an economic analysis with estimated rate of return. However, this was based on
assumptions about how many cases of HIV infection and HIV/AIDS deaths might be avoided from the
original project design that envisioned attenuation of the HIV epidemic. With the revised project DOs, it
is not possible to estimate the economic benefits using comparable methods.

However, very crudely, if the project covered (conservatively) about 40,000 IDUs and 15,000 SWs, these
would, based on the literature, represent about 5,000 new HIV cases avoided from injection and about
1,000 avoided from SW. These 6,000 avoided cases represent about 20 years of Disability Adjusted Life
Years (DALY; weighted by age preference and a discount rate of 3 percent), or about 120,000 DALYs
saved over a 20-year period. If each DALY is valued (again conservatively) at three times the regional
average GDP of US$600/capita (adjusted for a 5 percent annual income growth), then the non-discounted
value would be US$260 million, or in discounted (at 3 percent) terms, about US$77 million. The
discounted project costs are about US$22 million (assuming an inflation rate of 11 percent). Thus, in
crude terms, the total economic benefit exceeds the projected costs several fold. This further suggests that
high coverage of high-risk groups might have made the economic returns from the project even greater.
However, the estimation is sensitive to the value of life- if each healthy year of life is valued only at
average per capita income, then the project has only modest overall benefit. Finally, the lack of alignment
of outputs of the project with the reduced HIV transmission effectively means that it is quite difficult, if
not impossible, to assess the economic returns from the rest of the project. Surveillance activities generate
important information effects and as public goods, it is hard to evaluate the returns from such information.
Indeed, it might be plausible that the economic returns from the rest of the small grants program would be
zero. A recommendation from this ICR is to organize a formal economic analysis of the project.

Finally, a full fiscal impact is not undertaken here. The surveillance, operations and maintenance costs
associated with the project are quite small (the total annual cost for all Regional Training Centers,
including programmatic and operating costs (salaries, communication, etc.), is only about US$0.6
million), and can be easily accommodated within the annual health budgets of the four countries. There is
no recurrent cost liability with the RAF (small grants program), and indeed some external assistance from
GFATM and PEPFAR will continue a few of these grants, albeit only at national levels. The project had
originally envisioned the RAF funding being transferred to other sources, but this goal was dropped at
restructuring. Thus, the overall fiscal burden associated with the project is small.

1. DESCRIPTION AND PROJECT START UP
1. Central Asia has been experiencing four overlapping epidemics - HIV/AIDS, drug abuse, sexually
transmitted infections (STIs), and tuberculosis (TB) - that mostly have youth at its center. Since 2001, the
World Bank has carried out sector work on HIV/AIDS, STIs and TB in Central Asia’. In November 2003,
the Bank and UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) initiated discussions with the
Governments of Central Asia about the possibility of financing a regional operation that will further assist
implementation of the regional and country-specific strategies to control HIV/AIDS.
2. The Central Asia AIDS Control Project (CAAP) funded by the World Bank and the DFID was
implemented since 2005 in four Central Asian Countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan.
3. The CAAP was the first regional initiative in the Central Asia Region in the area of HIV response.
Launching this initiative was risky and challenging at the same time since there had been no similar
previous experience in the region, and it was not clear ex ante whether the implementing body, with its
proposed structure, would manage to be efficient and effective on both regional and national grounds.
Difficulties and bottlenecks were enormous; these needed to be overcome in order to bring the initiative
to success.
4. The development objective of the project was stated as ―Contribute to controlling the spread of
HIV/AIDS in participating countries in the Central Asia Region by establishing regional mechanisms to
support national HIV/AIDS programs‖.
5. The outcome indicators were: i) to develop institutional framework to inform policies at
national/regional levels; ii) to establish of Central Asia Regional AIDS Fund; and iii) to strengthen the
capacity and cooperation between the Public, Nongovernmental (NGOs) and the Private sectors on the
Regional and National levels
6. The project consisted of three components: Component 1 (US$ 7.3 million) was aimed at: (a) creating
a favorable environment for the implementation of an appropriate HIV/AIDS regional strategy; (b)
improving information and decision-making based on the quality epidemiological data; and (c)
strengthening institutional capacity; Component 2 (US$ 15.5 million) - the Regional AIDS Fund (RAF)
that was established to finance, through sub-projects, national and regional initiatives; and Component 3
(US$ 3.7 million) consisted of the Project Management and M&E. This component financed project
management and monitoring and evaluation of the whole project.
7. The Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC) who was the main Recipient of the IDA grant is the
successor of the Central Asia Cooperation Organization that provided legal framework for the project.
The project management arrangements were detailed in the document CAAP’s Operational Manual. The
high-level management of CAAP was implemented through a Regional Project Steering Committee
(RSC) composed of the Vice-Prime Ministers of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the Minister of
Health of Kazakhstan, as well as UNAIDS representative. The RSC was designed to provide CAAP with
strategic direction, discuss complex regional issues, and serve as a policy forum to reflect the views and
concerns of the benefiting countries on policy development and regulatory harmonization for HIV. The
actual project implementation was done by the RPMU and national project offices. Also, on the national
level, fiduciary and grant administration procedures were implemented with the support of the United
Nation Development Program (UNDP).
2. PROJECT DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPACT
8. In general, the project was implemented in line with project implementation plan and by Project Year
(PY) - 4 and achieved most of its forecasted outputs with exception of delayed implementation of certain
sub-component activities. Due to savings made over the project implementation and with the purpose of
utilizing all the project resources, the Grant was first extended until September, 2011. This also allowed



                                                                                                         43
smooth preparation and start up of Regional One Health Project, which was implemented by the efforts of
the same team. For the purpose of full completion of the project and closing all accounts, based on the
Decision of RSC and agreement between Recipient and Bank, the project was further extended until the
end of December 2011.
9. In terms of funds disbursement, 99.5% of allocated US$25.00 million IDA grant was utilized. DFID’
funds in the amount equivalent to US$1.55 million (including exchange difference) was fully disbursed in
2010. Disbursement of funds by components was as follows: Component 1 – US$ 8.24 mln or 118.4% of
the component funds; Component - 2 – US$14,31 mln or 86.0% of the component funds and Component
3 – US$3.99 mln or 158.3% of component budget. Lower than planned disbursement of the Component 2
is explained by the fact that some of the last implemented sub-projects were partially cancelled and not all
of the funds were utilized. Taking into account that grant distribution cycle process took at least 1 year
time, the unutilized resources under Component 2 were redirected to other activities in the last project
implementation year. Detailed activities carried out within the scope of each component are given below.
Component 1: Regional Coordination, Policy Development and Capacity Building
10. To facilitate regional coordination and policy development, 4 partners’ forums were organized by
the project on an annual basis since 2007. The results of these assured better coordination of activities,
improved dialogue, discussion and agreement of priority issues in the prevention of HIV/AIDS. During
the forums, decisions were made to harmonize the efforts made by all interested parties. One of the key
results of the Partners Forum was the Regional Strategy on prevention of HIV/AIDS that was developed
over the years and discussed with Partners. In October 2009, during another Health Council meeting
under EurAsEC, the draft of Regional strategy was approved and disseminated to the stakeholders.
11. 5 annual meetings of Interregional Parliamentary group also contributed to harmonization of the
efforts in the area of legislation framework. During the project life, Tajikistan made amendment to its law
in HIV/AIDS, Uzbekistan prepared amendment to the law which is at the stage of adoption, and
Kyrgyzstan prepared draft law that covered the issues of harm reduction and substitute therapy.
Parliamentarians from Azerbaijan who joined CAAP also contributed to the development of a new law on
HIV/AIDS in their country that was adopted in 2010, which is considered as an unexpected project
outcome. At the end of 2010, normative acts compilation handbook was developed by the project and
disseminated on national levels.
12. During the second half of 2010, assessment of safe injection and vascular access practices in health
care facilities was conducted in all the four countries with the support of CDC. A total of 81 specialists
were trained by CDC who carried out field works. Preliminary results were discussed during the regional
conference in December 2010, final versions were presented in September 2011 in Almaty.
13. Research on needs assessment in use of disposable medical instruments in state medical entities in
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan was carried out by a consulting firm, results of
which were discussed during the project final conference in December 2010. Ministries of Health
welcomed the assessment and used the findings and recommendations in their planning activities.
14. Surveillance and regional M&E systems sub-component was focused on supporting two areas:
sentinel surveillance (SS) and electronic surveillance (ES).
15. 13 sentinel surveillance sites were established and supported by the project since the beginning of the
project. At later stages, with the request of the countries, additional 5 sites were included into the project.
Support was provided in the form of procurement and supplied of lab equipments and consumables, and
subsequent trainings, refrigerators, power generators, vehicles, IT equipments and other goods, as well as
training AIDS Center’s personnel. On an annual basis starting from 2007, project procured test systems
for primary level (screening) tests and confirmative level (experts) tests for diagnosing selected high-risk
groups for three infections: HIV, hepatitis C and syphilis. For the purpose of the collection of data, special
registration forms were completed that were entered into Epi-Info database software. The volume of the


                                                                                                            44
forms varies from country to country and reaches up to 7200 forms in a country. To attract people for
interviewing, various incentives were provided such as package of food, mobile phone sim cards, etc.
16. In terms of capacity building of the medical personnel involved in the surveillance process,
epidemiologists, lab specialist, dispensary personnel, IT experts and others received basic and advance
level of trainings on data collection, entry, processing and analysis and preparation of reports. 3 separate
trainings were conducted in each of the project benefiting countries and a total of 528 specialists were
trained.
17. Sixteen (16) national sentinel surveillance reports were prepared and disseminated between 2007-
2009 through national conferences in which government sector representatives, NGOs and international
partners participated. The results of the SS were used for preparation of grant proposals, national
programs on HIV/AIDS prevention and country reports. Besides, national workshops were conducted on
voluntary consulting and testing for 112 representatives of NGO and AIDS Centers and basic and
advanced training workshops for control of the quality of the lab researches for 240 lab experts.
18. For the part of Electronic Surveillance, software was developed by experienced IT firm on monitoring
of the HIV/AIDS infections. The software was first developed in Kazakhstan and after successfully
testing, it was adopted in other three project countries. An effort was made on improving the Internet
connection between the republican AIDS centers and regional centers in each country through
procurement of IT equipment and other network supplies.
19. 3 regional meetings were conducted for training of 120 specialists of AIDS Centers who are currently
involved in ES implementation. Most of them went through extensive on the job trainings by the software
developers and RPMU trained staff. Besides, a study tour was organized for 8 experts from CAR to
Ukraine were ES has been implemented successfully.
20. At this moment in 25 pilot sites of 4 countries the ES is fully established and operational. It is
expected that GF funded projects and new ICAP Project who is funded by PEPFAR will continue
expanding the program in CA.
21. The sub-component human resource development primarily focused on establishment of Regional
Training Centers and their capacity building, which was supported through Regional AIDS Fund
component as well, through providing grants. A total of 4 RTC’s were established during the project life
which were targeted i) organization of epidemiological surveillance on HIV–infection (located in
Kazakhstan), i) implementation of harm reduction programs (located in Kyrgyzstan) iii) prevention of
HIV-infection among migrants (located in Tajikistan) and iv) treatment, care and support to PLWH
(located in Uzbekistan). All four RTC established successfully and are operational to date, though
sustainability of their operations on regional level is still questionable. Nevertheless, a few of them are
getting government and international donors support on a national level. Necessary capacity building was
conducted and required office equipments and other supports provided. With the support of CAAP
trainers manuals were developed for each RTC for conducting regional ToT and national training of
trainers. The gross of 330 specialists on regional level and 557 specialists on national levels were trained
in various fields by RTC’s. For development of training manuals and conducting trainings, national as
well as international experts were recruited. Not once study tours were organized to forefront centers
(Saints Petersburg, Odessa, Kiev, Krakow, Zagreb). Works on establishment of RTC were carried out
together with international partners: AIHA, IOM, Eurasian Harm Reduction Center, UNODC.
22. In order to improve awareness of the HIV/AIDS issue among the population, project worked closely
with journalists and religious leaders. A total of 24 journalists were trained through regional seminars
who further trained 122 journalists on a cascade basis on the national levels, which led to better coverage
of the HIV/AIDS issue in the region. Trainings were conducted in close collaboration with UNESCO.
23. Regional working group was established to work in the area of building capacity of the religious
leaders that convened 5 times. Manual was developed for Muslim religious leaders that highlighted


                                                                                                         45
addressing the HIV/AIDS issue from religious point of view. Basic and advanced training was conducted
with the support of international expert. Besides, a study tour was organized by the Project to Cyprus to
enhance the knowledge of the CA Muslim religious leaders. 112 religious leaders were trained through
regional seminars and 63 religious leaders through national seminars. The training course for trainers on
HIV/AIDS was integrated into the curriculum of Islamic Universities in Tajikistan
Component 2: Regional AIDS Fund - RAF
24. As stated above initially a total of US$ 15.5 million (US$ 13.65 million from the World Bank and
US$ 1.85 million from DFID) were allocated for RAF. It is necessary to note that DFID funds were used
only for financing the sub-projects. RAF operations and grant administration is based on the
comprehensive RAF Handbook (that includes RAF Manual and Grant Recipient Handbook) which was
developed by RPMU in 2005 and later revised by international experts. By the end of 2010, the project
implemented four grant rounds and approved US$6.5 million for small country-level grants and
implemented three grant rounds and approved US$8.0 million for the large regional grants. Overall, the
project financed 221 small (up to US$50,000) country-specific grants and 11 large regional grants
focused on provision of HIV prevention and care support services to the most at-risk populations at least
in two countries.
25. RAF was the first donor to provide large regional grants to the local organizations. Implementation of
eleven regional grants allowed better cooperation and information exchange between different
organizations working in different countries. Independent survey conducted by international experts
showed that some sub-recipients that participated in implementation of the large grants rated the value of
partnerships that were formed during implementation of joint regional activities even higher than the
actual program results achieved during those activities and were convinced that their organizations will
continue benefiting from these partnerships in the future. Detailed assessment of RAF is reflected in
consultants’ report that is available publicly on project web-site.
26. The situation with availability of AIDS service organizations ready to work with RAF was a
challenging issue during the first years of project implementation. In response, CAAP in conjunction with
USAID-funded CAPACITY project implemented ―Community mobilization strategy‖, which focused on
capacity building of potential service providers in project design, management and M&E.
27. When RAF was started none of the local organizations were ready and capable to apply for large
regional grants. Therefore, during the first round RAF has agreed with international NGOs (PSI, AFEW,
AIHA and JSI) that they would serve as ―umbrellas‖ for local implementing partners and would manage
regional grants as principal recipients. During the first two years, RAF and its partners worked to further
build up the capacity of the already experienced and respected local AIDS-servicing organizations. As the
result, consortiums of several local organizations applied for funding and received large regional grants in
Rounds 2 and 3.
28. The experience that these organizations received working with RAF was challenging, but gave them a
great opportunity to build their capacity and increase their organizational and project management skills.
Organizations improved their capacity to manage funds and projects because RAF provided them with
support during the start-up and implementation (detailed RAF handbook, start-up trainings for project and
finance managers and supervisory monitoring visits), but also due to the fact that RAF procedures were
rather complex and sophisticated and organizations had to establish and adopt operational procedures that
they did not have before.
29. Regional Technical Evaluation Committee and National Technical Evaluation Committees were
established to evaluate and select large regional grants and small national grants, respectively. The
members of the Committees received extensive training on evaluation process.




                                                                                                         46
30. Overall approximately 68% of RAF funds were allocated for service provision to high-risk groups
namely IDU, SW, MSM, migrants and PLWH, where the last grant round was fully targeted to high-risk
populations.
31. RAF has achieved and in some cases significantly over-achieved all targets set by the project
performance framework for its indicators and its implementation can be rated as fully satisfactory.
32. Funding from the RAF in the countries became de facto Institutional Development Funds where at
many instances astonishing results have been achieved. This funding enabled institutions that are ready
for change to move forward and implement activities that were frequently stalled by lack of operating
budgets, one of the key constraints in institutional development and capacity building in participating
countries. Many activities became self sustainable or were converted into government policies with far
reaching effects. Examples of such sustainable integration include a training course for teachers and
classroom materials on HIV prevention for youth was introduced into mandatory school curricula in
Uzbekistan supported through sub-project ―HIV prevention among youth‖ by Ministry of Higher and
Secondary Special Education of the Republic of Uzbekistan; second generation epidemiological
surveillance sessions that were incorporated into the post graduate medical education curriculum in
Uzbekistan by Tashkent State Medical Institute for Post-graduate studies; CAAP created Department for
Planning, Analysis, Response and Coordination (PARC) was institutionalized under Republican AIDS
Center of Uzbekistan through the Governmental resolutions; a training module on HIV and migration for
nurses introduced into the curriculum of nursing schools in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and in Uzbekistan
under sub-project ―HIV prevention in labor migrants in Central Asian countries‖ implemented by IOM.
33. Based on project indicators, from the beginning of implementation of RAF, up to date: more than
103,5 thousand IDU’s, more than 331,0 thousand migrants, and around 40,0 thousand sex workers were
reached through HIV prevention services; nearly 2,0 million needles and syringes were distributed among
IDUs in harm reduction services and 1,6 million condoms were distributed among risk groups that were
procured mainly by the Global Fund; 31,9 thousand of PLWH were reached through care and support
services (including palliative care).
34. Besides, as a project achievement, we can state the mechanism of financing sub-grants developed
under the RAF as one of the effective instruments developed in the region. Today, this mechanism is
being considered by other donor organization, including the Global Fund for implementation in financing
sub-projects.
35. In total, more that 230 sub-project recipients of RAF were provided with technical assistance in the
area of development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects. Strengthening the capacity
of these organizations in the issue of project management that brought to improvement of their skills in
fiduciary management, including on procurement and finance in accordance with the international
practices.
Component 3: Project Management and M&E
36. The Regional Project Management Unit (RPMU) was established in 2006 and was responsible to
coordinate the implementation of the CAAP including program management, procurement, financial
management and monitoring project activities.
37. The RPMU was established as an international fund organization and designated as Executive Body
on behalf of EurAsEC for purposes of implementing the project. The highest body that is responsible for
implementation of the CAAP is the Regional Steering Committee (RSC). It is a high-level regional
coordination body that sets up strategic directions of the project and overseas its implementation. Having
RSC at the level of Vice-prime ministers allow multi-vector interventions through the use of inter-sectoral
approach to combat HIV and AIDS in the region. RSC enabled the project to discuss HIV/AIDS related
policies in the region taking into account the views and interests of all countries participating in the
Project. Due to a very high level representation, it was possible to bring together more sectors than just


                                                                                                        47
the healthcare sector in the respective countries and to tackle the problem of HIV epidemic with joined
forces from a multi-sectoral perspective. RSC held meeting at least 3 times a year and issued 33 decisions
during the life of the project that cover different aspects of the project implementation.
38. Approximately 15 staff at head office and 4 staffs in each four countries managed the project
throughout its implementation period. All project staff received various trainings and technical assistance
support. Procurement and Financial experts gained extensive experience in procurement and
administering funds in accordance with World Bank procedures by attending trainings and workshops, as
well as receiving day-to-day support from World Bank’s team.
39. Annual work-plans and budgets were submitted to RSC and World Bank timely. RPMU timely
prepared un-audited Financial Management Reports and submitted to the Government and World Bank
on a quarterly basis since the beginning of the project. An independent auditing firms acceptable to World
Bank conducted annual audits and over the course of project implementation no major misuse of funds
was observed. All project progress reports, annual reports and project final reports and brochures were
prepared timely and were also uploaded to the project web-site once published to make project more
transparent and visible.
40. Monitoring and Evaluation team of RPMU received extensive support from World Bank team, who
guided them in preparation of project indicators, collection of data and analyzing them. During the final
year of project implementation an international consultant carried out independent evaluation of
implementation of CAAP project management and structure.
41. CAAP collaborated with United Nation Development Program in implementation of the project at
national and regional levels. UNDP provided on-going technical support to the CAAP in the area of
fiduciary management of project activities, as well as capacity building programs. UNDP maintained a
full office and programme with strong capacity in each country and, in many cases, enjoyed pre-existing
partnerships with CAAP key national partners. Similarly to CAAP, UNDP tailored its approach through
establishing regional mechanism for project support. UNDP country office in Kazakhstan acted as a lead
office that was supported with UNDP country offices in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
42. UNDP also participated in Technical Working Groups which included representatives from different
Ministries, Drug Control Agencies, NGOs, private sector. During the project implementation, TWGs
assist the development of project activities including preparation of policy amendments for approval by
the Regional Steering Committee; provision of expert assessment of sub-project grant applications to the
Regional AIDS Fund and others. This ensured effective implementation and decision making process.
3. ANALYSIS OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE WORLD BANK, RECIPIENT/GOVERNMENTS
AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
43. At the early stages of the project implementation RPMU had some difficulties in communicating with
the World Bank team, particularly on project management issues. The earlier team of the Bank (between
the periods 2007-2009) was focusing very much on the micromanagement of the project and its staff,
instead of focusing on the broader issues. This lead to delays in number of activities. With the change in
project team from the Bank side in the middle of 2009, situation improved drastically, as the new team
was focusing more on macro issues, such as dialog with the countries, the Recipient’s management –
EurAsEC on possibility of expanding project results through establishment of public health platform,
discussion with international partners on their support and future involvement, assessment of HIV/AIDS
situation in the region, including CAAP interference, achievements and lessons learnt, attending major
events initiated by CAAP (inter-parliamentary meetings, partners Forum, RSC meetings and other
separate meetings with high-level people),etc. and left the project management issues to the Recipient,
who is ultimately responsible for project management and performance. At the same time Bank’s new
team strengthened its monitoring through regular missions, procurement post-reviews and independent
assessments.



                                                                                                        48
44. Nevertheless, the overall operation of the World Bank during course of the project implementation is
assessed as efficient, useful and supportive, particularly during the last two years of project
implementation. During the implementation, the project was regularly monitored by the Bank missions,
assessing the status of the project components. Though in the beginning phase of the project, ranking was
marginally satisfactory, in later years Bank ranked Project satisfactory. Required clearances were
provided timely and adequate advice or recommendations were given. Local staff at resident mission
provided continuous support for all enquiries of the RPMU.
45. World Bank conducted number of training and seminars where RPMU and other project participants
managed to learn Bank procedures, and new practices.
46. Finally, at the end of the Project World Bank provided extensive guidance with procedures of closing
the Project and evaluating its performance.
47. DFID’s co-financing of project activities, namely RAF component was effective and all funds were
utilized during the project implementation. DFID was actively involved in supervision missions of the
Bank.
48. The Recipient of Grant funds, Central Asian Cooperation Organization and its successor Eurasian
Economic Community, in principle fulfilled its obligations in front of the Bank and took all the necessary
actions for the support in successful implementation of the Project. Regional Steering Committee and
RPMU were established in satisfactory level to the Bank. Subsequently project related documents were
developed and adopted by RSC and RPMU.
49. Although with some delays, Government of Kazakhstan provided necessary conditions for RPMU to
operate in the territory of the country, including immunities and privileges, exemption from the taxes and
duties, office area on complimentary basis, to name a few.
50. Other Governments were also active in the lifetime of the project. In all countries, Governments
issued necessary resolutions and decrees to support the smooth implementation of the Project in
respective countries. Ministries of Health and their subordinate institutions were also active throughout
the span of project implementation. No substantial objections and/or barriers were created by the project
benefiting country Governments in successful implementation of the CAAP.
51. It is necessary to recognize the support provided to the project by other parties. Center for Disease
Control and Prevention took active role in implementation of Sentinel Surveillance which they initiated
back in 2003 and guidance in assessment of safe injection practices. UNAIDS provided its guidance on
the overall implementation of the strategy and was represented in the Regional Steering Committee.
UNDP provided substantial support in fiduciary aspect of the project on national basis and built capacity
of the local small grant recipients.
52. IOM, UNODC, AIHA provided their technical expertise in the related areas to the Regional Training
Centers established under the project. Active involvement of International NGOs—JSI, PSI, AFEW—
helped bring best international practices and experience to Central Asian Region and thus contributed in
capacity building of local NGOs.
53. Lastly, but not the least, synchronizing a number of activities with Global Fund led to efficient use of
project resources.
4. SUSTAINABILITY OF PROJECT INVESTMENTS
54. The health sector reforms in Central Asia have been scaled up drastically starting from the year 2000.
The generic objectives of the national wide reforms are: i) to share responsibility for health between state
and patient; ii) to shift health care delivery to PHC; iii) to introduce new model of health management and
health information system (HIS); iv) to strengthen maternal and child health; v) to control spread of
socially significant diseases; and vi) to reform medical education system.



                                                                                                         49
55. The Central Asia AIDS Control Project provided significant contribution to the achievement of
objectives 3 and 5. This was done by providing opportunities to scale up the surveillance system
including electronic surveillance and health management, by engaging diverse public and other sectors on
the national and regional level in the HIV/TB prevention and by providing continuous training
opportunities for NGOs and medical workers. It is rather difficult to measure the impact of the project for
the health reforms of the countries at this stage. However, the outputs of the project efforts and mid-term
outcomes could be referenced to understand the areas and the level of project interference.
Unique opportunity to sustain better coordinated response on the regional level
56. The coordination of the project was facilitated by the high-profile Regional Steering Committee
which comprised Vice-prime ministers of the project participating countries and UNAIDS coordinator.
Establishment of the Regional Steering Committee (RSC) is seen as a regional coordination and
harmonization mechanism of the decision-making process in the region related to implementation of the
project activities. This approach has become another step in promoting the inter-sectoral approach to
solution of problems related to HIV and AIDS.
57. RSC is used as one of the main driving forces for discussing the HIV/AIDS related policies in the
region, taking into account the views and interests of all countries participating in the Project.
58. Due to very high level representation it was possible to bring together more sectors than just the
healthcare sector in the respective countries, and to tackle the problem of HIV epidemic with joined
forces, from an inter-sectoral perspective.
59. Development and approval of the Regional AIDS strategy would not be possible without existing
coordination mechanisms. The Regional AIDS strategy was approved by the Council of Ministers of
Health of Eurasian Economic Community in autumn 2009. The selected coordination approach proved
itself effective and was used by the principal Recipient of CAAP - EurAsEC to start up not just a new but
an innovative project on One Health that aimed to harmonize the preventive approach of zoonotic
diseases in the Central Asia region.
Implementing and sustaining Three Ones principal of UNAIDS: the work with parliamentarians
60. Enabling political and legislative environment is a key to success of any programming. HIV
prevention programming in the region has benefited from the revised national legislation related to the
HIV. Thus project succeeded in facilitation of those revisions by engaging in project activities
parliamentarians of all project participating countries.
61. The revised legislation enables AIDS service organizations, both government and NGOs, provide
uninterrupted services, prevention and treatment thereby creating equal opportunities for access to health
related services for all people in need.
62. The Parliaments of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in their law revision set in stone the need to work
across sectors by developing and implementing the National strategic programs on the regular basis. This
step enabled sustainability of Three Ones principles promoted by UNAIDS in these countries.
63. Discrimination on the basis of HIV status has also been eliminated from the legislation of project
participating countries, which served as a clear sign of commitment of Central Asian countries to promote
human rights and fundamental freedoms of People living with HIV and their citizens in general.
Sustainability of interventions related to the quality decision making in Central Asian countries – CCM
support and data collection
64. Quality and evidence base of decisions of Country Coordination Mechanisms and other stakeholders
on HIV are subject to availability of reliable and up-to-date information. To ensure a synchronized
approach in improving data quality, the project supported expansion of HIV sentinel surveillance in all
four countries. The HIV SS program used to have spot pattern and was piloted in a few oblasts of each of


                                                                                                        50
the project participating countries. With the joint efforts of CDC, GFATM, Ministries of Health, CAAP
and civil societies of the project participating countries, HIV SS was widely implemented in all territories
of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and in major territories of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The HIV SS was
expanded into a total of 18 sites. Number of trainings and procurement of needed equipment and
transportation created opportunities for the conduct of HIV SS on the regular basis.
65. Importantly, project supported institutionalizing the HIV SS in all 4 countries of the Central Asia. The
success if this initiative differs from one country to another. But in general, all countries have adopted the
HIV SS protocols and incorporated them into respective normative documents. Moreover, Kazakhstan
and Uzbekistan developed the curricula for postgraduate students of the Medical school, so starting from
2009 all epidemiologists that work in AIDS centers were mandated to undergo this HIV SS training. This
fact can be attributed to the impact of the CAAP intervention in a long run.
66. HIV electronic surveillance is another major step in improving the service provision to the People
living with HIV. The project has supported development and installation of HIV ES in 25 sites. The major
pilot of the system in 17 sites was implemented in Kazakhstan. Sustainability of this initiative was
ensured by the countries’ efforts to continue its implementation building on the project achievements. In
Tajikistan, Ministry of Health issued a decree to expand the electronic surveillance at the national level.
In Kazakhstan, decree was approved by Ministry of Health to expand the electronic surveillance
throughout the country. CDC supported ICAP project to continue implementation and supporting of
electronic surveillance system in AIDS service centers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.
Global Fund/UNDP funded HIV prevention program in Uzbekistan, also supporting further expansion of
the ES in the country.
Regional TOT centres (RTC): capacity building
67. To ensure regional information exchange and training opportunities, the Project supported the
establishment of the 5 regional TOT centers: 2 in Kazakhstan and one in each of the remaining project
participating countries.
68. In Kazakhstan, sustainability was ensured for both the Regional TOT training center established
under the CAAP and the project investments in upgrading Sentinel Surveillance. The Kazakh Regional
TOT Center was set up by the CAAP with the objective to provide trainings on Sentinel Surveillance to
the entire region. After the project closure, TOT center staff will become National AIDS Center staff and
will be financed from state budget (related financing was included in the National Program 2011-2015).
In this sense, operational sustainability is fully assured by the Government of Kazakhstan. Sustainability
of the regional character of the Kazakh TOT center is uncertain though. Commitment of the neighboring
countries is very low and without CAAP support in the future, the status of the Kazakh Regional TOT
center will likely be downgraded to National.
69. Regarding the CAAP investment in Sentinel Surveillance in Kazakhstan, CAAP provided extensive
support though procurement of equipments, vehicle, consumables and support in trainings (laboratory,
epidemiology, database management etc). During the CAAP project training activities, knowledge level
of the personnel was increased by at least 30%, which was measured through the regular pre/post-tests
carried out during the trainings. Although, State financing procurement of the goods/consumables will be
assured in the future, there are number of issues that needs to be considered, such as: i) procurement
capacity of the AIDS center is weak ii) funding by State is not timely that might adversely affect
timeliness of conducting surveys iii) difficulty in getting funding from Ministry of Economy as compared
to getting from International Donors. Once Donors approve the budget, financing is accomplished without
problem, unlike in case of the State Budget.
70. In Kyrgyzstan, CAAP project financed the establishment of Central Asian Information and Training
Center on Harm Reduction by UNODC through a large grant. The Center was registered in 2008 as an
NGO in Kyrgyzstan. The Government is not ready to support regional initiatives, particularly soft



                                                                                                           51
activities (trainings, meetings, etc). There is certain likelihood that TOT Center will not be sustainable
after project closing. Kyrgyzstan seems to be the only country where even the currently well functioning
Sentinel Surveillance system is under serious threat of unsustainability on the long run. After significant
investment in infrastructure by the CAAP (laboratory equipment and vehicles procured for three sites),
the situation is such that there is no state budget allocated to consumables needed to operate the vehicles
and to carry out testing (e.g., there is no state money allocated for blood filter paper).
71. In Tajikistan, the establishment of the regional TOT center was initiated under the CAAP in 2007 to
address the training needs of the region on the issue of work with migrants and members of their families.
By 2010, the TOT center was fully established, with 12 training modules elaborated for different target
groups like state workers, NGOs, healthcare providers, religious leaders, etc. Within the CAAP
framework, 2 regional and 54 national trainings were implemented after that the activities of RTC were
supported through large grant (for carrying out national and regional trainings). In the initial stage (first 3
to 5 years), the TOT center will depend on international donors, with the commitment of the Center to
gradually move towards self-sustainability once the capacity is strengthened and key stakeholders both
from public and civil society recognize the added value of this Center.
72. In Uzbekistan, a regional TOT center was established under the CAAP to address needs for trainings
on provision of treatment and care to people living with HIV in the region. The TOT Center is located in
the National AIDS Center, whilst premises and facility use are free of charge. With the TA of American
International Health Association, the major international partner in this initiative, TOT organized
intensive on site trainings in three different cities of the Russian Federation on ART and Opportunistic
Infection treatment for adults, children and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. After the
closure of the CAAP, the sustainability of the Uzbek Regional TOT center will be fully assured by the
Uzbek Government. The Government is planning to place the TOT Center under both Tashkent
Postgraduate Institute and the National AIDS Center at the same time, and to be co-financed by both
organizations. Without a future regional project, the likelihood that the TOT center will conserve its
regional scope of activity is moderate.
Sustainability of the Regional AIDS Fund
73. RAF funding enabled institutions ready for change to move forward and implement activities that
were frequently stalled by lack of operating budgets, one of the key constraints in institutional
development and capacity building in participating countries. Many activities became self-sustainable or
were converted into government policies with far reaching effects.
74. Increased coverage of vulnerable populations with HIV awareness activities and mobilization of local
communities, especially in rural areas, to work in HIV area was the unique and the most important input
of the RAF into the national efforts to combat HIV epidemics in the region. Implementation of the RAF
small grant program facilitated capacity building of local AIDS-servicing organizations and improved
inter-sectoral partnerships and cooperation. Although sometimes cumbersome and complicated for
inexperienced organizations, RAF procedures applied in accordance with the RAF Operations Manual
helped many organizations to develop their organizational structures and procedures and made them more
competitive and professional. RAF was also the first donor to give large regional grants to local
organizations, which led to improved information exchange and regional cooperation. Grant selection
mechanism and tools developed by RPMU for RAF were considered by most of the stakeholders as one
of the most transparent and participatory in the region.
75. Although sustainability of RAF-funded initiatives and the RAF mechanism and tools itself largely
depends on the availability of external funding and political will of current and future donors to continue
using RAF experience, CAAP has reached its targets and developed a set of documents for transparent
and justified granting mechanism which is available for national and international stakeholders and can be
easily applied on the national and the regional level.



                                                                                                            52
76. Nevertheless, many activities funded by RAF already became self-sustainable through funding of
other donors (CARHAP, USAID or the Global Fund) or were converted into the government policies. As
an example, to continue activities of the Regional Training Centers for HIV prevention among migrants
(one of the regional grants), IOM has signed an agreement with the Population Service International (PSI)
to become a sub-contractor for the USAID-funded Health Outreach Project. Within this project, it is
expected that IOM will continue providing HIV prevention services to migrants and build capacity of
other service providers by implementing project activities on a regional level until the end of 2015.
Several local partners of the TUMAR project have continued implementation of the started
comprehensive HIV-prevention model using Global Fund resources (Kurgan-Tube, Tajikistan; Aksu,
Kazakhstan), as well as local administration (municipality) funds (Almaty, Kazakhstan).
77. A number of training materials developed within different RAF-funded small projects were integrated
into national educational curricula. Examples of such sustainable integration include a training course for
teachers and classroom materials on HIV prevention for youth that was introduced into mandatory school
curricula in Uzbekistan supported through sub-project ―HIV prevention among youth‖ by Ministry of
Higher and Secondary Special Education of the Republic of Uzbekistan; second generation
epidemiological surveillance sessions that were incorporated into the post-graduate medical education
curriculum in Uzbekistan by Tashkent State Medical Institute for Post-graduate studies; CAAP-created
Department for Planning, Analysis, Response and Coordination (PARC) was institutionalized under
Republican AIDS Center of Uzbekistan through the Governmental resolutions; a training module on HIV
and migration for nurses was introduced into the curriculum of nursing schools in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan
and in Uzbekistan under sub-project ―HIV prevention in labor migrants in Central Asian countries‖
implemented by IOM.
78. Similarly to the sustainability of the RAF-funded projects, sustainability of RAF granting mechanism
depends on two key variables: 1) effectiveness and appropriateness of the grant financing tools and
procedures developed by RAF; 2) availability of donor funds and their willingness to use developed tools
and procedures.
79. In 2008, CAAP prepared and presented to EurAsEC Secretariat a set of documents, including
Agreement on establishment of the Central Asia Regional AIDS Fund under the Eurasian Economic
Community, RAF Development Concept and Charter. Discussion of this idea took place in 2008 and
2009 during different meetings of the EurAsEc Health Council. Further, this idea was transformed into a
broader initiative of developing a Regional AIDS Strategy first, with the assumption that if the latter is
approved and implemented, it would naturally lead to the need of developing a financing mechanism for
its implementation. Thus, CAAP initiated discussions among partners about priority areas for the
Regional AIDS Strategy, which was finalized in 2009 and approved by the Health Council of EurAsEC.
The Regional AIDS Strategy contains a list of key priority areas that should be considered by all
stakeholders working with HIV in the region. Implementation of this Strategy might require provision of
grants to different AIDS-servicing organizations. Procedures developed and introduced by CAAP for its
RAF implementation can be used to ensure the process is well-documented, participatory, country-led and
transparent. Implementation of the Regional AIDS Strategy depends on the political will of the national
governments and donors. However CAAP, as the result of its second component (RAF), has provided
various partners with a ready-made tool in a form of a comprehensive RAF Operation Manual, which was
made available to all and can be applied on the national and regional level.
5. LESSONS LEARNT AND RECOMMENDATIONS
80. Taking into consideration the fact that this is the first regional project of such nature, overall
implementation of CAAP is considered satisfactory. There is a very positive impact and many project
participants remained satisfied with the project. Project is expected to have its full impact on the
beneficiary level in coming years as major activities were carried out in the recent two years. However




                                                                                                        53
there were several obstacles and difficulties in project implementation that could serve as lessons learnt,
leading to some recommendations for future projects.
81. The project development objectives (PDO) have been identified in participatory manner prior to the
start of implementation in 2003-2005 during the consultations between IDA and Central Asian countries
on the design of the project. Inability to predict the character of HIV epidemic and its potential growth in
the region and globally, resulted in unrealistic planning of the project’s expected results. Thus, the
original specific objectives of the project included reduction of growth rate of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Based on the fact that this objective cannot be fulfilled within given time-frame and financial resources,
as well as based on the global picture of the epidemic development, all involved parties understood that
changes needed to be introduced into the PDO. Project performance was not rated satisfactory for the first
three consecutive years of implementation mainly due to this incongruence. Only in 2009, with the new
World Bank team leader on board, Project restructuring took place and PDO was changed as outlined in
Section 4 above.
Recommendation: in future, the preparation team of the Bank, its respective partners and counterparts
should be careful in formulating development objectives of projects. Just relying on track trends in the
growth rate of the epidemic is problematic because the incidence in some regions is based on HIV case
reporting which represents only a fraction of new infections occurring in specific area/region.
Specifically, due to low social-economic status as well as stigma and discrimination surrounding
HIV/AIDS, it is common for members of the groups most at risk of HIV to avoid medical and social
services, including HIV testing, so that the official data tend to downplay the scale of the epidemic. Thus,
the baseline parameter for this PDO was likely to be underestimated.
82. Late establishment of RPMU was another factor that delayed some of the activities. Although the
Development Grant Agreement between the World Bank and the Recipient signed in May 2005 foresaw
the establishment of the RPMU, the RPMU was actually established in March 2006 and its legal status
was certified in December 2006 when the Government of Kazakhstan ratified the host agreement signed
between Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan and RPMU.
Recommendations: given that in many parts of the region bureaucratic practices inherited from the Soviet
time still exists, in starting up of similar project the Recipient and the Bank should be careful in
identifying the conditions of the project effectiveness. An accurate action plan should be developed and
Bank needs to regularly monitor implementation of the action plan. Although, it is recognized that
Recipient/Borrower remains responsible for timely start up of any projects, Bank team in their best
capacity should guide the Recipient/Borrower’s project team in speeding up the start up process and
when necessary, the obstacles arising in the course of project start up should be conveyed to the
Governments by the Bank at the highest possible level.
83. Challenges in collaboration with UNDP arose in the early years of project implementation, but the
situation improved substantially later, particularly on the 5th year of project implementation. Given that it
was first experience of its kind for UNDP in terms of implementation of a regional project in Central Asia
and the fact that UNDP did not have a regional (sub-regional) office in Central Asia, it had to develop
new mechanism to provide support to CAAP on the regional level. Regional office of UNDP in Slovakia
designated Kazakhstan country office as lead office, which was responsible for coordinating other three
independent UNDP country offices in the project countries. The problems started to arise when the latter
country offices could not follow agreed deadlines, and reporting quality was in some cases poor.
84. While RPMU had formal communication relationship with Lead office that was responsible for
consolidating reports, the lead office could not control adequately its colleagues in neighbouring country
offices because of fact that neighbouring country offices were basically in the same level with lead office
in terms of their formal legal status, duties and obligations. All four countries were formally accountable
in front of UNDP regional office in Bratislava. In addition, the key project advisor appointed by UNDP



                                                                                                          54
was located in Moscow, Russian Federation, that further hindered collaboration and communication
between RPMU and UNDP, and within UNDP system as well.
85. In addition, UNDP faced with challenges in adopting its reporting system to the requirements of the
CAAP, which was basically drawn up to meet World Bank standards and requirements. The ATLAS
system of project management of the UNDP differs substantially from that of World Bank standards. This
matter mainly concerned financial management and reporting.
Recommendations: careful attention should be paid during the phase of project design, particularly when
there are activities to be outsourced to a third party as fiduciary agent. Due consideration should be
given to the experience of the fiduciary agent to run regional project, its internal arrangements with its
peer agencies and most importantly the ability of the fiduciary agent to adopt to the standards and/or
satisfy World Bank’s requirements.
86. Poor design of the collaboration between World Bank, Regional Steering Committee and EurAsEC
could be another factor of poor project performance in early years of project implementation. Although
RSC who was responsible for supervising and coordinating the CAAP, it was the EurAsEC who was
ultimately accountable in front of the World Bank, because EurAsEC was the principal Recipient of the
Grant, who signed the legal agreement. The lack of clear identification of the relationship between RSC
and EurAsEC led to some confusion in respect to making decisions on the project implementation.
Recommendations: it is highly recommended that project steering committee has clearly identified
relationship with the project principal recipient, either through recipient’s representation in the board of
steering committee or through clearly documented procedures describing interactions between principal
recipient and steering committee and/or executive agency, whereby in the latter case, necessary steps
should be taken to fully protect the interest of the principal recipient, as it is the principal recipient who is
accountable to the donor.
87. Details of challenges project faced in terms of implementation are reflected in independent evaluation
of CAAP project management and structure by international consultant. Nevertheless, most of the above
issues were addressed effectively along the project implementation period and basically were eliminated
by 2010 due to extensive experience gained and efforts of key project stakeholders.
88. Lessons learnt, particularly on management side, laid a proper foundation for One Health project that
was started up quickly and implemented efficiently and effectively. One of the key factors was adopting
Project Implementation Agreement between RPMU and EurAsEC that clearly identified roles and
responsibilities of each party involved in the project.
6. CONCLUSION
89. Frequently, value added of the regional approach is not fully recognized or is misunderstood.
Experience from CAAP presents a valuable resource for other regional initiatives and there are a number
of advantages and values that regional approach can bring to implementation of national programs. In
light of the aforementioned, the following arguments can be advanced to support regional activities in
response to the epidemic of HIV infection :
•    Regional approach provides framework to raise issues that would be very difficult to address from
     within specific country due to political and technical constraints. Regional approach provides
     opportunities for peer pressure for policy change, harmonization of policies and enhances policy
     dialogue.
90. It is not possible to separate public health programs and political developments and fragile democracy
in the region. Several countries in the region have legislation that prevents them from sending specimens
of contagious agents to WHO reference laboratories for further analysis and typization. As demonstrated
through CAAP, for example, with injection safety research and seminars, or with parliamentarian
meetings that resulted in positive legislative changes, public health issues that might be considered even


                                                                                                              55
as national security threats are addressed at regional level resulting in harmonization of policies and
further enhancements of preventive measures.
91. The design of CAAP was unique and complex. This is the first regional initiative in the area of HIV
prevention that has involved a wide group of stakeholders in the implementation on a regional level. This
initiative was able to function due to the strong commitment of governments of the Central Asia Region
to address this area of health. It also pioneered the use of a political umbrella organization Eurasian
Economic Community to create an enabling environment for implementation of HIV prevention programs
in the region.
92. The project has succeeded in a number of areas including institutionalizing the HIV sentinel
surveillance, improving legal framework on HIV, platform for partners’ discussion, establishing a variety
of training opportunities in the region, financing harm reduction programs, capacity building of local
AIDS service providers, service delivery to population at high risks and others. The implementation of the
project set the regional platform for the public health interventions in the region and can be considered as
a successful pilot. Implementation of the CAAP was followed by the Central Asia One Health project that
was implemented through the existing arrangements with improvements in the management arrangements
that were based on the lessons learnt during the implementation of CAAP.
