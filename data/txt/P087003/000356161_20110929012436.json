The\n            extension is necessary to allow the Regional Project\n            Management Unit (RPMU) to arrange for transfer of physical\n            assets (vehicles, computer and office equipment) and project\n            files. This is a somewhat sensitive process given the\n            involvement of four countries in the project. An extension\n            of the grace period without an extension of the grant\n            require the Euroasian Economic Community (EAEC) to finance\n            essential RPMU staff to complete the said arrangements which\n            is not an option as EAEC does not have such funds. This is\n            the second and final extension of the Grant closing date.\n            The first extension was for nine months. Therefore, this\n            represents a cumulative extension of twelve months."}, "docdt": "2011-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
