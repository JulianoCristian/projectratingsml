                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project is extended for 9 months to disburse payments for Grants program for which most contracts finished on December 31 and invoices will be submitted only after that date and
                         to fully utilize funds envisaged from savings from the Grants Program. Grace period alone would require EAEC to finance essential RPMU staff to complete transaction during the
                         grace period which was not an option as EAEC does not have such funds as would national government have and therefore the extension of the Project was granted instead of
                         Grace period.
