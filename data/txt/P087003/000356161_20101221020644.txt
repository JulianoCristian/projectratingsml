                                    Restructuring Paper




1.     The closing date for the Central Asia AIDS Control Project, Grant No H1490 will be
extended from December 31, 2010 until September 30, 2011.

2.      The project continues to make good progress towards its objectives, with the
management, issues which had impeded implementation, now resolved. The project
objectives of "contributing to controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS in participating countries
in the Central Asia Region by establishing regional mechanisms to support national
HIV/AIDS programs" continue to be relevant and achievable. Since project was
restructured in January 2011 it continues to be rated satisfactory with good progress in
achievement of PDO. There are no outstanding audit reports.

3.     Although all funds are committed, the invoices for the Grants will only be available
after December 31, 2010 which is currently set as the closing date for the project with no
Grace Period. It is estimated that there will be some savings upon implementation of the
Grants program but the exact amount will be known only after financial reconciliation,
which is expected by February 2011.

4.      The proposed extension is necessary to: a) provide time for receipt of final
deliverables and disbursement of payments in the amount of US$2.3 million mainly for
Grants program for which most contracts will finish on December 31, 2010; and b) fully
utilize savings that will be available after the invoices for Grants will be submitted. A
Grace Period alone would require the EAEC to finance essential RPMU staff to complete
transactions for accruals which is not an option as EAEC does not have such funds (as
national government would have); therefore the extension of the Project is proposed.

5.     This will be the first extension of the project.
