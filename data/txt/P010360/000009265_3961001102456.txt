MEMORANP  AND RECOMMENDTIOQNOE  THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AMD DEVELOEN
TO THE EpEUTV  T.IRECTORS 0N THE PROPOSED SUPILEMENTAL LOAN TO
SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIMITED
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed supplemental
loan of US$60 million equivalent to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL)
is submitted for approval. The loan to SNGPL would be made to supplement Loan
3252-PAK for the Corporate Restructuring and System Expansion Project.   The
supplemental loan would be repaid on the same payment schedule as the existing
loan with interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
ENERGY SECTOR
Energj Resources
2.        Pakistan's  commercially  exploicable  energy  resources  consist  of
hydropower, natural gas, oil and coal. The hydropower potential is estimated
at about 30,000 NW.  Proven reserves of natural gas are estimated at about
19.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF).  Oil reserves, both probable and proven, are
estimated at about 58 million tons. Coal and lignite deposits are estimated at
about 900 million tons, of which 175 million tons are proven.  In addition, the
country has a large base of traditional fuels in the form of fuelwood and
agricultural and animal waste, which provide a major share of rural consumers'
energy needs. Despite its endowment of energy resources, Pakistan's dependence
on imported liquid hydrocarbons is expected to continue over the foreseeable
future, particularly in light of the long lead time and vast financial resources
required for the implementation of the major hydro projects. This dependence,
however, can be reduced by: accelerating the development of the smaller hydro
sites and of discovered oil and gas fields; encouraging the substitution of
domestic as well as imported coal for higher value petroleum products;
restraining the growth of demand through price and non-price measures, including
rehabilitation and retrofitting of power plants, refineries and energy-intensive
industries; and expanding and strengthening the imolementation capabilities of
the entities involved in the sector.
Enerv SupalXZDemand Balances
3.        The forecast of energy demand for the period 1986-2010 calls for demand
increasing at an average annual rate of about 7% up to the mid-1990s and
declining gradually thereafter to about 6%.  Although the output of domestic
energy resources especially of coal and hydropower and, to a lesser extent of
oil and gas, is forecast to increase, their share in total supply is expected
to decline relative to that of imported energy. Consequently, in order to meet
the forecast demand at least cost, the share of coal both imported and domestic
in total consumption is forecast to increase from 7X in FY88 to about 21X in
FY2O10 to substitute for higher value petroleum products and gas. Despite this,
the share of petroleum products would increase from the present level of 39% to
50%  in FY2010.    By contrast,  the  share of gas  is expected  to decline
significantly to about 12%, while given the long lead time and resources required
to develop the country's major hydro sites, the hydropower contribution to the
overall supply of energy is expected to increase only marginally to about 20%.



4.        The Long-Term Energy Strategy (LES) formulated by the Government with
the assistance of the Bank in 1985 was aimed at initiating integrated structural
reforms with the objective of accelerating and rationalizing the development of
the energy seotor (correcting distortions in energy pricing, strengthening the
institutions and increasing private sector involvement). In order to assist GOP
in implementing these reforms, a series of sector loans were envisaged by the
Bank, each in support of a monitorable core program of policy actions and
priority  investments.   The  first phase of these reforms was  implemented
successfully under the First Energy Sector Loan (ESL I) during the last three
years (FY86-88) of the Sixth Plan. Support for continuation of these reforms
is being provided under the ESL II which covers the first three years (FY89-
91) of the Seventh Plan.
Proeress under ESL II on Implementation ogf the Core Investment Program (CIP)
5.        As a first step towards rationalizing investments and minimizing the
shortfalls in energy supply, a Core Investment Program (CIP) of priority projects
was agreed to under ESL II. The sources of financing for its implementation were
identified, including potential foreign financing, as well as the contribution
of GOP through the Annual Development Plan and that of the sector entities from
their internally-generated funds. The CIP comprises ongoing and new projects
to be implemented during the first three years (H£89-91) of the Seventh Plan by
both the public and private sectors. Progress in the implementation of the CIP
for FY89 and FY90 has been satisfactory in terms of both mobilization and
allocation of these resources for the agreed priority projects.
Obiective of the Supplemental Loan
6.        The primary objective of the proposed supplemental loan is to provide
additional assistance to GOP in the continued implementation of a priority energy
sector project, included in the CIP and supported by an ongoing Bank loan, which
has been adversely affected by foreign exchange constraints due in large part
to the effect of the Gulf crisis. The proposed supplemental loan would assist
SNGPL in implementing the expansion of its infrastructure for the transmission
and distribution of gas which has been initiated under the ongoing Corporate
Restructuring and System Expansion Project (Loan 3252-PAK).
Corporate Restructuring and Svstem Expansion Proiect (Loan 3252-PAR)
Proposed Sugnlemental Loan Amount: OSS60 million
Project Description
7.        A loan to SNGPL of US$130 mill! n was approved for this project by
the Bank on August 7, 1990, and signed on October 22, 1990; it became effective
on April 12, 1991.  The objectives of the p:oject are: (i) to assist GOP in
restructuring SNGPL's equity ownership to make the utility more autonomous and
enhance its resource mobilization capacity to finance its infrastructure
development at least cost; (ii) to promote tne substitution of gas for higher
value petroleum products in the northern part of the country;j and (iii) to
strengthen SNGPL in the areas of planning, demand management and operational



maintenance.  The project has three components: (a) restructuring of SNGPL's
ownership through issuance of new equity shares to dilute public sector ownership
from 91% to not more than 40% within five years (1991-96); (b) infrastructure
development by expanding the SNGPL gas pipeline transmission and distribution
system capacity from 450 MMCFD to 800 MMCFD, as well as installing a 120 MMCFD
gas purification plant; and (c) consultancy services and training.
Pro1ect Implementation
8.        This project is being implemented by SNGPL's Project and Distribution
Departments. Technical assistance is being provided through consultant services
for the corporate restructuring of the entity, the issuance of equity shares,
and the design, construction and supervision of installation of the gas pipeline
across rivers, for which SNGPL's experience is limited.  During the period prior
to effectiveness, contracts valued at over US$10 million have been awarded for
procurement of heavy construction equipment for laying the 30-inch pipeline and
consultants to advise SNGPL on the issuance of equity shares have been appointed.
In addition, terms of reference for the appointment of consultants to develop
SNGPL's Financial Management Information System are being finalized.
'roi4ct Ctos and Financing
9.        The appraised project cost was estimated at US$443 million excluding
US$104 million for duties and taxes. The Bank loan of US$130 million to SNGPL
was to finance the direct foreign exchange costs, representing about 29X of total
project cost (net of taxes and duties).   New equity issues (US$93 million
equivalent) and local loans (US$121 million equivalent) together with SNGPL's
internally generated funds (about 203 million) were to finance the local currency
costs (including duties and taxes). About US$115 million of the Bank loan was
to be used for importing material and equipment through ICB, including US$58
million for importing portions of the high grade 30" diameter linepipe to be
used at river crossing, since the specifications for these precluded local
manufacture. It was anticipated that the rest of the linepipe (about US$120
million equivalent) would be manufactured locally using imported materials, under
reserved procurement. These costs were treated during appraisal as local and
were to be financed from local loans. The foreign exchange needed to import
steel plate for the locally manufactured linepipe was to be obtained from the
Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves.   Because of the country's severe
foreign exchange constraints, the Government and SNGPL have requested Bank's
assistance in financing imported materials (steel plates) representing about half
of the total cost of the linepipe to be locally manufactured.
Procurement and Disbursement
10.       SNGPL has initiated the procurement process for the steel plates which
will be procured by SNGPL under ICB procedures in accordance with Bank
procurement guidelines. The steel plates will be used by a prequalified company,
selected under local procurement procedures, to manufacture 30-inch diameter
linepipes. The proposed supplemental loan would finance the import of steel
plates under ICB but not the local manufacturing of linepipe.   The current
closing date is June 30, 1996, and no delays would be incurred due to the



proposed supplemental financing.   Out of the original loan, commitments for
contracts valued at about US$30 million have already been made for items other
than the steel plates, and disbursements totalling about US$10 million are to
be made shortly against expenditures eligible for retroactive financing under
the original T7an Agreement.
Financial Position of SRGPL
11.       SNGPL has been a profitable company since its inception in 1958 and
is expected to remain so over the foreseeable future.  The agreed financial
performance criteria under Loan 3252-PAK is that SNGPL would achieve a rate of
return of 17.5% on historically valued net fixed assets in use. This replaced
a rate of return on revalued assets requirement under early Bank loans to SNGPL,
which encountered difficulties in arranging for proper evaluation of fixed
assets. In addition, SNGPL has agreed not to incur any additional debt, without
prior consultation with the Bank, if after the incurrence of such debt, the
debt/equity ratio would be greater than 70:30. These covenants are applicable
for FY91 onwards and preliminary assessment of SNGPL's performance in FY91
indicates that SNGPL will achieve the covenanted performance due, inter alia,
to: (a) increased sales, particularly to industrial and power consumers; and
(b) increases in the price of gas supplied, amounting to 15% for industry and
power, and 17.7% for residential gas consumers.
Justification for Su&lemental Loan
12.       Due to the deterioration in the country's foreign exchange situation
exacerbated by the Gulf crisis, the Central Bank's ability to provide all the
foreign exchange required to import the steel plates has been severely
constrained. SNGPL has, therefore, requested a supplemental loan to finance
the full foreign exchange component of the cost for the 30" linepipe. SNGPL
would import the steel plates and would have them manufactured locally into
linepipes under SNGPL's specifications satisfactory to the Bank. The cost of
the imported steel plates is estimated at US$60 million equivalent, and would
be financed from the proceeds of the proposed supplemental loan to Ln. 3252-
PAK. The cost of local manufacturing would be borne by SNGPL. While the project
cost will not change, the supplemental Bank loan of US$60 million would raise
the Bank share in project financing to 431 and substitute for part (about 501)
of the originally planned local loans. The 251 rate of return calculated for
the project remains unchanged. SNGPL and the Government are in compliance with
all the existing covenants under the Loan Agreement.
Risk
13.       The risk of delay in the procurement of the steel plates has been
addressed by the fact that SNGPL has already initiated the procurement procedures
for these plates in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Furthermore, the selection
of the local manufacturing company to manufacture the plates into linepipes has
already been made. Bank staff have visited the pipeline company's manufacturing
facilities' and found them satisfactory.

Rationale for Bank Involvement in the Pxoposed Suwplemental Loan
14.       The project being financed by the ongoing loan, is entering a critical
phase in terms of activities scheduling, whereby procurement action (either in
contractor prequalification or financial payments to contractors) must be
maintained to avoid severe delays in project implementation.   It is in this
context that the request for a supplemental loan to the ongoing Bank loan has
been requested by GOP and SNGPL. Moreover, the recent Gulf crisis has exerted
increased pressure on Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves, which recently fell
to a level equivalent to less than two weeks imports. For 1991, the negative
foreign exchange impact due to the Gulf crisis is tentatively estimated at about
US$450 million.   Given this deterioration in the external account, special
assistance in the form of the proposed supplemental loan would be justified.
This supplement would respond to the current resource constraints Pakistan is
facing and safeguard the timely completion of project components which are
critical to meeting the demand for supply of natural gas in the country.
Agreements Reached
15.       It has been agreed with SNGPL that a proposed supplemental loan to Loan
3252-PAK would be made under the same terms and conditions as the original Loan.
16.       Furthermore, it was agreed with GOP and SNGPL that the existing Loan
Agreement for the Corporate Restructuring and System Expansion Project (Loan
3252-PAK) would be modified to reflect the supplemental loan and that in
Schedule 1 of the Agreement the allocation under Category 1 for materials and
equipment would be increased from US$120 million to US$180 million.
Recommendation
17.       I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental loan complies with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.  I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed supplemental loan.
