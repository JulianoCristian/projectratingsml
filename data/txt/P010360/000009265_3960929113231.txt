MEMORANDM  AN! RECOkEUNDAION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANM YOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEmELOPMENT
TO THE tYRUTIV  TARiCTO
ON A PROPOSED LAN
TO SUX NOTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIUTED (SNOPAK. PAXISTAN
FOR A CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING AND SYSTEM mxpASION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to Sui
Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (SNGPL), a semi-autonomous gas transmission and
distribution entity in Pakistan, for US$130 million equivalent is submitted for
approval.   The Islamic Republic of Pakistan would be the guarantor of the
proposed loan.  The loan would be at the Bank's stanckrd variable interest rate,
and repayable over twenty years including a five-year grace period. It would
assist in restructuring the ownership and management of SNGPL and in expanding
the utility's transmission and distribution capacity.
Backgroun
2.        In 1985, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) formulated with assistance
from the Bank a Long-Term Energy Strategy (LES), aimed at addressing the major
issues affecting the development of the sector.  Support for initiating the
process of structural reforms called for by LES was provided in 1985 under the
Energy Sector Loan I (ESL I, Loan 2552-PAK). The objectives of ESL I have been
achieved fully and GOP is continuing this process with Bank support under ESL
II which, inter al", is aimed at: eliminating budgetary support for revenue
earning public enterprises in favor of prudent direct borrowing in capital
markets; rationalizing investments in the public sector to ensure that priority
projects are implemented within the resources available to the public sector,
and to supplement these through appropriate incentives and a framework to enable
the private sector to assume a more prominent role in the development of energy.
3.        Natural gas is Pakistan's main commercially exploitable hydrocarbon
resource with proven and probable reserves of about 16 and 6.3 trillion cubic
feet, respectively. However, its share in the overall consumption of energy has
declined and shortages of gas have persisted since 1981. This is mainly due to
inadequacies in the Government's pricing policies which failed to restrain the
growth of demand and encourage public and private producers to increase their
output of gas. As these shortages were inducing consumers to shift to higher
value petroleum products which, in turn, were absorbing the country's scarce
foreign exchange resources, GOP agreed under ESL I to rationalize the consumption
and supply of gas. On the demand side, the consumer price of gas has been
increased six times since 1981.  On the supply side, a new gas producer pricing
formula was adopted in 1985 which links the well-head price of gas to two-thirds
the border price of fuel oil. The private sector, both local and foreign, has
responded favorably and 21 new onshore concessions have already been signed.
In addition, satisfactory progress in the implementation of the Core Investment
Program agreed under ESL I and ESL II has increased gas reserves by about 4.6
trillion cubic feet and has enabled the Oil and Gas Development Corporation
(OGDC) to accelerate the development of the Pirkoh and Loti gas fields, output
from which can be increased by about 200 MMCFD in a relatively short time. This
gas can be made available to final consumers in the northern part of the coun;ry
to correct the imbalance between supply and demand, but would require an
expansion of SNGPL's transmission and distribution capacity.
4.        The Bank's involvement with SNGPL began in 1964, the year it became a
public limited company under the Companies Act.   Since then, the Bank has



2-
assisted SNGPL through a series of five loans. While these operations have
contributed significantly to the expansion of SNGPLs operations and the
strengthening of its institutional capability, it also became evident during
their implementation that the autonomy granted to SNGPL under the Companies Act
was not gaining hold because of the continued concentration of SNCPL's ownership
in the hands of GOP and government-owned institutions and has resulted in GOP
exercising substantial control over the management and operations of the company.
This situation is being addressed in the proposed Project through agreements
concerning the dilution of GOP's ownership and control initially, to be followed
by majority shareholding by the private sector and management arrangements which
reflect it.   A second major feedback from the completed projects is the
difficulty of enforcing a rate of return covenant based on revalued assets in
operation. Because of continuing non-compliance with the covenant, the Bank has
agreed, until a new pricing formula is developed, to substitute under the
proposed Proiect, a new covenant which would require SNGPL to achieve a rate of
return of 17.51 on SNGPL's fixed assets and also limit the Gas Development
Surcharge, which together would yield results comparable to those under the old
covenant.
Project Objectives
5.       The objectives of the proposed Project are to:  (a) assist GOP in
restructuring SNGPL's equity ownership to make the utility more autonomous and
anhance its resource mobilization capability by ftnabling it to tap new sources
of finatncing; (b) expand SNGPL's infrastructure for purification, transmission
and distribution of gas at least cost; (c) promote the substitution of gas for
higher value petroleum products in the northern part of the country; (d)
rationalitze the consumption and supply of gas through pricing and demand
management; and (e) strengthen SNGPL's capabilities in long-term planning,
project implementation, inventory control, operation and maintenance, and safety.
Pxoiect Description
6.       The proposed Project would include three components:   Corporate
Restructuring of SNGPL, Infrastructure Development, and Consultancy Services and
Training. CorRorate Restructuring of SNGPL would involve: (a) restructuring
of SNGPL's ownership through issuance of new additional equity shares to dilute
public sector ownership initially from 911 to 511, and subsequently to at most
401; (b) restructuring SNGPL's Board of Directors to reflect the new
shareholding; (c) establishing financial performance criteria to improve its
efficiency and ability to raise equity; and (d) reviewing the regulatory
functions of the Directorate General of Gas.  Infrastructure Devel2Rm=  would
provide for: (a) installation of a 1 x 120 M)CFD gas purification plant at Sui;
(b) expansion of the transmission system capacity by about 300 NKCFD; (c)
expansion of the distribution network to supply natural gas by FY96 to new
domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers, two fertilizer plants and the
power station at Kot Addu; (d) installation of a linepipe coating plant; (e)
installation of a telecommunication system for monitoring the operations of the
network; and (f) procurement of rompressors and construction equipment required
for the installation of the linepipe. Consultancy Services and Training would
cover:   (a) safety and hazard assessment survey of the transmission and
distribution system; (b) upgrading the capability of the. Directorate General of
Gas, and training of SNGPL staff through a collaborative arrangement with a
foreign private gas utility; (c) development of SNGPL's financial management
information systems and data processing and training in internal auditing of
computerized accounting systems; (d) designing the new formula for setting



-3
SNGPL's prices net of the Gas Development Surcharge, and performance criteria;
(e) services of financial advisers and an underwriter or consortium of
underwriters'to manage the issuance of shares; and (f) design, engineering and
supervision of high pressure pipeline construction at river crossings.   The
project, to be carried out over a period of si'L years, provides funds for the
procurement of equipment and materials for the construction of the high pressure
linepipes, including compressors, SCADA system, gas purification plant and a
linepipe coating plant; training, technical assistance and consultancy services.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$546.5 million equivalent with
a foreign exchange component of US$129.9 million (24X). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map (IBRD No. 20961R1) is attached. Also attached is the Staff Appraisal Report
No. 7407-PAK dated July 12, 1990.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
7.        The proposed Project fits into the overall framework of the ESL II,
which identifies pr: rity investments and policy reforms to be implemented during
the period FY89-93.   It would assist GOP in reducing the fiscal deficit to
sustain the economy's growth momentum and control inflation as provided in the
macro-economic framework agreed with the IMF and the Bank, and enhancing the role
of the private sector in energy development. The Bank's support for this Project
is to be viewed in the context of its continuing economy-wide role in promoting
both privatization and corporate. restructuring of revenue-earning entities, and
in assisting GOP in mobilizing financing from the private sector.
Summary of Agreements and Recommendations
8.        GOP has agreed to:   (a) annually increase the price of gas to
households so as to reach full parity with the border price of fuel oil by June
30, 1993; (b) annually increase the development surcharge on the sale of gas to
power producers so that by June 30, 1995 the price of such gas, inciuding such
development surcharge shall achieve full parity with the domestic price of fuel
oil less discounts for the gas transmission investments made by the power
producers; (c) contirue to maintain the price of gas supplied as fuel by the gas
transmission and distribution companies to the industrial, power and commercial
sectors at least at full parity with the domestic price of fuel oil; (d) a a
means of diluting its ownership of SNGPL, initially reduce its direct  - I
indirect shareholding in SNGPL to not more than 51% by June 30, 1991 through the
issuance of 57.5 million new equity shares; (e) thereafter not purchase or
otherwise acquire directly or indirectly, any additional new equity shares to
be issued by SNGPL during the life of the project, if its direct and indirect
shareholding in SNGPL will exceed 40X; (f) undertake not later than October 31,
1991, and complete not later than March 31, 1992, a study, under terms of

achieved.
9.        GOP and SNGPL have agreed to: (a) implement all, measures necessary to
enable SNGPL in each fiscal year to: (i) earn a rate of return of at least 17.5X
on net fixed assets in service valued at historical cost; and (ii) set the Gas
Development Surcharge at not more than 321 of the gross revenue from gas salts
to consumers in FY92 and at not more than 281 thereafter.
10.       SNGPL has agreed to:  (a) provide, not later than December 31, 1990,
evidence satisfactory to the Bank that it has obtained all necessary consents
and clearances for the marketing of the new equity shares; (b) appoint not later

to the Bank, to prepare the detailed design,  ngineering and supervision of The
high pressure pipeline across rivers Ravi and Sutlej; (i) complete the plan for
distribution of gas to new towns and, in consultation with GOP, establish, not
later than June 30, 1991, criteria satisfactory to the Bank, for the ranking and
selection of the new towns to be connected; (j) take all necessary actions to
commence not later than December 31, 1990, the process of acquisition of the land

SNGPL's staff in computer auditing, and to submit the completed studies and
recommendations and an implementation plan to the Bank, no later than June 30,
1992. The auditor's annual reports will cover, besides the annual accounts, the
special account and all statements of expenditure on the basis of which
withdrawals are made for the Project.
11.       The following would be set as conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed  Loan:    (a)  appointment  by  SNGPL  of  financial  advisers,  whose
qualifications, experience and terms of reference are satisfactory to the Bank,
to manage and implement measures for raising the required resources through



equity issues and loans; (b) submission of evidence of concluded loan agreements
totalling Rs 1.5 billion with local institutions;  (c) approval of the PC-1
document  by  ECNEC;  and  (d)  submission  of  evidence  that  the  gm-forma
Environmental Impact Assessment of the Project has been approved by the Pakistan
Environmental Protection Agency.
Benefits
12.       The proposed Project would assist GOP in restructuring SNGPL with a
view to increasing its autonomy and ability to mobilize resources from the
financial capital markets and the general public, as well as expanding the
utility's transr.ission and distribution network at least cost. Specific benefits
under the proposed Project are expected from:   (a) increased private sector
investment in SNGPL, which would be supportive of GOP's filcal reforms by
restraining the growth of public debt; (b) incremental sales of gas to new
consumers; (c) incremental consumer investment contributions; and (d)
substitution of gas for higher value petroleum products which, at the margin,
are imported.
Risks
13.       The main risks associated with the proposed Project are:  (a) inability
of SNGPL to raise the required financial resources from the capital markets;
(b) delays in the implementation of the proposed Project because of its
relatively large size compared to past investments undertaken by SNGPL; (c) a
decline in the productivity of the gas fields to a level lower than forecast;
and (d) environmental impact from possible gas leakages. These risks are being
addressed through the provision of:  (a) professional services of a financial
adviser and underwriters to assist SNGPL in managing the marketing of equity
shares in the domestic capital mwrket;   (b) consultancy servicss for the
engineering, design and supervision of the construction of the high pressure
pipelines and the establishment of a collaborative arrangement with an
experienced foreign private sector utility to assist SNGPL in project
implementation, as well as train its staff in pipeline operation and maintenance
and establishment of adequate safety measures, including the installation of a
new SCADA system to monitor gas flows and detect faults along the system; and
(c) technical assistance and consultancy services under ESL II for the
development of the Loti field, and also under Pirkoh III Development Project,
financed by the Asian Development Bank, for the development of the Pirkoh field,
and assistance to OGDC, under the proposed Domestic Resources Development
Project, for the accelerated development of new gas fields.
Recommendation
14.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Direct3rs approve the
proposed loan.
