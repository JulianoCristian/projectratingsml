implementation of the Ghana\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), in line with the 2004\n            Country Assistance Strategy. The operation will continue to\n            focus on three broad components of the poverty reduction\n            agenda organized under: (1) the promotion of growth, income\n            and employment; (2) improvements in the delivery of services\n            for human development; and (3) the strengthening of\n            governance and public sector management. While the PRSC-3\n            support would translate primarily into funding for the\n            implementation of the GPRS, particular attention is given to\n            policy dialogue and to monitoring resource allocation and\n            outcomes. The proposed PRSC-3 would also pay attention to\n            welfare and poverty indicators that allow an assessment of\n            whether poverty reduction objectives (including income and\n            non-income dimensions of poverty) are being achieved."}, "docdt": "2005-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
