and, assist the Government to\n            complete selected analytical work on policy reforms.\n            Therefore, project components will: 1) provide TA in\n            implementing reforms of the Municipal Financial Management\n            Bill/Act, which prescribes budgeting, accounting, and\n            financial reporting systems, with reforms implemented\n            through a three-phase process. Implementation of additional\n            reforms, such as regulatory reforms to encourage the\n            development of municipal finance markets, and for reforms in\n            intergovernmental fiscal transfer programs will be\n            addressed; 2) design, and implement a municipal sector\n            monitoring, and early warning system, through an active\n            transformation of corporate structures; and, 3) assist with\n            additional policy reforms in the municipal sector, for\n            accessing resources, ensuring provision of basic services,\n            particularly for the poor. Moreover, policy formulation will\n            focus on strategies, and institutional design, linking these\n            reforms to appropriate management and regulation, to finally\n            address financing of the overall strategy.
