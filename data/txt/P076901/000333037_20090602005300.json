were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            capacity building of local government officials in a clearly\n            determined reform area through mentoring and on-the-job\n            inputs by resident international experts is a viable\n            strategy. To be successful, such an approach requires that\n            the level of expertise and experience of the international\n            experts substantially exceeds that of the national staff.\n            Regular feedback from staff being mentored on the quality of\n            inputs provided by international experts is essential to\n            maintain confidence and forward movement. Furthermore\n            mentorship as a modality for building capacity is a sound\n            approach to ensure that skills are transferred and for\n            sustainability of project achievements. In middle income\n            country (MIC) where financial resources are not a priority\n            for the Government but technical assistance or specialized\n            expertise is in demand, lending can be a point of access for\n            the Bank's knowledge resources. The process to conclude\n            technical assistance support may need to be re-examined. The\n            Bank may need to differentiate between countries that have\n            project management capabilities from those with limited\n            management capacity."}, "docdt": "2008-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
