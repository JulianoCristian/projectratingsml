form of electricity to rural customers who cannot be\n            served economically or in a timely manner by conventional\n            rural electrification; (2) to facilitate private sector\n            participation in advancing renewable energy\n            commercialization; (3) to promote environmentally sound\n            energy resource development in Indonesia and reduce the\n            energy sector's dependence on fossil fuels; and (4) to\n            strengthen Indonesia's institutional capacity to\n            support and sustain decentralized rural electrification\n            using solar photovoltaics. The project's global\n            environmental objective is to mitigate carbon dioxide\n            emissions in Indonesia. The penetration of SHS will reduce\n            these emissions by displacing the use of fossil fuels. The\n            project consists of two major components: (1) a credit\n            component comprising an IBRD loan and a GEF grant, to enable\n            purchase of solar home systems by rural households and\n            commercial establishments on an installment plan basis; and\n            (2) technical assistance, including support of detailed\n            monitoring and evaluation activities during project implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
