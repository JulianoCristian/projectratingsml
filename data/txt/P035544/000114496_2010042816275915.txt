Dear Mr. Minister:
Re:
GEF TF 028488-IND (Solar Home Systems Project)
Further Amendment to the Grant Agreement
We refer to the Grant Agreement (Solar Home Systems Project) between the 
Republic of Indonesia (the Recipient) and the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (the Bank) dated March 11, 1997, and the Amending Letter dated May 28, 
2001.
It has come to the Bank’s attention that the reference to the province of Banten 
was omitted from the amendment to Section 1.02 (o) of the Grant Agreement.
Therefore, such Section 1.02 (o) is hereby further amended to read as follows:
"Section 1.02. (o) "Project Area" means the Recipient’s provinces of 
Banten, Lampung, South Sulawesi and West Java, together with any Kabupaten 
which is immediately contiguous to any of such provinces, and any other rural 
areas within the territory of the Recipient as may be agreed between the 
Recipient and the Bank."
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing and dating the 
enclosed duplicate of this letter in the space provided, and by returning it to us.
Yours sincerely,
By /s/ Vikram K. Nehru
Acting Country Director, Indonesia
