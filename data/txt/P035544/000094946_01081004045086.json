Furthermore, institutional\n            development impacts are high, while the proactive actions by\n            the project team, superior project supervision, and, the\n            Government's collaborative approach to project\n            preparation deemed highly satisfactory, and satisfactory\n            performance ratings for the Bank, and Borrower,\n            respectively. Lessons underline that market-based projects\n            should provide broad scope for companies to adjust product\n            lines, and business models, to meet changing market signals,\n            while significant market entry support for firms, as well as\n            performance based grants that scale down over time, are\n            necessary. Nonetheless, the convincing end-user audit\n            program, and transparent grant releases, encouraged dealers\n            to participate in the project, and follow the consumer\n            protection requirements, encouraging participating dealers\n            to learn and market efforts on rural consumers.\n            Consequently, upstream, and monitoring support to financial\n            organizations is necessary to increase sector knowledge,\n            given that the high costs of market entry that confront\n            dealers, are mirrored by the costs confronted by\n            organizations that would finance them. Hence, dealer\n            performance information, may reduce transaction costs of\n            financial institutions, and partially lower barriers to\n            financing SHS dealers, and, a cross sectoral approach\n            focused on both the consumer, and institutional photovoltaic\n            markets, provides greater potential for sustained\n            development impacts."}, "docdt": "2001-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
