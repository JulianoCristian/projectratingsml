(i)\n            tourism development projects, mostly hotels, financed by CIH\n            under loans to be made until end 1983; (ii) a cost benefit\n            study on tourism investments, to be carried out by the\n            Ministry of Tourism (MOT) and CIH with the assistance of\n            consultants; the study would represent the third and last\n            phase of a program of studies, the two first phases of which\n            were carried out under a UNDP project with the World Tourism\n            Organization as executing agency; and (iii) a training\n            program for CIH staff to improve and computerize further its\n            appraisal of tourism investments. Up to $600,000 of the\n            proposed loan of $100 million would be made available for\n            the cost benefit studies if required (the studies may be\n            financed under a new UNDP project), and up to $400,000 for\n            training of CIH staff. The benefits to be derived from the\n            project are several: net foreign exchange generation of $128\n            million per year in 1980 prices by 1987; 21,000 new jobs,\n            direct or indirect; and net fiscal revenues of at least DH80\n            million per year initially, growing to about DH149 million\n            after five to ten years."}, "docdt": "1980-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
