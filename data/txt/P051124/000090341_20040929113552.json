The lessons learned indicate that the water\n            and sanitation sector was more difficult to privatize and\n            introduce market-oriented reforms because people consider\n            the provision of water at low (or even negligible) prices to\n            be a basic right. The establishment of a credible, stable\n            and efficient regulatory system is a long-term activity that\n            will have its ups and downs as any process of institution\n            building. Another relevant lesson is that the importance of\n            policy-making in the context of market-oriented reforms have\n            been underemphasized. A positive lesson is related to the\n            importance of competition. The main source of price\n            reductions in telecommunications was probably related to a\n            more competitive environment -either because technological\n            conditions were more favorable than in other industries or\n            because monopoly rights assigned through concessions did not\n            last as long. Finally, multi-sector Technical Assistance\n            (TA) projects are expensive and almost always take longer to\n            implement than anticipated. In particular, allowances need\n            to be made for: (i) the project unit becoming familiar with\n            Bank procedures; (ii) the heavy workload of implementing\n            many small components (about 40 in this project); and (iii)\n            prolonged transitions between administrations."}, "docdt": "2004-08-03T00:00:00Z"}
