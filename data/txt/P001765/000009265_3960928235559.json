(a)\n            reverse the decline in production and marketing of cashew\n            nuts and restore exports to their levels of the seventies;\n            (b) make small- and medium-scale agricultural enterprises\n            more efficient and profitable; and (c) strengthen local\n            capacity to formulate and implement long-term growth\n            strategies for the irrigation and cashew subsectors.  The\n            project components include: (a) rehabilitation and\n            development of the cashew subsector; (b) assistance to\n            agricultural enterprises; and (c) specific subsectoral\n            studies and surveys.  Under the first component, financing\n            will be provided for: (a) equipment, incremental costs and\n            technical assistance to agricultural extension, research,\n            and cashew nut nurseries and to the state secretariat; (b)\n            investment credit to commercial farmers and traders and for\n            cashew processing factories.  Because women play a dominant\n            role in agriculture and cashew marketing, a survey will be\n            carried out to assess factors determining the agricultural\n            productivity of women and measures to be taken to enhance\n            benefits accruing to them.  Under the second component,\n            financing for technical assistance, incremental costs, and\n            equipment will be provided to develop a capacity within the\n            Ministry of Agriculture to address the rehabilitation needs\n            of agricultural enterprises and provide them with managerial\n            and planning assistance and training.
