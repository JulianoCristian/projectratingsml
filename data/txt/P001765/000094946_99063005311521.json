It\n            was successful in establishing extension networks for\n            restoring Government agricultural services, and\n            contributions were made to sector and sub-sector planning,\n            namely, on reform analysis for cashew processing and\n            marketing. Nevertheless, poor project design, and, limited\n            and delayed implementation, coupled with failed production\n            objectives, hindered success. Furthermore, minimal progress\n            was achieved in reversing development constraints for both,\n            producers and processors. The key lessons convey that\n            projects should provide a platform to support policy\n            reforms, particularly in countries where macroeconomic and\n            agricultural policies are not in place. Project success\n            cannot be guaranteed without effective implementation of\n            policy frameworks, which would prod disbursement of project\n            funds. Consideration to technical assistance, training and\n            research, require priority design, to restore production\n            constraints in the agricultural sub-sector, and, be in tune\n            with the overall institutional capacity. Hence, fundamental\n            actions/activities for project development, need to be\n            incorporated in project design to ensure accountability, and\n            be responsive to the prevailing context. Timely provision of\n            counterpart funds is essential, particularly for\n            agricultural operations; thus projects require an\n            appropriate scale, and a proactive management to achieve sustainability."}, "docdt": "1999-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
