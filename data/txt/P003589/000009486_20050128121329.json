In\n            1996, the year that the Chinese government launched its\n            National Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) Safe\n            Injection Plan for 1997-2000, only 30 percent of all\n            injections were provided according to the national injection\n            standard of one sterile syringe and one sterile needle for\n            each injection. The Government of China, with assistance\n            from its development partners, has made great strides in\n            improving injection safety. The MOH has issued regulations\n            regarding the safe disposal of medical waste, including\n            injection materials for both immunization and other health\n            (therapeutic) services. However, even today, use of\n            non-sterile syringes, re-use of syringes, and unsafe\n            disposal of syringes is not uncommon. Current financial\n            incentives lead public health facilities to neglect less\n            profitable preventive health care services, in general and\n            injection safety in particular. In order to address this\n            problem, the government should consider: (i) separate\n            accounting systems for free immunization services and\n            for-profit preventive care to assure appropriate use of\n            public monies. The Government needs to clearly define the\n            responsibility of public health care providers and regulate\n            the allocation of public funds. Most importantly, EPI funds\n            should not be used for the provision of for-profit health\n            care; and (ii) establishing a specific fund for the\n            purchase, distribution, and safe disposal of injection\n            material for immunization services. If carefully regulated,\n            such a fund would motivate health care providers to properly\n            use and dispose of injection materials."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
