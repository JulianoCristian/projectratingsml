vaccine-preventable\n            diseases to reduce morbidity, disability and mortality,\n            especially in the poorest provinces of China. This will be\n            carried out by improving the immunization services and by\n            introducing policy measures to improve vaccine quality and\n            to ensure access of all population groups, and to add new\n            vaccines to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI); and\n            2) improve the capacity of the health sector to design and\n            implement health promotion programs to prevent and control\n            the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs),\n            sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/human immunodeficiency\n            virus (HIV) and injury. This will be accomplished through\n            policy and institutional improvements and by implementing\n            pilot programs, including surveillance, staff training,\n            health education and other health promotion interventions,\n            at selected locations. The project comprises three main\n            components: 1) immunization, which consists of four\n            sub-components: (a) cold chain improvement; (b) health\n            workers' training; (c) management and surveillance; and\n            (d) information, education and communication; 2) health\n            promotion, which will comprise the following sub-components:\n            (a) institutional development and policy reform; (b) human\n            resources development; (c) surveillance, especially\n            behavioral risk factor surveillance; and (d) community-based\n            interventions; and 3) the national-level programs."}, "docdt": "1995-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
