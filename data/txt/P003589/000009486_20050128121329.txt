following impressions were gathered from          proportion of health facilities using the
those studies:                                    boiling method for disinfection was higher
                                                  than in urban areas in general. In Shanxi

      no cohort studies available for             health facilities studied used the boiling
      mapping changes over time in the            method in 1998. In Wulong county of
      type of syringe used, it seems that         Chongqing City, nearly 80% of health
      reusable    (glass)   syringes    are       facilities still used the boiling method for
      increasingly   being   replaced   by        syringe disinfection in 2002. In a study of
      disposable syringes. In Anhui, a            five western provinces in 2000, more than
      mid-income province, 12% of rural           20% of health facilities wiped the needles
      health facilities in the study used         with an alcohol solution while more than
      only disposable syringes in 1996. In        10% of health facilities disinfected the
      Shaanxi, a poorer province, 21% of          needles by washing them with water.
      rural health facilities used only

      provinces used a higher proportion          proportion of      disposable syringes and
      of disposable syringes than less            needles. However, there was no report on
      wealthy provinces during the same           burial after     burning. It was noted that
      time period. In 1999, the study in          more than 80% of health facilities studied
      Liaoning reported that 80% of               in Gansu, and nearly 26% of health
      health facilities were using only           facilities studied in Liaoning, simply threw
      disposable        syringes        for       away disposable injection material after
      immunization services, while Gansu,         use, without taking any measures to
      a poorer western province, reported         disinfect and destroy material (1999).
      only 3% of health facilities using          Studies in 2000 reported an increase in the
      disposable        syringes        for       proportion of disposable injection material
      immunization programs; and                  that was buried. Recycling was also seen
                                                  in about 20% of township health facilities
      Wider use of disposable syringes for        in the five western provinces. In 2001 and
      immunization services. In most of           2002, the studies in Henan and Wulong of
      the studies that included both              Chongqing        indicated   that   a    high
      immunization      and     therapeutic       proportion of health facilities in rural areas
      services, disposable syringes were          threw away disposable injection materials.
      far more likely to be used for
      immunization services than for
