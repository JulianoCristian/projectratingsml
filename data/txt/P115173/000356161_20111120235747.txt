       Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
       The Project Development Objectives are to: (i) strengthen public finances and their
       transparency by enhancing the efficiency of revenue generation and results-based
       management of expenditures; and (ii) improve competitiveness by enhancing secondary
       education attainment, facilitating market entry in the telecommunications and insurance
       sectors, and strengthening the legal framework pertaining to intellectual property rights.

      These objectives are fully consistent with the medium-term strategic objectives of the
      2008 CPS, which are to: (a) address emerging challenges to continued growth and
      competitiveness, in particular with respect to infrastructure shortcomings, skills gaps and
      excessive red tape; and (b) sustain and deepen recent gains in poverty reduction, social
      sector development and the environment.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

This single-tranche Development Policy Loan with Deferred Draw-Down Option (DPL-
DDO) in the amount of US$500 million was intended to support the government's reform
program in the context of the global economic crisis and was part of a coordinated effort on
the part of the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) to reduce liquidity risks.

This effort included a US$500 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) approved on December 17,2008, aimed at providing liquidity to the private sector by
facilitating productive sector access to financial resources. l Similarly, the US$720 million
precautionary Stand-by Arrangement (approved by the IMF Board in April 2009), provided a
contingent line of liquidity to support the Central Bank's international reserves if needed. The
US$500 million DPL-DDO provided a contingent line of credit to the Ministry of Finance in
case a worsening in the economic environment made the financing of the deficit more
difficult than anticipated.

The operation specifically supported key elements of the government's reform program,
including: (i) strengthening public fniances and their transparency by enhancing the
efficiency of revenue generation and results-based management of expenditures, and (ii)
improving competitiveness by enhancing secondary education attainment, facilitating market
entry in the telecommunications and insurance sectors, and strengthening the legal
framework pertaining to intellectual property rights.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Political Context

Costa Rica is one of the most stable democracies in Latin America. The country's political
culture places a high premium on achieving a wide consensus on major public policies.
While this can lead, at times, to slow decision-making, it also helps create a broad social base,
enhancing the sustainabilityof economic and social reforms and helping to maintain the
credibility and accountability of public institutions.

The Arias' Administration came to power with a comprehensive National Development Plan
for the period 2006-2010. It was structured along five strategic policy lines aimed at
sustaining economic growth and employment, improving the quality and coverage of
education, rehabilitating the transport infrastructure, strengthening public institutions and
combating corruption, and reversing the deterioration of crime rates. The Plan covered the·
social sectors, output and competitiveness, environment and institutional development, with
the reduction of poverty and inequality serving as the overriding development goal. The
Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (Report No. 43276-CR) discussed by the Board
on September 4,2008, supported the government's National Development Plan, including to

strengthen public finances and improve. Costa Rica's competitiveness-the two main areas
covered by the DPL DDO.

Background and Context

Costa Rica is an upper middle-income country of about 4.5 million people and with a per
capita income of US$6,345 in 2009. Costa Rica consistently outperforms on the Human
Development Index and is ranked above the regional average at 62 of 169 in 2010. The
country has achieved universal primary education and is making gains in secondary coverage
and completion rates. Important health achievements include a life expectancy rate of 79,
and low infant mortality rates, outcomes that are impressive not only in a regional context,
but at a global level.

After well over a decade (1994-2006) of very little change in poverty levels, important
reductions took place in 2008. Overall poverty decreased from 22-23 percent to 17.7 percenr
and extreme poverty fell even more rapidly from 6.5 percent to 3.5 percent. This decline in
poverty is in part linked to the impact of higher growth (which averaged 75 percent between
2005 and 2007) and to increasing social transfer expenditure, such as the conditional cash
transfer (CCT) which provides a cash benefit to poor households in exchange for enrolling
their secondary school-aged children in sc:hool. As with poverty, Costa Rica's income
distribution also exhibits low levels of inequality by Latin American standards. The Gini
coefficient was 0.49 in 2008, compared to the Latin American average of 0.52.

Leading up to the global economic crisis, Costa Rica's growth performance was one of the
most impressive in Latin America, reaching 8.8 percent in 2006 and 7.8 percent in 2007
compared to LAC regional averages of 5 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively (Table 1). The
strong economic performance was attributable to a combination of internal factors (high
business and consumer confidence, robust private consumption and investment, credit
expansion at low interest rates) and external factors (strong growth in world demand and
important foreign direct investment (PDI) inflows. High growth was also partly due to good
macroeconomic management based on the stimulation of private sector-led growth, the
introduction of fiscal discipline, reduction in public debt, improved debt management, a
redistribution of public spending towards education, health, security and public
infrastructure, and an improved quality of public spending.

This period from 2006-2007 also saw a growing current account deficit, in response to rising
domestic demand, which was financed by robust capital inflows, mainly FDI resulting in a
current account deficit hovering around 5 to 6 percent of GDP, while foreign direct
investment (PDI) inflows alone averaged around 6 percent of GDP in this period, leading to
an increase in international reserves.




2This decline in poverty represents an increase from a record low of 16.7 percent in 2007 due to the
impact of the food and fuel crisis.           '

As a result of an improved fiscal performance in 2006 and 2007 the central government
posted a surplus of 0.3 percent ofGDP in 2007, its best performance in the last fom decades,
while the overall public sector balance showed a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP. The
combination of high growth rates and. fiscal reforms introduced by the government raised tax
collection from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to 15.2 percent in 2007. These higher tax
revenues, together with lower public debt servicing costs, permitted higher public spending
on priority social programs. In effect, central government spending on education, social
protection and health increased from 7.9 percent of GDP in 2006 to 9.0 percent in 2008 and
even further to 10 and 11.7 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The increase in
social spending in the last two years took place mainly in social protection (1 percentage
point) and education (0.7 percentage points) (Table 2): This substantial increase in priority
spending was achieved with only a slight increase in public debt from under 36 percent in
2008 to 37.9 percent by the end of 2010.

However, the surge in food and fuel prices that peaked in the second quarter of 2008 led to
deteriorating external balances and a current account deficit of almost 9 percent of GDP by
the end of the year. A deepening of the fmancial crisis in the US and Europe, compounded
the challenges of implementing macroeconomic policy. Since mid-2008 Costa Rica's
external environment changed from one of abundant capital inflows that prompted the
appreciation of the currency to one of short-term capital outflows that put the Colon on a
devaluation path, driving the central bank to intervene (selling dollars) in support of the
currency.

Driven by the global surge in food and fuel prices, inflation started to increase in the last
quarter of 2007 reaching 10.8 percent at end-2007 and 13.9 percent by end-December 2008.
Food prices rose twice as fast as headline inflation affecting the poor mostly, as they spend
almost half of their income on food. The government used some of its expanded fiscal space
to put in place well-targeted transfer programs to cushion the impact of higher commodity
prices. Core inflation (headline inflation net of food and oil) increased from 8.5 percent in
January 2008 to 14.8 percent in December 2008, partly reflecting a relaxed monetary stance
by the Central Bank during this period. The authorities' policy response at that time was to
prioritize growth over the containment of inflation.

Macroeconomic Outlook at appraisal

In February 2009, at the time of loan appraisal, Costa Rica's medium-run outlook was one of
slower growth, which was projected to fall to about 0.5 percent in 2009 and 1.5 percent in
2010 as both external and domestic demand weakened (Table 3). On the external front, the
global economic crisis reduced receipts from exports and tourism. External financing was
also expected to be more constrained, with foreign direct investment dropping off and private
sector access to external credit lines likely to be more limited than in the past. At the same
time, slowing domestic demand and fears of a deepening US recession would also have an
impact on business confidence, and domestic investment was expected to decline from 27.4
percent ofGDP in 2008 to 21.8 and 22 percent in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Although lower US and European growth and declining external demand could be partly
mitigated by a rising share of exports to other nations, the overall impact on export growth
was expected to remain negative, given the global nature of the crisis. At the same time; a
sharp decline in imports was also envisaged due to falling domestic demand. The trade
deficit was therefore projected to decline_ from 16.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 10.7 and 11.0
percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The current account deficit was also
projected to decline from 8.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 5.3 percent of GDP in 2009- -
10. This deficit was expected to be financed mainly by FDI flows, projected at 4.4 percent of
GDP, assuming a decline in FDI flows of2.8 percent ofGDP from 2007 when FDI reached
7.2 percent ofGDP.

 *Outlook at appraisal (February 2009)

The greatest source of risk for the economy was the uncertainty surrounding the severity and
duration of the global economic and financial crisis. While the authorities were revising their
macroeconomic policy parameters to account for the projected deterioration in the external
environment and tightening financial markets, there was a recognition that a further
deterioration in the environment beyond the projected decline was possible and therefore the
Government needed to ensure adequate resource availability on a contingent basis.

This involved managing financing risks by seeking contingent fmancing from the multilateral
financial institutions. Costa Rica worked very closely not only with the World Bank, but also
the IDB and the IMF. In December, 2008, the IDB approved a contingent line for US$500




                                                        5
    million under its Liquidity Program for Growth Sustainability Program3• In April 2009, The
    IMF approved a IS-month, US$720 million Stand-By Arrangement to support the country's
    strategy to cope with the adverse global economic environment. The resources for these' two
    programs were treated as precautionary and were not drawn-down, however served as
    important signals for the financial markets.

The combined package of reforms and risk management measures was designed to allow
priority public spending to remain on track in the face of further adverse shocks, while
implementing longer run measures aimed at improving systemic robustness to crises and
maintaining fiscal balance. Specifically, the government's macroeconomic strategy in
response to the crisis focused on the following broad policy objectives: (i) facilitating an
orderly reduction in the external current account while seeking to minimize adverse effects
on economic activity, (ii) gradually introducing greater exchange rate flexibility and moving
toward an inflation-targeting monetary policy, (iii) protecting the most vulnerable groups of
the population from the adverse effects of the economic slowdown, (iv) reducing fmancial
sector vulnerabilities, and (v) securing contingent fmancing from multilateral institutions to
cover potential shortfalls.

 The policy framework being implemented relied on both fiscal and monetary policy
 instruments in a manner consistent with long run sustainability. Central government
 expenditure was projected to increase from 16.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 18.9 percent of
 GDP in 2009, due largely to an increase in social and labor-intensive infrastructure spending.
,This appeared to be an appropriate response from a countercyclical policy perspective.
 Meanwhile, on the revenue side, the government implemented a series of administrative
 reforms to improve the efficiency of revenue collection. However, given the expected growth
 slowdown, tax revenues were projected to decline to 15.4 percentofGDP in 2009 from 15.7
 percent of GDP in 2008. As a result, the central government deficit was expected to widen
 from 0.3 percent ofGDP in 2008 to 3.2 percent ofGDP in 2009. Similarly, the balance of the
 overall public sector was expected to deteriorate from a 0.1 of GDP surplus in 2008 to a 4.1
 percent of GDP deficit in 2009 (Table 3).

 In summary, at the time of appraisal, even though the economy was entering a downturn and
 there were significant risks to the short-term outlook associated with a difficult external
'environment, economic fundamentals were solid and provided an adequate basis for Bank
 development policy lending. Building on Costa Rica's strong macroeconomic record, this
 operation was intended to help the country weather some of the potential downside risks
 associated with the global crisis and strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals, including by
 improving fiscal,transparency and tax administration.

 secondary education attainment, facilitating market entry in the telecom and insurance
 sectors, and strengthening the legal framework pertaining to intellectual property rights.

 1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

 The one-tranche DPL DDO supported government efforts in the following main policy areas:

 Strengthening public revenue generation capacity and fiscal transparency. In response
 to the heightened need to assure adequate fiscal space for priority spending, the operation
 supported the government's strategy of further improving fiscal transparency and efficiency.
 On the revenue side, this strategy involved strengthening tax administration through better
 information and facilitation of tax payments, while on the expenditure side the focus was on
 spending outcomes when formulating the fiscal budget through developing the tools for
 results-based budgeting and a medium term expenditure framework intended to support a
 coherent budgetary process consistent with fiscal sustainability.

  Improving Competitiveness by Removing the Secondary Education Bottleneck. Costa
  Rica's Government continues to uphold the country's traditional emphasis on education,
  reflected in comparatively high (by middle-income country standards) levels of per student
. public education spending, as well as in relatively favorable education attainment indicators.
  However, the deceleration of growth in secondary enrollment after 2004, coupled with high
  secondary repetition and drop-out rates - nearly two-thirds of children starting secondary
  school, dropped out before finishing - slowed improvement in education attainment levels
  and undermined Costa Rica's competitiveness. The loan supported the government's strategy
  to reduce desertion rates in secondary education and improve the quality of secondary
  education.

 Improving Competitiveness by Facilitating Market Entry. The pursuit of greater
integration into the global economy through participation in DR-CAFTA has been a
cornerstone of the Government's development strategy. Within this strategy, the most
important commitments involved the passage of framework legislation to permit the
liberalization of telecommunications and insurance markets, and the strengthening of
intellectual property rights. These reforms, approved by Congress over the course of 2008,
represented a major step forward in developing a more modem, efficient and competitive
economy. The implementation of these reform efforts were supported by the DPL DDO and
are expected to help Costa Rica take maximum advantage of the opportunities offered by
DR-CAFTA in terms of raising the quantity and quality of trade, and in attracting foreign
investment to ease infrastructural bottlenecks and facilitate technological transfer.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

All the action triggers that were a condition of Board approval were met on time. The prior actions
were selected in a few key strategic areas and the Bank's rapid response to the client's
demand and timely preparation helped strengthen relations with the country and improve
dialogue in key areas of the CPS program. The actions remain relevant for the current
government and all of the actions remain in place, attesting to the sustainability of the programs.

Rendering Public Finances More Efficient and Transparent

Strengthening Tax Administration

The increase in fiscal revenues over the past three years prior to the appraisal of the loan had
pennitted Costa Rica's government to raise social and public investment spending, without
widening the fiscal deficit. The rise in fiscal revenues was due to, both, faster economic
growth and greater efficiency in revenue collection, particularly through an improved tax
administration. However, the deteriorating international economic environment since
December 2007 had raised a danger of economic contagion that could reduce the growth of
fiscal revenues and, thereby, undermine the expansion in social and public investment
spending. Moreover, the onset of tighter financial conditions, both globally and in the
country, meant that Costa Rica's Government could not rely on borrowing to make up for
any financing shortfalls. Inste~, it will have to depend more heavily on domestic revenue
generation to ensure adequate funding of priority expenditures.

In order to address this problem, the Government, through its Tax Authority, had initiated a
program of legal, administrative and technical actions aimed at further strengthening its
capabilities for tax administration by carrying out a series of strategic measures, that were
prior actions for the DPL DDO, including:                                 .

   • Enactment of Law No. 8624 ("Ley de Cobra Judicia"), which streamlines the
     procedural and legal principles applicable to the recovery and collection of debts
     (including tax-related debts) with the intervention of specialized justice sector
     institutions;
   • Updating of procedures for the filing and processing of tax returns by Large Tax
     Payers and the issuance of guidelines for the periodic updating ·of a related tax-
     information base;
   • Approval of guidelines for the electronic filing and processing of tax declarations
                                                8
      (Tributaci6n Digital); and,
    • Implementation of the Government's Information Technology Project for Customs
      Control (TICA). This project introduce d several improvements to render customs
      procedures more efficient, such as: (i) the unification of customs-related databases, (ii)
      the development of a single electronic format to process export and import
      declarations, (iii) the use of internet-based custom declarations, and (iv) the
      simplification of documentation utilized to process standard transactions. The project
      was being implemented gradually, beginning with the import module and followed by
      export and special regimes modules. Full implementation of the Project covering all
      customs posts was planned by end-2009.

 Improving the Efficiency and Transparency 0/ Public Expenditures

The need for ensuring adequate fiscal space for priority expenditures required some
adjustments on the expenditure side. In the past, an important obstacle to an efficient
prioritization of public expenditures has been the lack of attention to spending outcomes
when formulating the fiscal budget, as well as the absence of a medium term expenditure
framework. These shortcomings had limited the Government's capacity to match fiscal
resoUrces with the priorities expressed in the Government's Development Plan that this loan
was supporting. To address this problem, the Government had been advancing in developing
the tools for introducing results-based budgets and a medium term expenditure framework.

In order to improve. the process of budgetary programming, increase fiscal transparency, and
strengthen accountability, the Ministry of Finance had started to implement three measures
which were prior actions for the DPL-DDO: (i) the development of a new budgetary
programming methodology, (ii) the linkage of the budget to operational and strategic
institutional planning, and (iii) the development and improvement of a medium term fiscal
framework. The framework was results-oriented and based on the identification and
definition of medium term priorities. The expectation was that the new methodology would
generate useful information for policymakers and support the process of allocation of public
resources.

Improving Competitiveness by Removing the Secondary Education Bottleneck

Reducing desertion rates in secondary education and improving the quality         0/ secondary
education.

Costa Rica has traditionally put emphasis on education, reflected in high levels of public
spending per student compared to other middle income countries, and relatively favorable
education indicators. At the primary education level, Costa Rica's gross and net enrollment
rate has been approximately 100 percent since 2000. At the secondary level the net
enrollment rate (l3-17 year olds) had grown from 59.5 percent in 2000 to 71.2 percent in
2007. Similarly, the secondary gross enrollment rate had increased from 68.4 percent in
2000 to 87.9 percent in 2007. However, the growth in secondary enrollment after 2004
decelerated and unusually high school desertion rates started to show, representing a major
challenge for the country and an obstacle to the country's competitiveness.


                                              9
 In order to address this problem the Government started to take a number of measures aimed
 at improving quality and reducing drop-out rates. On the demand side, the Government
 introduced the "Avancemos" program, which provides cash trap.sfers and other benefits to
 beneficiary families conditional on their children attending secondary school. On the supply
 side, the Ministry of Education started to increase the quality of secondary education through
 a number of targeted reforms. In this context, the actions aimed at raising secondary school
 enrollment and enhancing the quality of secondary education, which were prior actions for
 the DPL-DDO, included the:                                                    .

    •   Expansion of the gross number of secondary education students receiving benefits
        under the Avancemos Program from 98,050 in 2007 to 156,909 in 2008;
    •   Amendment of policies governing promotion and repetition of secondary students;
    •   Establishment of a teacher training institute (Instituto de Desarrollo Profesional
        Uladislao Gamez Solano) under the purview of the Ministry of Education; and
    •   Approval of guidelines to facilitate the participation of Costa Rican students in
        international standardized testing programs (such as the Program for International
        Student Assessments, PISA).

. Improving Competitiveness by Facilitating Market Entry

The pursuit of greater integration into the global economy through participation in DR-
CAFTA continues to be a cornerstone of the Government's development strategy. Costa
Rica's participation in DR-CAFTA, however, could not be ratified until the prior
commitments included under the complementary agenda were fulfilled. For Costa Rica, the
most important commitments involved the passage of framework legislation to permit the
liberalization of telecommunications and insurance markets, and the strengthening of
intellectual property rights. These reforms were approved by Congress in 2008 and its
implementation should help Costa Rica take maximum advantage of the opportunities
offered by DR-CAFTA in terms of raising the quantity and quality of trade, and in attracting
foreign investment to ease infrastructural bottlenecks and facilitate technological transfer.
The main measures supported by the loan are discussed next.

 Telecommunications

Costa Rica's long-term competitiveness is closely linked to improvements in
telecommunications. Although basic indicators for the telecommunications sector reveal
high penetration, other important issues such as the low quality of service (both landline and
mobile), the low penetration of high-speed internet, the lack or delay in technological
innovation, uncertainties in the allocation of spectrum and overall slow pace of investment
pointed to the need for a more competitive environment.

With the aim of expanding and deepening Costa Rica's competitiveness, attract foreign
investments in key sectors and further benefit from international trade, the Government had
enhanced the telecommunications sector through the enactment of Law No. 8642 and Law
No. 8660. The first of these two laws established the general regulatory principles and overall
framework for the sector; and the second one created a new regulatory authority. for the
sector (SUTEL), established the policy function for the sector in the Ministry of Environment,
                                              10
Energy, and Telecommunications, and removed many of the administrative barriers of the
state-owned operator, ICE, to invest, incur debt, and hire/fire staff. These two new laws are
mutually reinforcing and constitute a powerful reform package, which, in line with Costa
Rica's DR-CAFTA commitments, aims at introducing gradual, selective and regulated
liberalization without privatization, while at the same time guaranteeing the benefit to the
user in line with the social objectives of universality and solidarity. The laws allow the entry
of new private operators to the country to compete with ICE in mobile services, internet and
private networks, they create a solid regulatory framework to ensure fair competition, they
create a new independent regulatory institution specialized in regulating the sector and
establish user protection guarantees, in particular number portability as well as a universal
service fund (FONATEL), which will support the provision of service to rural and
commercially unattractive areas and customers. The enactment of these laws was considered
as prior actions to this DPL DDO.

Insurance

Costa Rica's insurance sector has been dominated for a long time by a self-regulated, public
monopoly. This has resulted in poor insurance services, delivered at a high cost to
consumers. For example, Costa Rica's insurance penetration ratio, at 2.03 percent in 2002,
was the lowest among all middle-income countries in Latin America (averaging 2.39 percent)
and was substantially below the world average of 8.14 percent. Costa Rica's comparatively
low penetration ratio was mainly due to an absence of life insurance policies. In the non-life
insurance sector, the Costa Rica's insurance penetration ratio is similar to the regional
average, but the average premium per capita paid is the highest in the region. Finally, another
striking feature was that Costa Rica's insurance penetration ratio had been stagnant or
declining over time, reflecting monopoly pricing and an absence of competitive pressure

With the signing of DR-CAFTA, the Costa Rican Government committed to liberalize the
insurance sector, allowing the entrance of the private sector into an industry that has hitherto
been a state monopoly. In line with this commitment, the insurance sector has been
enhanced by a series of reforms aimed at modernizing its operation, improving delivery of
services and creating an effective oversight institutional framework, through the enactment of
Law No. 8653. The enactment of the new insurance law, whi.ch was approved by the
Congress in August 2008, was a prior action for the DPL-DDO.

Intellectual Property Rights (lPRs)

Costa Rica had a fairly effective legal framework governing intellectual property rights for
some time. Nevertheless, the existing laws also contained shortcomings that limited Costa
Rica's potential to attract foreign investors, especially in areas of innovative technologies.
There is considerable evidence that the quality of intellectual property rights is significantly
correlated with FDI in technology/R&D intensive industries. Furthermore, international
empirical evidence also suggests that the efficiency of R&D investments in terms of
increasing the number of patents received by local inventors per dollar spent in R&D tends to
improve with the strength of IPRs.

 Costa Rica already enjoyed considerable success in the initial phases of developing its
 manufacturing, but recent analytical work (World Bank 2005 and 2007) had identified the
 existence of R&D bottlenecks as a key impediment to further development of innovative
 economic activities. Therefore the Government's plan called for removing remaining
 shortcomings of Costa Rica's previous intellectual property rights legislation. Following up
 on this commitment, Costa Rica's intellectual property regime underwent a series of reforms
 aimed at meeting obligations under relevant treaties and conventions through the enactment
 of Law No. 8631, Law No. 8632, Law No. 8633, Law No. 8635, Law No. 8636, Law No.
 8656, and Law No. 8686. The enactment of these seven laws, which were approved by
 Congress between March and December 2008, were prior actions for the DPL-DDO

 2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

  The deeper than expected recession in 2009 was a major factor affecting implementation.
  GDP growth in 2009 was -1.1 percent instead of the projected 0.5 percent at time of appraisal.
  Central Government expenditure increased to 17.7 of GDP in 2009 instead of the projected
   18.9 percent, due largely to a larger-than-expected decre~se in total revenues, despite the
  Government implementation of a series of administrative reforms to improve the efficiency
  of revenue collection. Tax revenues declined from 15.7 percent of GDP in 2008, to 13.8
. percent of GDP in 2009. As a result, the balance of the overall public sector deteriorated
  from a 0.1 of GDP surplus in 2008 to a 4.3 percent of GDP deficit in 2009. The current
  account deficit in 2009 was smaller than originally envisaged (-1.8 percent) as imports
  decreased more than expected while exports increased more than projected. While in certain
  aspects of the program implementation (e.g., tax revenues, secondary education dropout
  rates) was slower than expected, the government has continued to focus on important reforms
  in the areas covered by this Project. The Bank also agrees with the approach of government
  to focus on targeting of the "Avancemos" program in light of the audit results.

The DPL-DDO supported a program that was underpinned by a substantial body of analytical
work carried out by the Bank in conjunction with the Government of Costa Rica (Annex 2)
and was designed to address highly relevant problems affecting the country. The Public
Expenditure Review prepared in 2008 was particularly relevant in carrying out the policy
dialogue associated with the prior actions involving the measures to strengthen public
finances and their transparency. The DR-CAFTA study published in 2005, in tUrn, flagged
the importance of critical complementary reforms involving the telecommunications sector,
the insurance sector and intellectual property rights.

In May 2010, the same political party was re-elected, which provided a continuity of support
for key reforms, including strengthening tax revenues, improving the quality of public
education and seeking a deeper integration into the global economy, especially through Costa
Rica's participation in the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement with
the US (DR-CAFTA). However, implementing major structural reforms required building
consensus among political parties, given that the National Liberation Party (PLN) did not
obtain a majority in Parliament. The Government transition and subsequent consensus-
building efforts delayed implementation; however, it should be noted that effectiveness
delays are a common factor affecting the implementation of all projects in Costa Rica, and in

                                              12
 this case the Project was signed quickly following approval and the effectiveness delay did
 not exceed 18 months.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E design. The Bank and the Minister of Finance agreed that the Ministry of Finance
(MH) will play the primary role in implementing, monitoring and evaluating the DPL-DDO.
The Government and the Bank also agreed that this Ministry will also coordinate actions
among the concerned line agencies in the event of draw-down, including, in particular, the
Ministry Education (for aspects concerning the education sector) and the Ministry of
Commerce (for aspects concerning the complementary agenda of the DR-CAFTA). Together
with the Ministry of Finance, these institutions will collect the necessary data to assess
                                                    13
 implementation progress and report it to the Bank, taking into accouIit both process advances
 and service statistics, surveys and other data that could be used to assess the achievement of
 the program's medium outcomes.

 The Government of Costa Rica and the Bank had also agreed to conduct reviews of program
 progress on a semi-annual basis. These reviews would aim at identifying areas of strengths
 and w~aknesses, and possible assistance needed to maintain momentum toward the planned
 medium-term outcomes. They would also assess possible downside risks and agree on
 measures to address these to 'the extent feasible. The Government and the Bank team would
 jointly evaluate progress towards achieving the outcomes and, if necessary, agree on course
 corrections.

 M&E implementation. Data availability for all indicators was adequate to evaluate progress.
 The Directorate of Public Credit at the Ministry of Finance was the counterpart entity in
 charge of the M&E of the loan and for collecting the appropriate data necessary to assess
 implementation progress. Other agencies playing an important role in this process, besides
 the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Commerce, are the Social Assistance Institute
 (lnstituto Mixto de Ayuda Social - IMAS) in charge of the "Avancemos" program; the
 Telecommunications Superintendence (SUTEL) for aspects related to the telecom reform; the
 General Insurance Superintendence (SUGESE) for aspects concerning the modernization of
 the Insurance sector).

 3. Assessment of Outcomes

 3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
  The design in terms of a DPL with Deferred Draw-down Option was appropriate given that
  Costa Rica is an open economy and the extent of the impact of the global crisis was difficult
  to predict. The objectives of the program were relevant when the operation was appraised
  and remain relevant to date. For example, in the area of strengthening public revenue
. generation capacity, the Government is launching a broader tax reform which would
  contri1?ute to a significant increase in tax revenues.
 While this Project was not specifically identified in the recently approved CPS, adjustment to
 the global crisis meant a major change in the structure of lending with budget support taking
 the place of investment lending. Despite the shift in instrument, the DPL DDO was designed
 to be consistent with the country's strategic priorities, such as competitiveness, education,
 environment and social assistance in Costa Rica, and maintained a focus on the key results
 areas of the GPS, for example telecommunications and education. This approach combined
 with good quality supporting analytical work shows how a country can adjust to changing
 circumstances while maintaining the commitment to deliver results in the areas targeted by
 the CPS program.

3.2.1. Rendering Public Finances More Efficient and Transparent

    •   Strengthening tax administration - Satisfactory

  The program supported by the DPL DDO estimated that given tighter global financial
. conditions, the Government could not rely on borrowing to make up financing shortfalls, and
  had to depend more on domestic revenues to ensure adequate funding of priority
  expenditures. Therefore, on the revenue side, the Government's strategy involved
  improvements in tax administration through better information and facilitation of tax
 payments.

In this respect,the following outcomes were fully achieved: (i) the number of users of e-
based taxation increased and represents more th~ 50 percent of all central government tax
revenues; and (ii) the exports regime is fully incorporated to the Information Technology for
Customs Control (TICA, for its initials in Spanish), in all customs agency posts since end
2009. Moreover as of April 2010 the Free Zones regime is also fully operative in all customs
agency posts under the TICA project.

Given the international financial crisis was far deeper, and its impact in the Costa Rican
economy much stronger than expected at the time of appraisal, the target for tax revenue to
GDP was not met. The deteriorating international economic environment since December
2007 reduced the growth of the economy in 2009 much more than expected (-1.1 percent of
GDP instead of 0.5 percent of GDP). Imports fell sharply in 2009 as external demand
dropped, leading to a fall in import duties and overall tax revenues as highlighted in Table 3.
While improved growth in 2010 led to an improvement in tax revenues in 2010, tax
collection still felt short of the original target (14.4 percent of GDP versus 15.2 percent of
GDP). This shortfall was accommodated within the IMP program and in this regard cannot
be considered a significant macroeconomic concern.

It is important to note that efforts to increase taX revenues as part of this DPL DDO have
been a prelude to a broader tax policy reform which the government is currently undertaking
with a view to increasing revenues by 2.5 percent of GDP. In this respect the government is
well positioned to make continued progress to increase tax revenues over the medium-term.

    •   Improving the efficiency and transparency of public expenditures -Satisfactory

 The Government stepped up the implementation of a results-based budget management
system, including: (i) the establishment of technical and methodological guidelines for the
alignment of budget allocations with the Government's development priorities, and (ii) the
establishment of technical and financial guidelines for the preparation of results-based budget
proposals for 2009 by all government agencies. At end 2010, 260 staff members of the
Planning and Budget Departments of 13 Government Entities, including ministries, the
Electoral Tribunal and the Legislative Assembly, have been provided with enhanced
technical assistance in the preparation of their annual budget, exceeding the original target of
12 entities. The Economic Commission for Latin American Countries (ECLAC) advised and
provided tec~cal assistance in this area.
                                              17
3.2.2. Improving Competitiveness by Removing the Secondary Education Bottleneck -
Moderately Satisfactory.

The net secondary emollment rate (13-17 year olds) increased from 71.5 percent in 2006 to
75.2 percent, exceeding the target of 74 percent. In addition, following the pilot survey to
750 students in 2009, Costa Rica participated for the first time (June 2010) in the Program
for International Assessment (PISA) together with more than 5000 stud~nts of 184 secondary
education institutions of the world. The publication of results will take place in 2011.

While the target in terms of number of beneficiaries of the "Avancemos" program reached
only 180,740 in 2010, below the target of 200,000 students, the basis for the shortfall is
reasonable. In 2009, following the approval of this DPL DDO, an evaluation of "Avancemos"
revealed that 5 percent of the beneficiaries did not need the financial support. As a result, the
Ministry of Education, in coordination with IMAS, started an auditing process to ensure that
the program is well targeted. In addition, the national scholarship fund (FONABE) had to
work in the synchronization of data so that those students with scholarships in the primary
education continued with the support in secondary. Therefore, the delay in incorporating
additional secondary students is related to the analysis of IMAS and Ministry of Education to
ensure that the program is well targeted.

Finally, the secondary drop-out rate that fell from13.2 percent in 2006 to an estimated 11
percent at end 2010, higher than the target of 10 percent. The shortfall is explained by the
fact that the economic crisis resulted in a drop-out rate that was slightly higher in the first
semester of2010 (4.9 percent) compared to the first semester of2009 (4.6 percent).

3.2.3. Improving Competitiveness by Facilitating Market Entry - Satisfactory

Telecommunications. Following the competitive bidding process to open up the cellular
phone market, that took place end-December, the regulatory authority SUTEL recommended
the Government that Band 3 (850 Mhz) be awarded to Telef6nica, and Band 1 (1,800 and
2,100 Mhz) to America M6vil. Owing to these awards, FONATEL (National
Telecommunications Fund) currently possesses the resources and institutional capacity to
function satisfactorily. In addition, the additional resources will allow for a further
strengthening of SUTEL capacity, including hiring additional staff.

Insurance. With the enactment of Law No. 8563, the insurance sector is in a process of
modernization which will improve the delivery of services and create an effective oversight
institutional framework. At the end of 20 10 the performance of this component is satisfactory
since the expected outcomes have been achieved. The oversight agency supervising the
insurance sector (SUGESE) is fully staffed and operating; and the participation of 6 new
operators (fully authorized) and other 4 operators (fmalizing the process of approval) has
resulted in improved insurance services at a lower cost to consumers.

Intellectual Property Rights. By end 2010, the expected outcomes were fully achieved.
Costa Rica has approved and enforced a series of rules and regulations aimed at completing
the intellectual property rights system and attracting foreign investment. The DPL DDO
                                              18
supported the enactment of several reforms to the intellectual property regime that has
allowed Costa Rica to meet obligations under several trade agreements and promote
technological innovation. An outcome of this reform has been an increase in FDI, which is
expected to reach 1.5 billion at end 2010 compared to 1.3 billion of 2009, and about 70
percent ofthe·FDI is directed to high technology projects in manufacturing and services.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome of this operation is rated Satisfactory. The objectives of the loan set at
the time of its approval (strengthening tax administration, improving the efficiency and
transparency of public expenditures and boosting Costa Rica's competitiveness) remained
relevant throughout the operation and were aligned to the Government's commitment to
maintain fiscal sustainability and transparency remove the education bottlenecks and
facilitate market entry. The issues addressed in the program remain key priorities for the
government.

In addition to the satisfactory contribution to development outcomes, .the resources provided
by the DPL DDO enhanced the ability of the government to address the challenges of the
crisis and sustain a healthy macroeconomic position that has facilitated the economic
recovery.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Before the global crisis poverty, extreme poverty and unemployment were ona positive trend.
However as the economy slowed in 2009, unemployment increased markedly from 4.6
percent in 2007 and 4.9 percent in 2008 to 7.8 percent in 2009. Poverty increased from 16.7
percent in 2007 to 18.5 percent and in 2009 and extreme poverty increased from 13.4 percent
to 14.3 percent during the same period. With improved projections for growth in 2010 and
2011 it is expected that the poverty trajectory will revert back to is pre-crisis trajectory. The
limited information suggests that the social programs of the government have softened the
impact of the crisis on the poor.

The design of the Project focused on impacting poverty through two programs that affect the
poor. These include reducing secondary school dropout rates among the poor and improving
the quality of schools contributing to closing income gaps. The actions supported by the
DPL DDO were deemed to have significant positive poverty and distributional effects over
the long-run. The CCT program "Avancemos", associated with reducing secondary school
dropout rates, supports the real consumption of beneficiary families. While the target
number was not met, the Bank supports the government's efforts to improve targeting of the
program. In general, the fact the Government supported proactive fiscal policies which did
not decrease public expenditure on key programs like Avancemos and Education, are likely
to have a positive impact on poverty.

                                              19
 4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    Rating: Low to Ne.gligible·

 Since the preparation and design of the DPL-DDO two main broad risks were identified that
 could affect the long-term success of the development outcomes. However, the risks that
 development outcomes will not be maintained are rated low to negligible because of the
 commitment by the current Government to its reform program. Although this is a single
 tranche operation, the actions supported by the DPL-DDO have been embedded in part of a
 longer-standing policy dialogue that has been carried out through various ongoing lending
 operations and, particularly, in the context of the Bank's Analytical and Advisory Activities
 (AAA) support.

 4.1 Economic and Fiscaf Risk

 Costa Rica's economic recovery is firming up. The rebound in activity is now broad-based
 and real GDP growth for 2010 was 3.8 percent. While sustained high oil prices and rising
 food prices could negatively affect Costa Rica's economy and threaten recent gains, risks of
 economic slowdown have been incorporated into the macroeconomic program and the Bank
 and the Fund are maintaining an on-going dialogue with the authorities on macroeconomic
 policies.

 4.2 Natural Disasters Risk

 The country is exposed to natural disasters due to its geographic location and geotectonic
 characteristics. In fact, on January 8, 2009, Costa Rica was struck by an earthquake (6.3
 degrees of the scale of Ritcher) which took 34 lives and displaced more than 1200 people.
 While natural disasters can place a major strain on public finances and reverse recent gains in
 poverty ~eduction, this risk is partly mitigated by the strong emergency management system
 developed by Costa Rica with the support of the innovative World Bank financed
 Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO), which acts as a source of bridge
 financing if a country declares a state of emergency as a result of a natural disaster. This
 proved to be an extremely effective tool in responding to the aftermath of-the January 2009
 earthquake. The country also has a comprehensive legal and institutional framework for
 disaster risk management (DRM).

 5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

 5.1 Bank Performance
 (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

    Rating: Satisfactory

. The design of the DPL DDO was timely and responded to the critical challenges for Costa
  Rica in the face of the global financial crisis. This operation played an important role in the
  Government's contingency planning to cover financing gaps at a time when the global
  economic and financial environment threat~ned the implementation of important reforms and
  undermined the capacity to sustain key social programs. Additionally, the availability of
                                               20
 Bank's financing as part of a coordinated response by the IFIs was a key in maintaining
 investor confidence.

 The one-tranche design was consistent with the need to act quickly while advancing a reform
 program that been embedded in the recently approved CPS. In this way the DPL DDO built
 on the work the Bank was already supporting, including through analytical work, trust funds
 and investment lending'. In· addition, the DPL DDO chose a limited number of critical
 actions which helped government and the Bank to focus on a realistic policy matrix which
 could be easily monitored and used as a management tool.

 In the borrower's view, (Evaluation Report - Annex 4) Bank support during the negotiation
 phase was critical to focusing the operation to assist the Gove~ent in its efforts to, inter
 alia, bolster finances, boost competitiveness, and strengthen the legal framework for
 intellectual property rights.

 (b) Quality of Supervision

  Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance during supervision is rated Satisfactory. The Bank team which was
charged of supervision of the DPL DDO visited Costa Rica three times in 2009 and 2010,
and in between visits followed up regularly on the implementation of the program. The
reviews identified areas of strengths and weaknesses, and gave technical advice needed to
advance toward the planned medium-term outcomes. The Government and the Bank team
jointly evaluated progress towards achieving the outcomes included in the program and, the
Government appointed a coordinator at the Directorate of Public Credit at the Ministry ·of
Finance, to follow up with the various ministries and agencies that were implementing
reforms. Where there were issues in reaching targets, the team agreed to actions which
limited the potential gaps in results and ensured progress towards development outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Costa Rica's Government demonstrated strong ownership in the design and outcomes of the
DPL·DDO program. This contributed to the timely compliance of most of the key outcome
indicators, as well as a commitment to achieve the medium term development goals. Though
a new Administration took office in' May 2010, the political transition did not adversely
affect the implementation of the loan. The current authorities continued to seek support from
the Bank to continue the program of reforms in the areas of this DPL DDO, and proceeded to
build consensus for the operation in Congress. In the Borrower's view, the Program served as
a contingency against adverse events that could have a considerable impact on the country's
public finances and ensured that ongoing priority programs and projects were not affected,
particularly those targeting employment, poverty reduction, education, and production.

 (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

The Government performance through the Directorate of Public Credit at the Ministry of
Finance, our main counterpart, as well as the performance of the Ministry of Finance
(increase in revenues and improving efficiency in expenditure); Ministry of Education
(removing secondary education bottlenecks and improving the quality of education) Ministry
of Commerce (modernization and implemelltation of intellectual property rights system);
Superintendence of Telecommunications (telecom reform), and the Insurance
Superintendence (modernization of insurance sector), is rated satisfactory.         Overall
leadership by the Ministry of Finance helped to focus on monitoring the intended results and
facilitate coordination among the concerned agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

The Costa Rican Government committed· to the reform program and maintained its
coInmitment even under difficult conditions, both external and internal.

6. Lessons Learned

The Public Finance and Competitiveness DPL-DDO responded to a specific request from the
Government of Costa Rica to support their program of reforms in order to be prepared for a
possible deterioration as a result of the global fmancial and economic crisis. The DPL-DDO
was built on best practice principles for well performing middle income countries including
the following:

Reinforce Country Ownership. The operation was developed within the objectives of the
Government's Medium-Term Plan, which establishes clear priorities developed through wide
consultation with stakeholders and broader civil society. The priority legislative agenda was
developed in consultation with the Parliamentary leadership on an ongoing basis. The
Government's program, seeking to protect the fiscal space needed to sustain social protection
measures and the program of competitiveness-enhancing reforms, was fully consistent with
the objectives of Bank engagement laid out in the Country Partnership Strategy (2008-2010).

Agree up front with the government and other fmancial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework. The Bank's support is summarized in a brief and focused policy
matrix, which received the support in the form of loans or contingent credit from IDB and the
Bank. Both institutions drew on the country's development plan, thereby ensuring
coordination among them and consistency of support. Both have been supporting measures
to enhance public financial .management, strengthen tax administration, and improve
competitiveness.

Choose actions critical for achieving results as prior actions for disbursement. The fact
the Bank's policy matrix focused on a limited set of prior actions that addressed key
development policies prioritized in the CPS helped focus the Bank support and achieve
results. Special emphasis was placed on discussing the policy matrix with government
                                            22

before formal project approval, guaranteeing the country's ownership of a realistic policy
matrix which facilitated its use as a management tool

Borrower's Implementation Completion Report

Pursuant to the request by the Manager of mRD loan No. 76860-CR the borrower prepared
an evaluation implementation report, which contains: (i) an evaluation of objectives,
implementation and outcomes; and (ii) assessment of the performance of the Bank. The
report is brief and complementary, to the Bank's final report on the implementation of the
above-mentioned loan.

Evaluation of Objectives, Implementation and Outcomes

Purpose of the Loan:

With respect to the Public Finance and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan with
Deferred Drawdown Option (DPL DDO), which was approved by Law No. 8843 of August
11,2010, and in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 5.07 of Article 5 (project
Implementation) of the General Loan Conditions, which stipulates that, subsequent to the
closing date, the Borrower must prepare a report on the .Program's implementation, the
Minister of Finance of Costa Rica informed the following:

The general objective of the credit is to provide financing to the Government of Costa Rica in
the event that macroeconomic and fmancial conditions deteriorate beyond projections and
trigger a significant liquidity squeeze. In other words, the Program serves as a contingency
against adverse events that could have a considerable impact on the country's public finances
to ensure that ongoing priority programs and projects are not affected, particularly those
targeting employment, poverty reduction, education, and production.

Implementation and Outcomes:

In that respect, the actions undertaken in the Program cover three key areas: ensuring greater
efficiency and transparency in the area of public finances; boosting competitiveness by
removing the secondary education bottleneck; and boosting competitiveness by facilitating
market entry.

In that connection, the main outcomes in light of the Government's strategy are as follows:

•   Ensuring greater efficiency and transparency in the area of public finances

With respect to strengthening the tax administration, the target was achieved as the number
of users who filed tax returns electronically account for at least 50 percent of all of the
central Government's tax revenues.

In addition, the free zones have duly implemented the TICA (Customs Control Information
Technology) system in all customs offices across the country, and it is functioning
satisfactorily. Work is currently under way to complete the inward processing system, which
is the final module, by the first quarter of 20 n.

                                             30
With regard to greater efficiency and transparency in public spending, training was provided
to 260 public officials tasked with budgeting and planning in the following 13 government
bodies: the Ministry of Foreign Trade; the Ministry of Foreign Relations and Religion; the
Ministry of Environment, Energy, and Telecommunications; the Supreme Electoral Tribunal;
the Legislative Assembly; the Ministry of Justice and Peace; the Ministry of Culture and
Youth; the Ministry of Labor and. Social Security; the Ministry of Housing and Human
Settlements; the Office of the President of the Republic of Costa Rica and the Ministry of the
Office of the President; the Ministry of Government and Policy; the Ministry of Finance; and
the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Policy. These training and advisory
activities will help hone and optimize the skills of personnel tasked with budgeting and
planning.


•   Boosting competitiveness by removing the secondary education bottleneck

In the area of education, the Government's strategy focused on reducing the dropout rate at
the secondary level and increasing the net enrollment rate in schools, by undertaking the
following activities:

           •   Increasing the number of beneficiaries of the Avancemos Program. This
               Program seeks to ensure the continued attendance and re-enrollment in the
               formal education system of teenagers and young people who belong to
               families that, owing to economic reasons, fmd it difficult to keep their
               children in school. In 2009, 165,749 students received benefits under the
               Program, which increased to 180,740 in 2010.
           •   The net enrollment rate in secondary schools. (13-17 years old) increased to
               75.2 percent, which is higher than the targeted rate of 74 percent.
           •   Promoting Costa Rica's participation in international standardized tests, such
               as the OECD's Program for International Student Assessments (PISA). Costa
               Rica also took part in UNESCO's Second Regional Comparative and
               Explanatory Study (SERCE), in which Costa Rican students performed well
               in mathematics, reading, and writing, compared to their peers in other Latin
               American· countries.

•   Boosting competitiveness by facilitating market entry

With respect to the telecommunications sector, to date, and following the competitive
bidding process to open up the cellular phone market, SUTEL (telecommunications
regulatory authority) recommended to the Government that Band3 (850 Mhz) be awarded to
the Spanish company Telefonica, and Band 1 (1,800 and 2,100 Mhz) to the Mexican
company America Movil.

Owing to the aforementioned awards, FONATEL (National Telecommunications Fund)
currently possesses the resources and institutional capacity to function satisfactorily. SUTEL
is also operating within the established parameters.             .



                                             31
In the insurance sector, SUGESE (insurance regulatory authority) has the necessary
personnel to meet the needs of the current insurance market and is fully in operation. To date,
the country has six duly registered insurance companies: Instituto Nacional de Seguros;
Seguros del Magisterio, S.A.; Mapfre Seguros Costa Rica, SA.; Alico Costa Rica SA.; Assa
Compaflia de Seguros S.A.; and Pan American Life Insurance of Costa Rica S.A.

The following four insurance companies are currently being registered: Aseguradora del
Istmo Adisa S.A.; Seguros Bolivar Aseguradora Mixta SA.; Qualitas Compaflia de Seguros
(Costa Rica) S.A., and the BMI Insurance Company (Costa Rica branch).

With respect to intellectual property and foreign direct investment (FDI), Costa Rica
approved a series of regulations to strengthen· the intellectual property rights system and
attract FDI. Approximately 70 percent of FDI in Costa Rica is geared toward manufacturing
projects and services in the high technology sector.

Assessment of the performance of the Bank

The Costa Rican Government is of the view that the preparation and implementation of this
credit operation, as well as the support received through the Bank team, were appropriate and
professional. This support, which was provided during the negotiation phase, was key to
focusing the operation to assist the Government in its efforts to, inter alia, bolster finances,
boost competitiveness, and strengthen the legal framework for intellectual property rights, in
the event that, in light of the international financial crisis, the implementation of these
activities and social programs is threatened, particularly programs and projects targeting the
most vulnerable population groups.
