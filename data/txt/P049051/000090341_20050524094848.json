The Institutional\n            Development Plan (IDP) was developed by a small team of\n            consultants without forming a joint State Audit Board\n            BPK/consultants task force. The Project needed components\n            that supported reform efforts in key external agencies. The\n            Project design expected that audit quality of BPK would meet\n            international best practices through classroom training by\n            Project closure. The IDP needed a change management\n            component that targeted the structural issues in BPK.
