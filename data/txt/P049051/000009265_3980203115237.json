of the BEPEKA Audit\n            Modernization Project is to assist BEPEKA to better assess\n            the accountability of public finances through the\n            enhancement of its financial and performance audit\n            capabilities.  The project will: 1) support BEPEKA's\n            efforts to remove existing audit scope limitations and other\n            regulatory constraints and carry out full-fledged financial\n            and performance audits; 2) promote user demand for such\n            audits; 3) reduce internal supply constraints by upgrading\n            technical and managerial skills; 4) build up the audit\n            management information system; and 5) institutionalize\n            international best practices.  The project consists of two\n            major components.  The first one is strategic planning.  An\n            international expert will be retained to (i) analyze\n            sectoral and institutional issues; (ii) review existing and\n            pending legal framework; (iii) increase demand for\n            performance auditing; (iv) plan and conduct the first set of\n            performance audits; and (v) assess other internal\n            institutional factors critical to BEPEKA's long term\n            sustainability.  The second component is institutional\n            development, including: (i) skills development; (ii) audit\n            management; and (iii) project management and implementation."}, "docdt": "1997-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
