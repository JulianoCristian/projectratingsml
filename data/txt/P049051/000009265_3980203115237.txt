Country: Indonesia                                                                       Project Title: BEPEKA Audit Modemization Project
Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
Modem governments depend on public accountability and rely heavily on their supreme audit institutions (SAIs) to ascertain
that public funds are spent judiciously; that public programs achieve their intended goals; and that areas of waste, fraud and
inefficiency are identified and eliminated. Therefore, SAIs have become important tools of good government and powerful agents of
change.
BEPEKA is Indonesia's supreme audit board and has the constitutional mandate to ensure accountability of state finances.
To do so, BEPEKA carries out financial and compliance audits of government and public sector entities, as well as a small number of
performance audits of narrow scope. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) is keen to develop modern institutions that will sustain and
continue its past rapid growth, and BEPEKA is one such important building block. GOI has asked for Bank assistance to support
BEPEKA's development into a modern SAI.
The objective of the project is to assist BEPEKA to better assess the accountability of public finances through the
enhancement of its financial and performance audit capabilities. The project will (i) support BEPEKA's efforts to remove existing
audit scope limitations and other regulatory constraints and carry out full-fledged financial and performance audits; (ii) promote user
demand for such audits; (iii) reduce internal supply constraints by upgrading technical and managerial skills; (iv) build up the audit
management information system; and (v) institutionalize international best practices.

1) Strategic Planning To improve the capabilities of BEPEKA to develop and implement
its long-term strategy and its enabling legal framework, specialized advisory services would be
provided. An international expert--an Advisor--would be retained to (i) analyze sectoral and
institutional issues; (ii) review existing and pending legal framework and propose further
amendments, if needed, to provide BEPEKA with a clear financial and performance audit scope        Policy       825,000          3.3
mandate; (iii) increase demand for performance auditing through a combination of user needs
assessment, change of reporting formats and frequency, and an enhanced consultation process
with its main user (the Parliament) on audit selection and follow-up; (iv) plan and conduct the
crucial first set of performance audits; and (v) assess other internal institutional factors critical to
BEPEKA's long term sustainability, including the formulation of a medium-term strategy
addressing structure, staffing and skills mix, incentive and compensation scheme, and budgetary
requirements. The advisor would be supported by a local Indonesian consultant and other short-
term experts, as needed, for the completion of these tasks. This component will also provide
support to 2(c) below.
2) Institutional Development:
A. The Skills Development Component will develop a core capacity in government
auditing with a special emphasis on performance and financial audits by supporting (a)
overseas and in-country degree and short-term programs to create a small but well-trained       Institution   20,138,000         81
multi-disciplinary auditing team; and (b) BEPEKA's training center to develop a core            Building
curriculum and course material for maintaining and upgrading staff skills.
B. The Audit Management Component will (a) implement modern audit tools and
technology, such as audit MIS and updated manuals and guides; and (b) carry out pilot           Institution    3,495,000         14
performance audits to ensure feedback into implementation/modification of the project's final    Building
outputs if necessary.

Performance Indicators: The project's outcome cannot be fully measured by the time of project closing (December 2002). A
more realistic, full-impact year is likely to be 4-5 years after completion. Nonetheless, the project incorporates indicators to assess
progress toward achieving the full impact objectives. The success of the project will be measured by improvements in BEPEKA's
internal capacity and by increase in BEPEKA's external effectiveness.
Assessment of the internal capacity will be based on achieving annual quantity and quality targets. Quantity will be based on
BEPEKA's meeting agreed and increased work program (See Annex 1). The quality of audits will be assessed in two ways: during
implementation, through a proxy indicator, i.e. , the net increase in trained staff retained by BEPEKA, as well as feedback from pilot
audits (under component 2b); and in the last year of the project, through an independent review of a random sample of its audits.
These will account for about 70 percent of project's outcome.
External support for BEPEKA's full effectiveness will be measured through two indicators: (i) a survey of BEPEKA's
primary user (the Parliament) in the first and last year of the project. The second means of assessing effectiveness would be by
tracking the percentage of key recommendations implemented by the auditees. Both measures are 'good practice' indicators among
leading SAls. However, baseline data for these two indicators are not available yet and will be developed with the help of the Advisor
in close cooperation with the design of the audit MIS, and after at least one full audit cycle. This will account for the remaining 30
percent of project outcome.
The project will also support one other goal, namely the passage of proposed legislation (see under Legal Framework below),
which achievement, however, are not within the control of the project per se. Project activities are, however, geared to support
BEPEKA in making a strong case for its passage.
3. Benefits and target population:
The project will benefit the public administration at large, since audits performed by BEPEKA are geared to ensure the
accountability of government finances and to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and economy of public programs and spending. The
project will directly benefit BEPEKA by strengthening its institutional infrastructure and staff skills. A transparent yet rigorous
candidate selection procedure, combined with the provision of a wide range of training options, will allow male and female staff to
participate equitably in the skill-building component by tailoring programs to institutional needs and candidates' circumstances.

Implementation period: Five years
Assessment of the Executing Agencies:
Role and Function. BEPEKA is the Government's supreme audit body and functions as its external auditor.
Constitutionally, it has a high standing -- the same level as the Presidency, Supreme Court and the Parliament -- which legally affords
it a strong and independent position. It reports regularly to the People's House of Representatives, Indonesia's Parliament.
Legal Framework: BEPEKA was established in 1946 to fulfill Article 23 of the Constitution which calls for accountability
in state finances. Within this broad framework, there has been periodic legislation to further interpret the authority and function of
BEPEKA. The most recent is Law No. 5 of 1973 (available in project files). In addition, other laws of the Republic of Indonesia
have bearing on BEPEKA's operations, such as the Budget Law and sector specific laws. This segmentation, common in other
countries as well, has resulted in some ambiguities and limitations in BEPEKA's audit authority. For instance, BEPEKA does not
audit tax revenues and hence cannot certify government accounts. Similarly, in conflict with the banking law, it cannot audit state
banks. These constitute a significant scope limitation (which are not in accordance with the Lima Declaration on Guidelines on
Auditing Precepts- 19th INTOSAI Conference). BEPEKA has addressed these issues through a proposed draft law aimed at clarifying
the exact scope and functions of BEPEKA as defined under Law No. 5 of 1973, expand its autonomy, and better define accounting
principles to be enforced through BEPEKA's auditing function. This proposal was submitted to the Cabinet Secretariat (SEKNEG) in
1995 and is being reviewed before it can be sent to the Parliament for ratification. The length of this process is not easy to predict and
will depend on the country's broader political and legislative agenda. In the past, SEKNEG has been very responsive to BEPEKA. In
1995, BEPEKA's proposal to introduce general audit guidelines for all public sector entities was accepted (SK No. 4/1995).
Nonetheless, the existing legal framework still permits the implementation of the proposed project as designed. The project will
further support BEPEKA's efforts to expedite the process by increasing the demand for its audits.

Reporting to and Interaction with Other Government Agencies. Through its formal and ad hoc reporting, BEPEKA has
established a close relationship with the Parliament and other government agencies. The formal channels of reporting consist of the
HAPSEM and the HAPTAH, the compendia of main audit findings presented at mid and end year. The ad hoc interactions are mostly
in the form of written replies to questions raised by members of Parliament (MPs) on the audit reports, and meeting with MPs to
discuss financial matters that arise during members' visits to the regions and provinces. On occasions, BEPEKA is invited to observe
parliamentary sessions, meetings and public hearings where state financial or audit matters are discussed. In carrying out its work,
BEPEKA relies on audit findings generated by internal audit and control units of the Government, such as BPK (within the Ministry
of Finance) and the Inspectorates of line agencies. In case findings point to criminal action, the office of the Attorney General, which
has a section covering economic crimes, is called to act. To further strengthen the capacity to implement the findings of audits,
especially with regard to eventual criminal activity, the project is providing selected training to the staff of the Parliament Secretariat
the Attorney General's office, BAPPENAS, and MOF. This would substantially improve the user response and capacity.
Organization and Leadership. BEPEKA is headquartered in Jakarta, with field offices in Yogyakarta, Ujung Pandang, and
Medan. It is organized into the following divisions: R&D, Operational Planning, Supervision, State Budget, State-Owned Enterprises
and Local Budgets. BEPEKA's Board of Governors consists of the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman, and five members at large. Its day
to day management is overseen by its Secretary General. The Chairman is appointed by the President for a period of five years and
since 1993, Prof. Dr. Soemarlin (a former Cabinet Minister) has been at the helm of BEPEKA. Dr. Soemarlin has been a key architect
of Indonesia's economic development, is well respected and viewed as one of Indonesia's visionaries. He is keen to elevate BEPEKA
to a modern SAI for it to make a more active contribution to the country's development. One of his achievements has been the
introduction of the standard government auditing guidelines (Standar Audit Pememrintahan) which have to be followed by all
government auditors in Indonesia. These standards are in line with international recommendations issued by the International
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). Indonesia has also been an active member of INTOSAI and ASOSAI (its
Asian equivalent). It will be hosting the upcoming ASOSAI meeting in October and will assume its Presidency for the next three
years.
Budgetary and Human Resources. BEPEKA's annual development budget is around US$10-12 million. The proposed
project will average about 25% of its yearly budget. BEPEKA has a staff of 1900, of which 1220 are auditors and only four hold
master's degrees. A large part of its skilled staff were trained under the Bank's First Accountancy Development Project, but human
resources remain BEPEKA's most binding constraint. Two years ago, BEPEKA advocated for a staff authorization of an additional
1000 professionals (200 per year). At a time of serious hiring freeze, the Government's acceptance of BEPEKA's proposal was a sign
of strong support. To date, BEPEKA has recruited around 400, mostly recent university graduates and mid-career staff from other
government audit agencies.
Project coordination: BEPEKA will coordinate all project activities.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): BAPPENAS, Indonesia's economic planning agency, is responsible for development
budget planning and monitoring of general project progress and expenditures.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements:
BEPEKA's regular accounting system will be complemented by a separate project accounting system which will record,
classify and report project expenditures and performance outputs. Basic project accounting records will comprise a cash disbursement
journal, a project general ledger, as well as other records to account for project-related capital equipment and to systematically record
project performance. Project financial and performance reporting will be quarterly and will be the basis for disbursing loan proceeds.
Project report formats and accounting systems and procedures will have been developed by the time the project begins.
Arrangements will be made to have annual project financial and technical audits by a qualified, independent private
accounting firm. The financial audits will cover the Special Account and the Statement of Expenditures. The cost of these audits has
been included in the project cost as part of GOI's counterpart financing.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
Monitoring and evaluation for project activities will be carried out by BEPEKA and the Bank through yearly reviews, regular
supervision, and a mid-term review to establish whether the project as designed, is achieving its intended goal. At mid-term (or

5. County Assistance Strategy (CAS) Objectives:
The project is consistent with the CAS update, discussed by the Board on June 4, 1996. It supports Bank efforts in the
area of public sector management. Moreover, the project has worked in tandem with and is consistent with the full CAS under
preparation scheduled for Board discussion in July, 1997.
Indonesia has had an impressive record of economic development. For instance, poverty was reduced from 56% to 11%
between 1970 and 1995. The challenge ahead will be to maintain the pace and improve the quality and equity of growth.
Utilizing public spending in activities of high social and economic return is crucial to achieving this goal. With the phenomenal
growth of the private sector, the role of the Government is changing. The proposed project will provide an important tool to
assess the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of government programs and complement other activities aimed at promoting
administrative reform, and legal and institutional development. It is also a critical building block toward addressing governance,
transparency and credibility issues.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
By all measurable standards, Indonesia's economic development has been remarkable and exemplary. This is mainly due to
the Government's consistently sound macro-economic management and the steady opening of the economy. Over the next decade,
globalization will put further pressure on achieving and maintaining international competitiveness. This will require efficiency and
effectiveness in the allocation of all resources -- private as well public.
In deregulated environments, market forces, by and large, drive private investment and operation decisions, and financial
performance is usually an adequate indicator of efficiency. Hence, financial audits may be sufficient formats of reporting. Public
entities and programs, however, operate predominantly in protected or monopolistic environments. Financial (and compliance) audits
alone do not provide the full picture of their performance and accountability. In these cases, performance audits supplement other
audit efforts through a range of quantitative and qualitative techniques by assessing results against expectations and often in the
absence of market forces or comparable benchmarks. While financial audits of commercial entities are generally performed by
private auditors, performance auditing and auditing of public entities is predominantly carried out by government auditors.
Since the early 1 980s, the Government of Indonesia has taken steps to improve the discipline and quality of reporting by.
private and public entities (See section 7). The First and Second Accountancy Development Projects (See section 9) have helped
improve the quality of higher education in accounting and auditing; introduce accounting standards similar to international standards;
build up the credibility of the public accounting profession; upgrade the capacity of enforcement agencies such as the Capital
Markets Board; modernize the government accounting standards and systems; and encourage entry of foreign and domestic
accounting firms to improve supply and competition. Government auditing is the only area that has not yet been sufficiently
addressed, and due to its distinct difference, warrants a separate intervention. The following are the main sector issues:
(a) Government Auditing: Like other countries, government auditing in Indonesia is undertaken by several entities:
BEPEKA, BPKP (Finance and Development Control Agency of the Ministry of Finance) and the Inspectorates General of the line
ministries at central, provincial and local levels. BEPEKA is the highest ranking Government auditor and functions as its external
auditor. BPKP is the internal auditor of the Government. The Inspectorates are internal auditors of their respective ministries and
perform 'house-keeping' functions to ensure compliance in examining fmancial transactions and records before accounts are closed
for financial statements. All internal audit institutions submit their reports to BEPEKA as the latter audits on a selected basis only a
fraction of state finances in any given year. Though it may appear that there is some overlap, all these organizations coordinate and
perform accountability functions of different scopes and objectives and provide separate services. This is accepted, justified good
practice within the private and public sector worldwide. Nonetheless, there is room for better coordination among the auditors to
ensure that the auditee is not overburdened and that work is not duplicated.
(b) Private/Public Mix: The responsibility for auditing government entities rests with government auditors. To leverage
resources, advanced SAIs 'out-source' to private auditors some of their standard audits (e.g. financial or compliance audits) or audits
of specific entities.(e.g. state enterprises). This has improved their cost-effectiveness and has allowed them to maintain flexibility and

Country: Indonesia                                                           Project Title: BEPEKA Audit Modemization Project
responsiveness for audits that they must perform themselves. With the increase of qualified private auditing firms in Indonesia,
BEPEKA is considering this option as well. What and how to out-source audit work needs to be evaluated and will be reviewed under
the project (as discussed in section 7) and incorporated into the strategic plan.
(c) Skills Gap: Unlike their private counterparts, government auditors have less flexibility to recruit directly from the
market due to two factors: (a) disparity of public/private salaries (discussed below), and (b) shortage of well-trained candidates in the
field of government auditing. In many countries, the field of government accounting and auditing is not fully covered in university
programs. SAIs generally rely on entry-level recruits who are trained on the job. The project would make a difference in two ways. It
would provide BEPEKA with a cadre of skilled staff and would upgrade the in-house training program to introduce new concepts and
retool auditors as the institution's needs change. Over time, it is foreseen that the more basic or theoretical modules will be picked up
in academic programs. The program will also incorporate courses and programs offered by accounting firms in Indonesia in order to
avoid any duplication of existing in-country training capacity.
(d) Compensation and Incentive Structure: Private/public salary gaps have been widening sharply in Indonesia as a result of
the growth of the private sector. Though civil service still remains attractive due to greater job security, recruiting and maintaining
top-quality expertise in the public sector has become a challenge. BEPEKA advocated and was granted a modified civil service scale
which affords it wider salary bands and less time in grade requirements. Within this system, BEPEKA has been able to offer its
professional staff more attractive compensation packages than average civil servants. For the time being, this may be adequate but the
issue would need to be revisited in the future. As government auditors are a special class of civil servants whose independence,
competence and accountability is critical, the project will review and propose, as needed, an appropriate incentive package to allow
BEPEKA to recruit, retain and maintain requisite professional skills, standards and working environment. This issue will be assessed
under the strategic planning component.
(e) Ouality of Audits: The effectiveness of government auditors depends on the appropriateness and significance of areas
examined, issues raised, relevance of recommendations, and the ability of timely response. There are existing international audit
standards which BEPEKA has adopted as the basic framework for its audit work. The project will help BEPEKA build on this
foundation a modern audit information infrastructure (hardware, software, audit guides and manuals) and a quality assurance system
which will include criteria for selecting and prioritizing audits and an audit recommendation tracking system to assess BEPEKA'
effectiveness over time.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices made:
The current audit activities, capabilities and strategic direction of BEPEKA are similar to those of other SAls within the Asia
region; especially those in the Philippines, China, Malaysia, Thailand, India and Pakistan. Essentially, BEPEKA and these other
SAIs have well developed capabilities for performing compliance audits and have staff who typically were recruited as new
accounting graduates from local universities. While BEPEKA is generally effective in performing compliance audits, its efficiency in
doing so has been hampered by a growing workload and a limited capacity to apply computer assisted techniques to audit planning
and field work. Also, as with other SAIs in the region, BEPEKA staff has limited capabilities for doing financial-statement audits of
state-owned enterprises and government accounts. The theme for the next meeting will be privatization.
There is a general trend worldwide among SAIs to move away from traditional compliance auditing toward audits that focus
more on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, i.e. performance auditing. This newer and much more
demanding type of government auditing has become common practice for SALs in many developed countries, and now is becoming a
priority developmental concern for SAIs in emerging Asian countries. Indeed the theme of the last tri-annual meeting of ASOSAI
was performance auditing.
While the Bank has provided TA for specific activities within SAls, such as drafting of audit guides, this project would be a
first effort to comprehensively address the complex task of legal framework, policies, procedures and staff development programs
toward building a credible and effective performance audit capability. There is no directly relevant Bank ESW available in this area
and the project has relied on guidelines and publications prepared by outside agencies, such as the United States Government
Accounting Office (GAO), Intemational Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), and Asian Organization of Supreme
Audit Institutions (ASOSAI), etc. (as listed in Annex 8). The recommendations were discussed and the documents were exchanged
with BEPEKA.
The project analyzed two strategic questions in its design: (i) why support a government auditor instead of fostering private

auditors; and (ii) why create institutional capacity through significant staff training instead of direct recruitment. The following
strategic choices were taken into consideration:
The need for government auditors:
*  In advanced countries with well established and sophisticated private auditing sectors, public sector auditing is still carried out by
the country's SAI and other internal government auditors. It is considered a key and legitimate public sector activity.
*  Regardless of capacity and quality issues, there are large portions of public sector operations which may not be audited by private
auditors due to confidentiality, national interest and security.
*  The project will not displace private auditors. Instead, the project is likely to increase demand through potential outsourcing of
audit work which can be carried out cost-effectively by private auditors. The feasibility of this option will be assessed as part of
the formulation of the strategic plan. Upon BEPEKA and GOI's agreement, the project will draft the necessary policies and
procedures on how and where to engage outside auditors. The appraisal mission met with several auditing firms. While private
audit firms may have worldwide program performance auditing capacity, creating such capacity in any one country is very rare
and expensive. It is unlikely, that for the foreseeable future, the private auditing sector in Indonesia will invest in such capacity.
Growth in the private accounting sector in Indonesia will be in the area of commercial financial auditing and mainly absorbed by
the mushrooming private sector.
Training vs. direct recruitment:
*  Given the disparity between private and public salaries, BEPEKA may not be able to attract the top tier of graduates for the type
of skills it needs.
*  Training its staff would provide BEPEKA greater flexibility and leverage in meeting its human resource needs than direct
recruitment from the market. Staff selected for external training have demonstrated track records and knowledge of BEPEKA's
activities. Study fields are determined strictly on the basis of BEPEKA's planned work program expansion and its skill needs.
Candidates must meet the prevailing academic entrance requirements and commit to serving BEPEKA for agreed periods of time
(usually five years) after their return, or refund all costs. As the majority will not be able to repay, BEPEKA will benefit from
their loyalty and freshly acquired skills. Direct recruitment may not be sufficient and can at best complement BEPEKA's other
staffing efforts.
8Prject alterntivesonderedan reasons for rejection;
The main criteria for project selection were:
*  Readiness of proposal,
* Commitment of implementing agency and the government,
*  Simplicity and manageability of project, and
*  Explicit request for Bank involvement by GOI.
The project team explored the following options:
(1) Support BEPEKA's skill building and audit management activities and include the policy/strategy component as a means
to address broader issues that will impact the pace and direction of BEPEKA's development over the next 10-20 years.
(2) Focus solely on BEPEKA's skill building and audit management activities.
(3) Develop a project to include BEPEKA and BPKP (GOI's main internal auditor) to have maximum impact on the
government auditing sector.
Option I was selected because BEPEKA's proposal was at an advanced stage of preparation; the project is in this year's
GOI's Blue Book and ready for external financing; and project design could be kept simple while still addressing selected sector
issues on a manageable scale. Most importantly, the Government had requested Bank assistance for a fast-track project and
BEPEKA/GOI demonstrated a strong commitment to the project.
Option 2 was rejected because, it was too narrow and would not be able to resolve broader institutional issues that are
important to BEPEKA's long term sustainability.
Option 3 was pursued with GOI and BPKP. Under the Accountancy Development II Project, the Bank had discussed a
government auditing component for both institutions. Hence, the Bank explored a joint project in order to tackle the entire
government auditing sector. But, BPKP' s project proposal is not yet ready and is not in the Blue Book (which is a requirement for

external financing), and BPKP is considering support from the ADB.
GOI and Bank decided to proceed with a smaller, yet focused, manageable project to respond to BEPEKA's immediate
needs. Since BEPEKA and BPKP are independent of each other, with different needs and missions, there would have been little room
for achieving economies of scale in a combined project. This does not, however, preclude Bank involvement with BPKP in the
future, if and when its project is at a more advanced stage and Bank assistance is requested.

9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and planned).
Bank involvement in and support for the sector began with the First and Second Polytechnic Development Projects, which
had small accountancy development components. This eventually led to the free standing First and Second Accountancy
Development Projects.
Accountancy Development I was approved in May 1988 and completed in June 30, 1995. The project achieved its
objectives and was rated satisfactory. The project's primary objectives were:
(a) to improve accounting practices: (i) in the public sector, by introducing modern government accounting practices, initially
in the Borrower's Ministry of Finance and three other agencies, and eventually in all agencies; and (ii) in the private sector, by
developing technical standards and a code of ethics for the accounting profession; and (b) to support the Government's program to
raise the quality of accounting faculty and teaching staff, to expand the accounting education.
Accountancy Development II was approved in September 1994 and is expected to close by July of 2000. The project will
have (a) established accounting and auditing standards which are close to international standards, (b) improved the standards and the
standing of the profession by instituting a professional exam and strengthening the Indonesian Accounting Institute; (c) revamped the
government accounting practices and system; and (d) strengthened an important enforcement agency, namely Indonesia's Capital
Markets Board. The project is rated satisfactory both on implementation progress and development objectives.

lO;Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Instrument Specific Lessons:
Technical assistance loans (TAL) are the Bank's riskiest lending instruments with a failure rate of 24% bankwide mostly due to:
* Commitment from the Government: The project has strong Government ownership as discussed in Section 11.
* Complexity of the Project: The design of the project has been kept simple and is within the institutional capacity of BEPEKA to
implement.
Country Specific Lessons: Experience with TALs in Indonesia has been positive and considerably above the Bank average (17%
failure rate). TALs have significantly contributed to capacity improvement of line agencies and have built the back-bone of the
government's current institutional infrastructure. Main implementation lessons reflected in the project are:
* Timely availability of counterpart funds: Funds for the first year of the project have already been earmarked and approved by
BAPPENAS. Subsequent years' budgets will be determined and reviewed as part of the yearly review scheduled for
September/October, in time for the budget request submissions in January for the following fiscal year.
*   Late project star-up: BEPEKA has carried out screening of its staff and is preparing promising candidates for overseas training.
A first batch of candidates is ready for the next academic year. Also, the TORs of the main consultants have been drafted and will
be finalized before Board presentation.
Accounting and Auditing Sector Specific Lessons/Objectives:
*   Legislative authoritv: BEPEKA already has an audit mandate under the Constitution. Within its broad legislative mandate,
BEPEKA needs to clarify its authority to conduct performance audits. It also needs to remove current legislative restrictions on
its authority to audit tax revenues and state banks.
* Political will and leadership: The project has been sanctioned at the highest level of the Government. The management of
BEPEKA is forward looking and committed to carry out the necessary actions to develop BEPEKA into a modern audit agency.

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The following demonstrate a strong Borrower commitment:
*    GOI authorization to increase BEPEKA's professional staff by 1000 over five years, despite a binding hiring freeze in
the public sector.
*   The project was proposed by the highest level of the Government to Bank management.
*   BEPEKA has submitted a complete and well-thought-out project proposal.
*    BEPEKA  has selected and prepared the first group of candidates for overseas and domestic degree programs.
*    The project is already in the Government's Blue Book.
*    The Government has accepted a substantial cost sharing of the project close to 60/40 (Bank/GOI).
*    The Government has already accepted and allocated the incremental first year budget necessary to carry into next year's
budget.
*    BEPEKA  has already completed activities which had initially been identified as conditions of effectiveness, i.e.,
establishment of the project management unit and the project steering committee.

12. Value added of Bank support:
Bank's value added to the project will be through:
*    Complementing past and ongoing initiatives to strengthen the country's capacity for improved public sector
management;
*    Continuing joint GOI/Bank strategy for the accounting and auditing sector;
*    Raising the profile and the quality of the debate to resolve institutional issues necessary for BEPEKA's long term
sustainability; and
*    Transferring cross-country experience and international best practice.

b. Project management:
To implement the project, BEPEKA has established two bodies: (See Annex i 1, for Project organizational structure)
1)      A Steering Committee, chaired by the Secretary General of BEPEKA, includes the heads of all the departments and
representatives of other Government agencies concerned with the project. It will provide general policy guidance, review monthly
progress, and resolve coordination issues within and outside of BEPEKA.
2)      A Project Implementation Unit, led by the Head of the Training and Human Resource Department and staffed with key
personnel, will carry out day-to-day project implementation and the required reporting to the Bank and BEPEKA Management. The
operating budget of the unit has been included as a recurrent cost in the project cost estimates.

*17. Social Assessment:
As full-fledged performance auditing will be a new tool, BEPEKA could initially face resistance and reluctance by auditees
to accept or acknowledge adverse finding. There may be efforts to undermine or compromise the independence of BEPEKA and its
auditors which are crucial requirements toward achieving the ultimate objective of the project in establishing a competent, objective
and independent organization.

20. Sustainability:
The Project's long term sustainability depends on four factors:
*   Developing a strong demand for comprehensive financial and program performance auditing;
*   Clarifying BEPEKA's powers to carry out such audits;
*   Maintaining a rewarding and professional environment and the necessary staff incentive system; this will be addressed
through the strategic planning component;
*   Maintaining and expanding staff skills; the support for the training center will provide a mechanism for BEPEKA to
meet its ongoing routine training/retraining needs;
*   Addressing staff compensation issues that are crucial to retaining and attracting a high caliber staff;
*   Providing adequate budgetary resources; the strategic planning component will estimate the adequate level of resources
and seek an agreement on meeting them; and
*   Usefulness and usage of BEPEKA's findings and recommendations.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
There could be some confusion about BEPEKA and BPKP (the government internal auditor under the Ministry of Finance)
by those who may not be familiar with the different roles of internal and external auditors. Within Indonesia, they may be viewed as
competitors and potentially played against each other. It is important that the different functions of these agencies be highlighted and
that they not only coordinate but cooperate closely with each other so as not to duplicate efforts or overburden auditees.

(1)    About 10-15 staff have completed the preparatory activities and may be ready to attend overseas programs by the next
academic year. If so, they will have to be sent prior to the project's Board date or effectiveness date. To ensure that the project is not
delayed due to lack of such funding, the project allows for retroactive financing up to US$500,000 for expenditures for overseas
training incurred since appraisal. But, the use of retroactive financing will be dependent on GOI's internal budgetary mechanisms to
allow this flexibility.
(2)    By July 31, 2000, BEPEKA will furnish to the Bank its medium term strategic plan on the basis of activities carried out under
the strategic planning component with the assistance of the advisor. This strategic plan will have assessed issues raised under such
component and proposed a specific action plan to address these.
(3)    The training component shall be carried out in accordance with programs and an implementation timetable acceptable to the
Bank.
(4)    Selection of financial and performance audits to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan will use technical, financial and
economic criteria acceptable to the Bank.
(5)    The borrower shall maintain throughout project implementation a project steering committee and a project implementation
unit.
(6)   BEPEKA will carry out project technical audits in addition to the annual financial audit of project accounts, Special Account
and the Statement of Expenditures.

Indonesia - BEPEKA Audit Modernization Project
Detailed Project Description
Overall
The project aims at enhancing accountability of government fnancing through strengthening of the Indonesia's
supreme audit institution, BEPEKA. The project would provide technical assistance to develop BEPEKA's long-term
institutional strategy, bring about internal institutional changes, upgrade human resources, and build the institutional audit
management information systems. The project has two components: (i) Strategic Planning and (ii) Institutional
Development (Skills Development and Audit Management) and Project Management.
Project Component I - Advisory Services for Strategy Planning, US$ 825,000 (total cost of component)
This component will support the analysis of the sectoral and institutional issues that would enable BEPEKA to
develop into a strong audit agency. The project will provide funding for the appointment of a high-level advisor (preferably
ex-Chief or Deputy of a leading SAI) who will advise BEPEKA's chairman and the Steering Committee on a full range of
issues and help apply international best practices. The advisor will visit Indonesia 3-4 times a year for a period of 2 weeks
and discuss critical institutional issues, propose actions, and guide with implementation as detailed under Section 2 of the
PAD.
The advisor will also provide input into the design and execution of the user survey at the beginning and end of
project; the selection and conduct of the pilot audit; the design of the key audit recommendations tracking system; and the
ex-project independent review of BEPEKA's performance audit reports.
The advisor will participate in the selection of a local Indonesian consultant with expertise in Management and
Organizational Behavior to interface on a more permanent basis with the Steering Committee and to help formulate the
advisor's recommendations regarding BEPEKA's institutional framework. The advisor and the local Indonesian expert will
be selected on the basis of their personal qualifications (and not the qualifications of their current employees). The project
will also provide funding for other short-term consultancy assignments, as deemed necessary, to carry out the objectives of
this component.
Project Component 2a - Institutional Development Component, US$ 20,138,000 (total cost of component)
The project would support extensive training and skill development for BEPEKA managers and staff. It would
include in-country and overseas degree programs and overseas short courses. BEPEKA has projected its work program over
the next 5 years. The staff training program is directly tied to the fulfillment of this schedule. The courses and levels of
study, as well as the number of participants, have been determined so as to develop a minimum core capability that will be
needed for BEPEKA to carry out more extensive financial audits to begin an effective performance audit program. The in-
country program will involve about 80 participants at the Masters' degree level, and about 140 who will complete
outstanding requirements at the undergraduate level. The Masters' concentrations will include corporate law (31
participants), management accounting (42) and governmental accounting and auditing (35). The undergraduate study
concentrations will comprise accounting (130) and information systems (10).
Some 60 specially selected staff will be sent to overseas graduate programs (55 at a masters level and 5 at a doctoral
level.) The overseas programs will provide for areas of study concentration that are not yet developed in Indonesian
universities. The areas of concentration at the doctoral degree level will include public administration (3), industrial
psychology (1) and information science (1). The masters level programs will comprise business level administration (30),
with specialties such as public finance, banking and control; human resource management (8); policy and public
administration (8); information service (7); and law (7).



The overseas short courses will benefit about 250 participants. These courses will have a duration of about one to
three months, and will cover subjects such as internal control reviews, program evaluations, economy and efficiency and
advanced Electronic Data Processing audit techniques. In addition, some 10 BEPEKA executives will undertake short
executive-level programs or seminars offered by more advanced SAIs throughout the world. Key staff involved with
implementation of BEPEKA recommendations from other government agencies will also be eligible to participate in short-
term, in-country or overseas training in order to improve the effectiveness of BEPEKA. These will include staff of the
Parliament's Secretary General's office that interact with BEPEKA on finance and audit matters, key staff from the Attorney
General's office, BAPPENAS and other government auditors as necessary.
Secondly, the project would provide technical assistance in the development of the training program, develop and
teach course modules that will form a core training program which new auditors will undertake during their first three years
of employment in the BEPEKA. About fifteen separate courses are planned in essential audit subjects (e.g., statistical
sampling, internal control reviews and EDP auditing program evaluation), and on basic management and performance topics
relevant to different sectors (e.g., health, education and finance) and public enterprises. Also, about five courses will be
developed for BEPEKA's client agencies covering agency control systems, new regulations, and trends and issues derived
from past audit findings.
Lastly, the project will carry out a select number of pilot performance audits starting in the third year of project
implementation to test newly developed processes, procedures and the audit MIS, to the extent that it has been implemented.
The purpose of this activity is to assess and improve the quality of audits in the course of project implementation.
Project Component 2b - Audit Management, US$ 3,495,000 (total cost of component)
The project would support technical assistance and the purchase of hardware and software related to an audit
management information system that would link four of BEPEKA's principal field offices. The system would allow BPKP
managers to more efficiently and effectively plan and monitor field audit activities, record and evaluate audit findings, and
store and retrieve audit programs and working paper forms to use in the field. In addition, the project would support the
purchase of audit software and lap-top computers for use by auditors in the field. The system will also incorporate a
recommendation tracking system (as customary in leading SAIs) to evaluate BEPEKA's effectiveness.
The project would also support technical assistance, to assist in the development of audit manuals and guides to be
used by auditors in the field. Included will be manuals covering general audit procedures, as well as manuals covering more
advanced audit procedures (e.g., system-specific EDP audit techniques), as well as enterprise of sectoral specific procedures.
Project Component 2c - Project Management, US$ 484,000 (total cost of component)
The project will be implemented through the formnation of a Steering Committee comprised of the heads of the
various sections of BEPEKA, and representatives from the Legal and Communications Department. It will meet once a
month and ensure smooth internal coordination within BEPEKA and support for external action. The project will be
implemented by a Project Management Unit to carry out the day-to-day activities under the project. The project will cover
the recurrent cost of the steering committee and the project management unit.

Indonesia - BEPEKA Auditing Modernization Project
Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
This is a first project of its kind in the Bank. Hence, there is no relevant benchmark which would allow a fair
and meaningful comparison.
Cost-effectiveness indicators
Separate segments of the project incorporate in their design cost-effectiveness experiences under previous Bank
projects. For instance:
(1)  The overseas training program will be administered by one or more educational exchange organizations
(EEOs) that specialize in placing students in appropriate and cost-effective programs. The Bank and Indonesia
have had extensive experience with these organizations. This experience, which has been incorporated in project
design/costing and coordination, will continue during project implementation.
(2) Procurement of goods will be done under ICB.
(3)  The assignment of consultants under various components was reviewed carefully to determine the most
cost-effective method (in line with recent Bank Consultant Guidelines) for the respective levels of expertise
required.
(4)  It is assumed that the tuition costs of the in-country/overseas short and long-term courses reflect the
respective value of such training. Moreover, staff selected for such training must fulfill a number of
requirements to ensure that they are capable of absorbing the material taught and of contributing commensurably
to BEPEKA's work program after they return.
Cost Benefit Analysis
The project does not lend itself to a cost-benefit analysis. However, the project is likely to impact the rate of
return on public spending. Even if audit findings can impact the decision on a small proportion of GOI's budget,
the potential return on the projects is likely to be significant and considerably exceed the cost of the project. This
justifies the intervention.
In a narrower sense, the existing organization is being supported through the budget. The project will ensure that
BEPEKA itself is a more effective agency.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
The Borrower has had previous experience with Bank procurement procedures under the First Accountancy Development
Project. Nonetheless, due to changes in the guidelines and significantly higher volume of procurement, the Borrower's PIU
will recruit a procurement specialist to carry out day-to-day activities. A detailed project implementation chart and
procurement plan are enclosed in the Project's Implementation Plan prepared by the Borrower. A short summary of the first
year's procurement is in Annex 11.
Procurement: The project will finance procurement of goods and consultant services following "Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," dated January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996 for
procurement of goods; and "Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated
January 1997 for consultants' services. Standard bidding documents and contracts will be used in all instances.
Procurement methods (Table A)
Consultant Services: Consultant activities will mainly consist of technical assistance and training to execute the following
components:
Strategic Planning Component:
*  One high-level expatriate consultant to advise on policy and strategy issues. This will be done in accordance with
"quality-based selection" with prior review by the Bank of the TOR and the Contract (ca. 400,000 over the life of the
project).
*  A local Indonesian consultant with specialization in Organizational Behavior to support the advisor and interface with
the Steering Committee and the project management unit on the implementation of the strategy. This consultant will be
procured/retained on an "individual basis" with prior review by the Bank of the TOR and the Contract. (ca. US$ 150,000
over the life of the project).
*  Other individual consultants to carry out specialized short-term/part-time assignments in areas where BEPEKA may not
have in-house expertise. These will be procured on 'individual' basis with prior Bank clearance of the TOR and
contract. This would be for the conduct of pilot project, PIU support, etc.(less than US$50,000 per consultant over the
life of the project, for a total amount of around $205,000)
Skills Development Component:
*  Placement company(ies) will be recruited as needed ($600,000 total cost foreseen) to help place screened candidates into
appropriate overseas training programs to be in accordance with "quality based selection."
* Local/international consultant for the design/delivery of curriculum and course material for the in-house training
program (for the initial years) also on the basis of "quality-based selection." ($150,000 over the life of the project)
* The bulk of the loan will finance tuition and subsistence for students. Students will be screened to meet the prevailing
program's selection criteria for in-country or overseas, short term or degree programs. Over the life of the project, these
costs will amount to $14.2 million of project cost for overseas training and $3.85 million for in-country. (as in Annex 2).
Audit Management Component:
*  Qualified firm to conduct a needs assessment and prepare systems specifications document, and implement the MIS
program. This will be in accordance with "quality-based selection" (ca. $150,000 total).
*  Consultant/firm to help update draft new audit manuals and guidelines. This will be done on a "fixed budget" (ca.
$100,000) with prior review of the TOR and contract.
PIU
* Assignment of private auditing firm to carry out the project accounts and technical audits. This will be done on a "least
cost" basis (ca. US$20,000 over the life of the project), with prior clearance of the TOR and the contract.
Formn



Goods are mainly computer hardware and software, packaged into groups and lots of at least US$200,000 each and procured
under ICB. NCB procedures could be used for contracts valued at between $50,000 and $200,000 while contracts valued
below $50,000 could be procured under national shopping after receipt of quotations from at least three suppliers.
Preference for domestically manufactured goods will apply to goods manufactured in Indonesia as per the Guidelines.
Requests for quotations shall indicate the description and quantity of goods, as well as the desired delivery time and place.
Total amount earmarked for goods is US$2.263 million.
Prior review thresholds (Table B):
All contracts for goods valued at US$200,000 or more and all consultant contracts awarded to firms valued at US$ 100,000
and above, US$50,000 and above for individual consultants and all QBS contracts. As the bulk of the goods will be
procured on ICB basis, nearly 90% of contracts will be subject to prior review. All other contracts will be subject to random
post review during supervision missions by Bank staff. This is acceptable given that local procurement procedures have
been judged to be acceptable to the Bank. Contracts not subject to prior review would be post reviewed on a sample ratio
basis of one in four.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C): The proceeds of the Bank loan will be disbursed against:
*  100 percent of foreign expenditures for goods, and 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory), for items procured
locally, and 65 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally.
*  80 percent of expenditures for consultants' services;
*  100 percent of overseas training and 50 percent of in-country training.
Use o statements ofexpenditures 6S2Es): Disbursements-against-goods contracts valued at US$ 200,000 or more and
consultant contracts valued at US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,0000 or more for individuals will be fully
documented. For all other expenditures, disbursements could be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).
Supporting documents for SOEs will not be fumished to the Bank but will be retained by BEPEKA and made available to
Bank staff during supervision. BEPEKA will keep copies of contracts so that the Bank can monitor them for prior or ex-post
review as needed.
Special account: To facilitate project implementation and to reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, a special account
in an amount of US$I million will be established at Bank Indonesia on terms and conditions acceptable to Bank.

1) QBS (Quality-based selection) applies to complex or highly specialized assignments, i.e. assigmnents which have high downstream
impact and assignments for which proposals may not be comparable (re. para 3.2 of the Guidelines).
2) Individual is based on competitive selection without formal evaluation; the best qualified firm or individual, i.e., with the best
qualifications and references, is invited to submit a combined technical/financial proposal; this applies to very small assignments (para 3.7 of
the Guidelines).
3) Least Cost - uses price only among proposals of an acceptable quality and generally applied to small contracts for assignments of a
standard or routine nature (para 3.6 of the guidelines).
4) Fixed budget - can be used when the assignment is simple and can be precisely defined, the budget fixed and the TORs particularly well
prepared so the assignment fits in the budget.
