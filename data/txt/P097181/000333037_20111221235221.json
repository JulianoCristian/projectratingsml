The\n            reallocation of the credit proceeds is needed to enhance\n            project effectiveness by ensuring funding for the\n            program's central component on sub-grants for community\n            nutrition sub-projects. The reallocation aims to maintain\n            the coverage and strengthen the intensity of the\n            community-based activities, particularly in light of the\n            negative impact of the external economic shocks on poverty\n            and nutrition. The reallocation is made possible because of\n            economies made on the categories of drugs and pharmaceutical\n            supplies, consulting services and project management costs\n            over the course of the project implementation, mainly as the\n            result of new support from other donor sources and and/or\n            increased Government contributions.
