1.      This paper seeks the approval of the Country Director for the reallocation of
proceeds of the Senegal Nutrition Enhancement Project (Credit No. 4245-SE). The
proposed reallocation of credit proceeds has been requested by the Government of
Senegal in a letter from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, dated October 17, 2011
and is designed to ensure continued effectiveness of the program, notably the community
nutrition subprojects implemented by Local Governments. The reallocation request is as
follows:

2.      Project Progress. The project was approved by the Board on November 13,
2006. The credit of SDR 10.1 million (equivalent to US$15 million) became effective on
January 29, 2007. As of December 1, 2011, SDR 9.1 million (equivalent to 90 percent of
the total credit) has been disbursed. The current closing date is May 14, 2012.

3.      The Project Development Objective is to expand access to and enhance nutritional
conditions of vulnerable populations, in particular those affecting growth of children
under five in poor urban and rural areas. The project components are as follows:
Component 1: Community-based Nutrition: This subcomponent represents the core of the
program and refers to activities including monthly evaluation of growth of children under
two years of age with counseling feedback to mothers, home visits to children requiring
special attention, cooking demonstrations, follow up on health service delivery, and
distribution of insecticide-treated bednets.
Component 2: Multi-Sectoral Support for Nutrition: Activities through Sector Ministries,
i.e., health and education, based on a joint priority analysis of sector development plans.




                                          ~1~
Component 3: Support to Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation of National Policy:
Activities to strengthen the implementation and monitoring performance of the CLM,
local government, and Sector Ministries.

4.     The project's performance is rated highly satisfactory, with all indicators having
surpassed the end-of-project targets. Project management is performing very well, with
implementation progress rated highly satisfactory in all areas but financial management,
which is rated satisfactory. All legal covenants have been complied. There are no
outstanding audit reports, and the 2010 audit report is acceptable to the Bank.

5.      The main thrust of the project is the community-based nutrition program, which
covers over 50% of the under-five child population with an essential package of nutrition
and health services at the community level. This is well over the end-of-project target of
40%. Chronic malnutrition has come down since 2000 and Senegal now has the lowest
rate of chronic malnutrition in continental sub-Sahara Africa. The service delivery is
contracted out to NGOs (as subprojects) by Local Governments under the oversight of
the Executive Nutrition Office of the National Committee on the Fight against
Malnutrition. Other activities that are supported by the project include school health and
nutrition; maternal and child health campaigns; and nutrition surveys and surveillance.

6.      The reallocation of the credit proceeds is needed to enhance project effectiveness
by ensuring funding for the program’s central component on sub-grants for community
nutrition sub-projects. The reallocation aims to maintain the coverage and strengthen the
intensity of the community-based activities, particularly in light of the negative impact of
the external economic shocks on poverty and nutrition. The reallocation is made possible
because of economies made on the categories of drugs and pharmaceutical supplies,
consulting services and project management costs over the course of the project
implementation, mainly as the result of new support from other donor sources and and/or
increased Government contributions. No changes are being made to the development
objectives,       outcomes,      design,      or       scope        of      the      project.
