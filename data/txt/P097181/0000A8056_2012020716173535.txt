                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Second Phase objective is to expand access to and enhance nutritional conditions of vulnerable populations, in particular thoseaffecting growth of children under
                         five in poor urban and rural areas. The extent to which this objective is attained in the intervention areas by 2011 will be measured by: (i) an increase in overall program
                         coverage of children under five in rural areas from 15 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011; (ii) an increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among 0-6
                         month old infants by 30 percent; and (iii) at least 40 percent of pregnant women and children under five are sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing strongly and looks set to meet its development objectives. All indicators have surpassed the end of project target. The implementation of the project is
                         very decentralized and follows a strong results-based management design with the involvement of a broad range of actors and stakeholders. While the project suffered earlier from
                         insufficient funding for the national scale up, this has now been resolved and the scale up of the program has reached its targets, covering all Districts of the country. Currently, 50%

                         of children under five in rural areas are reached by the community nutrition component (compared to the end of project target of 40%). With the success of the program (supported
                         by this project), local governments are showing a growing interest in taking on a responsible role in the management of the program. This has set in motion an accelerated process of
                         capacity building and devolution of responsibilities.

                         A partnership of development agencies supports the program and conducts twice yearly joint mission in support of program implementation since 2007. Co-financing by
                         development partners is approximately 4% of expenses. The CLM and USAID are in a process to enhance coordination between the Nutrition Enhancement Program and the
                         USAID-funded Feed the Future project. In December 2010, the partners set up a donor group for nutrition to coordinate their programmatic support efforts more efficiently. Senegal
                         joined the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement in April 2011 and participated at the UN General Assembly in New York City on September 20 and 21, 2011. Senegal's status as a
                         reference country for nutrition policy and program implementation has been further illustrated by an exchange visit by a Malawi delegation with the objective to learn from the Senegal
                         experience.
