The\n            additional credit will help implement modified and\n            additional project activities which cannot be funded under\n            the initial project, specifically: (i) the expansion of\n            nutrition activities to scale up the project's impact\n            and development effectiveness under component one\n            (community-based nutrition) and component three (support for\n            implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the nutrition\n            development policy); and (ii) the financing gap for\n            multisectoral pro-nutrition activities under component two\n            (multisectoral support for nutrition)."}, "docdt": "2012-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
