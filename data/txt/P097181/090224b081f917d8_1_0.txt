                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Second Phase objective is to expand access to and enhance nutritional conditions of vulnerable populations, in particular thoseaffecting growth of children under
                         five in poor urban and rural areas. The extent to which this objective is attained in the intervention areas by 2011 will be measured by: (i) an increase in overall program
                         coverage of children under five in rural areas from 15 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011; (ii) an increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among 0-6
                         month old infants by 30 percent; and (iii) at least 40 percent of pregnant women and children under five are sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to perform well. The implementation is very decentralized and follows a strong results-based management design with the involvement of a broad range of
                         actors, sectors and stakeholders. Currently, over 70% of children under five in rural areas are reached by the community nutrition interventions. With the success of the program
                         (supported by this project), local governments are showing a growing interest in taking on a responsible role in the management of the program. This has set in motion an accelerated

                         Since 2009, following successive external shocks, the program has been scaling up community screening and treatment and is adding a focus on strengthening resilience by
                         addressing the basic causes of malnutrition. The Bank is supporting the broader scope of the program through the additional financing approved in March 2012.
