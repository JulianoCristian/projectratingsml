                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Second Phase objective is to expand access to and enhance nutritional conditions of vulnerable populations, in particular thoseaffecting growth of children under
                         five in poor urban and rural areas. The extent to which this objective is attained in the intervention areas by 2011 will be measured by: (i) an increase in overall program
                         coverage of children under five in rural areas from 15 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011; (ii) an increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among 0-6
                         month old infants by 30 percent; and (iii) at least 40 percent of pregnant women and children under five are sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has benefited from an additional financing of US$10 million equivalent from InternationalDevelopmentAgency(IDA)sources. With the additional financing, a few changes
                         were made to the results framework including new(higher) targetsandnew indicators.The new indicators reflect the stronger focus on: (i) anemia prevention; and (ii)
                         multisectoralapproachesatcommunity level toreduce vulnerability to external shocks. Apart from these changes, the overall structure of theprojectremainsthe same. Theproject is

                         So far, the project has performed very well. Theimplementationof theproject is very decentralized and follows astrong results-based management design with the involvement of
                         abroad range ofactorsand stakeholders. Currently, over 60% ofchildren under five in rural areas are reached by the communitynutritioncomponent. Withthe success of the program
                         (supported bythis project), local governments are showing a growing interest intakingon a responsiblerole in the management of the program. Thishas set in motion an accelerated
                         process of capacity buildinganddevolutionof responsibilities.
