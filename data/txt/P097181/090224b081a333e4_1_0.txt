                         The Second Phase objective is to expand access to and enhance nutritional conditions of vulnerable populations, in particular thoseaffecting growth of children under
                         five in poor urban and rural areas. The extent to which this objective is attained in the intervention areas by 2011 will be measured by: (i) an increase in overall program
                         coverage of children under five in rural areas from 15 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011; (ii) an increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among 0-6
                         month old infants by 30 percent; and (iii) at least 40 percent of pregnant women and children under five are sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets.

                         The project continues to perform well even though the implementation of the additional financing run into some administrative delays. The Government has requested an extension
                         of the closing date. Other than the delay, the implementation is very decentralized and follows a strong results-based management design with the involvement of a broad range of
                         actors and stakeholders. Currently, 70% of children under five in rural areas are reached by the community nutrition interventions. With the success of the program (supported by
