                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Second Phase objective is to expand access to and enhance nutritional conditions of vulnerable populations, in particular thoseaffecting growth of children under
                         five in poor urban and rural areas. The extent to which this objective is attained in the intervention areas by 2011 will be measured by: (i) an increase in overall program
                         coverage of children under five in rural areas from 15 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011; (ii) an increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among 0-6
                         month old infants by 30 percent; and (iii) at least 40 percent of pregnant women and children under five are sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets.

                         The project continues to perform well. One Project Development Objective (PDO) indicator out of four has not yet reached its target. Similarly, just one out of 16 intermediate
                         outcome indicators still has not reached the end-of-project target. Both indicators are new indicators that were added with the additional financing in 2012.

                         The implementation of Component 1 on Community-Based Nutrition is very decentralized and follows a strong results-based management design with the involvement of a broad
                         range of actors, sectors and stakeholders. Over 70% of children under five in rural areas are reached by the community nutrition interventions. With the success of the program
                         (supported by this project), local governments are showing a growing interest in taking on a responsible role in the management of the program. This has set in motion an accelerated
                         process of capacity building and devolution of responsibilities. Since 2009, following successive external shocks, the program has been scaling up community screening and

                         treatment and is adding a focus on strengthening resilience by addressing the basic causes of malnutrition, notably in the area of food security. The Bank is supporting the broader
                         scope of the program through the additional financing approved in March 2012.

                         Component 2 which focuses on supporting line ministries, in particular health and education, but since 2013 also agriculture, has fared very well. The focus of Component 2 is to
                         mainstream nutrition in their package of services that can be monitored and evaluated. Both health and education have integrated nutrition services into their programs. For
                         agriculture, the work is still in progress.

                         Under Component 3 there have been many developments. The Cellule de Lutte contre la Malnutrition (CLM) is the lead agency for policy development and coordination. Under the
                         CLM's leadership, nutrition has been successfully incorporated in the successive national development plans, most recently, the "Plan Senegal Emergent" (Plan for an Emerging
                         Senegal). National surveys for nutrition have been conducted in 2010/11, 2012 and 2013, with the 2012 going as far as providing representative data at the level of the
                         "DÃ©partement" (in addition to the Regional level which is where most surveys stop) and thus allowed for far greater flexibility in evidence-based program planning. In 2011, Senegal
                         joined the international Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement, and in 2013 it joined the New Alliance for Food and Nutrition Security led by the G8. Under these global partnerships,
                         Senegal conducts regular reviews and coordination meetings, and receives numerous South-South learning exchange delegations. In 2013, the CLM has started a consultative
                         process of updating the policy letter as well as the development of a new strategic plan.
