The objectives of the project were to raise the\n            health status of the population in Kaltim and Nusa Tenggara\n            Barat (NTB) by improving service coverage and quality in the\n            project provinces, increasing efficiency in the use of\n            available resources, encouraging greater resource\n            mobilization at the province level, and strengthening\n            institutional capabilities for management and service\n            delivery at the provincial and central levels. The\n            performance of the Bank was highly satisfactory. Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (i) local government involvement is vital\n            to the success of any decentralization effort; (ii) greater\n            transparency in the use of authority, especially in\n            assignment of responsibility and accountability, were also\n            key factors in success with decentralization; (iii) the\n            results of the study were delayed and not available in time\n            to effect the project outcome, although the knowledge of\n            household behavior provided by the study will be useful in\n            assessing demand for health services in future projects; and\n            (iv) the attractive and effective rehabilitation of the old\n            hospital at Mataram could be instructive for future project design."}, "docdt": "1996-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
