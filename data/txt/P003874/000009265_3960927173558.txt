MENORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
O-F ThIE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEO?MENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED L-AN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR&A THIRD, HEATH PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$43.5 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years'
grace, at the standard variable interest rate, and would help finance the
Third Health Project.
2.       Background.  Indonesia has achieved considerable progress in the
health sector during the last two dec&des. Life expectancy at birth has risen
from 42 years in the mid 1960's to 56 years in 1985 and the infant mortality
rate has been halved from around 138 per thousand live birthr in the mid
1960's to around 70 in 1985. These improvements were associated with a
substantial expansion in government-financed community and preventive health
programs which took place during the oil boom. However, since 1982, as a
consequence of the sharp decline in real oil prices and the resulting fiscal
adjustments, central government spending on health fell by 45% in real terms
between the Government of Indonesia (GOI) FYs 1982/83 and 1987/88. The
severity of this decline has impaired the sector's ability to maintain the
momentum of health improvement and has highlighted a number of key sectoral
issues.
3.    The issues are: (a) the declining levels of central government
expenditure which have meant a virtual halt on capacity expansion and a
deterioration in the quality of health facilities and services; (b) the modest
poverty alleviation impact of health sector interventions, with the Outer
Island provinces and the rural areas, in general, having higher mortality and
morbidity rates than national averages, and lower utilization of services than
urban dwellers and insured persons; a contributory factor has been the
regressive interregional distribution of central spending; (c) a significant
reallocation of spending priorities away from communicable disease control
programs to curative services, and a growing imbalance between personnel and
non-personnel expenditures; (e) low productivity and maldistribution of health
manpower; (f) fragmentation of funding sources and limited local government
responsibility for planning and budgeting for the health sector despite GOI's
commitment to decentralization; (g) low resource mobilization; and (h)
inadequate sector management.
4.       Government Sector Strategy.  GOI is aware of the above problems and
has formulated a development strategy for the period 1989/90 - 1993/94
(Repelita V) to deal with the major sector issues. The key policy elements
are: (a) increased levels of funding and priority to be given to preventive
and promotive health activities and improving the nutrition status in the less
privileged areas where the problems are greatest; (tC improving the quality of
health services through better management of resourcek  (including manpower
training and provision of adequate personnel), emphasis on operations and
maintenance (O&N) and strengthening the hospital services as part of the
referral system; (c) optimizing the use of financial resources through
decentralized integrated planning and budgeting with more responsibility given
to local governments; and (d) stimulating greater resource mobilization
through a balanced financing plan in terms of budgetary allocations from all
sources, adju' ing fee structures selectively, providing central subsidies
based on locv.. revenue capacity and encouraging fee retention at health
facilities for O&M requirements. The last two policies, in particular,



-2
reflect a major shift in GOI strategy since it is the first time explicit
recognitton has been given to financing issues, including the more efficient
use of public resources and increased resource mobilization. GOI has prepared
a Health Policy Statement which provides the Repelita V policy framework for
the proposed project, and an Action Plan outlining the specific measures to be
implemented. The policy statement indicates that the provinces of Kaltim and
NTB have been chosen as pilot regiorn' for the accelerated implementation of
these policies.
5.       Rationale for Bank involvement.  Bank support would reinforce GOI's
strategy and Bank assistance in the medium term would be to support an
increased level of health expenditures. This would be directed towards: (a)
restructuring GOI expenditures towards community and preventive health
programs which have the greatest impact on decreasing infant and maternal
morbidity and mortality as well as the fertility of mothers, and which are of
greatest benefit to the poor; (b) promoting more effective use of resources,
improving the quality of health services and supporting decentralization
efforts; (c) assisting Government to mobilize additional resources for the
sector; and (d) strengthening the institutional capabilities of MOH and the
local governments to plan, manage and implement projects and programs. The
institutional weaknesses have become evident based on the experience of the
on-going projects (Loans 2235-IND, 2542-IND and 2636-IND) where effective
implementation has been constrained due to lack of institutional capacity.
6.       As policy adjustments and institutional changes are necessarily
difficult to achieve, Bank assistance would be selective and phased over a
long period. The proposed project is the first phase of the above strategy,
since it helps sustain required expenditures for priority health programs in
two Outer Island provinces, provides institutional support and would
operationalize and test at the provincial level some of the principal
adjustments related to decentralization and resource mobilization before they
are proposed for wider national application. As other future operations will
continue the focus on financial and decentralization adjustments, a shiZt
towards more policy based lending is envisaged. However, as management
capacity will be a major constraint in the sector, each future operation will
also include specific actions to strengthen sector management.
7.       Project Objectives.  The project objectives are to improve the
delivery of health services to raise the health status of the people in the
provinces of Kaltim and NTB and improve sector management througb.: (a)
improving service coverage and quality; (b) implementing policy measures, on a
pilot basis, for increasing efficiency in the use and availability of
resources; and (c) strengthening institutional capabilities at the local
government and central levels. Kaltim and NTB were chosen because of their
differing health status indicators, socio-economic conditions, resource base
and the interest of the local governments in initiating policy reforms. The
provinces would provide differing models for policy adjustment that may have
wider replication in future operations.
8.      Proiect Description.  In line with the objectives, the project
consists of: (a) sector expenditure program support; (b) policy support for
decentralization and resource mobilization measures; and (c) sector management
improvements.
9.       The project supports the Regelita V health sector expenditure
prgoams in Kaltim and NTB which have been reviewed and are acceptable to the



- 3 -
Bank. The project would give priority to improving health programs expected
to reduce infant and maternal morbidity and mortality as well as fertility.
Specifically, the project consists of strengthening promotive and preventive
health services with emphasis on programs such as immunization, diarrhea
control, nutrition and family planning; improving and expanding coverage of
priority Communicable Disease Control programs; improving health
infrastructure (including subhealth centers, health centers and provincial and
district hospitals); and providing assistance for supporting programs such as
training, health education, drug management and control, and rural water
supply and sanitation. Bank financing would be provided for equipment,
furniture, materials, civil works, vehicles, training, technical assistance
and incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis.
10.      Fundamental policy reforms are necessarily a long-term effort. The
project supports the implementation, on a pilot basis, of reforms which would:
(a) provide for an integrated budgeting framework and decentralize
responsibility for planning, budgeting and management of sectoral resources
from the central to the local government level; and (b) improve resource
mobilization through a number of measures. These include the return of all
health sector revenues to the sector, selective upward adjustments in tariffs
(taking into account ability to pay), variable central government subsidies
and the retention of fees in health facilities. The project would provide
significant amounts of training and technical assistance to strengthen staff
capabilitL.s to implement, as well as monitor and evaluate the policy
adjustmetits.
11.      Sector management improvements to be supported under the project
includes strengthening institutional responsibilities at the local govertment
level in line with decentralization policies, and developing the capabilities
of the BOP in MOH.  In line with decentralization, primary responsibility for
project management and implementation.would rest with the heads of the
Provincial Health Administrations. They would be assisted by provincial
Project Secretariats headed by Executive Secretaries.  The central MOH would
have a similar Project Secretariat to provide policy and technical advice to
the provinces and for coordination with the Bank. Assistance would also be
provided under the project to strengthen BOP to monitor and evaluate all
externally assisted projects, pla.a and prepare future projects, and coordinate
donor assistance in the sector. An Inter Agency Coordination Committee has
been established to ensure intra and inter-sectoral coordination. The project
would finance the necessary training, technical assistance and other
operational support for the above.
12.      The project is estimated to cost a total of US$103.5 million of which
US$25.8 million is expected to be in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan
of US$43.5 million would finance about 43% of the net project cost. The
technical assistance component in the project would be co-financed by the
Japan Grant Facility (US$4 million). The Australian International Development
Assistance Bureau would finance the rural water supply and sanitation
component (US$4.3 million) in the island of Lombok in NTB with additional
assistance for the Repelita V period under discussion with GOI. In the
interim, allocations have been made in the financing plan for GOI funding for
the component. Cost estimates and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. The timetable of key events of project processing is summarized
in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is shown in
Schedule D. Maps of the project provinces are attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report is being distributed separately.

13.      Actions Agreed.   During negotiations, the Government agreed on the
follo-wing: (a) the Health Policy Statement and Action Plan and that the Action
Plan would be carried out according to the schedule for its implementation;
(b) composition and financing plans for the Repelita V expenditure programs
for the project provinces; (c) annual review of the provincial integrated
health plans and budgets with the Bank; (d) as condit4ons of disbursement: (i)
land acquisition, adequate payment of compensation and rehabilitation for the
nine families residing on and/or cultivating the site for the construction of
the Balikpapan hospital; (ii) land acquisition and adequate payment of
compensation to the owner for the expansion of the Mataram hospital on a site
acceptable to the Bank; and (e) the establishment of Project Secretariats
headed by Executive Secretaries (already appointed) at the provincial and
central levels.
14.      Benefits.  The major benefit of the project would be greater coverage
and efficiency in health service delivery, improved technical quality of
programs, additional resources for the sector and better project management
through decentralized health administration in two Outer Island provinces.
Although difficult to quantify, this is expected to lead to substantial
reductions in morbidity and mortality of the poki-lation in the preject areas.
Additional benefits would be the opportunity to replicate the decentralization
and resource mobilization policy changes once they have been tested, and
improvements in the institutional capacity of BOP.
15.      Risks.   The principal risk is that the goals of decentralization and
accompanying gains would not be fully realized given the limited management
capacity and the difficulties inherent in attempting to implement policy and
procedural innovations. There is also the risk that unless there are
concomitant improvements in the quality of services, cost-recovery measures
could lead to a decrease rather than an increase in health service
utilization. Significant assistance to strengthen the capabilities of the
local government and central level staff to implement these reforms, a gradual
phasing of the policy measures and selective targeting of cost recovery
measures would minimize these risks. Additionally, the annual review of work
programs and budgets would also allow for corrections to ensure project
success.
16.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
