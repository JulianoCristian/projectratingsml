        help restore economic activity disrupted by the recent\n            emergency through enhanced access by the private sector to\n            critical imports. The Credit supports the restoration of\n            assets and production levels immediately after the civil\n            disturbances that seriously disrupted the Borrower's\n            economy during 2001 by providing immediate financing for a\n            positive list of imports identified as necessary to an\n            effective recovery program while supporting macroeconomic\n            objectives by providing financing for the budget. It also\n            encourages resource mobilization from the donor community as\n            a whole by setting an example of rapid assistance. While\n            this type of operation does not include conditionality\n            linked to macroeconomic policies, IDA/Bank monitoring of\n            economic developments and close collaboration with the IMF\n            will help ensure adequate macroeconomic and fiscal diligence\n            on the part of the Government."}, "docdt": "2001-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
