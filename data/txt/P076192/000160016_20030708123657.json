The objective was to support the\n            restoration of assets and production levels immediately\n            after the civil disturbances which had damaged the economy\n            in mid- to late 2001. Specifically, the EERC financed 10-15\n            percent of the incremental external financing gap for 2001\n            and helped increase imports of critical goods. In addition\n            to the general improvement in macroeconomic indicators, the\n            EERC encouraged other donors to commit funds to FYR\n            Macedonia. Project sustainability is likely. The overall\n            performances of both the Bank and the Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. Two lessons derived from the project\n            experience are cited: 1)   An Emergency Economic Recovery\n            Credit provides a fast way to deliver urgently needed\n            financial support through an investment channel in\n            post-conflict environments.: The EERC was an appropriate\n            vehicle because the funds were urgently needed. The funds\n            were not linked to reforms, because neither was there time\n            to negotiate reforms nor was there a political climate\n            conducive to policy change. 2) A quick disbursing ERL type\n            project can be justified even if the recovery program is\n            eventually sidetracked. :. The macro framework became\n            sidetracked in the fervor leading up to the September  2002\n            elections. However, the activity of the EERC operation not\n            only led to additional funding (US$  25 million from the\n            Government of the Netherlands), it kept the donor community\n            engaged and  encouraged them to make substantial commitments\n            in March 2002. Though the program went off  track, the\n            donors had a defined program to work with, which might\n            facilitate future disbursements."}, "docdt": "2003-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
