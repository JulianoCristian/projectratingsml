                      Romania: Social Sector Development Project
                                     (Loan 4616-RO)
                         Proposed Restructuring of Project and
                             Amendment of Loan Agreement




 1.     Background: The Social Sector Development project (SSD) was approved by
the Board on June 14, 2001. Since that time disbursements have been very slow,
amounting to only US$ 1.06million as of December 19,2003.

2.      The slow disbursements have reflected three main realities:       (i) tight fiscal
frameworks in 2001 and 2002 resulted in very small budgetary authorizations for the
SSD; (ii) priority within the foreign financing budgetary framework of the Ministry of
Labor, Social Security & Family (MMSSF) was given to the completion of the
Employment & Social Protection Project (ESPP) (Loan 3849-R0), which closed on
September 30, 2003; and (iii) as a result of reforms to the unemployment fund supported
through the Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL) (Loan 4489-RO) process, the much
improved financial position of the fund has enabled the MMSSF to finance Labor
Redeployment Program (LRP) from its own resources rather than drawing down fiom the
SSD loan proceeds.

3.      Since Board presentation, although the development objectives of the SSD remain
unchanged, the priority activities and investments required to achieve them have changed
as discussed below, particularly as Romania is embarking on the process towards
European Union (EU) accession.          Bank staff have fully evaluated these changed
investment priorities, which are consistent with the original development objectives.
Moreover, the Government has allocated a fully adequate budget for the SSD for 2004,
enabling a loan disbursement of up to US$ 17.0million. The MMSSF has dedicated itself
to the full and timely implementation of the SSD once restructured according to the
paragraphs below. There are no changes in implementing agencies.

4.      The SSD is currently rated unsatisfactory in terms of implementation progress,
although the MMSSF is in compliance on audit reports and the great majority of legal
covenants.

5.      Proposed Restructuring: The Government has requested the Bank to restructure
the SSD, combined with an extension of the closing date by 12 months duration, namely
until June 30,2007. The key elements of the proposed restructuring are as follows:

   0    Reduction in the allocation of loan proceeds to the LRP from US$20.80 million to
       US$5.40 million, reflecting the ability of the unemployment fund to finance these
        services to a major extent. SSD loan funds will be used to finance business
       incubator and small business advisory services to the unemployed, including

those laid off through restructuring in the civil service, military and mining
sectors, as well as a result of privatization.

Increase in the allocation of loan proceeds to the Pension Administration sub-
component from US$6.80 million to US$9.33 million to enable the completion of
the computerized management information system initiated under the ESPP. This
system is a pre-requisite for any further attempts at reforming and strengthening
the pension system.

Reduction in the allocation of loan proceeds to the Pension Supervision
Commission (PSC) sub-component from US$1.85 million to US$1.60 million
reflecting the efficiency gains resulting from establishing the PSC initially under
the Insurance Commission.

Allocation of US$3.48 million in loan proceeds to the Occupational Hazards
Insurance (OHI), reflecting the fact that anticipated bilateral grant finance for this
activity did not materialize. Establishing OH1 is an important step towards EU
accession and meeting the relevant labor acquis.

Allocation of US$6.50 million in loan proceeds to the reform and modernization
of the adult training system begun under the ESPP, and which now needs to be
scaled-up for results. Such modernization is an important element in enabling
Romania's workforce to be more competitive and take advantage of the new
opportunities opened up by the EU accession process. This is a new sub-
component.

Allocation of US$1.72 million in loan proceeds to the National Agency of
Employment & Training (ANOFM) in order to strengthen its staff, undertake
labor market analyses and further develop adult career counseling services. This
is a new sub-component.

Allocation of US$0.88 million in loan proceeds to develop 10 pilot training
facilities (within existing adult training facilities) for the disabled, thereby also
making progress towards meeting the relevant EU acquis. This is a new sub-
component.

Reduction in the allocation of loan proceeds to Institution Building for Social
Assistance from US$7.67 million to USS5.17 million, recognizing the cost
savings from lower unit costs for information technology and a more cost-
effective system design.

Allocation of US$3.00 million in loan proceeds to the support the development of
social assistance services at the local government level in Romania. This is a new
sub-component and will be implemented according to Project Operational Manual
satisfactory to the Bank.
