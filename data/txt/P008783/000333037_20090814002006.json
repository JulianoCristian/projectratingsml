 outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            greater emphasis should have been placed on training, SSD\n            allocated 1700 staff days to training, a large allocation,\n            but even more training was needed. Principally, additional\n            training will have facilitated utilization by end-users of\n            Information Technology (IT) systems installed at their\n            level, and thereby enhanced efficiency of using the systems,\n            and reduced errors inputted. It would also have drastically\n            reduced the interval that end-users required to become\n            familiar with system procedures and thus use them more\n            efficiently, reducing pension system costs. The role of\n            local agencies in the delivery of social services is\n            critical, In providing support for local Ministry of Labor\n            and Social Solidarity (MMSS) staff and for the award of 70\n            sub-project grants, SSD was able to strengthen the technical\n            ability to deliver services to those in great need, but also\n            to: increase the breadth and quality of outreach; increase\n            the liaison between MMSS with local Non-Governmental\n            Organizations (NGOs) and other organizations of all types;\n            make available 'demonstrators' of key medical\n            equipment that patients needed for support. This increased\n            the familiarity and knowledge of this equipment, crucial for\n            many disabled patients, for a broader range of individuals.\n            Finally, the national ability to recognize disabilities, and\n            how they could be dealt with in the best way, was enhanced."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
