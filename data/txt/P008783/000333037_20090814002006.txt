F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective of the Social Sector Development Project (SSD) is to
  contribute towards increased economic growth and poverty reduction through: (i)
improving policy development, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in both poverty and



                                               ii

social protection; (ii) supporting social insurance system reform, including a multi-pillar
pension reform; (iii) facilitating labor market adjustment and micro-business
development; and (iv) strengthening the social assistance system.

  The PDOs stated in the PAD Annex 1 are slightly different and the Loan Agreement
(LA) only refer to the above 4 specific objectives. The statement in the LA is legally
binding and will be used for the assessment of the Project development objectives. For
reference, the PDO statements from all three of these sources are included in Annex 10.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomics

At project inception in 2001, Romania was emerging from a decade of erratic macroeconomic
management. Growth during the 1990s was mediocre, with GDP declining from 1997 to 1999.
Inflation, the current account deficit, and unemployment were high, while foreign direct
investment (FDI) was low. Poverty also increased sharply, with the proportion doubling to 41
percent in the second half of the 1990s. The Government that took office in December 2000 laid
plans for the reforms needed for better macroeconomic performance and eventual accession to the
European Union (EU).

As shown in Table 1, macroeconomic performance improved dramatically during the project
period, but with some important deficiencies remaining. A major driver of growth was the strong
increase in FDI, which increased to over 5 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005. Strong FDI inflows
also covered a significant portion of the growing current account deficit.

*Beginning 2004, fiscal data are based on new classification and thus are not comparable to series
before 2004.

Inflation fell dramatically, in large measure because of sound monetary policy. Poverty also
declined significantly, in large measure due to the surge in overall growth. GDP growth averaged
6.0 percent from 2001 to 2008, with some annual variation (see Figure 1, below). As shown, the
overall trend in growth for the period was modestly upward. Increased growth was principally
due to the strong increase in FDI, and Romania's EU accession on January 1, 2007.

Substantial Macroeconomic Challenges

Despite the strong growth, macroeconomic deficiencies remained and were discussed with both
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The consistent increases in both the
fiscal and current account deficits are serious problems that have reached unsustainable levels.
The country had acknowledged through the entire period the need to strengthen government
revenues because the growing level of SOE arrears and quasi-fiscal deficits was unsustainable. A
proportion of GDP did not grow from 2001 to 2005, but then began to increase modestly.
However, the fiscal deficit grew and reached an unsustainable level by the end of the project, in
part because of the rigidity of public expenditures and the increase in civil service salaries.1 In
October 2005, the IMF stated that its Stand-By Agreement with the country was off track, and
Romania ended the agreement with the Fund. A major additional problem was the rapid growth
of the current account deficit, seen by the Fund as unsustainable.

The government also recognized that starting in 2007, it faced a further challenge by the
requirement that it co-finance EU Structural and Cohesion Fund "SCF" grants. It consequently
established a medium term goal that revenue be enhanced by 3-4 percentage points.2 However,
due to the existing rigidity of public expenditures--mainly recurrent spending--this would prove
difficult.

Public revenue (as a percent of GDP) did not grow from 2001 to 2005, but then increased
modestly, rising from 30.2 percent in 2005 to 32.0 percent in 2008. Compared to the medium-
term goal of enhancing revenue by 3-4 points, revenue increased by just 1.8 points just as the
world-wide recession worsened.

A particularly poor economic policy action was the ambitious pre-election pension increase
program launched in November 2007. This aimed to increase gross replacement rates from 27.4
percent in October 2007, to 37.5 percent in 2008, and to 45 percent in 2009. This program
jeopardized both short and long-run sustainability of the public pension system. Bank financial

will prove difficult......in the short run......to make space for co-financing EU grants."


                                                                 2

projections indicated that, in the absence of additional pension reform, the policy decision to raise
pension levels would lead to a long term, chronic financial deficit of the public pension fund.

Sector Issues

At the time of project preparation, the government was pursuing a 4-year social protection
strategy as an element of preparing for EU accession--expected in January, 2007--and was
seeking Bank and Fund endorsement. The main parts of this strategy included:

     Policy Development, Monitoring and Evaluation: The purpose here was to develop a
        coherent framework for social protection in light of the tight fiscal constraints.
     Reform of the Social Insurance System: The context of this effort was the pension deficit
        that contributed to government fiscal deficits. Measures included changes to pension
        calculation and the establishment of a separate "private pillar."
     Promotion of Employment Growth: An effort to promote employment growth by
        improving the business climate, providing assistance to small business, creation of small
        business incubators, and micro-credit finance.
     Labor Redeployment Services: Assisting displaced workers by active interventions to
        match them to new jobs and enhance their productivity.
     Strengthening Social Assistance: The purpose here was to implement major institutional
        reform, and consolidate programs in the Ministry of Labor and Social Solidarity (MMSS)
        to reduce bureaucratic costs.

In accord with this Strategy, the World Bank and the government agreed under SSD to pursue
more comprehensive pension reform, social assistance, and labor market adjustment.

The SSD can be viewed in many ways as an effort to further develop and widen the basic reforms,
capacity building, and other efforts made under the Employment and Social Protection Project
(ESPP), which closed at the end of September 2003. To a large degree, SSD "scaled up" and
built upon the foundation laid by ESPP.

At inception, the State Pension scheme was suffering from an increased imbalance, which
contributed to state fiscal problems.          It also caused pension policy officials to raise the
contribution rate from 14 percent in 1990 to 37.5 percent in 1999, which was costly for business.
The imbalance was due to:

     A decline in the number of contributors; there were 35 percent fewer in 1999 than a
        decade earlier;3
     A parallel increase in the number of beneficiaries of 89 percent over the same interval;
        and4
     An increase in pension payments in 2007, contrary to advice provided by the Bank.

Rationale for Bank Involvement



3This was stimulated by the growing gray sector, increased evasion, and corporate restructuring.

4Of the 4.1 million beneficiaries in 1999, 2.9 million were retirees, 0.6 million survivors, and 0.6 million
disabled--many of them injured in "hazardous working conditions."

The Bank had developed a successful relationship with MMSS through a number of means, the
most important of which included: (1) the Bank was the largest financier of Social Protection
programs; and (2) the dialogue concerning, and that surrounding, the loans that provided these
funds. Much of the activity under these projects overlapped with or affected SSD. In the 5 years
prior to SSD, the relationship deepened through implementation of the ESPP, the Social
Protection Adjustment Loan, and policy elements in the Private Sector Adjustment Loan 1
(PSAL1) and the proposed PSAL 2, which was not implemented. These projects were largely
undertaken before and/or in parallel with SSD, and had an impact on the first 3 years of SSD
implementation. This is discussed in Section 2.1, Implementation, and in greater detail in Section
5.1(a), Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project development objective of the Social Sector Development Project (SSD) is to
contribute towards increased economic growth and poverty reduction through: (i) improving
policy development, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in both poverty and social protection; (ii)
supporting social insurance system reform, including a multi-pillar pension reform; (iii)
facilitating labor market adjustment and micro-business development; and (iv) strengthening the
social assistance system.

The PDOs stated in the PAD Annex 1 are slightly different and the Loan Agreement (LA) only
refer to the above 4 specific objectives. The statement in the LA is legally binding and will be
used for the assessment of the Project development objectives. For reference, the PDO statements
from all three of these sources are included in Annex 10.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDOs were not revised. However, the PDO Indicators were changed as described in Section
2.3.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The intended beneficiaries of SSD were as follows:
     The poor were to be the major beneficiaries:
             o Benefits to the poor were to include capacity-building efforts for MMSS staff
                 working to distribute MIG benefits, as well as support for the amendment and
                 expansion of the MIG Law in 2004;
     Social service agencies were to benefit from capacity building;
     Social service agencies as intermediaries for patients who were to receive SSD-funded
         care;
     Micro-credit agencies as intermediaries for small firms needing loans to increase
         employment;
     Unemployed individuals needing assistance whose unemployment resulted from the
         privatization of SOEs, as well as those discharged from the military downsized during the
         project period;
     Individuals needing employment assistance;
     Individuals needing disability assistance, including the elderly, youth at risk, and victims
         of domestic violence.



                                                 4

Agencies were intended to receive high-quality management, IT, M&E, and portfolio
management advice, inter alia, to help improve their efficacy and efficiency. This would target
individuals at the management and staff levels of: MMSS, both headquarters and the field; Anti-
Poverty Commission; National House of Pensions; National Institute for Medical Expertise and
Work Capacity Recovery; Labor Redeployment Program (until 2004); National Agency for
Employment; National Adult Training Board.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Social Sectors Development Project had four components. A brief explanation of each
component and their sub-components follows below:

    Component I: Policy Development, M&E (total estimated costs US$2.10 million) - This
    component was intended to strengthen the policy development and monitoring and evaluation
    (M&E) capacity of the government on poverty reduction and the core Ministry of Labor and
    Social Solidarity (MMSS) in social protection. The sub-components of this component were:
       o Poverty Policy Development, M&E (US$0.56 million): This sub-component
           strengthened the supported policy development and M&E capacity of the government
           by setting the Government Anti-Poverty Commission (CGAS) under the office of the
           Prime Minister;
       o MMSS Policy Development, M&E (US$0.80 million): Set-up of the Strategic
           Informatics Unit (SIU) to support the MMSS was the core purpose of this sub-
           component;
       o Project Management (US$0.49 million): Activities of the Project Coordination Unit
           (PCU) and cost of project audit was supported under this sub-component.

    Component II: Social Insurance System Reform (total estimated costs US$17.47 million)
    - This component focused on the development of a pension and social insurance system
    through the following sub-components:
       o Pension Administration (US$13.99 million): This sub-component supported the
           institutional development of the National House of Pensions & Other Social Insurance
           Rights (CNPAS);
       o Development of the Pension Supervision Commission -PSC (US$2.21 million):
           This sub-component supported the overall establishment of the PSC;
       o Occupational Hazards Insurance (US$0.58 million): This purpose of this sub-
           component was to develop and deliver an insurance scheme financed by way of a
           payroll tax to protect against occupational accidents and disease.

    Component III: Labor Market Adjustment (total estimated costs US$38.47 million):
    This component continued to support the adjustment of labor policy and programs to support
    economic reforms and had two sub-components:
       o LRP (US$26.35 million): was to provide an array of active interventions to assist
           individuals affected by labor market restructuring, particularly due to the privatization
           of state owned enterprises and the downsizing of the civil service and military;
       o Micro-credit (US$12.12 million): The establishment of 12 micro-credit agencies with
           revolving funds for the providing financing was to be assisted under this sub-
           component.

    Component IV: Social Assistance Strengthening (total estimated costs US$19.69
    million): The support of implementation of the new institutional framework for social


                                                 5

    assistance introduced under the new Law on Social Assistance was the focus of this
    component. Its three sub-components were:
       o Institution Building (US$14.18 million): This sub-component supported the
            development of institutional capacity within the social assistance system,
            rehabilitation and refurbishment of the judets level social assistance offices, provision
            of information technology and technical assistance for the roll-out of the new system;
       o Personnel Development (US$1.71. million): This sub-component was to support the
            development of training capacity with the MMSS, the preparation of curriculum for
            staff at all levels of the social assistance system and the coordination and delivery of
            training programs including the development of in-service training.
       o Communications: (US$2.05 million): The objective of this sub-component was to
            improve management communications within the social assistance system and to
            inform the public about the role of social assistance and the range of available benefits
            and services.

Major contributions were to be provided by the following co-financiers:

DFID - was to contribute US$970,000 million to strengthen staff capacity at local as well as
central social assistance offices, and support the development of communication capacity in
social assistance agencies.

EU-PHARE - was to finance under a US$4.7 million for the (i) preparation of technical
specifications and functional requirements of an integrated IT system for administration of social
assistance benefits; and (ii) institutional design for three new social assistance agencies: National
Agency for the Administration of Social Assistance Benefits, Social Inspection and the Social
Observatory.

CIDA - was to provide US$580,000 for institutional capacity building activities for the
Occupational Hazards Insurance System.


1.6 Revised Components

SSD began very slowly, with limited disbursement during the first 3 years, and as a result was
restructured in early 2004 as discussed below in Section 2.2. Three subcomponents of Component
3, two subcomponents of Component 4, and one of Component 2 started in 2004 as a result of
project restructuring, while LRP reduced, and eventually ended, its efforts under SSD. The funds
for the newly-starting sub-components, around US$17m, came principally from the downsized
LRP. Table 2 below illustrates the changes made during project restructuring and additional
details are provided in Annex 2.

As shown in Table 2 below, Components 1 and 2, initially comprising 2.7 percent and 22.5
percent of total cost respectively, began at project inception and continued through project
completion. Component 1, Poverty Policy Development and Monitoring and Evaluation, focused
on the institutional development of MMSS in addition to working directly with the Anti-Poverty
Commission (CASPIS). There was a good deal of synergy of working in the same policy area
with more than one agency.

Note: The shaded bars indicate when a particular sub-component was active.

Component 3, with 49.5 percent of initial funding, initially concentrated on the Labor
Redeployment Program (LRP). That sub-component (3.A.) was terminated in 2004 as part of
restructuring. LRP allocation was reduced at the request of the government because the new law
on unemployment allowed for increased allocation in the unemployment budget for active
measures. A successful LRP operation by the National Agency for Employment has continued
until the present.

As part of the core project goal of strengthening the institutional framework that supports delivery
of social services, component 4, with 25.3 percent of initial funding, focused on developing the
capacity of MMSS in the area of poverty as well as others including:
     Administrative arrangements for social assistance functions under the new law;
        strengthening local capacity in these areas; and
     Other wide-ranging support for social assistance management.

Component 4B which was added as part of the restructuring was comprised of a fund for the
provision of Social Services.               This component awarded 70 grants to regional and local
organizations. Original sub-components 4B and C were implemented under sub-component 4A.

1.7 Other significant changes

As described in section 2.2, SSD started out very slowly and the project was extended 3 times as
shown in Table 3 below. These extensions were implemented mainly to compensate for the very
slow progress made in the first 3 years (section 2.2 below), and to allow time for the new sub-
components to be implemented.




                                                              7

     3. February, 2008           6 months                  12-31-08

The project cost was also revised to reduce the total amount borrowed from the Bank. US$3
million was cancelled on October 22, 2008, and at project closing, the remaining undisbursed
amount of US$2 million was cancelled.

In terms of the various con-financiers, the following changes were made:

USAID ­ Support from USAID was not initially pledged under the project but was provided and
had a positive and timely impact on the achievement of the PDO. The USAID financed technical
assistance support for (i) institutional capacity building of the National Commission for Private
Pensions Supervision, assisting them in preparation and first steps of implementing the business
plan, and (ii) improvement of the legal framework for private pensions (2nd pillar), and
preparation of several related implementation norms (secondary legislation).

CIDA was meant to provide US$580,000 for institutional capacity building activities for the
Occupational Hazards Insurance System, but since the EU provided similar support under a larger
scale PHARE program, the Canadian support was no longer needed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

A. Project preparation and design:

SSD learned a great deal from earlier operations, with the most important being the lessons taken
from ESPP. In essence, ESPP provided a solid foundation upon which SSD built. For example,
ESSP established 5 regional adult training centers, and SSD extended the network to 21 local
adult training centers by project close. Similarly, the design and initial development of National
House of Pensions & Other Social Insurance Rights (CNPAS) was supported by ESSP prior to
SSD inception. Additional detail on lessons taken from earlier projects is provided in Annex 10.

The design of SSD placed an important emphasis on institutional development. As a result, an
SSD objective was to continue to support CNPAS institutional development by improving the
functions and efficiency of the agency, as follows:

     Renovating CNPAS facilities and office equipment to enhance the productivity and the
        satisfaction of its staff;
     Updating fundamental aspects of agency work by revising MIS, revising the processes of
        collection and pension assignment
     Developing a state of the art archiving system that brings the antiquated paper records
        system into the modern age
     Enhancing the capacity of staff to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative business
        practices, such as the payment of benefits
     Emphasizing Continuing Education of staff



                                                  8

Key aspects of SSD design included emphasis on:

The strongest impact occurs when quality implementation accompanies quality design. SSD
took this lesson from a wide geographic sample of Bank projects, and it was an important area of
concentration. The synergies that can be achieved across different parts of social protection are
substantial. For example, the relationship between the necessary safety net, a sound labor market,
and a pension system that does not require a subsidy--are evident. SSD Component 1--Policy
Development, M&E--addresses nearly all the major reforms in the ECA Social Protection
Strategy.

Close Stakeholder Involvement. If the project is to address the true needs of beneficiaries, it is
critical to fold stakeholder views into the project design. SSD did this consistently during project
preparation, including the viewpoints of people from all parts of the political spectrum, redundant
workers, and viewpoints learned during previous projects, and the views of trade unions as well
as pension beneficiaries and businessmen.

Sound M&E is Critical. During SSD identification, it was determined that the M&E of earlier
social protection projects was inadequate. Despite some shortcomings in its own M&E (as
described above), SSD emphasized that M&E needed to be made a key part of the entire range of
Social Protection programs.

Local Government Capacity in Social Assistance Delivery should be Stronger.
Strengthening local governments' capacity was a key aspect of the project design given their
central role in all aspects of social assistance programs, including the financing, delivery, and
targeting of services. Close involvement in the reform process and a close link to MMSS--as
well as to NGOs and other civic organizations--had the effect of enhancing the responsiveness
and accountability of service delivery.

Inclusion of Active Labor Market Programs. Well-designed and well-executed Romanian
ALMPs such as the LRP initially included in the project greatly facilitate redeployment of labor
and reduce transition social costs. To promote micro-business support by policy reform under the
planned PSAL II, LRP was modified toward implementation of more direct interventions.

Overall, the design of the project was consistent with its PDOs. However, project M&E was
weak in a number of ways. This expansive project used 10 outcome indicators and some were
vague or non-specific regarding project achievement. In addition, there was an extensive list of
output indicators (35) many of which were actually outcome indicators and many others which
were not as useful. Eighteen additional Indicators were added during the project's last supervision
mission to the ISR, considerably upgrading the quality this area, and several adjustments resulted
in a total of 26 Indicators used in this ICR to measure project achievement.

Implementation Arrangements were also deficient, which posed an obstacle to project progress in
the first 3 years. This is discussed further in Section 2.2 below. Additional details on QAE is also
provided below in Sections 2.4 and 5.1 (a).

     B. Lessons from earlier operations:

The SSD learned a great deal from earlier operations, with the most important being those taken
from the ESPP. The relationship with the ESPP is described above, and, as described in the ICR
narrative, ESPP generally provided a foundation upon which SSD built. Also, as described in



                                                  9

section 3.1 in the context of Relevance, the design of SSD is completely consistent with the ECA
Social Protection Strategy as well as that of the Bank.

The strongest impact occurs when quality implementation accompanies quality design. SSD
took this lesson from a wide geographic sample of Bank projects, and it was an important area of
concentration. The synergies that can be achieved across different parts of social protection are
substantial. For example, the relationship between the necessary safety net, a sound labor market,
and a pension system that does not require a subsidy--are evident. SSD Component 1--Policy
Development, M&E--addresses nearly all the major reforms in the ECA Social Protection
Strategy.

Close Stakeholder Involvement. If the project is to address the true needs of beneficiaries, it is
critical to fold stakeholder views into the design of the project. The SSD did this consistently
during project preparation, including the viewpoints of people from all parts of the political
spectrum, redundant workers, and viewpoints learned during previous projects, and the views of
trade unions as well as pension beneficiaries and businessmen.

Sound M&E is Critical. During SSD identification, it was determined that the M&E of earlier
social protection projects was inadequate. Despite some shortcomings in its own M&E (as
described above), SSD emphasized that M&E needed to be made a key part of the entire range of
Social Protection programs.

Local Government Capacity in Social Assistance Delivery should be Stronger.
Strengthening local governments' capacity was a key aspect of the project's design given than
importance given their central role in all aspects of social assistance programs, including the
financing, delivery, and targeting of services. Close involvement in the reform process and a
close link to MMSS--as well as to NGOs and other civic organizations--had the effect of
enhancing the responsiveness and accountability of service delivery.

Inclusion of Active Labor Market Programs. Well-designed and well-executed Romanian
ALMPs such as the LRP initially included in the project greatly facilitate redeployment of labor
and reduce transition social costs. To promote micro-business support by policy reform under the
planned PSAL II, LRP was modified toward implementation of more direct interventions.

Precede Pension Reform with Development of Institutional Capacity. This lesson was taken
into account in the design of SSD; the emphasis was to strengthen the National House of Pensions
(PSC) prior to introduction of pillars 2 and 3,5 which turned out to introduce significant delays.

     C. Risks Identified:

The major risks identified in the PAD were:
      Poor macroeconomic management would detract from project achievement:
         Macroeconomic performance during the project was discussed in section 1.1. While
         significant deficiencies remain in this area, they were not sufficient to have a major effect
         on project progress. The authorities were quite effective at managing monetary policy




5Assuming that capital market, macroeconomic, and fiscal conditions permit.




                                                  10

         during SSD, and reducing inflation. Management of fiscal policy was less successful, as
         discussed earlier, but this was not sufficient to affect SSD progress.

     Weakness in the Financial Sector Would Affect Initiation of a Private Pension
         System (Pillar II): Capital Market supervision was sufficiently strong to support all SSD
         activities. A strong positive influence in this area was the country's accession to the EU
         in 2007.

     Parliamentary Failure to Pass Required Legislation: This risk was avoided to a
         significant extent during implementation.           The major legislation to permit the
         establishment of a multi-pillar pension system was approved as required. The legislation
         required for Pension Supervision Committee (PSC) was passed, but 3 years later than
         envisioned, which caused delay and difficulty in operation of the PSC. At SSD inception,
         Parliament was in the process of approving new laws on Social Assistance and the
         Minimum Income Guarantee.

     Weak Financial Management by the PCU: The risk had been envisioned of delays in
         PMU payments to vendors, late audit reports, and other financial management issues.
         These were avoided, however. The PCU was very effective at financial management,
         and was able to avoid these problems.

The SSD was successful at avoiding nearly all of the risks identified in the PAD. However, the
risk that project implementation would be significantly delayed--due to SSD inception during a
time of government focus on completing ESPP--was not identified, a deficiency. Overall project
performance with respect to the identification of risk was good.

    D. Readiness for implementation:

The ICR rates Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory, with strengths somewhat outweighing
shortcomings. While the project was not reviewed by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG), the
project benefitted from a review by a panel of Bank experts in March 2000. This was a Quality at
Entry Review which recommended that the project be "anchored explicitly in three broader
contexts: (i) the government's own reform agenda, (ii) the Bank's broader program, and (iii) EU
Accession. The SSD was clearly linked to each of these areas, and was successful in each.

The Panel was positive about the lending instrument utilized and the timing of the project; the
latter judgment, in retrospect, was not entirely correct. The Panel was most enthusiastic about
SSD tackling pension reform, feeling that this could produce important benefits. The Panel also
suggested several important analyses, and the project team went ahead with most of the studies
recommended (see Annex 11 for list of studies completed under SSD).

The task team also articulated potential criteria for setting priorities:
    (i)      Activities on which there was some consensus (e.g., pensions)
    (ii)     Support to on-going activities which are reasonably effective (e.g., LRP)
    (iii)    Institution-building for implementation of forthcoming policy reforms
    (iv)     Pilots for possible scaling up (e.g., social assistance delivery at the local level).

These were all incorporated into the project design. One criticism of the panel was that the project
needed to be better sequenced because it was complex and segments were in a varying status of
readiness. The design of the project remained as it was, but this recommendation proved to be



                                                   11

correct during the implementation of the project because of SSD's limited ability to achieve its
goals during the initial period precisely reflecting QER's criticism.

2.2 Implementation

The implementation of SSD started out slower than expected, and implementation was rated
unsatisfactory in the Bank internal system for one of the first 3 years (late 2003-early 2004). In
large part this was because, in 2002-2003, SSD was conducted in parallel with the high-priority
ESPP, which closed in September 2003. (See section 5.1[a]) Aggregate disbursement of SSD as
of late December, 2003, was US$1.06 million in over 2 years--around 6 percent of what was
intended--with most activity primarily focused on development of the legal framework. Bank
staff appraising SSD should have recognized that government had a clear desire to emphasize
completion of the earlier project and that SSD would receive relatively little attention.

Another reason for the slow start of SSD was project complexity given the large number of
components. Also, implementation arrangements were highly complex given the large number of
GoR agencies and/or beneficiaries. For example, project activities were funded concurrently by 4
different budgets: that of the overall State (Government of Romania), the Unemployment Budget,
the Social Protection Budget, and the Bank project budget. This involved audits by 3 Courts of
Accounts and by the Bank's independent auditor. Although, during project preparation the Bank
proposed to involve a single source of funding for project activity, the GoR declined.

The progress of the project was also affected by the inconsistency of GoR progress in Sector
reform.    Although good reform progress was made during the project overall, there was
considerable variability.     For example, progress in implementation of pension reform was
hindered because of legislative delay, which caused a compression of the PPSC start-up period.
Project progress was also affected when the Government decided to terminate LRP activity
within SSD and funds were transferred to new sub-components.

A positive aspect of implementation was the decision to restructure the project in early 2004. As
a result, by the end of 2004, disbursements increased to US$7.5m and the implementation rating
was raised to satisfactory until completion. The project literally accelerated very rapidly after
restructuring: in its first 3 years, disbursements totaled US$2 million, while in the next 3½ years
disbursements were US$37.3 million.

Another positive aspect of implementation was the close coordination between different Bank-
financed operations and Government programs. SSD was implemented very closely with MMSS,
with which the project team conducted a seminar before SSD approval. Close sectoral work with
the Bank has continued until the present.

Much of the stimulus for the post-restructuring increase in reform progress can be attributed to
SSD, but not all. As noted earlier, the country was preparing for EU accession in January 2007,
and that critical moment in the country's history motivated a rapid reform in many sectors.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

SSD efforts in the M&E area were inadequate. The PAD included 10 outcome indicators and 35
output indicators. The main M&E shortcoming was that PDO indicators were weak. The original
10 PAD outcome indicators were modest, often too general or vague to convey adequate
significance. In addition, some of them were not really outcome indicators. Some of the
deficient indicators include, for example:


                                                  12

          "Improved pension administration" (number 7)
          "Improve measures to alleviate poverty" (number 14)
          "Number of M&E Reports Prepared" (number 2)

Little or no data requirements or measures were specified for any of these. Also, some PDO
indicators were interchangeable with Component measures. Likewise, approximately 5 Indicators
in addition to those in the above list were similar, or identical, to component indicators
(Indicators number 1, 14, 22, 24, and 26).

Though the November 2006 ISR recommended that the team improve the PDO indicators prior to
the next mission, this was not done until 2 years later.6 The Bank team made an effort to correct
this problem, but only at the end of the project. The additional 18 were added by ISR 137 in
2008. However, even though retrospective data were added, these indicators cannot have guided
project direction.

The collection and use of component output indicators was better, however. Their influence on
project direction can be seen in the Aide Memoires written--usually every 6 months. However,
the positive influence of the component indicators does not outweigh the overall poor assessment
of project M&E. Also, some of these component indicators were less useful.

Indicator Utilization

Actual use of M&E data to guide project direction also seems to have been weak. This ICR could
not obtain adequate information to indicate the extent to which this had taken place during the
project period.

However, the use of component indicators was much better, with progress measured regularly for
each principal component.8 These included:

         Social Assistance - data was collected on support functions--publication of the Social
         Services Guide (models of good practice);9
     Labor Redeployment Program;
     Micro Credits, Pensions (both 1st and 2nd pillars); and
     MIG and social assistance services evaluations.

For example, the most recent report on the Social Assistance component states that over 200
handbooks were distributed to people in the field, and it describes the substantial benefits that this
provided to local service providers.

This report also describes in detail the 70 sub-projects in this area funded by SSD, their
geographic distribution, and a detailed description of the criteria by which they were selected.



6This has an implication for Supervision, as well. The 2006 ISR "recommends that the team review and
adjust the PDO indicators for the next supervision mission." However, this was not done until December,
2008, when 13 indicators were added in ISR 13.
7Data for these 18, however, were collected for the intervals relevant to each indicator.

activity continued after the funding.


                                                    13

The report also presents the results of the evaluation of these sub-projects by a local university
(see Annex 10). This type of report was completed annually for each of the 4 project components.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Overall fiduciary and safeguard compliance was satisfactory. All assessments by procurement
and financial specialists rated the project as "satisfactory." And all financial reporting was
completed on time, and with no deficiencies.              No irregularities were found in any other
safeguard/fiduciary area.

There were several instances of minor procurement shortcomings. These were attributed to
disbursement and procurement delays, which were either outside the purview of the PCU, or were
minor and remedied as quickly as possible.10

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

SSD was central to the Government of Romania's program of Social Protection reform, and the
project encouraged a very close relationship between the Bank and the pertinent agencies. This
facilitated the intensification of government involvement in each aspect of the project, and staff
undertook or maintained responsibility well before the project ended. The project was planned as
a "turn-key" operation, and was executed that way. O&M was the government's responsibility,
and was included in government budgetary plans at project completion. Finally, the close Bank-
country relationship contributed to continued Bank involvement in reform, as did Romania's
entry into the EU, and this seemed likely to encourage successful government operation of Social
Sector projects.

In one case, the ongoing Social Inclusion Project, a new Bank-financed project was the result of
SSD. The Social Inclusion Project was based on the good results of the SSD Social Assistance
Services component, and is supporting delivery of such services on a larger scale for targeted
groups of beneficiaries (youth at risk, and victims of domestic violence), under similar
competitive arrangements to those developed under the SSD. As a result of the close Bank-
government relationship, this has sometimes been the case in the context of the Romanian Social
Sector.

It should also be noted that a 300 million DPL was approved less than six months after SSD
closed, with one objective being to target social protection mechanisms in a highly-constrained
fiscal environment.11 This was planned as the first of three single-tranche DPLs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

SSD was a highly relevant project at time of inception, aimed at the principal goals of both the
Bank and the Borrower (discussed in next 2 paragraphs). Also, SSD reflected a very sound
diagnosis of the country's development needs. At inception, unemployment was high, and the




10Most procurement delays were related to the government`s preference to function under an earlier set of
Bank procedures, which were exceedingly complex and sometimes caused confusion.
11Social Protection was one of three sectors in the operation.


                                                     14

need for employment services was rising due to closing of mines and former SOEs, and the
declining size of the Romanian military services.

The scope of SSD was also completely consistent with the FY02-04 CAS, which focused on the
broad themes of poverty and EU accession. Poverty reduction was the heart of the project, which
also concentrated on strengthening government policy for poverty reduction as well as assistance
to rural areas. This very broad and diverse project also focused on strengthening the delivery of
social services, assistance to the unemployed, and in particular on bolstering the institutional
framework that provided critical social services to the poor. Finally, SSD supported government
progress on the 2000-2003 strategy for social protection that it prepared as required for EU
accession.12

SSD remains highly relevant at the time of this ICR. With regard to the Bank, project PDOs are
very much in parallel with Bank strategies in the Social Protection Sector.13 The Bank's Strategy
emphasizes:

    Labor markets and job creation, including promoting active labor market policies to
        match skills with demand, and emphasize job search and placement;
    Assistance for pensions and old-age income support. Analytic tools have been developed
        and are widely used to evaluate the long-term fiscal implications;
    Social safety nets;
    Community-driven development community-based risk management; and,
    Disability and development.

Of these five areas, SSD was almost completely comprised of 1, 2, 4, and 5. The project put a
strong emphasis on job search and placement, active labor market measures, a broad program of
pension support, and strengthening capacity in both community development and disability.

SSD is also in parallel with two of three pillars of the FY2006-2009 Country Partnership
Strategy: (i) addressing fiscal vulnerabilities and modernizing the public sector; (ii) targeting
poverty reduction and promoting social inclusion. Both of these were components of SSD.
During this period, Romania's entire polity was consumed with successfully entering the EU,
which Romania did in 2007. One of the goals of SSD was to help Romania improve the fiscal
status of its public pension system, a concern that was specifically identified by the EU prior to
Romania's entry. Finally, SSD strongly addresses the corporate strategies of helping to alleviate
poverty and assist people with special needs.

As a final point, in 2008, the government adopted a new Social Protection Strategy.14 This
strategy was almost identical to SSD. Stated differently, the government adopted SSD's design
as its policy.




12 The Bank and the IMF endorsed the strategy as a required step in the accession process.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall Achievement
Overall SSD Achievement was satisfactory, as shown in Figure 2, below. This figure displays the
Percent of Achievement of project Targets for the 26 indicators. Data for one indicator could not
be obtained.15

Of the 25 for which data could be obtained, all except two (Indicators 10 and 15) show Target
achievement of at least 95 percent.16 Nine show that 100% of the Target was achieved, three are
slightly below that, while nine are above 100%--one at 144%. In essence, these data show that
overall project achievement was strong.

A detailed assessment of the achievement of each of the four PDOs is discussed in the sections
that follow.

Indicator 10, at 67 percent, reflects the extent to which the project was successful at reducing the
deficit in the pension system, measured as a percent of GDP. The baseline deficit was -0.87
percent in 2001, and the target was zero--or an improvement of 87 "basis points." The deficit
actually reached zero in 2006 and 2007, but then increased to -0.29 percent by project end. At
least part of the reason the deficit increased in 2008 was the worldwide recession and the
November, 2007, increase in pension payments,17 but SSD could also have had a role.

Data not shown in Figure 2 are for indicators that had a second measure of achievement.
Indicator 3 reached 167 percent of this measure, and Indicator 29 reached 125 percent of its
second measure.

A small number of intended pension reforms were not achieved. These included the "unification
of male and female retirement," which meant that the retirement ages of 65 for men and 60 for
women stayed as they were. The increased male retirement age--also a reform being sought--
was not achieved.




15Indicator 27, Jobs Created Through Micro-Credits. No target was set for this Indicator.
16No targets were changed at any time.
17This policy decision is described in section 1.1.


                                                   16

It should also be noted that Supervision was assessed positively during the entire project (section
5.b.) Many positive judgments were received on the considerable expertise provided in pensions,
use of the Bank's PROST model for poverty analysis, and expert advice on improving the quality
of management.

A detailed assessment of the achievement of each of the four PDOs is discussed in the sections
that follow.

PDO (i): "to improve the Borrower's capacity in policy development, monitoring and
evaluation in the areas of poverty reduction and social protection."
The SSD was satisfactory in the achievement of objective (i). This was achieved, in part, with the
substantial improvement of M&E capability of the Anti-Poverty Commission (CASPIS), as well
as that of other economic policy agencies. By 2005, CASPIS was able to conduct thorough
poverty reports, using the methodology jointly developed by CASPIS and the Bank.                 The
accuracy of the reports for 2005 and 2006 were validated by the Bank, and the reports were
completed in a timely manner. In 2007, CASPIS was incorporated into the Social Inclusion Unit
of MLFEO, so its methodology could be shared with other agencies.

SSD also addressed poverty reduction through its assistance to MMSS in the updating of the MIG
law in 2004, and by strengthening the units of MMSS that distributed MIG payments.

It is likely that some part of the fall in poverty and other macroeconomic progress was achieved
through the improved policy toward poverty reduction, although neither the consistent decline in
poverty during the project nor the rise in income (see data in Section 1.1) can be attributed
directly to SSD.

PDO (ii): "to support a social insurance system reform, including the development of a
multi-pillar pension system."

Achievement of PDO (ii) is considered highly satisfactory. As discussed later in this section, the
11 Indicators of this PDO averaged achievement of 98.7% of their Targets.

Public Pension Reform--In support of the public pension fund, SSD supported installation of
data systems, and training in their use, that had major benefits. These included:

      Worker pension contribution records were scanned, digitizing the data and making the
         effort to retrieve information substantially more efficient. The digitized data is housed in
         the National Archives.
      Using this data, the agency utilized IT systems procured under the project.               This
         increased both the efficiency of this process as well as the accuracy of the data used.
      Each contributor was sent an annual report on the status of their account.18
      Responses to contributor inquiries were made within 45 days--60-70 percent more
         quickly than had been the case before SSD.
      The IT systems were fundamental in allowing the pension system--as well as other
         MMSS systems--to be decentralized, and to devolve responsibility to local offices.




18Reports were not sent in 2006, 2007, or 2008 due to budgetary limitations.




                                                   17

Private Pension Funds--In support of PDO (ii), a key project goal was establishment of "sound
regulation and supervision of private pension funds."19 As described in greater detail below,
support was provided to three pillars:
      Pillar I, a reformed public pillar
      Pillar II, a privately-managed mandatory pension fund
      Pillar III, voluntary private funds

The Pension Supervision Commission (PSC), an autonomous regulatory agency that is
subordinate to the Parliament, was established for the purpose of "sound regulation" in
December, 2005--3 years later than envisioned--in accord with legislation passed earlier that
year. The late PPSC start was due to government delay regarding the legislation, and this
contributed to a compressed interval during which PPSC could build adequate capacity to
exercise a very broad responsibility.

The support of PSC was very successful (PSC also received independent support from USAID).
The project provided hardware, software, and training for IT, as well as on-site training to PSC
staff in organizational and managerial functions. Pension records were scanned under the SSD,
and the data kept in a more efficient and safer way. This increase in efficiency and accuracy of
data provided a foundation for decentralizing many functions, which was achieved under SSD.

It is useful to note that, in 2008, Romanian private pension funds were the only ones in the region
to achieve a positive return. While Romanian gains were 11 percent (on an annual basis), other
Central European private pension funds saw a negative return of between -6 and -23 percent in
2008.20

The design and initial development of the National House of Pensions and Other Social Insurance
Rights (CNPAS) was supported by the ESSP, prior to SSD operation (or, in some cases, during
its first 3 years of implementation).

As noted, support was provided to three pillars: Pillar I, a Reformed Public Pillar; Pillar II, a
privately-managed state pension fund, in which individuals can choose in which of the 18 current
funds they wish to invest; and Pillar III, voluntary private funds (of which there are 12).

Pillar II has only recently been established, and consequently, funds were being invested--but not
yet paid as benefits. Pillar III has made the least progress, and has just been organized.

Pillar II officials were taken on Study Tours to countries with similar systems, including Poland,
the Netherlands, and France. These trips were outstanding in terms of enhancing managers'
ability to identify successful and unsuccessful agency functions and policies.             Managers
interviewed stated that these tours were extremely helpful in developing the efficiency of PPSC
procedures.

It should be noted that, in accordance with the law, PPSC could and did select successful fund
managers of any nationality to manage individual funds, and         PPSC negotiated contracts with

fund managers. Most importantly, the competitive results of the yield on each fund are published
monthly. Additional details on Pillar II funds are provided in Annex 10.

The Bank also supported a Public Awareness Campaign for the PSC; privately-managed funds
had not existed earlier, and their establishment and, most importantly, details on the steps they
needed to follow, needed to be explained to contributors and future beneficiaries. Public surveys
documented that these campaigns reached and successfully increased public consciousness of
these new approaches, and adequate knowledge of the future options they would have, and the
procedures they would need to follow. The total number of "information guides" distributed by
PSC was around 67,000, with an additional 39,000 flyers.

Bank assistance to the PPSC was very successful: initial agency establishment; development of a
first set of regulations,21 agency operating procedures, refurbishment of facilities and acquisition
of office equipment; and, as noted earlier, software and hardware systems and staff training.

Achievement of Pension System Indicators

SSD utilized 11 indicators to measure the progress of the pension system--PDO indicators 5
through 10, and Intermediate Outcome Indicators 1-5 (Data Sheet). Of these, nine reached at
least 100 percent of their targets, with the 10th reaching 67 percent. Weighted equally, these 11
reached an average of 102.8 percent of their targets.

A key SSD indicator for PDO (ii) was number 5, "higher collection rates." The ratio of pension
collections to payments was used as a proxy to measure this. At project inception in 2001, the
ratio was 91.4 percent, with a target of reaching 95.3 percent by project completion. The ratio
reached 97.4 percent by project end, with the percent of target achievement thus 102 percent. All
indicators are shown in graphical form in Figure 2.22

In rating the achievement of PDO (ii), the above minor flaws were considered to have a
negligible weight considering the huge importance of what was achieved by SSD in the pension
area.

PDO (iii) "to facilitate labor market adjustment and micro-business development"

SSD was satisfactory in the achievement of PDO (iv). As discussed in section 1.1, there were
enormous exogenous influences with a positive effect on labor market adjustment during SSD:
rapid GDP growth, a monotonic decline in the unemployment rate (2001-2008), a surge in FDI,
and EU accession.

However, it is likely that SSD contributed to labor market adjustment:

Labor Redeployment Program (LRP). While LRP was operating within SSD, "business
incubator services" were provided to 4,689 individuals exiting the military, of which 317


21 Management stated that around 30 regulations were promulgated for each pillar--nearly 100 in total--
from the fall of 2006 to the present.
22Goal was to have Pension Fund receipts and payments balanced at deficit of 0% of GDP. This was not
achieved, as deficit for 2008 was -0.20%, and was expected to grow in 2009. While percentage of
achievement could not be conventionally calculated since target was zero, estimate was made of progress
from deficit of -0.87% in 2001 to -0.29% by project completion, and thus 58 "basis points," or 58%.


                                                   19

successfully started their own businesses, and were employed by them. During the same
interval, 521 clients in the civil sector received start-up advice, and 37 were successful.
During the same interval, 1,256 rural individuals were successfully placed into positions.

LRP was terminated within SSD in 2004 as part of restructuring, and was subsequently operated
successfully by the National Agency for Employment. The rationale provided for this was that
the new unemployment law allowed for increased allocation for active measures in the
unemployment budget, and some of the funds were spent in this way in SSD.

Micro-Credit: Micro-credit in Romania was non-existent until the World Bank begin to support
the preparation of this project. In the Micro-credit (MC) area, all 7 regional MC Funds that
opened under the project are fully operational and continue to provide micro-loans within the
current revolving phase. To date, 2,040 micro-loans have been made, with an average size of
US$ 6,796 and a total amount loaned of US$13,863,734 million.

By gender, the number of micro loans granted to women comprised around 28.7 percent of the
number of loans and nearly the same proportion of total funds loaned. By sector, the loans funds
were granted predominantly to agriculture, 82.3 percent, with 5.5 percent loaned to agricultural
services, 9.8 percent to trade, and 3.3 percent to industrial production.

The micro-credits created, or supported, 4,244 jobs. This amounts to around US$3,270 of loans
for each job. The repayment rate is very impressive. As would be expected of micro-credit
organizations, organizational allegiance is high with a reported repayment rate of 100 percent.

The future prospects of the Micro-credit funds are uncertain. Though they will stay afloat for the
next few years by re-lending funds that are repaid, beyond that no assurance of their continued
function is assured. When the system was initially established, a Romanian bank offered to
purchase the entire new system. While the government turned that offer down, there have been
no offers from financial organizations since.

PDO (iv): "to strengthen the social assistance system."

SSD was satisfactory in the achievement of objective (IV). The major thrust in this area was
institutional reform and the diversification and devolution of social services. The institutional
capacity of local judet23 officials was enhanced by the development of 70 local projects that were
funded to increase local capacity to respond more effectively to needs and priorities identified at
the local level, increase community participation, and promote and strengthen partnerships
between local authorities and the NGO sector.

The UK Department of International Development (DFID), a co-financier, also made a major
contribution in this area. DFID trained 1,150 local officials and county council members in social
inclusion and other social service areas.24 (This included some of the 70 projects as well as
additional individuals). The training was based on demonstrating to local officials the processes
used for the same functions in the UK. MMSS officials reported that there was a substantial
increase in local capacity which facilitated the increased devolution of responsibility for services.



23"Judets" are the Romanian equivalent of counties; there are 42 in the country.
24As shown in Figure Y, DFID contributed US$1.71m to Personnel Development, and US$2.05m to
improved Communication (through the MIS described).


                                                  20

An accreditation structure for the Romanians to certify local officials' capacity was also
developed.

The Bank and DFID financed the evaluation of a sample of the 70 projects by a Romanian
university--Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Institute of Continuing Education. The projects,
which covered a wide variety of services, were developed based on the urgent needs of vulnerable
groups in different communities.        Researchers from the University reported the following
findings:

     beneficiaries described the projects selected as quite useful, and they were well-satisfied
        with the services delivered
     beneficiaries tend to be dependent on the services they receive
     the role of local authorities is essential in the provision of social assistance

The social services segment of the project aimed at strengthening institutional capacity of local
authorities to provide community social services that promote social inclusion and to provide
social services of all types--the most frequent of which has been social services to the elderly,
and social services projects for the protection of people with disabilities. This was a very
successful aspect of the project.

The success in promoting social inclusion is illustrated by the evaluation finding that 65.4% of
the 238 beneficiaries surveyed said that they met with other project beneficiaries "fairly
frequently" or "every time" they had therapy. This represents a major benefit to those receiving
services in the Social Sector.

Strengthening Social Assistance MIS--DFID and the Bank also collaborated in development of
an improved MIS for Social Assistance at the local level. This contributed to enhanced efficiency
and effectiveness through improved communication between MMSS and local authorities of
patient records and other information for management use.

Minimum Income Guarantee--SSD worked to enhance the performance of MMSS staff
charged with distribution of MIG payments, and also suported the government in the amendment
and expansion of the MIG law approved in 2004. At project close, DFID and the Bank jointly
supported the evaluation of MIG implementation and reached the following main conclusions:25

 "The MIG is well-targeted, has a positive impact on poverty alleviation and makes a real
    difference to the lives of the poor."
    o       "The formal poverty-impact analysis, national survey of applicants and qualitative
             interviews build a picture of an effective tool to support incomes of the poor, and that
             is appreciated by its recipients as providing help of last resort."

 "The administration of the MIG by local councils is, on the whole, effective and efficient."
     o        "Our analysis had led us to the conclusions that the MIG is: well-publicized;
              generally believed by applicants to be allocated by a fair and transparent process;
              implemented with relatively low administrative costs; and implemented without
              giving rise to a high level of complaints."

 "A system exists for the support and monitoring of local councils."
       o "Most local councils are satisfied with support and advice they receive from county
             councils who seem to be responsive to their concerns.              The monitoring system
             established by MoLSSaF and primarily operated by CDDSSFs collects data on a
             regular basis and produces monitoring reports monthly. The data collected covers
             most local councils."

The report also addresses some shortcomings, principally "local discretion" in administering the
law that makes it "likely that applicants with the same profile will be treated differently in
different localities." However, the overall evaluation is highly positive.

3.3 Efficiency

Although SSD was an investment project, it was very difficult to estimate the value of its many of
its benefits because the project covered such a wide range of areas producing hard-to-measure
benefits, or benefits that would have been expensive to measure.

Benefits could be measured by the reduction of time it took MMSS to respond to inquiries of
pension beneficiaries. While it was stated that earlier inquiries had required 4 to 6 months, SSD
management, IT, and other improvements reduced the interval to 45 days or less, a decline of 60-
70 percent.26

Over a longer study period, it would have been possible to compare private pension funds to
public funds by measuring the return on investment, and the proportion of income and payments
that were comprised of administrative costs.27

For example, institution-building efforts were undertaken among poverty policy officials, and in a
number of departments of the Ministry of Labor and Social Solidarity (MMSS), as well as in the
Department of Social Assistance components in charge of providing, or supervising, social
assistance services. Similar services were provided to the newly-established Pension Supervision
Commission (PSC).

IT hardware, software, and training were provided to a number of units of the Institute for
Medical Expertise and Work Capacity Recovery. While nearly every report on this installation
stated that the expected benefits were achieved, including the assessment of disabilities, it would
been difficult to estimate their value.




26In accord with the requirement of the new law.

27Pillar II funds had only recently been established, and their payments were much smaller compared with
assets than public funds.




                                                      22

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Considering that SSD was highly relevant (Section 3.1) and that achievement of PDOs
was rated as satisfactory, SSD is rated as achieving satisfactory outcome.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As described in various sections of the ICR, a significant portion of the project focused on
poverty, including the improvement of poverty policy (Annex 2, Component 1). Additional
emphases on poverty included the installation and training in use of the PROST model, which
enabled staff to make more accurate poverty projections, and capacity development in CASPIS,
the Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Commission (see text on achievement under PDO (i)).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

This is described in Section 3.2, above. The SSD focused heavily on providing capacity-building
services and succeeded in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of sector agencies.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The only unintended outcomes and impacts were those resulting from the sub-components that
were added after the GoR decided to withdraw LRP activities from the project. These consisted
principally of those covering Micro-credits, Adult Training Centers, and ANOFM Institutional
Development, and are described in the section 3.2 discussion of achievements related to PDO (iii),
and in the descriptions of related components (sections 3.2 and 1.6 as well as Annex 2).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.28

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate:      Risk is rated as Moderate because factors associated with low risk
considerably outweigh those associated with high risk. The risk moderate because SSD was a
central instrument of the close and successful relationship between the Bank and the country in
the social sector. The Bank made a wide range of recommendations in this area, and in most
cases the government was eager to implement them.

In a majority of interviews, the Borrower expressed its respect for the Bank's substantive
expertise in the cognizant areas--e.g., provision of social services, economic analysis of pensions,
and was also grateful for the management and technical support provided.

A positive factor reducing risk was the enthusiasm the government showed toward reform in
these areas, though it was variable during the 7 years. This was a microcosm of the swell of
support for "moving forward" during the project period. The country joined both NATO and the
EU during SSD, and was eager to move closer to the level of member countries in nearly every



28The "beneficiary surveys" referred to with respect to the provision of Social Assistance Services were
very limited in scope.


                                                    23

aspect of society. This support and the country's integration with other advanced societies
greatly reduced the likelihood that gains achieved in the social sector would be compromised
after project termination.

The highest risk the country showed was its very variable economic policy described in Section
1.1 and other sections of the ICR. As described, the increased levels of government pay and
pension payments, high Current Account Balance, and Fiscal Deficit are unsustainable.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project design was adequate overall: comprehensive, with good policy advice that the
Borrower accepted and eventually implemented.29 Regarding the establishment of IT systems
and provision of medical equipment, SSD also provided a great deal of hands-on training--to
complement the hardware--that improved Borrower efficiency in many sub-sectors. Overall, the
Bank had a strong and positive impact on the sector, and the SSD was a key part of that.

Bank performance in ensuring QAE was satisfactory in a number of other areas:
     Policy and Institutional aspects: This has been described earlier, and many officials
        described the high quality of Bank policy guidance, management advice, and training;
     Strategic Approach and Relevance: The Bank strategy was very well aligned with that of
        the government, and central to the country's needs;
     Fiduciary standards and staff competence; and
     Bank Inputs and Technical characteristics.

However, there were flaws in QAE: Project design in Monitoring and Evaluation had the
shortcoming of an insufficient number of PDO Indicators, with some deficient in quality. For
most of the project, the ten PAD indicators were the only PDO Indicators followed. This was an
inadequate number for such a sprawling project, and some were insufficient with respect to
specifying measures of project achievement as well as thresholds that would be considered
"satisfactory."

With respect to the latter, the PDO (ii) indicator, "Improved actuarial Performance," was vague
with respect to how this was to be measured. Similarly, the PDO (iv) indicator, "Improve
measures to alleviate poverty," did not provide any detail on how this could be done nor how it
could be assessed.

Project management gradually improved project indicators and tracked them carefully to assure
adequate progress. But this should have been done earlier; the 11-06 ISR recommends that PDO
indicators be reviewed and adjusted, but it was 2 years later when this was done. With the last
ISR, an additional 13 higher quality Indicators were added, and with most of these the team was
able to collect retroactive data.



29While very broad nature of the project was beneficial in extending its impact throughout the sector, it also
posed difficulties in terms of making it harder to administer.


                                                     24

While the first ten "project level" indicators were deficient, good quality data were collected at
the component level, which helped decision-making and contributed to project achievement.

Implementation arrangements were deficient. When SSD was appraised, staff observed relations
between the Ministry and Bank staff working on the ESPP.30 ESSP was, at this time, critical to
the social sector, and was in many areas a foundation for SSD. The new government strongly
emphasized completion of ESPP activities. Bank staff appraising SSD should have recognized
that government had a clear desire to emphasize the earlier project and that SSD would receive
relatively little attention. The likelihood that SSD could be completed within the stated time-
frame was negligible, and this slow start was a deficiency in QAE.

The initiation of SSD at a time when sector officials and staff were concentrating on the
completion of ESPP made it hard to utilize government systems and coordinate with institutions
where that might otherwise have been possible. The risk that ESPP requirements would absorb
nearly all the attention of policy-makers and key interlocutors was not stated in the PAD, nor
were plans suggested as to how to mitigate this risk.

In large measure as a result, SSD started very slowly, and implementation was rated
unsatisfactory for part of the first 3 years. A rough estimate is that the project was expected to
complete around 30 percent of disbursement in the first 2.5 years, but in fact completed only 6
percent.   While project complexity slowed SSD progress, the most important factor was
concurrent operation with ESPP. In early 2004 the project was restructured, and by the end of
2004 disbursements increased to US$7.5m and ratings were satisfactory until completion. o

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Supervision was good during the entire length of the project.            Many government officials
interviewed made positive comments about the Bank team, including the quality of technical
consultants. Beyond the IT area, this included: experts in pensions (on-site training in addition to
study tours described earlier); training in the use of the PROST model, which permitted staff to
make more accurate projections in poverty and pension policy ; and experts in management, who
made recommendations on reorganizing agency functions to be both more efficient and effective.

Also, expert IT and medical support was used to strengthen the capacity of the National Institute
for Medical Expertise and Work Capacity Recovery and local medical expertise offices of
CNPAS. Officials also stated that:
     The substantial continuity of the project team was of considerable benefit;
     They received excellent support from the Bank, including quick feedback from the PCU;
     The quality of advice received from the Bank--both from the PCU as well as from
        project consultants--was very valuable; and
     The Bank is much less bureaucratic than the EU.

The one shortcoming in Project Supervision was the lack of sufficient focus on development
results. This pertains to disappointing progress in improving the quality of project indicators.




30ESPP was extended at this time for 2½ years, closing on September 30, 2003.


                                                   25

While additional high-quality Indicators were added at the end of the project, this was not done
until 2 years after Regional management had made the recommendation to do so.

Overall, considering the wide breadth of the project and the challenges it encountered,
Supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Quality at Entry was rated as Moderately Satisfactory, with important deficiencies in
M&E and Implementation, while Supervision was rated Moderately Satisfactory, with one
shortcoming in the area of focus on development results. On balance, overall Bank performance
is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Borrower performance was adequate overall: the Borrower cooperated very well with the Bank
SSD team; provided competent mid-level and upper-level officials who learned as much as they
could from SSD, and worked hard to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their agencies.

However, there were a number of ways in which the Borrower's actions were not positive to SSD
progress.

For example the large pension increases before the last elections contributed to the increase of the
pensions budget deficit. In addition, the hesitant legislative process related to the private pensions
delayed the establishment of the PPSC as well as the launch of the implementation of the 2nd
pensions pillar.

Considering the positive aspects of Borrower performance as well as its deficiencies, an overall
rating is given of Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

MMSS also deserves considerable praise for its actions to devolve responsibility for the delivery
of social services, which produced evidence of improved quality and greater efficiency; for
setting up nine new counseling centers for disabled people; and developing, at the local level,
cooperative networks between both public and private institutions that could provide high-quality
services; and eight pilot centers to provide technical assistance to counselors and job-matching
agents.

The Implementing Agency was the MMSS, with which the Bank had an excellent relationship
which deepened during the project period. Within MMSS, the Bank implementing unit was the
Project Management Unit (PCU), which did an excellent job throughout the project. This
included:

     The PMU managed project stop-start progress very well. It was challenging to deal with
         variations in progress, with very few steps forward in the first 3 years, and acceleration
         after that;



                                                 26

     Transition arrangements for regular operation of project components effectively
        supported activity after Loan/Credit closing;
     All reporting by procurement and financial specialists reported the project as
        "satisfactory." All financial reporting was completed on time, and with no deficiencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
On balance, the positive contribution of the PMU and the overall adequate contribution of
Government result in an overall rating of Borrower Performance as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

    a) Greater emphasis should have been placed on training--SSD allocated 1700 staff days
        to training--a large allocation--but even more training was needed.             Principally,
        additional training would have facilitated utilization by end-users of IT systems installed
        at their level , and thereby enhanced efficiency of using the systems, and reduced errors
        inputted. It would also have drastically reduced the interval that end-users required to
        become familiar with system procedures and thus use them more efficiently--reducing
        pension system costs.

    b) Inclusion of a public awareness component is critical when a new agency is established,
        or a major policy change is made--When a Bank financed project undertakes efforts to
        make policy or organizational changes that affect a broad swath of the population, it is
        critical that a major public awareness campaign be undertaken. When the multi-pillar
        system was established following passage of the legislation, many younger contributors
        were affected, and had to make newly-developed choices.             The Public Awareness
        Campaign was very important to enhancing the awareness and understanding of a number
        of aspects of the rules governing private investment and the options that contributors now
        had that had never previously existed.

    c) The role of Local Agencies in the Delivery of Social Services is Critical--In providing
        support for local MMSS staff and for the award of 70 sub-project grants, SSD was able to
        strengthen the technical ability to deliver services to those in great need, but also to:
        increase the breadth and quality of outreach; increase the liaison between MMSS with
        local NGOs and other organizations of all types; make available "demonstrators" of key
        medical equipment that patients needed for support. This increased the familiarity and
        knowledge of this equipment--crucial for many disabled patients--for a broader range of
        individuals. Finally, the national ability to recognize disabilities, and how they could be
        dealt with in the best way, was enhanced.

Introduction
SSD included four components: I. Policy Development, M&E - US$1.85m (actual amount
spent); II. Social Insurance System Reform - US$17.7m; III. Labor Market Adjustment -
US$22.22m; and IV. Strengthening Social Assistance - US$14.39m. The total costs in the table
below only represent Bank loan figures at appraisal, project restructuring and at closing.

As shown, the 2004 restructuring caused the LRP subcomponent under Component 3 to be
reduced, and eventually end, its efforts in SSD. Funding of around US$17m from the downsizing
of LRP was principally allocated to the six subcomponents that started around that time: three
subcomponents of Component 3--Micro-credit, Adult Training Centers, and Institutional
Development of the National Agency for Employment (ANOFM); one subcomponent of
Component 2--Occupational Hazards Insurance;31 and two subcomponents of Component 4--
Institution Building of Social Assistance Agencies--private and public--and the Social
Assistance Service Fund, which awarded grants to 70 projects that provided social assistance
services.

As has been described earlier, reporting on component outputs was very good. The MIG program,
for example, was comprehensively evaluated by DFID, with very good results. Similarly, at
project completion, reports on sub-component results were completed on the Labor Relocation
Program, the development of social assistance, as well as other as other sub-components.

In reviewing component outputs, it should be noted that the Bank was successful at improving
social sector capacity by tailoring project components to the needs of each sub-sector, for
example:




31The PSC sub-component had been planned earlier, but was delayed in starting.




                                                                29

     Strengthening capacity of local officials with training, support of grant projects, and a
         significant quantity of medical equipment that improved the quality of diagnosis and
         treatment;
     Support for excellent quality pension managers and advisors who could assure that the
         newly-founded private pension sub-sector would be well managed during a very severe
         world recession, and that this subsector would gain strong public support;
     Efficiency of agencies involved in the project was enhanced by strong support for the
         management of pension administration and ANOFM, and by IT support for nearly every
         agency involved in SSD by provision of hardware, software and training. In particular,
         support for scanning the entire universe of pension records comprised a major
         improvement in operations.

Component 1: Policy Development, M&E
 original/
 PAD           actual
 US$           US$
  $ 2.10m      $ 1.85m

This component strengthened Government policy development, monitoring and evaluation
capacity on poverty reduction and the core MMSS in social protection. In the case of poverty
reduction, a new unit was created in the Office of the Prime Minister, the Anti-Poverty
Commission (CASPIS).32

This component included:
     development of an MIS system, including the software for a "poverty map," which was
         then developed
     training of staff on all new software and hardware
     procurement of office equipment
     four studies were also conducted:
              o social inclusion indicators
              o social conditions of the child exclusion
              o poverty map (preliminary study)
              o urban/rural poverty

As noted earlier, CASPIS worked closely with the World Bank, as well as with the National
Institute for Statistics (NIS), which provided training in use of the PROST model. This enabled
staff to make more accurate projections in poverty policy, pensions, and other areas, and training
in its use was widened to other economic policy agencies. CASPIS developed quickly in
producing timelier and more accurate projections than they had earlier.33




32In 2007, the CASPIS technical secretariat was transferred to the Social Inclusion Unit, in the Directorate
for Policies, Strategies and Social Inclusion Programs of the Ministry of Labor, Family and Equal
Opportunities (MLFEO).

33Strengthening policy skills in this area was co-financed by DFID.




                                                     30

The MMSS Statistics and Informatics Unit (SIU), which was responsible for analysis and
collection of data, were strengthened during SSD:
     Central MIS installed that connecting SIU to ANOFM, CNPAS and DSA and other
         Bucharest economic agencies;
     MIS connections also established to county-level "judets," of which there are 41in
         Romania.

This replacement of a paper-based system created much greater efficiency by assessing the needs
of patients--as well as their viewpoints--and also permitted policy makers to collaborate in the
analysis of alternative social policy approaches.

The SIU also increased the efficiency and effectiveness of MMSS social protection functions by:
(1) linking units in an area to MIS; (2) conducting training for headquarters and field staff in MIS
use; and (3) conducting series of policy-related studies (see Annex 11 for complete list).

Component 2: Social Insurance System Reform

 original/      actual
 PAD US$        US$

 $17.47m        $17.70m


As can be seen, expenditures in the Social Insurance Reform Component rose significantly from
what had been planned. This increment consisted of entirely of funding taken from the LRP
Component.

Expenditure on the Pension Administration subcomponent rose modestly, by $1.53m. This
consisted principally of additional training provided to staff, and additional Pension and Actuarial
consultants, whose work was noted by staff to be highly appreciated.

Public Pension Reform--In support of the public pension fund, SSD supported installation of
data systems, and training in their use, that had major benefits. These included:

     Worker pension contribution records were scanned, digitizing the data and making the
         effort to retrieve information substantially more efficient. The digitized data was housed
         in the National Archives;
     Using this data, the agency utilized IT systems procured under the project.                This
         increased both the efficiency of this process as well as the accuracy of the data used;
     Each contributor was sent an annual report on the status of their account;34
     Responses to contributor inquiries were made within 45 days--much more quickly than
         had been the case before SSD; and
     The IT systems were fundamental in allowing the pension system--as well as other
         MMSS systems--to be decentralized, and to devolve responsibility to local offices.

It should be noted that a small number of pension reforms were not achieved. These included the
"unification of male and female retirement," which meant the retirement ages of 65 for men and


34 Reports were not sent in 2006, 2007, or 2008 due to budgetary limitations.




                                                   31

60 for women remained the same. The increased male retirement age--an additional reform
being sought--was also not achieved.

Private Pension Funds--In support of the PDO (ii), a main project objective was establishment
of "sound regulation and supervision of private pension funds." As described in greater detail
below, support was provided to three pillars:

      Pillar I, a Reformed Public Pillar;
      Pillar II, a privately-managed mandatory pension fund
      Pillar III, voluntary private funds

The Private Pension Supervision Commission (PPSC), an autonomous regulatory agency that is
subordinate to the Parliament, was established for the purpose of "sound regulation" in
December, 2005--3 years later than envisioned--in accord with legislation passed earlier that
year. The late PSC start was due to government delay regarding the legislation, and this
contributed to a compressed interval during which PPSC could build adequate capacity to
exercise a very broad responsibility.

Bank support of PPSC was very successful (PSC also received independent support from
USAID). The Bank provided hardware, software, and training for IT, as well as on-site training
to PSC staff in organizational and managerial functions. Pension records were scanned under the
SSD, and the data kept in a more efficient and safer way. This increase in efficiency and
accuracy of data provided a foundation for decentralizing many functions, which was achieved
under SSD.

Greater efficiency was also achieved in the response of the Pension System to inquiries by
participants. As a result of changes made under SSD, the response time to a contributor inquiry
fell below 45 days, in accordance with the new law, whereas it had been considerably longer
before the project. The quality of the data also increased, as a result of the data processing and
scanning procedures that were begun under SSD.           This was determined by internal tests
administered by management.

The design and initial development of the National House of Pensions and Other Social Insurance
Rights (CNPAS) was supported by the ESSP, prior to SSD operation (or, in some cases, during
its first 3 years of implementation). As noted, support was provided to three pillars: Pillar I, a
Reformed Public Pillar; Pillar II, a privately-managed state pension fund, in which individuals
can choose in which of the 18 current funds they wish to invest; and Pillar III, voluntary private
funds (of which there are 12)

Since Pillar II has been recently established and to enable privately-managed funds, funds were
being invested--but not yet paid as benefits. (Pillar III has made the least progress, and has just
been organized)

Pillar II officials were taken on Study Tours to countries with similar systems, including Poland,
the Netherlands, and France. These trips were outstanding in terms of enhancing managers'
ability to identify successful and unsuccessful agency functions and policies.          Managers
interviewed stated that these tours were extremely helpful in developing the efficiency of PPSC
procedures.

It should be noted that, in accordance with the law, PPSC could and did select successful fund
managers of any nationality to manage individual funds, and PPSC negotiated contracts with fund


                                                32

managers. Most importantly, the competitive results of the yield on each fund are published
monthly. Additional details on Pillar II funds are provided in Annex 10.

The Bank also supported a Public Awareness Campaign for the PPSC; privately-managed funds
had not existed earlier, and their establishment and, most importantly, knowledge of how they
worked, needed to be explained to contributors and future beneficiaries.               Public surveys
documented that these campaigns reached and successfully increased public consciousness of
these new approaches, and adequate knowledge of the future options they would have, and the
procedures they would need to follow.

Bank assistance to the PPSC was very successful: initial agency establishment; development of a
first set of regulations,35 agency operating procedures, refurbishment of facilities and acquisition
of office equipment; and, as noted earlier, software and hardware systems and staff training.

The design and initial development of CNPAS was supported by the ESSP, prior to SSD launch.
It was the intention of SSD Component 2 to continue to support CNPAS institutional
development by: (1) completing development of key business procedures, including collection,
pension assignment, and management information systems and subsequent updating of these
systems; (2) refurbish facilities and acquire office equipment; (3) continuing CNPAS staff
training; (4) providing TA to identify and evaluate cost-efficient alternatives for paying benefits;
and (v) developing an archiving system.

In addition, the sub-component supported rehabilitation of the disabled by strengthening the
capacity of the National Institute for Medical Expertise and Work Capacity Recovery and local
medical expertise offices of CNPAS. Activities encompassed (1) staff training; (2) facility
refurbishment and purchase of office equipment; (3) acquisition of medical equipment; and (4)
upgrading IT systems.

As noted earlier, Component III was modified by the reduction in size of the LRP, which was
absorbed by the government in 2004, and the initiation of Micro-Credit, Adult Training Centers,
the development of the ANOFM Institute, and by provision of counseling for the disabled.

Labor Relocation Program

Ex-military personnel--While LRP was underway, SSD provided "business incubator services"
to 4,689 individuals in the civil sector, of which 317--around 7 percent-- actually successfully
started their own businesses, and were employed by them. During the same interval, 521 clients
exiting the military received start-up advice, and 37 were successful.



35 Management stated that around 30 regulations were promulgated for each pillar--nearly 100 in toto--
from the fall of 2006 to the present.




                                                 33

The success rate in actually placing rural residents (into existing businesses) was higher: 1,141
from the civil sector were successfully put into positions, around 17%, and 115 from the defense
sector, or 23%.

Rural Clients--Under SSD, contracts were established to provide skills-upgrading training to
6,619 rural clients, of which around 17 percent of the ex-military clients were successfully
placed, and around 23 percent of the civil sector clients.

Rural clients were also provided with counseling in starting a small business, but the numbers of
such clients were not available. Incubator services were provided to 3,133 firms employing
people from the civil sector, and 3,102 firms employing people from the defense sector.

Labor Market Information--Initial analytical work was done in this area, but a second study was
dropped, since continuing was considered unjustified since the National Agency for Employment
was participating, at the same time, under a cooperation project with Sweden, which implemented
a component of Labor Market Analyses and Forecasts.

Adult Training Centers--SSD continued the work of ESPP to develop NAE capacity to provide
adult vocational training centers. Nine new Centers were established under SSD in addition to
the five that had been established under ESPP, for a total of 14 nationwide.

The purpose of Component 4 was to enhance institutional development as well as the quality of
services provided, and improve communication. These activities were undertaken across a broad
range of agencies:

Social Assistance Sub-component--Additional services under this component were provided
through a $3 million social fund. The fund provided grants for community social services that
promoted social inclusion and enhanced the role of local level managers and providers to respond
more effectively to the needs and priorities identified at the local level, and promote and
strengthen partnerships between local officials and the NGO sector.

Seventy individual projects were awarded grants in the following areas:

     30 projects focused on the protection of elderly people;
     13 social services projects were undertaken for protection of people with disabilities;
     8 social services projects were addressed to mothers and children;
     7 projects protected young people;
     6 projects promoted social services for female victims of domestic violence;
     3 social canteens were established for all disadvantaged categories; and
     3 projects established day care centers for those with various social beneficiaries.

These projects were undertaken across nearly every judet in the country.

Component 4 also supported rehabilitation of the disabled by strengthening the capacity of the
National Institute for Medical Expertise and Work Capacity Recovery and local medical expertise
offices of CNPAS. Activities encompassed (1) staff training; (2) facility refurbishment and
purchase of office equipment; (3) acquisition of new medical equipment; and (4) upgrading IT
systems.

The following contributions were made by four co-financiers/partners to the project:

DFID--The UK Department of International Development (DFID), a co-financier, also made a
major contribution of US$3.76m to strengthen staff capacity at local as well as central social
assistance offices, and support the development of communication capacity in social assistance
agencies.

EU-PHARE--The EU financed under a US$4.70 million independent project (i) preparation of
technical specifications and functional requirements of an integrated IT system for administration
of social assistance benefits, which was then purchased and installed under the project, and (ii)
institutional design for three new social assistance agencies: National Agency for the
Administration of Social Assistance Benefits, Social Inspection and the Social Observatory.

USAID financed technical assistance support for (i) the institutional capacity building of the
National Commission for Private Pensions Supervision, assisting them in the preparation and first
steps of the implementation of the business plan, and (ii) the improvement of the legal framework
for private pensions (2nd pillar), and the preparation of several related implementation norms
(secondary legislation). The USAID support was not initial pledged, but it came only later when
the need for this kind of support was identified.

USDOL - The United States Department of Labor provided a parallel grant of US$400,000 to
work with the project.



                                                 35

                          Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

As described in Section 3.3, while some benefits achieved by SSD could be measured, in most
cases that would have been very difficult or expensive. For example, IT hardware, software, and
training were provided to numerous elements of the Institute for Medical Expertise and Work
Capacity Recovery. While nearly all sub-component reports on the Institute work stated that
significant benefits were achieved, it would have required considerable effort to estimate their
value. Consequently, no effort was made to estimate overall SSD efficiency.

Among the areas where some measure of benefits could be made, benefits could be measured of
the time decrement for MMSS responses to pension beneficiaries' inquiries. SSD reduced the
response time to 45 days, while earlier responses had required 120-180 days.

Similarly, regarding the establishment of Pillar II pension funds, it would be possible over a 3-5
year period to compare private pension funds to public funds by measuring the return on
investment, and the proportion of income and payments that were comprised of administrative
costs.

INTRODUCTION

         The turn in Romania's course of history after 1990 and the orientation towards a market
economy called, among other changes, for profound reforms of the social protection system able
to meet the stringent requirements of a transition period and lay the bases of a modern system of
laws and institutions meant to manage this important and sensitive sector of a market economy.

         The social protection reforming process, in all its aspects ­ employment, social insurance
and social assistance ­ started as soon as the new historic course was adopted and from the very
first stages it benefited from the constant support granted by the World Bank through technical
assistance targeted at project design and backed by laws the necessary reforms as well as through
financial support for building and developing the institutions required to implement such reforms.


         This support started with the TACI (Technical Assistance and Critical Imports)
Project; from 1992 ­ 1994, the project addressed for the first time in our country:
      Issues related to the social protection for the unemployed and the organization of specific
         services;
      Assessment of the needs for IT and personnel training;
      Options regarding the reforms in the social insurance field were discussed; and
      The White Paper of Reform of the Social Insurance and Pensions system was issued and
         debated upon along with the White Paper of the Social Assistance System, both of them
         launched in 1993.

         The main steps towards the reforms in the social protection field benefited from the
support granted by the Bank through the second ESPP (Employment and Social Protection)
Project developed between1995 -2003 whereby the basic laws were completed and the reforms
in the field of employment and social protection for the unemployed as well as in the pensions
field were implemented and the reform of the social assistance system started.

         During the period spanning 2003 ­ 2008, the Bank support continued with the SSD
(Social Sector Development) Project which was meant to consolidate the institutions that had
been built and to complete the reforms in the field of pensions and social assistance.

         The purpose of this report is to show the objectives pursued under the Social Sector
Development Project and the extent to which such objectives were fulfilled through the project
implementation.


PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS


         The results obtained from the Project implementation will be presented below, structured
by the project components.

I POLICY DEVELOPMENT MONITORING AND EVALUATION

Project Coordination

         During the Project implementation period there took place many changes in the structure
of the ministry, which also caused the change of the project coordinators.




                                                 42

         Consequently, the coordination of the project implementation was assumed by the
Minister of labor, family and social protection and was exerted during this period by the
following persons:

                 Marian Sârbu, Minister ...............2001 ­ 2003
                 Elena Dumitru, Minister............ ..2003 - 2004
                 Dan Mircea Popescu, Minister... .. 2004 - 2005
                 Gheorghe Barbu, Minister............2005 - 2007
                 Paul Pacuraru, Minister...............2007 -2008
                 Mariana Campeanu, Minister........2008

         The management of the implementation activities was supervised by the Project
Management Unit whose team kept its members all over the project period, which was a valuable
element of continuity in the fluid environment that characterized this period of time.

         The Project Management team closely collaborated with the technical implementation
teams designated in the specialized directorates of the ministry and later on in the newly created
institutions: the National Agency for Employment, the national House of Pensions and other
Social insurance rights, the Private Pension System Supervision Commission as well as the
specialized economic divisions within these institutions.

         The Project Management Unit (PMU) was set up and operated all over the project
duration with a number of 7 members, as follows:

                 Olteanu Constantin......... Director
                 Oprioiu Rzvan...............Deputy Director resp. for procurement
                 Golea Lucian.................. Resp. for financial operations
                 Pârlog Daniela............... Expert financial operations
                 Mariana Olteanu............ Expert - procurement
                 Valentina Mihutescu......... Expert - procurement
                 Gilorteanu Rodica............ Assistant ­ secretary


         The PMU provided the technical implementation teams with the technical assistance
necessary to carry out the procurement procedures, prepared the annual budgets and managed the
loan funds and the relations with the World Bank and the Ministry of Public Finance.

         All over the project duration the PMU activity benefited from the concrete and constant
support offered by Mr. Richard Florescu, Project Manager within the World Bank Office in
Romania and by the specialists from the Ministry of Finance, of whom a special role had Mrs.
Carmen Ghi, Head of department within the directorate specialized on external finance under
the Ministry of Public Finance and Mrs. Aura Tudor, expert within the same directorate.

         The project implementation management had to find solutions to the problems specific to
a multiple financing project with a complex structure in terms of the fields covered and the wide
territorial spread of the objectives. Consequently:

 In terms of financing, the project management had to manage four separate sources of
    financing, namely the loan and the local budgets provided through the Ministry of Labor,
    Family and Social Protection, the social insurance budget and the budget of the fund for the
    unemployed. To manage these budgets required maintaining separate bookkeeping. Three


                                                 43

     credit coordinators and three mechanisms of preventive and subsequent financial control were
     involved in the approval of the utilization of the funds.

 In terms of the diversity of the institutional construction and its spread over the country
     territory, the project management was confronted with a situation characterized by the
     impossible situation of having several procurement packages for equipment and services,
     which amplified the volume of such activities.
     This is perfectly illustrated by the structure of the procurements of goods and services which

     revealed 117 actions of local or international procurement whereby goods amounting to USD

     6.1 million were procured (the average amount of the contract is USD 60,265), compared

     with 11 international tenders whereby goods of USD 12.4 million were procured.



         In addition, 16 information/documentation and personnel training events (study visits,
participation to workshops and conferences) were organized and attended by specialists from
MMSSF, ANOFM and CNSSPP; the costs involved amounted to US$613,010.

         In parallel with these actions organized and developed by the Project Management Unit
there were also performed transfers of funds for the monthly payments made under the active
measures contracts developed by the National Agency for Employment (ANOFM), totaling
US$ 3,438,563 and under the contracts for the administration of the micro-crediting funds,
totaling US$ 7,000,000.

         In spite of all this diversity of procurements and multitude of operations all staff worked
without complaints and were motivation by a drive for success. There were no visa refusals on
behalf of the World Bank or the preventive control bodies with respect to the procedures
developed for the selection of suppliers of goods, services, or consultants.

Developing data gathering and evaluation capacities and formulation of recommendations for
the development of policies in the field of employment and social protection.

         Under this objective, a number of studies and analyses were conducted, the results of
which, served as orientation and substantiation of policies in the field of employment, the system
of indicators of the special protection domain, fighting poverty and promoting social inclusion.

Developing data gathering and evaluation capacities and formulation of recommendations for
the development of policies meant to fight poverty.

         At the first stage, this objective sustained the activity of the Anti-Poverty and Social
Inclusion Promotion Commission (CASPIS) by endowing it with specialized software for the
elaboration of poverty maps, IT equipment and other office equipment. This support developed
the commission's capacity to obtain up-to-date profiles of poverty, a capacity that was later on
transferred to the Ministry of Labor which after the commission dissolution took over its
attributions.


II THE REFORM OF THE SOCIAL INSURANCE SYSTEM



                                                   44

A. Occupational Hazards and Diseases Insurance System

    (i)      Institutional building

         In the conception phase of the project, the operation of the insurance system for against
occupational hazards and diseases was foreseen to develop within a stand-alone institutional
framework. For this reason, the project included funds necessary to sustain the respective
institutional building (about USD 3.48 million).

         After the Loan Agreement was signed, the decision was taken to administratively
incorporate this system in the structure of the National House for pensions and other social
insurance rights. For this reason, the specific needs for institutional building were reduced to the
procurement of some furniture and cars (USD 0.48 million). The funds that remained available
were reallocated to other objectives.


B. Pension System


    (i)      Developing the capacity to administrate the pension system


         Through this objective there continued the efforts to endow CNPAS with IT instruments
able to allow it to perform its duties more efficiently.


         The integrated information system was completed, whereby all activities carried out by
CNPAS were informative. This was in addition to the activities in the field of medical expertise,
as well as those deriving from the new attributions of CNPAS with respect to the operation of the
systems of pensions under private administration. The developed system covered, from the point
of view of the calculation of the pension rights, all charges resulting from the regulations that
emerged until 30 May 2005.


         Although the project had the necessary funds and the Bank approval for the procurement
procedures, CNPAS failed to complete the negotiations for updating the information system; the
task is to be assumed by CNPAS from own funds or from other European sources.


         The work books scanning system (development of software applications and equipment
endowment) was completed and is now implemented in the entire CNPAS. In parallel, the
government made efforts to ensure that the contents of the work books are taken over and that
this operation is complete by the end of 2010 (about 7 million work books).


    (ii)     Developing the potential of medical expertise and work capacity recovery

         The medical expertise and work capacity recovery system is an important component of
the pension system, mainly meant to protect the system against abuses through invalidity
pensions, by verifying/ invalidating the invalidity diagnostics.




                                                  45

         The system also has methodological and didactical functions; a central institute with
advanced capacities of diagnosis is also available along with a network of regional centers for
primary verification.


         The project sustained the efforts of informatization of the specific activities in the system
(hospital and network) as well as the endowment of the hospitals and the centers with medical
equipment.


         In this period, owing to the government efforts, a new, very modern location was
provided for the Institute of Medical Expertise and Work Capacity Recovery (INEMRCM) which
offers excellent conditions for the best use of the lab equipment and for medical investigations.


    (iii)    Private Pension System Supervision Commission

         The objectives of the project regarding the Institutional development and consolidation
of the private pension system (Pillar II - the pensions in private administration and Pillar II - the
facultative pensions) as well as of the Private Pension System Supervision Commission
(CSSPP) covered more fields and consisted in:

1. In the field of institutional building: selecting, hiring and training the specialty personnel,
    equipping with furniture, office equipment, cars and sustaining the operational costs of the
    commission for a period of 18 months.

2. In the field of information technology: implementation of a performing information system
    with modules covering:
                 The Registry of Authorized Entities
                 The central module for the evidence of the operations (register of participants,
                 register of transfers, register of individual accounts, log-register of investments)
                 The module for the management of the investment portfolios
                 The module for financial-accounting analyses in the fields of activity of CSSPP;

3. In the relational field: starting up the procedures regarding the conclusion of protocols of
    collaboration with institutions, authorities and supervision bodies at home and abroad
    having attributions in the field of private pensions and in the financial system in general.

4. In the field of international relations: CSSPP participation to European bodies in the field
    of private pensions and establishing bilateral relations with similar bodies in the European
    Union

5. In the field of communication: conducting a publicity campaign for population information
    and education with respect to the private pension system.

          During this period, CSSPP carried out intense normative activities meant to ensure
the legal frame for the operation of the private pension systems and issued over 90 norms and
other normative documents.

           A. Active Measures

                     The active measures were addressed to the military personnel laid off as result of the
           NATO integration measures and the professionalized army as well as to the civilians looking for
           a job.
                (i)  The active measures for combating the unemployment for the persons laid off from the

           B. Micro-Credits

                     The micro-crediting program was targeted at persons willing to develop a small business,
           to family associations and micro-enterprises and was complementary to the program for granting
           credits at a preferential interest as established by Law No. 76 of 16 January 2002 regarding the
           system of unemployment insurance and employment stimulation.

C. Adults' Training Centers

        The general purpose of this sub-objective was to continue the process of modernization
and development of ANOFM capacity to provide professional training services for adult persons,
a process that started with the first project with IBRD (ESPP) co-financing, by:
        -    Developing its own network of training centers;
        -    The rehabilitation-re-arrangement of the existing centers;
        -    Equipment endowing, personnel training.

        The project funds ensured the endowment with the support equipment for vocational
training in 18 trades, for a number of 22 vocational training centers in the structure of the
National Employment Agency (ANOFM), of which 9 newly established centers, in the counties
of: Alba, Arge, Brila, Braov, Buzu, Galai, Maramure, Mehedini, Sibiu and 13 vocational
training centers already existing in : Bacu, Bistria-Nsud, Botoani, Cara-Severin, Dâmbovita,
Hunedoara (Deva and Petroani), Iai, Olt, Neam, Prahova, Suceava, Timi.

        In order to meet the labor market requirements, the 22 own vocational training centers
under the subordination of the county employment agencies which benefited from the endowment
with equipment through the Social Sector Development Project were authorized as providers of
adult training for about 130 trades. Following that, they will continue the authorization process
for other trades for which a demand exists on the labor market.

        ANOFM has contributed funds from the unemployment budget amounting to             de Lei
9.36 mil., required for the rehabilitation of the buildings of 10 centers and providing the
conditions for th best use of the equipment acquired under the project.


                                                   48

        Owing to the funds allocated through the Labor Force and Social Protection Project and
the Social Sector Development Project, ANOFM now has a network of 7 regional centers and 19
local centers for adults' vocational training.

D. Institutional Development of ANOFM

(i) Labor market studies

        The general purpose of this objective was to conduct studies leading to the development
of the capacity to substantiate the programs and analyze the impact of the active measures. Since
ANOFM benefited from other non-reimbursable financing sources from various bilateral
programs, this objective was less developed; only one study was performed on "the supervision
of a sample of employers who hired unemployed persons participating to the program of active
measures". The results of this study and of the studies performed under bilateral programs have
been used in the planning of the active measures programs.


(ii)    ANOFM Personnel Training




                                               49

               The ANOFM own personnel vocational training program was devised to meet the natural
     need to increase the degree of professionalism of public servants and enhance the quality of the
     employment services in the context of Romania accession to the European Union.

               The situation of the training courses, by year, is as follows:

               The implementation of this sub-component was a real support for ANOFM as it
     developed in a period that followed certain major legislative modifications that resulted in
     increasing and diversifying the attributions of the agency; moreover, in this period the agency
     developed a project for the introduction of an information system at the level of the entire system.
     As a matter of fact, all training courses came to meet these two major challenges.

               The positive results recorded in the implementation of the sub-component Own
     Personnel Training, have led to the implementation of a project regarding the setting up of a
     vocational training centre for ANOFM own personnel. The project was started in 2005 and in
     November 2007 the centre was ready to open.

        (iii) Employment Counseling Services For Persons With Disabilities

               As at 2004, ANOFM started a new project "Advisory services for disabled people" which
     was developed under the loan granted by the World Bank (Ro 4616) whose purpose is to develop
     the capacity of the employment agencies to provide advisory and mediation services for a target
     group with special needs, while paying attention and collaborating with the economic agents
     going to hire persons from this category.


                                                       50

        The general purpose of the project is to increase the employment chances for the disabled
persons in Romania through the use of the abilities, experiences and knowledge of each assisted
person. The project is meant to change the attitude of the society in general and of its
representatives - institutions, valid persons, disabled persons and employers - with respect to the
social-professional integration or reintegration of the disabled.

        Based on a careful selection performed according to specific principles, the ANOFM
management decided to set up, in a first stage, 8 pilot centers in the following employment
agencies: Iasi, Vrancea, Arges, Olt, Caras ­Severin, Cluj, Sibiu and Bucharest. In a second stage,
this network was extended by 12 more centres situated in the following employment agencies:
Giurgiu, Mehedini, Timi, Vâlcea, Braov, Galai, Prahova, Neam, Maramure, Bacu, Bihor,
Constana.

        The results obtained during the project implementation period can be synthesized as
follows:

         Accessibility of locations within the 8 pilot centers according to the "Normative for
            adaptation of civil buildings and related urban space to the needs of handicapped
            persons";
         Organization of 3 training stages and an evaluation workshop for the personnel
            providing advisory and mediation services for disabled people under the 8 pilot
            centers and within the 6 CRFPA;
         Equipping the 8 pilot centers with the technical equipment necessary for the
            performance in optimum conditions of the information and advisory activity for
            disabled people;
         Elaboration of the draft Occupational Standard for the interpreter of the mime/gesture
            language together with the National Association of the Deaf in Romania, the National
            Authority for Handicapped Persons and COSA;
         Organization of the course for a mime/gesture interpreter for a number of 16 persons:
            10 - AJOFM (in the pilot advisory centers, 6 ­ CRFPA (one person in each CRFPA)
            and the graduation exam;
         Realization of publicity materials for developing the medias campaign to increase the
            public awareness in general and the awareness of the employers and the disabled
            persons in particular, on: 1) the abilities of the disabled people, 2) the fundamental
            rights of such people to live in the same conditions as any other person and to have
            equal access to all types of services and opportunities. The media campaign was
            launched in September 2007;
         Creation of a space for dialogue between the disabled people and the specialists in
            professional advising and work integration of the disabled, in the form of a blog
            www.potcepotisitu.ro, which can be also accessed from the ANOFM site
            (www.anofm.ro);
         Equipping the 12 new centers with furniture, IT equipment and assistive equipment
            necessary to make the work place accessible to a disabled person;
         Acquisition of a package of services of "blended learning" for the personnel offering
            services to the disabled, consisting of: (1) implementation of an e-learning and (2)
            provision of training services for the personnel in such centers.

        ANOFM ensured all costs necessary to make accessible the spaces in the 20 centers.

IV SOCIAL ASSISTANCE

A.       Institutional reform


         The objective covered, through co-financing, the advising needs for the domains Human
Resources Development and Development of communication capacity; the project funds were
used to develop the Integrated Information System for the administration of the social services.


         In the field of institutional reform, the PHARE program in which the terms of reference
for the information system were prepared was a strong support for the institutional building of the
National Agency for Social Services, the beneficiary of the information system; the
implementation of the information system was monitored.


B.       Social Services

         The main objective of this program was to strengthen the institutional capacity of the
local authorities to offer community social services able to promote social inclusion and
effectively meet the local needs and priorities as well as to promote and consolidate the
partnerships between the local authorities and the non-governmental sector.

         Following the selection procedure, out of 90 projects of social services submitted, 71
projects were found eligible and Financing Contracts were signed for a number of 70 projects.

         Such projects can be divided as follows:
     30 projects destined to the protection of the elderly;
     7 projects destined to the protection of youth;
     6 projects promote social services for the women who are victims of family violence,
         as well as assistance and protection for the victims of human traffic;
     3 social canteens for all disfavored categories;
     8 projects of social services addressed to the mother and child;
     13 projects of social services for the protection of the disabled;
     3 projects of social services of the daytime centre type for different social categories.

         Consequently, out of the 70 financed contracts (68 completed) of the PROJECT RO-4616
"SOCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT" - PROGRAM OF SOCIAL SERVICES, 27.9% were
directed to the North-East region, 19.1% to the Centre region, 11.8% to the Bucharest-Ilfov
region.

         The percentage distribution can be explained by the need of an equitable distribution
according to the social needs of each area and by the interest shown by the beneficiary
institutions/organizations.

         Another result of the research was the realization of the Guide for Social Services - best
practice models- containing a series of projects developed under the World bank funded program
and whose activity continued after the financing closure; the guide was distributed to all suppliers
of social services who submitted projects under this program as well as to other promoters of
social services, under the workshops organized in Bucharest and Iai.

1. Statements of Project Development Objectives

Loan Agreement

"The objectives of the Project are: (i) to improve the Borrower's capacity in policy development,
monitoring and evaluation in the areas of poverty reduction and social protection; (ii) to support a
social insurance system reform, including the development of a multi-pillar pension system; (iii)

2. Summary of Pillar II Regulatory Requirements Characteristics

      Twelve competing funds were established, with a majority of Fund Managers who were
         foreign nationals--either EU or other.
      Pillar II is mandatory for new contributors. Each individual has four months to choose
         which fund. The PSC issues a quarterly bulletin with all its rules and requirements, and
         recent pertinent developments.
      Contributors could switch their assets from one fund to another as many as four times per
         year.
      In       accordance    with   the    Pension   Law,     responses     to  contributor    inquiries
         reached the goal of being sent within 45 days--much more quickly than had been the
         case before SSD.
      Requirements for Pillar II pension assets are that funds invest with conservative
         investment strategy, including a limit of 25% on corporate bonds, 2 percent on Romanian
         equities, and 3 percent on commodities and derivatives. As discussed in Section 3.2,
         Romanian private pension funds were the only ones in the region that that were profitable
         in 2008.



                                                   55

     Contracts with each fund manager are drawn up and signed in accord with Bank
         requirements. The Bank examined and approved the first few contracts signed.

     Pillar II fund financial statements are distributed to contributors twice a year. They are
         audited   by    private  international   auditors    who   meet a   specified   standard.

     Pillar III pensions, on the other hand, have a limit of 5% for private equities and
         commodities. This conservative investment strategy is designed to protect against risks
         including fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates.

3. Strengthening Social Assistance System

PDO (iv) was intended "to strengthen the social assistance system," with the following principles
set for potential projects:

  Reach priorities established at both the local and national levels;
  Target resources in accord with the needs directed by groups at social and economic risk;
  Increase community participation;
  Encourage partnership;
  Enhance project sustainability;
  Ensure a balance between project cost and results;
  Ensure budget transparency; and
  Contribute to EU Integration.

Seventy projects were selected, with the largest number in the North-East region, the second
largest in the Center, and the smallest in the Bucharest-Ilfov region. Selection of the projects in
these regions was based on the need for equitable distribution with respect to the social needs of
each area, and the functional interests of recipient institutions.
