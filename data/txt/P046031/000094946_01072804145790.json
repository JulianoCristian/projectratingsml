The principal lessons identified include: 1)\n            The participatory, operational model for promoting\n            development piloted under the project functioned well in the\n            complex, conflictive environment of the region of Colombia.\n            2) The project demonstrated the need for flexibility and\n            continuous learning when promoting a participatory approach\n            in such a complex environment, and to expect a substantial\n            variation in the rate of implementation and development\n            depending on the varied conditions in different parts of the\n            region. 3) Increasing the capacity of individuals and\n            communities to take charge of their own development takes\n            more time than originally expected, particularly to develop\n            their ability to prepare and implement productive investment\n            projects which translate into increased incomes and better\n            standards of living. 4) Tensions between the participatory\n            process and technical requirements of preparing and\n            implementing investment projects will be recognized and\n            addressed more directly. 5) Provision of technical\n            assistance by external experts was effective in building\n            capacity and empowering organizations and producers. 6)\n            Monitoring and evaluation should support continuous learning\n            and empowerment of communities. 7) Project evaluation by a\n            reputable external entity is useful in a conflictive and\n            insecure environment."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
