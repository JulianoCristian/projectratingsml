Context of the preparation of the Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR)

1.   The ICR was prepared under difficult circumstances. A political crisis erupted in
Madagascar at the end of January 2009, which had several negative impacts on the
preparation of the ICR. The second phase of the impact study did not take place in early
2009, as planned, which limited the amount of information available on the impact of the
Project. The Bank's OP/BP 7.30 "Dealing with de facto governments" went into effect
on March 17, 2009 and, as a result the ICR team did not have any contact with the
Government and had only limited contacts with the FID, as travel to Madagascar was
suspended. Therefore, the ICR team did not benefit from first-hand discussions and
inputs from beneficiaries and other stakeholders. Because of the prevailing situation, the
Bank agreed that the ICR would be sent to the Board without prior review by the
Government.

Introduction

2.   An original credit of US$110 million / SDR85.2 million (Credit 3498-0 MAG) for
the Community Development Project (CDP) was approved on April 19, 2001 and became
effective on October 23, 2002.

3.   When the entire IDA portfolio was restructured in 2002 to respond to the urgent
social and economic needs of the country following the six-month political crisis, the
legal documents were amended. In November 2002, a component was added to the
Project to provide a permanent social safety net mechanism, and the Project was
expanded to include urban areas that were most affected by the crisis.

4.   In April 2004, the legal documents were amended, again to add a new component
for cyclone emergency and disaster relief activities.

5.   An Additional Financing of US$50 million / SDR34.2 million (Supplemental Credit
3498-1 MAG) was approved on June 16, 2004 to address the emergency situation arising
from the 2004 cyclones which resulted in substantial damage to social and economic
infrastructure.

6.   A new Additional Financing of US$18 million / SDR12.2 million (Credit 3498-2
MAG) was approved on June 23, 2006 to scale-up the Project and finance capacity-
building activities, as requested by the Ministry of Decentralization to support
implementation of the deconcentration and decentralization strategy, including the
preparation of the Commune Development Support Program (CDSP).

7.   Following the various amendments and two additional financings, the Project had
the following components: (1) transfer of funds to community associations to implement
small-scale basic infrastructure sub-projects; (2) transfer of funds to communes to
implement small-scale basic infrastructure sub-projects; (3) social safety net (cash-for-
work) to protect the poorest segments of the population; (4) rehabilitation and
reconstruction of basic infrastructure in response to natural disasters, including cyclones;

8.    Based on available outcome and output indicators, the Community Development
Project (CDP) and previous projects implemented by the Fonds d'Intervention pour le
Développement (FID) have established the right mechanisms to reach out to poor
communities, deliver basic infrastructure and provide quick and flexible responses in the
aftermath of natural disasters. The ICR shows that working directly with communities is
appropriate in the context of Madagascar where the central government goes through
recurrent political crises and faces difficulties to reach communities, in part because of
their remoteness. The CDP also worked well because of its ability to coordinate the
preparation and implementation of sub-projects with sectoral policies.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

    1.1 Context at Appraisal

9.    From 1960 to 1999 the population of Madagascar experienced a long descent into
deeper and deeper poverty, as average real income per capita fell by a third. The growth
of real GDP recovered in the 1990s but this did not reduce poverty rates. Instead, the
poverty rate was broadly stable in the 1990s, rising from 70 percent in 1993 to 73% in
1997 and then slipping to 71% in 1999. Physical measures of nutrition, which are an
alternative and basic indicator of poverty, were roughly consistent with the poverty rate,
as stunting (age/height) improved only marginally over the decade of the 1990s. Other
poverty indicators were more positive. In particular, the school enrollment rate of
children 6 to 14 rose from 51% in 1993 to 68% in 1999, despite the decline in
consumption. Living conditions were generally quite poor but tended to improve during
the decade. Access to electricity in urban areas rose and access to sanitation services rose
across the board. Access to clean drinking water rose from 18% in 1993 to 23% in 1999.

10. However, there were some significant changes in the poverty profile in the 1990s.
Rural poverty rose from 74.5% in 1993 to 76.7% 1999, despite the migration of poor


                                              2

rural families to urban areas. The worsening of rural poverty seemed associated with
increased physical isolation caused by a breakdown of the road system. The distribution
of income among provinces shifted significantly in the 1990s. The poverty rate fell to
72% in Toliara, which used to be the poorest province, but deteriorated in Mahajanga
(76%), Antsiranana (73%) and Fianarantsoa which became the poorest province in 1999
with a poverty rate of 81%. Finally, poverty in Antananarivo was relatively moderate
during the 1990s and reached 62% in 1999.

11. The Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) of the Government had
three pillars: (a) higher and more sustainable levels of economic growth; (b) governance
and institutional reform; and (c) improved basic service delivery. With respect to the last
pillar, the Government program included: (i) improving rural infrastructure; (ii)
increasing access to education for the poor; and (iii) broadening the health system. The I-
PRSP included an action plan for rural development, which goal was to improve the
productivity and competitiveness of the rural economy. The Community Development
Project (CDP) was part of that action plan.

12. One of the main objectives of the latest CAS was to ensure that economic growth
would be broad-based and benefit the poor. Since a large majority of the poor live in rural
areas, the CAS aimed at reducing rural poverty by improving productivity and
competitiveness in the rural economy.

13. To this end the CAS proposed investments in human capital development in rural
areas, particularly in education, basic health care, water, nutrition, and rural
infrastructure. Moreover, the CAS supported strengthening the delivery of basic social
and economic services in poor areas through decentralization of power and resources to
communities.

14. The Project addressed these objectives through intensive investment in the
provision of social and economic services in poor rural areas. Over the medium and long
term, a sustained flow of improved social and economic services was expected to
improve public health and education in targeted communities. This increase in human
capital was expected to contribute to higher labor productivity and incomes.

15. The Project was to support the CAS objectives through significant devolution of
powers to communities and communes, who would select and implement sub-projects.
The communes were in place, had elected officials and were receiving budgetary
transfers. The Project was designed to enable communes to strengthen their managerial,
financial and developmental capacity. The long-term vision was that the transfer of funds
to communes would be successful, so that communes would play a key role in rural
development. Although its role would change, the FID would become a permanent
instrument for targeted transfers of matching funds to communities and communes.

16. The Project was implemented by the Fonds d'Intervention pour le Développement
(FID). FID was established as a non-profit association for public service ("association à
but non lucratif reconnue d'utilité publique") in 1993. It has successfully implemented



                                             3

earlier social funds in Madagascar financed by IDA (the Food Security and Nutrition
Project, the Second Social Fund Project, and the Third Social Fund Project). FID would
continue to operate on a decentralized basis through six inter-regional offices in
accordance with the provisions of its by-laws, the Framework Agreement (Convention)
between the FID and the Government, and its Manual of Procedures approved by the
Bank.

    1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

17. According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) dated May 22, 2001, the
objective of the Project was "to contribute to the improved use of, and satisfaction with,
social and economic services provided thereunder amongst participating rural
communities". The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) dated March 23, 2001 has a
slightly different wording: "The PDO is to improve use of and satisfaction with project-
supported social and economic services within poor rural communities". The difference
between the two wordings is not significant. For purposes of the ICR, the relevant
wording is that of the PDO in the DCA.

18. In the PAD, the key indicators related to the project development objectives are the
following:

    ·   A minimum of 80% utilization of designed capacity for primary schools, health
        centers, potable water supply, micro irrigated perimeters and rural roads.

    ·   At least 70% of beneficiaries report that they are satisfied with services from
        project-supported infrastructure.

    1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and key
          indicators, and reasons/justification

19. When the entire IDA portfolio was restructured in 2002 to respond to the urgent
social and economic needs of the country, after a six-months political crisis, the legal
documents were amended in November 2002 to: (i) add a component to the Project in
order to provide a permanent social safety net mechanism, and (ii) expand the Project by
including urban areas that were most affected by the crisis. Therefore, the Project
Development Objective (PDO) was slightly amended to include urban communities, and
it reads as follows: "The objective of the Project is to contribute to the improved use of,
and satisfaction with, social and economic services provided thereunder amongst
participating rural and urban communities". The PDO amendment was not submitted to
the Bank's Board of Directors for approval and key indicators were not changed at that
time. The same revised PDO wording applied to the 2004 and 2006 Additional
Financings, which were approved by the Board.

20. In accordance with the PAD dated March 23, 2001, the Project was expected to
benefit the Malagasy who inhabit rural areas, by: (i) primarily, increasing their access to


                                             4

basic social and economic services and improving the quality of the services; (ii) building
the capacity of community associations and commune authorities to plan, implement and
operate development sub-projects; (iii) providing communities and local authorities with
the ability to seek additional funding for development activities in a systematic manner;
and (iv) increasing productivity and income over the medium and long-term, as economic
investments in infrastructure such as feeder roads improve the profitability of agriculture,
while social infrastructure in health and education improves labor productivity. The
purpose of the 2002 restructuring was to expand the project so that it would benefit also
the Malagasy living in urban areas.

21. For transfers to communes, in the first year the Project would disburse funds to
those communes that already have a communal development plan financed by other
partners (UNDP, French Cooperation, and European Union). After the first year of
operation, communes would be selected according to their implementation capacity.
More specifically, the Project would give preference to communes which have a
communal development plan, have experience in implementing an investment of the type
specified in the plan, and have the capability to maintain administrative accounts.

22. With the addition of new components, the Project also provided Madagascar with
an efficient instrument to respond to the major natural disasters that the country faces on
a recurrent basis (such as cyclones) through: (i) rehabilitation and reconstruction of
damaged or destroyed infrastructure; and (ii) labor-intensive public works (safety nets).
The 2004 Additional Financing was expected to benefit about 1.2 million people living in
areas affected by cyclones Elita and Gafilo.

    1.5 Original Components

23. The initial project included four components.

24. Component 1: Transfer of Funds to Community Associations (Community sub-
projects ­ individual investments) ­ estimated cost: US$80.0 million. This component
would fund sub-projects chosen by the communities themselves through a participatory
rural appraisal process. The sub-projects had to meet specific qualification criteria
designed for schools, health centers, small-scale rural water supply, rural roads, bridges,
and markets. Education and health infrastructure had to be approved by the respective
ministries and meet their design and technical norms. The sub-projects had to cost less
than US$50,000 (US$100,000 for rural roads), and the communities had to provide
contributions in kind as well as money equal to at least 15% of the cost (or 10% for rural
roads) of the sub-projects. With the exception of rural transport infrastructure and small
scale irrigation, which were executed by FID, sub-projects were executed by community
associations (such as parent associations for schools), which were responsible for
procurement, supervision and payment of contractors and suppliers.

25. Component 2: Capacity Building Activities ­ estimated cost: US$15.0 million. .
This component would fund the training of members of the project cells (cellules de
projet) of community associations and of elected officials and personnel of communes in



                                             5

project management, accounting, procurement, etc. It would also support the preparation
of participatory communal development plans.

26. Component 3: Transfer of Funds to Communes ­ estimated cost: US$25.0 million.
Under this component, funds would be transferred to communes to finance priority
investments in their communal development plans. Under this pilot operation, funds
estimated at US$5 per capita per year throughout the project period would be transferred
to 60 communes during the first year, 120 during the second year, 180 in the third year,
240 in the fourth year, and 300 in the fifth year. By the end of the Project, the pilot would
therefore have reached 300 of the 1400 communes in Madagascar. The choice of
investments that could be financed was large, since there would be no positive list, but
only a negative list. The beneficiary contribution to the investment would be 15 percent
of sub-project costs, as in component 1. Communes would be fully responsible for the
selection and implementation of sub-projects. The FID would conduct ex-post
inspections and audits on a semi-annual basis to ensure that the component is
implemented in accordance with the Manual of Procedures.

27. Component 4: Project Administration and Supervision - estimated cost: US$17
million. This component would fund the operating costs of FID which is responsible for
overseeing the implementation of all activities under the project. It would also finance
training of staff, beneficiary assessments, impact evaluations, poverty studies, monitoring
and evaluation, and financial and technical audits.

    1.6 Revised Components

28. When the entire IDA portfolio was restructured in 2002 to respond to the urgent
social and economic needs of the country following the six-month political crisis, the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended to add a component to provide a
permanent social safety net mechanism and US$15.7 million was taken from the other
components to be allocated to this new component. The project was also expanded to
include urban areas that were most affected by the crisis.

29. In May 2004, the DCA was again amended to add a new component to the Project,
which would allow the financing of emergency activities following the devastating
effects of the Elita and Gafilo cyclones. The objective of the new component was to
improve the living conditions of the most affected households for a six months period,
including distribution of nutritional supplements and other provisions for pregnant and
lactating women, as well as children under five; critical medicines to combat disease
outbreaks, such as respiratory infections, pneumonia and malaria; and distribution of
drinking water, soap and water treatment kits. The development objective of the Project
was not affected by this amendment.

30. In July 2004, the DCA was amended again to provide a Supplemental Credit of
SDR 34.2 million (US$50 million equivalent) to respond to the most urgent needs of the
population and restore basic infrastructure after the Elita and Gafilo cyclones. The




                                              6

Additional Financing was consistent with the project development objective and
components and could be fully executed during the initial implementation period.

31. Finally, a new Additional Financing was signed in September 2006 in an amount of
SDR 12.2 million (US$18 million equivalent) to finance the completion of the on-going
program and clarify the future role of FID in the decentralization process. This Additional
Financing consolidated the full-fledged components and activities that had been added
over the life of the Project. It also financed capacity building activities (US$1 million), as
requested by the Ministry of Decentralization and Regional Planning (Ministère de la
Décentralisation et de l'Aménagement du Territoire - MDAT) in order to support the
implementation of the Government 2005 Deconcentration and Decentralization Policy.
Under this policy, the Government was planning to establish a Local Development Fund
(LDF) as a means to harmonize and streamline support to local development within the
government structure. A multi-donor financed LDF would consolidate the transfer of
resources to communes in a sustainable way, and would build their long term capacity. In
addition to the preparation of the LDF, the new capacity building activities would support
the establishment and operating costs of eight commune support centers (Centres d'Appui
aux Communes or CAC). CACs, which were composed of three individual consultants,
would be legally attached to inter-communal public organizations (Organisme Public de
Coopération Intercommunale or OPCI). Each CAC would cover between 10 and 15
communes and would provide direct capacity building in areas such as communal
legislation, fiscal management and revenue administration, and would match commune
needs with training service providers and investment funds channeled through the LDF.

32. The Project Development Objective (PDO) under the second Additional Financing
remained the same as under the initial project following the November 2002 amendment.
Project components were the same as those of the initial Project except for the component
on "Cyclone Emergency and Disaster Relief Activities", which was replaced by a new
component 4 on "Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Response to Natural Disasters".
This component focused on disaster-related rehabilitation and reconstruction previously
included in the components of the original project on "Transfer of Funds to Community
Associations" and "Transfer of Funds to Communes". Also, the contents and
implementation modalities of the component for capacity building activities were
substantially modified with the addition of the LDF preparation and the CACs.

33. Following the amendments and additional financings, the project was financed by
three credits/amendments and had six components.

Credits/amendments:
    ·   Credit 3498 ­ MAG ­ DCA dated May 22, 2001 ­ SDR85.2 million ­ US$110.0
        million;
    ·   Credit 3498-1-MAG ­ amending agreement dated July 21, 2004 - SDR34.2
        million ­ US$50 million; and
    ·   Credit 3498-2-MAG ­ Financing agreement dated September 6, 2006 ­ SDR12.2
        ­ US$18.0 million.
    ·   Total: SDR131.6 million ­ US$178.0 million.



                                               7

Components:
    ·   Component 1: transfers of funds to community associations;
    ·   Component 2: transfers of funds to communes;
    ·   Component 3: social safety nets (shocks);
    ·   Component 4: rehabilitation and reconstruction in response to natural disasters;
    ·   Component 5: capacity building activities; and
    ·   Component 6: project administration and supervision.

34. Components 1 and 2 supported local development and decentralization; components
3 and 4 addressed shocks; and components 5 and 6 dealt with cross-cutting issues. These
changes were consistent with the recommendations of the April 2005 Mid-Term Review,
which suggested a clearer institutional and administrative separation of the FID's double
mandate of: (i) supporting long term local development; and (ii) responding to shocks, a
short-term and largely unpredictable activity by nature.

    1.7 Other significant changes

35. The FID's Manual of Procedures was updated to include some modifications in the
allocation to communes, following the Mid-Term Review recommendations. Under the
Original Project, US$5 per capita was allocated to selected communes each year under a
pluri-annual agreement. This created large inequities between communes, and prevented
less populated communes from financing meaningful investments. Allocation to
communes would be based on the cost of priority sub-project in the Communal
Development Plan, with a cap of US$100,000 per sub-project. The system of multiple
agreements with selected communes was replaced by annual agreements. The 66 new
communes, which would be receiving a grant under the 2006 Additional Financing were
to be selected based on a mix of criteria reflecting their poverty and capacity levels
defined in the Manual of Procedures, as well as criteria linked to the sampling
requirement for the planned project impact evaluation. In the future, the targeting criteria
of the Local Development Fund (LDF) would apply.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

    2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

36. The project was designed as a Community Driven Development (CDD) Project
which transfers funds to communities associations and communes. The long-term vision
was that the transfer of funds to communes would be successful, so that their allocation
would increase and they would play an enhanced role in rural development. During the
Mid-Term Review these alternative ways of decentralizing resources to communities
would be compared in terms of the soundness of financial management of project funds
and in terms of the cost, quality and implementation period for similar investments. Any
allocation increase would also be based on commune's implementation capacity, and
particularly their capacity to manage funds.




                                            8

37. The Project aimed to work within a "decentralization" process to communes, since
communes were local governments, had elected officials and were receiving budgetary
transfers. However, the Project was not a comprehensive decentralization Project as it
was not, for example, dealing with fiscal decentralization which can be achieved more
effectively through a macro-economic dialogue focusing on this issue.

38. The choice of FID as implementing agency was logical since FID had successfully
executed social fund projects in Madagascar. With a regional office in each province, it
was a key instrument that could be used to support government decentralization policies.
The FID III project had piloted community management of funds and procurement in
many sub-projects. In view of the somewhat different approaches of the Project, FID
management revised the skills mix of its staff and its organizational structure, and the
recruitment of IEC, MIS and training specialists was a condition of effectiveness of the
initial Credit (3498-0 MAG). Insofar as the Project built on the institutional capacity that
had been established under previous projects executed by FID, the PDO appeared clear
and realistic. However, there would have been a better correlation between the PDO and
the key performance indicator on utilization of assets if the PDO had referred to a
"satisfactory utilization of design capacity", instead of "improved use" of social and
economic services.

39. The Project design incorporated lessons from social funds supported by the Bank
and by other agencies in many regions of the world, as well as from the Bank's
experiences with the earlier social funds projects with FID in Madagascar. It emphasized
governance measures to be put into place, including as conditions of effectiveness.
Lessons learned from previous projects were related to the effectiveness of an
independent execution unit, the need to respect the strategies of sector ministries, the
importance of establishing incentives for good management of project funds, targeting,
procurement, coordination with other agencies, community mobilization and
sustainability. The Project design also included coordination in the rural areas with other
IDA-financed projects.

40. The Project was designed to take into account the structure of the country's rural
society, particularly the structure of rural communities -- where for example notables,
such as teachers or doctors, lead the decision-making process of their communities. The
awareness-creation campaigns would ensure that these notables promote actions that
render investments sustainable through the operation and maintenance phases. The
Project was unusually participative in the context of a country where community
participation is not commonplace. The Project was developed in part through the
feedback of beneficiaries in annual survey assessments. In addition, consultations took
place with deputies, rural mayors, NGOs, decentralized ministerial structures, and civil
society to solicit their views as how best to address issues in rural areas. The 2004
Additional Financing emphasized also the participatory approach, with maximum
community involvement in all phases of the project cycle.

41. During appraisal of the initial operation, the overall project risk was rated as
"Modest". The PAD clearly identified the modest risks (counterpart funds not provided



                                             9

on schedule1, lack of coordination with line ministries, and insufficient implementation
capacity in the country) and appropriate mitigation measures. The most substantial risk
was the risk that the Government would not follow its policy of decentralization and,
therefore, the communes would not be able to finance their share of the cost of
construction or rehabilitation of their infrastructure. With the 2006 Additional Financing,
new risks included the lack of effectiveness of the partnership between the FID and the
Ministère de la Décentralisation et de l'Aménagement du Territoire (MDAT) and the
uncertain financial sustainability of Centres d'Appui aux Communes, CACs.

42. The task team leaders of the IDA-supported projects that directly influence rural
development agreed on a plan for coordination and for joint action as a way of achieving
better results2. The agreement focused on sharing methods for maximizing community
participation (through a common design for participatory rural appraisals) and on joint
geographical targeting of efforts to maximize impacts. The four projects would prepare
and agree on compatible annual work programs. The only area of potential overlap was
irrigation. It was agreed that the CDP would respond to demands from communities for
investments in small-scale irrigation sub-projects (of less than 100 hectares) during a
transition period. On roads, the CDP would finance the rehabilitation of commune roads
requested by communities in their action plans. Since the Government had established
Regional Working Groups (Groupes de Travail Régionaux) to coordinate projects with
investment in agriculture, the Regional Working Groups would participate in the
meetings of the FID regional consultative committees that approve CDP supported sub-
projects.

    2.2 Implementation

43. The Project supported participatory rural appraisals through which the population
identified sub-projects and ranked them in order of priority in a communal development
plan. The communities were also asked to participate by co-financing and by executing
sub-projects proposed in the communal development plans.

44. A number of external events affected project implementation:

    a) The six-month political crisis in 2002 led to the addition of a component to
        provide a permanent social safety net mechanism (cash-for-work program). The
        Project was also expanded to include urban areas that were most affected by the
        crisis.



1This was no longer a risk under the 2006 Second Additional Financing which financed 100% of expenses
including taxes (as per the Country Financing Parameters approved on May 12, 2005).




2The projects are the Community Development Project (CDP), the Rural Development Support Project
(RDSP), the Rural Transport Sector Project (RSTP), and the Second Environment Project (SEP).




                                                  10

    b) Following the Elita and Gafilo cyclones that hit Madagascar from January to
       March 2004, in April 2004 the credit was amended to add a new component to the
       project allowing for financing of emergency activities, and in July 2004 an
       Additional Financing was approved to cover the cost of repairing the damages to
       social and economic infrastructure caused by the cyclones.

45. Under the 2004 First Additional Financing to support repairs of cyclone damages,
beneficiary contributions were not required in the zones that were severely affected in
terms of infrastructure damage (according to the classification by the FID) where people
have lost their homes and field crops. In communities that were moderately or less
affected, a beneficiary contribution was required under the components for transfers of
funds to community associations and communes.               However the percentage of
contribution was smaller than for the initial Project.

46. As mentioned above (see 1.7 on other significant changes), the implementation
modalities of Component 2 on transfer of funds to communes were changed following
the recommendations of the April 2005 Mid-Term Review (MTR).

47. The 2006 Second Additional Financing with the LD sub-component and the pilot
commune support centers (Centres d'Appui aux Communes ­ CAC) introduced a new
project risk, since the CAC concept was not well developed. The project design mitigated
this through a disbursement condition (namely, the submission of a CAC Manual of
Procedures dealing with the legal status of CAC, composition and rules of operation,
administration and finance, work plan and M&E plan).

    2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): Design, Implementation and Utilization

48. The Système d'Information FID, a powerful tool for tracking FID activities, was
upgraded to take into account the further decentralization of project activities to the level
of communes and communities. The system included modules on: (i) management of
beneficiary requests, annual work program and contracts with local consulting firms,
small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and NGOs; (ii) preparation of reports; and (iii)
monitoring of performance indicators. FID linked electronically technical data from its
MIS to data from its accounting system. To complement FID's monitoring and evaluation
system, communities would monitor and evaluate their own sub-projects using agreed
upon output and outcome indicators that communities or communes can monitor easily
and reliably before, during, and after implementation of a sub-project.

49. Key outcome indicators for the project and output indicators for each component
were defined in the original Project Appraisal Document (PAD). Sets of output indicators
were added under the 2004 and 2006 Additional Financings, and one "satisfaction"
indicator regarding the performance of the commune support centers (CAC) was added in
connection with the 2006 Additional Financing.

50. The FID's M&E system has been able to provide a lot of data and information.
However, that information has not always been consistent, which made it difficult for
outsiders to use that information for further analysis aiming at drawing lessons and


                                             11

recommendations for improvement. Also, the system is more a monitoring system (which
has allowed FID to follow closely project implementation) than an evaluation system.
FID does not have in-house capacity to do comprehensive evaluations and contracts them
out to consulting firms or academics. Consultants carried out an impact evaluation in
2006. In order to have more up-to-date information that would be useful for the ICR, a
new impact evaluation was scheduled to take place in two phases: (i) a baseline, which
has been established in February 2007; and (ii) the proper impact evaluation, which had
been designed and planned for early 2009, but could not take place due to the political
events.

    2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental aspects

51. At appraisal, the environmental category of the project was "F" (Financial
Intermediary Assessment). To monitor and evaluate the impact of the Project on the
environment, the Manual of Procedures was revised as a result of the environmental
study of February 1999, requiring the signature of an annual framework agreement
between the FID and the Office National pour l'Environnement (ONE) for each type of
sub-project. This framework agreement defined: (i) the training of FID staff on
environment-related matters; (ii) a plan to train and create awareness on environmental
concerns for the agency's partners (community associations, local consulting firms,
communal authorities, the regional consultative committee of FID, etc.); (iii) the best
procedure to follow for joint approval of sub-projects; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation
systems to follow-up on the impact of the proposed measures on each type of investment.
During the environment study that took place in 1999, FID agreed with the ONE that all
of the agency's sub-projects would be category "1" sub-projects which, according to the
new version of the national legislation, would require only a limited impact
environmental study. This requirement was included in FID's Manual of Procedures.

52. Findings from the field visits and stakeholder interviews during the preparation of
the 2004 Additional Financing suggested that there were potential safeguard risks
associated with ongoing sub-projects that needed to be addressed by FID3. The main
issues identified included: inadequate waste management procedures for health centers
and schools; lack of erosion control measures being used for feeder roads, particularly in
areas prone to erosion; and potential cumulative impacts associated with improved access
to natural habitats and forests via rural roads resulting in habitat degradation. To address
these issues, training was provided to FID staff and implementing partners, such as
NGOs, local consulting firms and subcontractors on the application of good practice
measures for environmental protection during the construction and operation of sub-
projects, and on monitoring sub-projects for safeguard compliance. In addition, the FID's
Manual of Procedures was revised to comply more effectively with the World Bank
safeguard policies and provide more adequate guidelines for the environmental

Communautaire", Banque Mondiale, ERM/AQUATERRE. July 27, 2004.




                                             12

evaluation of small-scale social infrastructure projects. Good practice measures were
integrated into subproject technical specifications. Finally, each of FID's regional offices
subcontracted an environmental specialist (NGO or consultant) to ensure that appropriate
safeguard measures are being implemented and guidelines are being applied.

53. The quality at entry assessment carried out in November 2007 for the 2006 Second
Additional Financing pointed out that the Bank team had failed to comply with the
Bank's policy requiring the disclosure of the EMP before the Bank appraises the Project.
The revised EMP was not disclosed in-country prior to appraisal, but shortly after during
the period June-July 2006. It was received by the Bank but not disclosed at InfoShop
until September 2007. The team, however, was commended for the various evaluation
reports contracted out to assess either the environmental performance or the impact of the
training and capacity building activities. The team was also advised to put in place a
continued supervision system to closely monitor the performance of the executing entities
in the field, given the generally weak environmental capacity of these entities. Some
areas requiring special attention were solid waste management and soil erosion. An
important missing component in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was the
costing of the proposed generic mitigation measures, as well as the cost estimate of the
capacity building measures which needed to be provided. Following the recommendation
of the November 2007 Quality at Entry Assessment of the Second Additional Financing
(Cr. 3498-2), the FID conducted a review of a number of sub-projects in each sector of
activity to better incorporate the environmental dimension at all stages of sub-project
implementation.

Procurement

54. According to the project design, the Bank Guidelines would be used for the
procurement of goods by FID for its own use (purchase of vehicle, computers, etc.) and
for the recruitment of consultants by FID. For all sub-projects financed from grants and
implemented by communities and communes, procurement of civil works, goods and
services financed by IDA would be done in accordance with FID's Manual of Procedures,
which is based on the AFR Simplified Procurement Procedures for Small Projects. Most
contracts for sub-projects would not be subject to prior review. To minimize the risk that
procurement by communities and communes is not in accordance with the procedures
included in FID's Manual of Procedures, technical audits reviewed samples of sub-
projects to verify the conformity of procurement procedures (including contract awards)
and to make recommendations for improving the quality of the works. Procurement
audits were also carried out. All these reviews have been successful, in the sense that FID
has consistently taken into account the suggestions from these reviews to improve the
procurement system and the quality of the works.



Financial aspects

55. At the time of appraisal, a computerized accounting and financial management
system based on internationally accepted accounting principles was operational. This



                                             13

system operated on a decentralized basis with the six (6) regional directorates. The
"special account 90-day advance procedure" especially designed for decentralized
agencies were used to facilitate the operation of FID's regional offices and to ensure
prompt payment of contractors and suppliers. The Manual of Procedures of the FID
addressed the fiduciary aspects of transfers of funds to community associations and
communes. This manual explained the procedures that would be followed by community
associations and communes for procurement, accounts and financial reporting on the use
of funds. In connection with the 2006 Second Additional Financing, the Administrative
and Financial Manual was revised as recommended by a financial management
assessment.

56. There were no major problems regarding financial management. During project
implementation, the FID has consistently maintained a satisfactory and up-to-date
financial management system permitting a close technical and financial follow-up of sub-
projects. Financial Reports have been produced on time during implementation and
financial audit reports were submitted on time and were unqualified.

    2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

57. The end of the Community Development Project (CDP) does not mean the end of
operations for the Fonds d'Intervention pour le Développement (FID). In order to deal
with the very challenging situation created by the combined impacts of the food price
crisis, the oil price shock, and reoccurring devastating cyclone seasons, the Government
of Madagascar and its development partners agreed on a new project. The Bank's
response included, inter alia, a safety net component to provide support to vulnerable
groups who are particularly affected by crises. On December 16, 2008 (that is shortly
before the closing date for the CDP), the Board of Directors of the World Bank approved
an IDA Credit to Madagascar in the amount of SDR 26.9 million (US$40.0 million
equivalent) for an Emergency Food Security and Reconstruction Project. The new Project
will finance a cash-for-work program to increase access to short-term employment in
targeted food-insecure areas. It will also seek to restore access to social and economic
services (schools, health centers, small roads, water systems, etc.) in the aftermath of
catastrophic events, including cyclones. Finally, it will finance community-based social
infrastructure sub-projects in order to increase access to social and economic services
among the poorest communities. The project will be implemented by FID which has a
strong record of successfully implementing similar emergency relief projects. When the
Bank's OP/BP 7.30 "Dealing with de facto governments" went into effect on March 17,
2009, program implementation was put on hold. As long as the political crisis does not
become prolonged, its negative impact on sustainability will be limited because the
process used to implement sub-projects has built community capacity for maintenance
and management of community infrastructure.

58.   With respect to the support to communes and the decentralization program, a
follow-up project is under preparation: the Commune Development Support Program
(CDSP), to be co-financed by a number of development partners including the European
Commission (EC).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

    3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

59. The main objective of the Government's August 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), under the umbrella of human and material security, was to enhance human
capacity and strengthen individual assets, through education, health and nutrition. The
PRSP viewed the commune as the main local service provider and the anchor for all
interventions in this domain. The Bank's November 2003 CAS was designed to support
the implementation of Madagascar's PRSP, focusing Bank interventions on creating a
much larger impact on rural poverty and protecting the most vulnerable against shocks.
The Community Development Project (CDP) was a key element of Bank support to the
PRSP. Subsequently, the Government of Madagascar (GoM) prepared its "second-
generation" PRSP called the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) for 2007-12, and the Bank
prepared its new CAS in March 2007 to support the implementation of the MAP. The
MAP reflected the GoM's focus on delivering services, especially in rural areas. The
CDP addressed key challenges outlined by the MAP, including: (i) improving support for
very poor and vulnerable segments of the population; and (ii) restoring basic social and
economic infrastructure in the aftermath of natural disasters such as cyclones. The CDP
thus continued to be a core element in the Bank's support to the MAP because it
continued a successful and effective program for community development that was
having a real impact on the ground.

60. In addition, with the 2006 Additional Financing, the CDP had a strategic goal of
supporting the agenda of the Ministère de la Décentralisation et de l'Aménagement du
Territoire (MDAT), including the transition to the Local Development Fund (LDF). The
Project was very much aligned with the MAP and plans for the LDF.

    3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

61. An impact evaluation carried out in the third quarter of 2006 and other information
and data monitored regularly by FID show that the CDP has reached, or even exceeded
its development objectives. A new impact evaluation was scheduled to take place in two
phases: (i) a baseline, which has been established in February 2007; and (ii) the proper
impact evaluation, which was originally scheduled for June 2008. Delays in sub-project
implementation and lack of availability of the consultant have delayed the second phase
of the final impact evaluation, which was first rescheduled for early 2010. Since it was
felt that more up-to-date information would be useful for the ICR, the plan was changed
to have a new impact evaluation in early 2009, but it could not be carried out because of
the political crisis.

62. Regarding the two key performance indicators, achievements have been as follows:

A.    The "use" of assets acquired under the Project has been above the target of 80%
utilization of design capacity4, as shown below:

B.      84% of beneficiaries are satisfied with the services provided from the
infrastructure sub-projects, which is above the target of 70%.

63. The Original Credit and the two Additional Financing (Cr. 3498-0, Cr. 3498-1 and
    Cr.3498-2) have also led to the following:

    (i)     implementation of 3,383 community-based social and economic sub-projects
            (including 1,425 rehabilitations and reconstructions in the aftermath of
            cyclones) over a period of 7 years equivalent to the implementation of 483
            sub-projects per annum, which is above the target of 314 sub-projects per
            annum (corresponding to 1,885 community-based social and economic sub-
            projects implemented over a period of 6 years);
    (ii)    186 communes with 3-year plans (Plan Communal de Développement ­ PCD)
            have received annual grants for executing investments, which corresponds to
            the target of 186 communes;
    (iii)   81% of sub-projects are operated and maintained adequately one year after
            completion, which is slightly above the target rate of 80%; and
    (iv)    21.2 million person/days of employment (HIMO) have been created
            benefiting 700,000 individuals, which is slightly above the target of 20.4
            million person/days of employment.

 As mentioned earlier, in view of the wording of this key indicator, it would have been better if the PDO
had referred to "a satisfactory utilization of design capacity", instead of "improved use" of social and
economic services.




                                                    16

64. The CDP had a positive impact on the population, through increased enrolment in
schools, better health care for mothers and children, increases in trade due to the rural
roads and markets, and better access to potable water. Every year cyclones hit
Madagascar with devastating impacts on basic economic and social infrastructure,
including roads, water systems, schools, etc. The response to natural disaster component
of the CDP has financed 1,425 sub-projects which allowed for a fast rehabilitation of
damaged infrastructure and resumption of service in the aftermath of natural disasters.

65. Annex 2 provides more details on outputs and achievements under each Project
component. In terms of infrastructure, the majority of sub-projects were schools,
followed by health centers. The CDP financed 3,790 social safety net sub-projects, which
generated 21.2 million persons days of employment benefiting 700,000 individuals.
Although the Project financed thousands of activities, the amount spent on training was
about half the appraisal estimate. However, community and commune members had
plenty of opportunities "to learn by doing". Regarding the capacity-building supporting
the LDF, there were problems with implementation, and the CAC experience was not
satisfactory. The quality at entry assessment carried out in November 2007 for the 2006
Second Additional Financing commented that the adequacy of the causal links between
the project's activities, outputs, and intended outcomes was satisfactory.

66. The impact study carried out in 20065 showed that the targeting was satisfactory.
Globally, the communes selected by FID were poorer and more "enclaved", or isolated,
than the average rural commune. Almost all communes were satisfied with FID's work,
and eighty-four percent of households were satisfied with the sub-projects financed by
FID.

67. With respect to "governance" at the level of the communities and communes, the
CDP was able to deal satisfactorily with issues that quite often plague CDD operations.
FID entered into grant agreements with community associations and communes, under
which FID would deposit money, in tranches, into their bank accounts to finance
approved sub-projects. A community association, such as a parent association in the case
of a school, would be represented by the President of its project cell (cellule de projet),
and a commune would be represented by its mayor. In accordance with FID's Manual of
Procedures (MOP), sub-projects were selected following a participatory process with the
preparation of communal development plans, so that "elite capture", if any, must have
been very limited. The evaluation carried out in 2006 shows that the participatory process
actually took place: only 6% of the households, a very small minority, considered that the
sub-project was not a priority. The MOP also stresses transparency in the use of funds,
including the procurement of works and goods. When the transfer of the first tranche
takes place, a FID representative attends a meeting of all community members where a
big panel representing a check is displayed so that community members get an idea of the
importance of the sums involved. Community members are told that the project cell must
report to them periodically on the award of contracts, payments made to contractors and
suppliers and any other use of funds. All members can also consult the simplified

   accounting documents kept by the project cell. Project cells are fully empowered to
   manage their bank accounts, but FID receives directly from the bank copies of the
   monthly statements and has the right, acknowledged by the bank, to block the account if
   FID believes that funds have been misused. Finally, the experience shows (and this has
   been confirmed many times by contractors) that communities do supervise sub-projects
   very closely by having a representative present at the work site all the time, in addition to
   the supervising engineer that has been recruited for the job. Social control has worked
   well in the CDP.

       3.3 Efficiency

    68. Research into social funds has shown that cost-effectiveness analysis is more
    feasible and reliable than cost-benefit analysis or calculation of rates of return. That is
    because it is difficult to measure the social benefits of social funds. Therefore, in the
    PAD the economic evaluation of the Project focused on a comparison of the unit costs of
    rehabilitation and construction by the executing agency with those achieved by other
    agencies and by the Government.

    69. Annex 3 on "Economic and Financial Analysis" presents some recent information
    on school construction. According to a July 2008 study6, the evidence is clear that
   community based approaches that empower local communities to implement school
   projects result in lower costs and are more effective in scaling up to build the number of
   schools that are needed. Community delegation has been the most effective way of
   building schools. Another finding of the study is that community participation is key to
   reducing corruption.

70. According to the technical audit reports, the quality of infrastructure financed by FID has
    continued to improve. FID now has a track record of building quality infrastructure in
    most cases at competitive prices and more quickly than other projects. For instance,
    schools and health posts are completed in four to six months.

       3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
    Rating: Satisfactory

    71. The CDP has been remarkably successful, despite some political turmoil in the
    country during the project implementation period. It built on solid achievements of
    previous projects, has adapted well to changing situations and has been able to respond to
    emergencies, such as the cyclones that hit Madagascar every year.

    72. Most performance targets have been exceeded, and 100% of the funds were
    disbursed. The targeting was satisfactory; the communes selected by FID were poorer
    and more "enclaved" than the average rural commune. The vast majority of beneficiaries
    were satisfied with the sub-projects financed by FID. Project implementation has been

cost effective. The Project placed appropriate emphasis on the need to work at
community level. Communities have been able to implement top priorities identified in
their communal development plans.

73. The overall outcome of the CDP is rated "Satisfactory".

    3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


74. The Project achieved its social development outcome --of reinforcing community
institutions--through its work with community associations and commune governments.
In particular, it promoted the engagement of communes in formulating their own
development priorities and plans, and a participatory process for the selection of sub-
projects by communities. The capacity building component funded 1,846 training
activities for the benefit of members of community associations and of elected officials
and personnel of communes in project management, accounting, procurement, etc., and
1,709 IEC activities to, inter alia, ensure that communities can manage and maintain the
infrastructure that are rebuilt or rehabilitated.

75. The CDP focused well on poverty issues. The impact evaluation carried out in 2006
concluded that the targeted communes were among the poorest communes, and were
more "enclaved" (i.e. isolated with more difficult access) than the average rural
commune. Grants for sub-projects were made to some of the poorest communities to the
same extent as to those more capable of implementing sub-projects successfully.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

76. The CDP contributed to develop the capacity of community associations. A lesson
learned is that a Social Fund is a very efficient mechanism to build the capacity of
communities. Benefits of social funds will be considerably increased if their design
allows them to be innovative and flexible.

77. Also, the CDP strengthened the FID itself, and prepared the way for the Commune
Development Support Program (CDSP) through the MDAT.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

78. Regarding rural water supply, a main criticism made to FID at the beginning was
related to poor design and lack of maintenance of FID-funded rural water supply systems.
After the 2005 Mid-Term-Review, FID started preparing its own Manual of Procedures
for Water Supply and Sanitation (MPWSS) in full compliance with the national one and
providing operational guidelines on norms and standards, O&M and M&E. A large
dissemination of this MPWSS associated with adequate training and rehabilitation
programs including pilot affermage contracts with local private operators, rehabilitation
works, and capacity building on community-based management have contributed to
improved results. FID now remains on good terms with the sector ministry contributing



                                               19

to sector policy dialogue and providing valuable inputs to the sector M&E database. A
lesson learned in rural water supply is that compliance with national sector policy and
strategy, as well as strong coordination with the sector ministry, lead to better synergy,
improvement of quality of investment and better sustainability of infrastructure built.

79. The social safety net (cash-for-work) and the post-cyclone reconstruction of the
Project are important programs which provide an overall protection to the Malagasy
population. These elements could be integrated in a social protection (SP) strategy.

80. As mentioned earlier, the CDP strengthened a number of communes through
training of their elected officials and personnel. Also, by providing communes with funds
to carry out sub-projects, it allowed them "to learn by doing". However, out of the about
1,550 communes in Madagascar, only 186 (12%) received financing under the CDP. On
balance, the strengthening of communes had only a limited impact on decentralization.

    3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

81. Annex 5 presents the results of the impact evaluation that was carried out in the
third quarter of 2006, which is in many respects a beneficiary survey. Some of the main
conclusions are summarized below:

    a) The principle of participatory consultation for the preparation of communal
       development plans (Plan Communal de Développement ­ PCD) seemed to have
       been well understood and applied. On the other hand, the use and relevance of the
       communal development plans often encountered operational problems related
       mainly to the coordination with the interventions of other donors in the communes
       and to changes in the municipal teams.
    b) Targeted communes were among the poorest communes, and were more
       "enclaved" (i.e. isolated with more difficult access) than the average rural
       commune.
    c) Populations at the village level were satisfied with the treatment of their requests
       by the communes.
    d) The satisfaction of the communes with respect to FID is very good; it is somewhat
       less with respect to consulting firms, and even a little less still with respect to
       NGOs (partenaires relais).
    e) The infrastructure created by FID is considered useful by a vast majority of the
       population.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

82. The project design included a number of features, which provided incentives to
communities and communes to operate and maintain the sub-projects and to contribute to
project sustainability. This included devolving the power to select and implement sub-
projects to communities and communes, requiring community contributions to sub-
project costs, and training of community associations and commune governments in
project management. In addition, linking the activities of FID to sectoral development


                                             20

strategies and involving deconcentrated ministerial structures in desk and field appraisals
of individual sub-projects were designed to help ensure that line ministries would honor
their agreements to provide staff, equipment, and a recurrent budget for the sub-project
by the time of completion. Although the FID had Memoranda of Understanding with the
Ministries of education and health, coordination suffered from administrative bottlenecks
and communication problems between the Ministries' central offices in Antananarivo and
their provincial and district offices. The freeze on the recruitment of civil servants was
also a problem, but the situation improved from 2006 on when Government made special
efforts to recruit and assign teachers and medical personnel to education and health
facilities.

83. As mentioned earlier, in rural water supply the strong coordination with the sector
ministry resulted in improvement of quality of investment and better sustainability of the
infrastructure built or rehabilitated. However, the FID had less impact in the transport
sector since it was not able to improve the overall framework regarding the sustainability
of rural roads. The sustainability of investments in this sector is still at risk.

84. Although the agreements between FID and the communes included a commitment
on the part of communes to maintain completed sub-projects, the sustainability of sub-
projects implemented by communes will depend on increased fiscal resources of
communes and on the successful execution of complementary investments in rural
development. In particular, the sustainability of the mechanism for the commune support
centers (CACs) is a risk.

85. The project sustainability will be helped by the Commune Development Support
Program (CDSP), which is under preparation and will be financed by development
partners including IDA. The CDSP is consistent with Madagascar's incipient
decentralization strategy, which seeks to strengthen the capacity of local governments
(communes) to provide basic social and economic infrastructure at the local level. A
recently created public agency (the Fonds de Développement Local) will build the
capacity of communes and transfer funds to them to implement sub-projects in areas
under their responsibilities. The project sustainability will also benefit from the recently
approved Emergency Food Security and Reconstruction Project (EFSRP) financed by
IDA.

86. The risk to development outcome is assessed as "Moderate".

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

    5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

87. The Project was well designed, based on a solid country and sector knowledge at
the time. The design was flexible enough so that it could be modified to adapt to
changing circumstances and emergencies. There was a plan for the coordination of the
IDA-supported projects that influence rural development and for joint action in order to
achieve better results.

88. The Project was designed to support the process of decentralization in Madagascar
by working with communes, which are local governments, have elected officials and
remained the focus of Government policies on decentralization.

89. The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated "Satisfactory".

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

90. Project implementation benefitted from a strong Bank team, both in Washington
and Madagascar. The skills mix was excellent, and there was continuity in staffing.
Fiduciary and safeguards aspects were well supervised. An experienced Bank team
enabled a smooth processing of the initial Project, as well as the amendments and
additional financings. The Project was modified, and the legal documents of the initial
Project were amended three times and a new financing agreement was signed in order to
respond to changing country circumstances and urgent needs. The project experience is
an interesting case of an evolution from a purely traditional CDD to a more diversified
project including a safety net (cash-for-work program) and emergency response to crises.

91. The 2006 Additional Financing was strategically appropriate. It was an innovative
use of the additional financing instrument to provide bridge financing while at the same
time supporting government as it shifted from a more traditional social fund (with Bank
financing under a SIL) to a program of local development and decentralization (which
would include Bank financing under a programmatic instrument). With the new local
development direction, the Bank made efforts toward donor harmonization. A lesson
learned is that additional financing (AF) may be an appropriate instrument to serve as a
"bridge" when the policy environment that provides the context for an existing operation
is in transition--when the existing operation is still relevant and appropriate but when
there is a new policy that is being developed and can potentially be supported under the
existing operation.




                                            22

92. The Borrower's ICR stresses that, in addition to financing the Project, the Bank has
been a good technical partner in a constructive and cordial relationship with FID, which
contributed to the good performance of the Project in general and the FID in particular.

93. The Bank's performance for supervision is rated "Satisfactory".

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

94. The Bank's performance for both quality at entry and supervision is rated
"satisfactory". The CDP was well designed and prepared and the Bank did also a good
job at the supervision stage. The overall Bank performance is rated "Satisfactory".

    5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

95. The Government, and especially the Prime Minister's Office (Primature) who is the
oversight Ministry of the Project, have always been very supportive of the Project and of
FID. At critical moments, such as in 2002 with the political crisis and in 2004 with the
cyclones, the Government selected FID to carry out emergency programs. More recently,
FID was also chosen as implementing agency for the Emergency Food Security and
Reconstruction Project (EFSRP). There is a lesson here for development partners such as
the World Bank: it is in their interest to continue to support well-performing and flexible
social funds over long periods in order to have at any time an efficient mechanism to
finance responses to emergencies.

96. The Government has demonstrated its commitment over the years by paying
counterpart funds for the CDP in a timely manner, which has not been the case for all
projects in Madagascar. Some further evidence of commitment is that neither the Prime
Minister nor other cabinet members have interfered in the day-to-day management of FID
and the Project, which helps explain why it was able to perform during times of political
upheaval.

97. The Government performance is rated "Satisfactory".

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

98. As mentioned earlier, the FID, which was created in 1993, had successfully
implemented earlier social funds in Madagascar under IDA -financed projects (the Food
Security and Nutrition Project, the Second Social Fund Project, and the Third Social
Fund Project). FID continued to perform well in managing the CDP and rehabilitating
social and economic infrastructure.




                                             23

99. The FID's Manual of Procedures clearly defined identification, preparation,
appraisal, selection and implementation modalities for each type of sub-project. The
Manual was regularly updated, with the addition of new volumes on "social protection",
"water supply and sanitation" and "environment". The arrangements for the transfer of
funds to communes were revised following the recommendations of the April 2005 Mid-
Term Review. In connection with the 2006 Additional Financing the Administrative and
Financial Manual was also revised as recommended by a financial management
assessment. A lesson learned is that, for social funds that operate independently and do
not need prior approval from the Government or the Bank on their actions as long as they
are in accordance with the provisions of the legal agreements and the Manual of
Procedures, it is very important that the Manual of Procedures be regularly updated and
revised based on the lessons of experience.

100. Procurement was satisfactory. There were no major problems regarding financial
management; audit reports were submitted on time and were unqualified. During the
project period, the FID (like most social funds) implemented activities which were not
financed by IDA; there were important governance issues in the implementation of these
activities outside the Bank project, but no final judgment has been reached on these
issues. No governance issues were experienced in the FID activities implemented with
IDA funds.

101. The main reasons for the success of the CDP are the quality and dedication of the
staff of FID and its management. FID's management is open to constructive suggestions,
whether from Bank supervision missions or from technical and financial audits, which it
takes into account to improve project implementation. FID staff is always responsive to
requests for information. Project management did perform well in response to the
numerous changes and crisis that occurred during project implementation, and it ensured
that nearly all project funds were utilized and properly accounted for. On that basis, the
performance of the Implementing Agency (FID) is rated "Satisfactory".

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

102. With the performance of both the Government and the Implementing Agency (FID)
rated "Satisfactory", the Overall Borrower Performance is rated "Satisfactory".

6. Lessons Learned

    a) A Social Fund is a very efficient mechanism to build the capacity of communities.

    b) Benefits of social funds will be considerably increased if their design allows them
        to be innovative and flexible in order to adapt to changing country circumstances
        and meet urgent needs.

    c) It is in the interest of development partners such as the World Bank to continue to
        support well-performing and flexible social funds as they can be an efficient
        mechanism to finance, at short notice, responses to emergencies or additional


                                            24

       activities to benefit vulnerable groups, including cash-for-work programs and
       other kinds of cash transfers.

    d) Demand driven programs can run the risk that the most able communities will
       fare the best; and social funds need to find ways of working effectively with the
       most vulnerable communities.

    e) Compliance with national sector policy and strategy, as well as strong
       coordination with sector ministries, lead to better synergy and improvement of
       quality of investment and better sustainability of infrastructure built.

    f) Coordination between FID and ministries has led to sector wide improvements,
       including in the definition of technical norms and standards.

    g) For social funds that operate independently and do not need prior approval from
       the Government or the Bank as long as their actions are in accordance with the
       provisions of the legal agreements and the Manual of Procedures, it is very
       important that the Manual of Procedures be regularly updated and revised based
       on the lessons of experience.

    h) Additional financing (AF) may be an appropriate instrument to serve as a "bridge"
       when the policy environment that provides the context for an existing operation is
       in transition--when the existing operation is still relevant and appropriate but
       when there is a new policy that is being developed and can potentially be
       supported under the existing operation.

105. The fact that actual expenditures for community and commune level sub-projects
were only 58% and 63% respectively of the appraisal estimate is the result of the
reallocation of funds to safety net and emergency measures.

106. The increase of nearly 50% of actual expenditure on project administration and
supervision compared to the appraisal estimate is due mostly to a significant
underestimation for that category in the cost estimates for the 2004 Additional Financing
of US$50 million. Whereas "administration and supervision" represented 12.4% of the



                                             27

project costs for the original credit of US$110 million and 14.7% of the project costs for
the 2006 Additional Financing of US$18 million, it was equal to only 1.6% of the project
costs for the 2004 Additional Financing of US$50 million.

107. The fact that contributions from local communities are only one-third of the
appraisal estimates is due to: (i) an overestimation of these contributions in the original
credit; and (ii) the fact that substantial amounts were reallocated to safety net and
emergency measures for which no community contributions were required.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


108. The development objective o f the project is to contribute to the improved use of,
and satisfaction with, social and economic services in participating rural and urban
communities. The project financed six components: (1) transfers of funds to community
associations /community sub-projects; (2) transfers of funds to communes; (3) social
safety nets (shocks); (4) rehabilitation and reconstruction in response to natural disasters;
(5) capacity building activities; and (6) project administration and supervision.

Component 1: Transfers of Funds to Community Associations ­Financing for this
component: US$69.22 million, out of which US$59.92 million from the IDA credits.

110. This component funded sub-projects in rural areas selected through the use of
poverty indicators. The sub-projects were chosen by the communities themselves,
through a participatory rural appraisal process, among a list of qualifying types of sub-
projects (schools, health centers, small-scale rural water supply, rural roads, bridges,
markets, including training for teachers and health workers and IEC activities for various
health programs). According to the Manual of Procedures, education and health sub-
projects had to be approved by the respective ministries and had to meet the design and
technical norms of these ministries. Also, the sub-projects had to cost less than
US$50,000 (US$100,000 for rural roads), and the communities had to contribute in



                                              29

materials, labor or money 15% of the cost (the contribution was 10% for rural roads).
Works were contracted out to the private sector and/or to qualified experienced NGOs.

111. With the exception of some rural transport infrastructure and small scale irrigation,
the sub-projects were managed by community associations which were responsible for
procurement and supervision, and the maintenance of the completed sub-projects. Rural
roads which required a financing from the CDP of more than US$10,000 per sub-project,
and micro irrigation perimeters and water supply schemes which required a financing
from the CDP of more than US$30,000 per sub-project were managed and implemented
by FID under a delegated contract management arrangement7, but with the participation
of beneficiaries.

112. Under this component, a total of 1,958 sub-projects were financed, out of which
1,201 (61%) were schools and 233 (12%) were health centers. The component absorbed
about 36% of the total financing for the CDP.

Component 2: Transfers of Funds to Communes ­ Financing for this component:
US$16.57 million, out of which US$15.15 million from the IDA credits.

113. Under this component, transfers of funds were made to communes to finance
priority investments in their communal development plans (Plan Communal de
Développement ­ PCD). According to the component's original design, funds estimated
at US$5 per capita per year were to be transferred under multi-annual conventions to a
cumulative total of 60 communes in the first year, 120 in the second year, 180 in the third
year, 240 in the fourth year, and 300 in the fifth year. By the end of the Project, the
component would have therefore served 300 of the about 1400 communes in
Madagascar. In order to start transfers to communes quickly, during the first year the
Project was to disburse funds to communes that already had a communal development
plan financed by other partners. After the first year of operation, the component would
distribute funds across provinces in proportion to their share in the rural population and,
within each province, communes would be selected according to their implementation
capacity.

114. To ensure that the communes would be able to manage the implementation of the
sub-projects and their subsequent operation and maintenance, the elected officials and the
staff of the communes were trained in project management, procurement, accounting, etc.
Funds were transferred annually to a separate bank account that each participating
commune was asked to open in a commercial bank. The FID would conduct ex-post
financial audits of investment expenditures on a semi-annual basis. The main purposes of
these audits were to avoid financial mismanagement and corruption, to assure that funds
are used for priority investments identified in the Communal Development Plan, and
finally to confirm that all expenses are eligible for reimbursement and that the commune
governments have respected the provisions of the Manual of Procedures.

115. Investments were identified through a structured consultation of communities. The
choice of investments that could be financed was large since there was no positive list,
but only a negative list of types of investments that could not be financed by the IDA
credit. The commune government and community contribution to the investment was set
at 15 percent, as in component 1. Commune governments were fully responsible for the
selection and implementation of sub-projects.

116. Following the 2005 Mid-Term Review recommendations8, it was decided to stop
the financing of the 120 communes that had already received funds and the
implementation modalities were changed in 2006 in connection with the additional
financing. Allocations to communes were based on the cost of the priority subproject in
the Communal Development Plan, with a cap of US$100,000 per sub-project. The system
of multi-annual conventions with selected communes was replaced by annual
conventions. The 66 new communes receiving a grant under the 2006 additional
financing were selected based on a mix of criteria reflecting their poverty and capacity
levels defined in the Manual of Procedures, as well as criteria linked to the sampling
requirement for the planned project impact evaluation. It was also decided that in the
future, the targeting criteria of the Local Development Fund (LDF) would apply.

117. Under this component, a total of 186 communes benefited from the direct transfer
of funds to communes to finance 694 sub-projects, out of which 232 (33%) were schools
and 106 (15%) were for training. The component absorbed about 9% of the total
financing for the CDP.

Component 3: Social Safety Nets (Shocks) ­ Financing for this component: US$26.31
million, all from the IDA credits.

118. This component was added in November 2002 following the six-month political
crisis to provide a permanent social safety net mechanism and to expand the project by
including urban areas that were most affected by the crisis. Social safety net sub-projects
in the form of cash-for-work were implemented by accredited faith and non-faith NGOs
and associations, with the objective of creating short-term employment and providing
revenues for the most affected families. Eligible sub-projects under this component
consisted primarily of rehabilitation of damaged public infrastructure that could be
implemented using labor intensive techniques ­ HIMO. This component has been
maintained and consolidated as a full-fledged component with the 2004 supplemental
credit and the 2006 additional credit. In connection with the 2006 additional financing, it
was decided that this public workfare program would be activated after a shock has
occurred (weather, price, etc.) and that preference would be given to sub-projects that
would contribute to the prevention or mitigation of future shocks.




8 It was felt that the US$5 per capita allocated to selected communes each year under a multi-annual convention created large inequities between selected and non

selected communes, and prevented lesser populated communes from financing meaningful investments.

119. Under this component, 3,790 social protection sub-projects, which generated 21.2
million persons/days of employment benefiting 700,000 individuals, have been financed.
The component absorbed about 14% of the total financing for the CDP.

Component 4: Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Response to Natural Disasters ­
Financing for the component: US$47.40 million, out of which US$46.54 million from the
IDA credits.

120. This component was added in July 2004 in connection with the US$50.0 million
supplemental credit. It sought to improve the living conditions of the most affected
households for six months after the cyclones, including reducing the risk of malnutrition,
ensuring availability of drinking water, protecting affected households from risk of
disease outbreaks and supporting local health services. These interventions, such as the
distribution of food and non food items, fell outside FID's standard range of activities.
Free food distribution was only provided on an exceptional basis for the vulnerable
population who was unable to work. The component also included rehabilitation of
infrastructure damaged during natural disasters (mostly roofs, windows, and upper walls),
and reconstruction of fully destroyed infrastructure. Sub-projects included: health
facilities, schools, rural water supply and sanitation, feeder roads, bridges, markets, and
administrative infrastructure. The emergency situation created by the cyclones required
rapid action that needed to be implemented without prior or parallel capacity building
interventions. Activities and works were contracted by FID to international organizations
and NGOs or to the private sector, or were implemented by community associations
directly whenever they had the capacity to do it. Works conformed to the FID's regular
anticyclone standards or to standards that have received the prior approval of the FID (in
the case of NGO-executed contracts).

121. Under this component, a total of 1,425 sub-projects were financed, out of which
982 (69%) were schools and 114 (8%) were health centers. The component absorbed
about 25% of the total financing for the CDP.

Component 5: Capacity building activities ­Financing for the component: US$7.88
million, out of which US$7.78 million were from the IDA credits.

122. This component funded 1,846 training activities for the benefit of members of
community associations and of elected officials and personnel of communes in project
management, accounting, procurement, etc. It supported the preparation of 856
participatory communal development plans (Plan communal de Développement ­ PCD).
It also financed 1,709 IEC activities: (i) Information, Education and Communication
(IEC) activities to ensure that communities can manage and maintain the infrastructure
that will be rebuilt or rehabilitated; and (ii) short training on selected themes such as
hygiene, prevention of communicable diseases, STI and HIV/AIDS.

123. The training of members of community associations and elected officials and staff
of communes included the following modules:




                                            32

    a) Project management: creation and management of an association, preparation of
        sub-projects, beneficiary contributions, and contractual agreement with FID.
    b) Technical management: procurement of works and goods, and supervision of
        works.
    c) Financial management: simplified accounting, bookkeeping (bank and cash
        ledgers), payment of contractors and suppliers, and reporting.
    d) Environmental safeguards: integration of the environmental dimension in the
        preparation of sub-projects.
    e) Information - Education - Communication (IEC) and/or formation for the
        maintenance of the completed infrastructure.

124. Elected officials and staff of communes were also trained on participatory rural
appraisals, and on the preparation and management of a communal budget.

125. In connection with the September 2006 additional financing, the component
financed new capacity building activities requested by the Ministère de la
Décentralisation et de l'Aménagement du Territoire (MDAT) for the establishment of the
Local Development Fund (LDF), which was created in February 2007. These activities
included: (i) support for the establishment and operating costs of eight Communal
Support Centers (Centre d'Appui aux Communes or CAC), including training of staff for
all the 18 pilot CACs planned nationwide; (ii) development of training modules on
various themes (e.g. responsibilities of CAC, participatory planning, budget management,
fiscal aspects, etc.); (iii) development of a LDF database and M&E system including a
qualitative survey to measure the impact of CACs; and (v) studies (e.g. a study to define
legal procedures, implementation manual and allocation systems under the LDF).
Regarding the capacity-building activities supporting the LDF, there were problems with
implementation: the FID remained the implementing agency and was responsible for
procurement, disbursements and financial arrangements, but the MDAT was responsible
for the technical quality. An assessment of the CACs was carried out at the end of 2008.
It concluded that the CAC experience was not sustainable and it recommended that it
should not be continued.

126. The component absorbed about 4% of the total financing for the CDP.

Component 6: Project Administration and Supervision ­ Financing for the
component: US$25.38 million, out of which US$21.69 million were from the IDA
credits.

127. This component funded the operating costs of FID which was responsible for
overseeing the implementation of all activities under the project. It also financed social
mobilization and community participation, training of staff, beneficiary assessments,
impact evaluations, poverty studies, monitoring and evaluation, and financial and
technical audits.

128. The component absorbed about 13% of the total financing for the CDP.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

129. Research into social funds has shown that cost-effectiveness analysis is more
feasible and reliable than cost-benefit analysis or calculation of rates of return. That is
because it is difficult to measure the social benefits of social funds. Therefore, in the
PAD the economic evaluation of the Project focused on a comparison of the unit costs of
rehabilitation and construction by the executing agency with those achieved by other
agencies and by the Government. Some limited information on the benefits of social
funds was nevertheless available from beneficiary assessments, mid-term reviews, annual
technical audits, and some partial indicators of benefits were drawn from these sources
and used to supplement the cost-effectiveness analysis.

130. A July 2008 study on "School Construction Strategies for Universal Primary
Education in Africa - Should Communities Be Empowered to Build Their Schools?" ­
Serge Theunynck - examined the scale of the school infrastructure challenge in Africa,
including Madagascar. It assessed the experiences of African countries with school
planning, school facility designs, construction technologies and construction management
over the past thirty years, and drew lessons on promising approaches to enable African
countries to scale up the facilities required to achieve the MDG and EFA goals of
complete quality primary education for all children at the lowest marginal cost. The
evidence is clear that community based approaches that empower local communities to
implement school projects result in lower costs and are more effective in scaling up to
meet the volume required.

131. The chapter on procurement and contract management of the above-mentioned
study analyses the experiences of Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia. It concludes that the notions that
communities and local governments are unable to manage school construction are highly
inaccurate; the evidence is that community delegation has been the most effective way of
building schools. These experiences show that communities can organize themselves
quickly to diagnose local problems, identify priorities, develop solutions and action plans,
and execute those plans. Communities can efficiently and successfully be trained to carry
out procurement and financial management methods that ensure transparency, economy,
and efficiency through adapted training methods. These experiences also show that the
quality of the works done by local contractors is -- as in any other implementation
arrangement -- heavily dependent on the efficiency of the technical supervision.
Technical supervision is always more efficient when the technical supervision service is
contracted out competitively to private sector providers, whether the contract is provided
by communities or any other entity. Communities can procure good technical supervision
services and ensure good quality of the works. Moreover, when communities are
empowered with information, resources and technical support they outperform all other
construction management arrangements in terms of cost for quality and delivery time.



                                             34

132. Regarding costs, a review of unit costs of contract management agencies in school
construction shows that, in Madagascar, the unit cost of AGETIPA managed classroom
construction (US$322/m2) was about 60 percent higher than the cost of projects managed
by the central Ministry of Education utilizing national competitive bidding procedures
(which averaged US$196/m2 under an AfDB-financed project) and almost double the
cost of construction carried out by FID.


133. Another finding of the study is that community participation is a key to reducing
corruption since community members have better incentives to monitor the progress and
quality of the works than bureaucrats do, because communities benefit from the services.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


A. Background

134. The March 2005 mid-term review of the Project recommended that an impact
evaluation of the Community Development Project (CDP) be carried out, as was
envisaged in the project design. This evaluation would be used as a guide for the review
of procedures for the next phase of the project (fiscal year 2007/2008) and would be an
important input for the project completion report.

135. The terms of Reference, methodology and deliverables were defined jointly by IDA
and FID. The study would cover a total of 236 communes and the methodology included
a quantitative part and a qualitative part (which would dwell at length on a retrospective
evaluation). The terms of reference of the study envisaged two distinct stages: a first
stage aiming at setting up a reference base for a series of new sub-projects to be
implemented in 118 communes, with the other 118 communes being the control group. In
the second stage, the evaluation of impact itself would be carried out after the
implementation of the sub-projects during the year 2007/2008. The first stage of the
evaluation was carried out in the third quarter of 2006. The implementation of the second
stage which was originally planned for 2010 was rescheduled for early 2009 in order to
be used as an input for the ICR, but it could not be carried out because of the political
crisis.

136. The present annex presents a summary of the results of the first stage of the
evaluation, which is in many respects a beneficiary survey. This annex deals with the
following aspects of the Project:

    ·  the planning done by communes (Communal Development Plans);
    ·  the targeting of communes and beneficiaries and the selection of the sub-projects;
    ·  the strengthening of the capacities of communes and communities; and
    ·  the appreciation and degree of satisfaction of the communes and beneficiaries
       with the sub-projects and activities.

B. Communal Development Plans

137. The existence of a Communal Development Plan (Plan Communal de
Développement, or PCD) prepared in a participatory manner with the whole population
constitutes one of the eligibility criteria of the Project; this requirement aimed to ensure
that there would be a consensus on the priorities and choices of investments planned for
the commune.

138. Other donors also financed the preparation of communal development plans of
some communes; the study noted that the FID financed the communal development plans
of 42% of the surveyed communes.




                                              38

139. The use and relevance of the communal development plans often encounter
operational problems related mainly to the coordination with the interventions of other
donors in the communes and to changes in the municipal teams (the last municipal
elections took place one year before the study).        This relative obsolescence of a
communal development plan creates a whole set of operational problems at the time of
the intervention of the FID. The FID will rightly ask communes to submit only requests
for priority sub-projects included in the communal development plan, whereas priority
sub-projects may have already been financed by other donors, or a new municipal team
may have priorities which are different from those of the previous municipal authorities.

140. The principle of participatory consultation seems to have been well understood and
applied. Only 10% of the villages (Fokontany) within communes stated that they were
not consulted at the time of the preparation of the communal development plan.
However, among those, 94% indicated that there was a meeting of the population of the
Fokontany to discuss their needs.

C. Targeting of Communes / Beneficiaries and Selection of Sub-Projects

141. Three basic parameters were used for the targeting of beneficiary communes: the
Poverty Index, the difficulty of access (enclavement), and the size (number) of the
population.

142. The results of the study show that the targeted communes are among the poorest
communes; this is due to the fact that the communes targeted to benefit from FID
financing have been precisely the disadvantaged ones.

143. The results are the same, but even more accentuated, for the index of
"enclavement": the surveyed communes, and thus served by the FID, are of a more
difficult access than the average of the rural communes. In fact, the FID wanted to
answer criticisms by choosing communes which are more "enclaved" than those which
received financing for sub-projects under the previous social fund projects.

144. Generally, Fokontany seem rather satisfied with the treatment of their requests by
the communes when they could take part in the decision-making process. Indeed, 30%
declared that they are "very satisfied" with the way the communes took care of their
needs, 38% are "rather satisfied", 23% are "moderately satisfied", 6% are "rather
dissatisfied" and 2% are "very dissatisfied". Obviously, communes cannot classify as
"priority" all the requests that they receive.

D. Strengthening of the Capacities of Communes and Communities

145. The activities of reinforcement of capacities carried out for the benefit of
communes and beneficiary communities are implemented jointly by the FID, consulting
firms and non-governmental organizations ­ NGO (partenaires relais).




                                              39

146. The results of the study show very clearly that the satisfaction of the communes
with respect to FID is very good; it is somewhat less with respect to consulting firms, and
even a little less still with respect to NGOs (partenaires relais):

    ·   60% are "very satisfied" with the interventions of the FID, 24% are "satisfied",
        12% are "moderately satisfied", and only 3% are "dissatisfied";
    ·   38% are "very satisfied" with the interventions of the consulting firms, 39% are
        "satisfied", 16% are "moderately satisfied", and 7% are "dissatisfied";
    ·   35% are "very satisfied" with the interventions of the NGOs (partenaires relais),
        29% are "satisfied", 19% are "moderately satisfied", and 17% are "dissatisfied".

147. In 75% to 95% of the cases, associations of beneficiaries that were established for
new sub-projects remained active for operation and maintenance; it should be noted,
however, that this relatively high "survival" rate may be due to the fact that these sub-
projects were implemented on or after 2003.

E. Judgment of the Beneficiaries on the "Usefulness" of the Built Infrastructure

148. In the survey sample, the distribution of the different types of infrastructure was as
follows:

                       Infrastructure type                   Percentage
                       Primary schools                          32.8%
                       High schools (CEG)                       10.3%
                       Basic health center 1 (CSB1)              3.4%
                       Basic health center 2 (CSB2)             14.0%
                       Market                                    7.1%
                       Feeder road                              10.4%
                       Bridge                                    4.9%
                       Water supply (AEP)                        5.3%
                       Micro irrigated perimeters (MPI)          3.3%
                       Other                                     8.6%
                       Total                                    100%

149. In 76% of the cases, the infrastructure is considered as "very useful" for the
inhabitants of the commune, in 8% of the cases it is "rather useful", in 13% of the cases it
is "moderately useful", and in 3% of the cases the infrastructure are considered as "not
useful", i.e. at the time of the survey the services rendered by these infrastructure are not
satisfactory for the commune.

150. The commune satisfaction rate is greater for infrastructure such as high schools
(CEG), health centers (CSB1), markets or bridges. For the infrastructure which are
considered to be "not useful" by the communes, the suggested solutions are as follows:
increase the size of the construction (35%); rehabilitate / maintain the construction
(32%); provide adequate personnel (11%); provide adequate equipment and supplies
(8%); and complete the construction (7%). It is clear that with the sizable increase in the
number of students in some school infrastructure are "under dimensioned" compared to



                                                40

the needs of the communes. Also, the lack of maintenance for sub-projects such as feeder
roads, bridges or water supply leads to a deterioration of these facilities which prevents
their full use.

F. Appreciation of the contribution and the degree of satisfaction of the final
beneficiaries

151. For the contribution of the households to the construction of the infrastructure, the
households indicated the following: 48% contributed in the form of labor, 14% in cash,
and 8% in building materials (the remaining 29% of households did not contribute
because the infrastructure was not for their Fokontany and they were not regarded as final
beneficiaries according to the type of infrastructure). The contribution of the households
to the sub-projects appears to satisfy the criteria established by the FID, although
checking that the contributions actually reached 10% of the project cost was beyond the
scope of the study.

152. Regarding the satisfaction of the households for the sub-projects in their commune
which were also close to or in their Fokontany: 53% of the households stated that the
construction is "very satisfactory" and 28% stated that the construction is "satisfactory"
(so, a total of 81% of households that are satisfied). On the other hand, 13% of
households find the construction "unsatisfactory" and 4% find it "very unsatisfactory".
(2% of households had no opinion, stating that "they did not know").

153. With respect to maintenance, which is not the responsibility of the FID but of the
communes, one again observes more dissatisfaction than that expressed by the
communes: 37% of households find it "satisfactory", 41% find it "sufficient", 17% find it
"insufficient" and 5% find it "very insufficient".

154. The survey also tried to ascertain whether the participatory process for the
preparation of the communal development plan actually took place. It seems that it is
indeed the case since 68% of the households declared that the sub-project was
"completely" (tout à fait) a priority and 26% said that it was somewhat (à peu près) a
priority. Only 6% of the households, a very small minority, considered that the sub-
project was not a priority.

155. Finally, 81% of the surveyed households believe that they benefit from the sub-
project, and 19% think that they do not benefit from it.

0. Préambule

        Le présent document constitue le Rapport d'Achèvement du crédit relatif à la mise
en oeuvre du Projet de Développement Communautaire (PDC), crédit obtenu par l'Etat
Malagasy auprès de l'International Development Association (IDA) ­ Groupe de la
Banque Mondiale.

    Le rapport d'achèvement comporte trois objectifs principaux dont :

    (i)    L'évaluation de la pertinence du projet par rapport au contexte qui prévalait au
           moment de sa conception et de son exécution;
    (ii)   L'appréciation dans quelle mesure le projet a atteint les objectifs et les
           résultats attendus; et
    (iii)  La formulation des leçons apprises de l'expérience passée au travers des
           processus de préparation et de mise en oeuvre des activités du projet.

    La préparation de ce Rapport d'Achèvement a été effectuée par le Fonds
d'Intervention pour le Développement (FID), Agence d'Exécution du Projet. En effet,
d'après l'Accord de Projet du crédit 3498-2 (section II. A.2), « l'unité de gestion du
Projet fournira à l'Emprunteur (Etat Malagasy) au plus tard le 27 Février 2008 un rapport
qui sera annexé au Rapport d'Achèvement du Projet de la Banque Mondiale ». Compte
tenu du report de la date de clôture des crédits qui est fixée au 31 Décembre 2008, ce
document a été rédigé en Février 2009.

1. Introduction

Dans le contexte de sa stratégie de lutte contre la pauvreté, l'Etat Malagasy a mis en
place le Document Stratégique pour la Réduction de la Pauvreté (DSRP) comportant le
Plan d'Action pour le Développement Rural dont l'objet est d'améliorer la productivité et
la compétitivité de l'économie rurale. Le Projet de Développement Communautaire
(PDC) fait partie de ce plan.

Le PDC est, en général, exécuté par les Communautés et les Communes suivant une
approche participative ; ces entités sélectionnent, exécutent, gèrent et entretiennent les
infrastructures financées sur la base de leur demande ou priorisation.

Le coût initial du Projet est estimé à l'équivalent de USD 137 millions :

           -    110 millions de USD de l'IDA
           -    5 millions de USD de l'Etat Malagasy
           -    22 millions de USD au titre des la contribution des bénéficiaires.




                                              44

La répartition du financement de l'IDA par composante9 se présente comme suit :

(i)     La composante « Transferts de fonds aux Associations Communautaires »
        pour un montant de 80 Millions USD,
(ii)    La composante « Renforcement de Capacités » pour un montant de 15 Millions
        de USD,
(iii)   La composante « Transferts de Fonds aux Communes » pour un montant de 25
        Millions de USD,
(iv)    La composante « Administration du Projet et Suivi Evaluation » pour un
        montant de 17 Millions de USD.

Le Projet est administré par le Fonds d'Intervention pour le Développement (FID),
association sans but lucratif et reconnue d'utilité publique, qui a géré avec succès des
fonds sociaux, financés par l'IDA et le Gouvernement malgache depuis 1993.

Les documents relatifs à ce crédit ont été signés le 22 Mai 2001. Ces documents sont
constitués par :
    -   Accord de Crédit entre le Gouvernement Malagasy et l'IDA,
    -   Accord de Projet entre le FID et l'IDA,
    -   Convention (de rétrocession du crédit) entre le Gouvernement Malagasy et le FID.

Toutefois, trois évènements majeurs ont marqué la vie du Projet entre la signature des
premiers accords de 2001 jusqu'en 2007 :

    1. La mise en place d'une nouvelle composante en Novembre 2002 intitulée
        « Protection Sociale » à travers une affectation d'un montant de 15,7 Millions de
        USD par l'amendement de l'Accord Crédit initial. Cette composante a été conçue
        pour faire face aux impacts socio-économiques à la sortie de la crise post-
        électorale que le pays a traversée en 2001-2002.
    2. La rétrocession par le Gouvernement Malagasy d'un crédit octroyé par l'IDA
        d'un montant de 50 Millions de Dollars (crédit supplémentaire) pour les travaux
        de réhabilitation / reconstruction d'infrastructure et les activités d'urgence de
        protection et d'assistance sociales nécessitées par le passage de deux cyclones
        dévastateurs (Elita et Gafilo) au cours du 1er trimestre 2004.
    3. L'octroi d'un crédit additionnel d'un montant de 18 Millions de Dollars en
        2006/2007 afin d'une part, parachever le programme en cours (crédit initial et
        crédit supplémentaire) et d'autre part clarifier le positionnement du FID dans le
        processus de décentralisation mis en place à Madagascar.

Remarquons qu'au cours de la conception du crédit additionnel 3498-2 MAG10 en 2006,
bien que les composantes de base du FID énumérées ci dessus n'ont pas changé

substantiellement, les interventions en post catastrophe telles les activités de protection
sociale et les réhabilitations/reconstructions post cycloniques sont devenues des
composantes à part entières.

Enfin, il faut noter qu'en cours d'exécution du Projet, des réallocations de crédit alloué
entre les composantes ont été rendues nécessaires compte tenu des exigences générées
par l'avancement entre les composantes elles-mêmes (voir section 8).

    2. Objectifs et description du Projet

    2.1. Objectifs du Projet

Selon l'accord de crédit de développement en date du 22 mai 2001, le Projet de
Développement Communautaire (PDC) a pour objectif de contribuer à (i) une meilleure
utilisation par les communautés rurales concernées des services sociaux et économiques
fournis par le projet, et (ii) une augmentation du degree de satisfaction de ces
communautés rurales quant à la fourniture de ces services».

C'est pour réaliser cet objectif que le Projet de Développement Communautaire (PDC)
comprenait initialement les trois composantes principales suivantes : (i) Transfert de
fonds aux Associations Communautaires (ii) Transfert de Fonds aux Communes et (iii)
Renforcement des Capacités.

Les diverses conjonctures déjà énoncées dans la section précédente et qui sont par
ailleurs citées lors de la revue à mi parcours du Projet en Mars 200511 ont fait que
certains rajouts et recentrages ont été apportés à l'endroit de la mission du FID à savoir :

    (i)     Les activités de « proximité » matérialisées par les composantes Transferts de
            fonds aux associations communautaires et le Transfert de Fonds aux
            Communes, et qui se rapportent essentiellement à l'appui au développement
            local et à la décentralisation,
    (ii)    Les activités qui sont focalisées pour les « chocs » à savoir les composantes
            Protection Sociale et la composante Réhabilitation / Reconstruction post
            catastrophe, domaines auxquels le FID a démontré son efficacité
            d'intervention et
    (iii)   Les activités « transversales » qui se rapportent aux activités de Renforcement
            de Capacités et l'Administration du Projet (composantes 5 et 6).

Finalement, la configuration finale des composantes du Projet se présente comme suit :

        Composante 1 : Transfert de fonds aux Associations Communautaires
        Composante 2 : Transfert de fonds aux Communes
        Composante 3 : Activités de Protection Sociale
        Composante 4 : Réhabilitation/Reconstruction - Catastrophes naturelles

          Composante 5 : Activités de Renforcement de Capacités
          Composante 6 : Administration et supervision du projet

Ainsi, bien que les composantes initiales du Projet n'ont pas connu de modifications
substantielles, les références aux composantes du Projet dans ce qui suit, se baseront sur
ces 6 composantes citées ci-dessus.

2.2. Description des composantes :

Composante 1 : Transfert de fonds aux Associations Communautaires

Cette composante couvre une grande partie des fonds du projet et finance la construction
et la réhabilitation d'infrastructure socio économiques à travers des financements directs
aux associations communautaires pour les sous projets d'infrastructure sanitaires,
scolaires, adduction d'eau, route, ponts, marchés. Ces travaux sont confiés à des petites et
moyennes entreprises ou ONGs qualifiées et impliquent directement les communautés
pour la passation de marché et la supervision de projet. Dans ce cas précis, certains
projets communautaires d'ouvrages d'art de petite envergure (ponts, radiers, etc.) peuvent
être gérés et exécutés directement par les communes ; les mêmes modalités de gestion et
réalisation s'appliquent toutefois aux associations de bénéficiaires et communes.

Par contre, les projets communautaires de routes rurales (et ouvrages s'y rapportant et
d'aménagement hydrauliques de moyenne envergure (c'est-à-dire les routes rurales qui
nécessitent pour leur réalisation un financement du PDC supérieur à 10.000 USD éq. par
projet, et les micro périmètres irrigués ­ MPI ­ et adduction d'eau potable ­ AEP ­ en
réseau qui nécessitent pour leur réalisation un financement du PDC supérieur à 30.000
USD éq. par projet) sont gérés et réalisés par le FID en maîtrise d'ouvrage déléguée
(MOD) avec la participation des bénéficiaires.

L'association des bénéficiaires et la commune passent avec le FID une convention de
maîtrise d'ouvrage déléguée et une convention d'entretien.

Une fois les conditions décrites ci-dessus remplies et que les projets ont reçu
l'approbation des différentes instances appropriées du FID, la convention de financement
est signée entre ce dernier et l'Association des bénéficiaires (visée en outre par le Maire
de la Commune).

Composante 2 : Transfert de fonds aux Communes

Sur la base d'une programmation d'investissement de la commune, issue du Plan
Communal de Développement ­ PCD ­ et auquel le FID peut préalablement participer au
financement de sa réalisation, le FID passe avec la Commune requérante et éligible une
Convention de Transfert de Fonds pluriannuel12 pour que la commune puisse elle-même
réaliser son programme d'investissement prioritaire (étant entendu que l'investissement

12 A l'issue de la revue à mi parcours du Projet en 2005, il a été décidé que les transferts de fonds aux communes ne
s'effectueront plus de manière pluriannuelle mais sur la base d'une activité priorisée à partir du Plan Communal pour
le Développement. Le conditions de gestion des fonds ainsi que les modalités de supervision du FID restant les mêmes.

ne se fasse pas sur une activité incluse dans la liste négative13). En appui au transfert
direct des fonds au compte bancaire de la commune, le FID contribue à la formation des
communautés et responsables communaux à la gestion de projets, comptabilité et
passation de marchés, à financer des activités d'Information, Education et
Communication afin de garantir que les communes pourront assurer la gestion et la
maintenance des infrastructure reconstruites ou réhabilitées.

Composante 3 : Activités de Protection Sociale

Cette composante concerne les activités liées à la mise en place de filets de sécurité
sociale par la réalisation de travaux de faible technicité utilisant le système de haute
intensité de main d'oeuvre (HIMO) et avec un système de rémunération du type « argent
contre travail » ou ACT. Elle vise particulièrement à pourvoir des revenus temporaires à
des couches de la population victimes de catastrophes d'origine climatique ou non.

Composante 4 : Réhabilitation/Reconstruction - Catastrophes naturelles

Cette composante concerne les activités de réhabilitation ou reconstruction post
cycloniques (y compris les dégâts suite à une inondation.

Composante 5 : Activités de Renforcement de Capacités

Cette activité consiste en la formation des communautés et responsables communaux à la
gestion de projets, comptabilité et passation de marchés, à fournir un appui à la
confection du plan communal de développement, à financer des activités d'Information,
Education et Communication afin de garantir que les communes pourront assurer la
gestion et la maintenance des infrastructure reconstruites ou réhabilitées ; de fournir
également des formations sur des thèmes sélectionnés comme l'hygiène, la prévention
des maladies transmissibles, le VIH SIDA.

Il faut noter qu'en 2007, lors de la mise en place du crédit additionnel 3498 ­ 2 MAG,
une sous composante (dénommée 5-b) a été mise en place qui consiste à un appui au
Ministère chargé de la Décentralisation.

Composante 6 : Administration et supervision du projet

Dans le cadre de cette composante, le Projet finance les frais d'administration et
d'exploitation, la formation du personnel, l'évaluation des bénéficiaires, les évaluations
d'impact, les diverses études ainsi que les audits techniques et financiers.

   3. Evaluation rétrospective de la préparation et de l'exécution du projet

   3.1. Points forts :

   3.1.1. Interne :

   D'une manière générale, l'on peut noter une intégration réussie de leçons apprises en
   terme de gestion de projets communautaires initiés au cours du Projet FID III.

   -   Ressources humaines / expertise : les expériences acquises lors de la réalisation
       des trois autres fonds sociaux précédents ont constitué une masse significative
       d'expertise constituée de cadres opérationnels et compétents en réalisation de sous
       projets.
   -   Décaissement : le rythme de décaissement et la qualité de la gestion financière du
       FID ont fait que d'une part, aucun problème majeur n'est survenu au cours de la
       réalisation du Projet et que d'autre part, tous les audits financiers externes réalisés
       n'ont pas fait l'objet de réserves tels que requis par les Accords de Financement.
   -   Organisationnelle : La présence d'unités décentralisées (Directions Régionales) a
       permis une bonne couverture nationale ayant permis un taux élevé de pénétration
       même au niveau de zones très enclavées.
   -   Flexibilité opérationnelle : Le rajout de certaines composantes / activités telles la
       Protection Sociale en 2002 ainsi que les Dégâts Cycloniques en 2004 ainsi que les
       réorientations de la Revue à mi parcours en 2005 n'ont pas influé l'opérationnalité
       du Projet. Toutefois, il faut noter qu'entre 2004 et 2006, une saturation due aux
       charges créées par le Programme Dégâts cycloniques a été constatée.
   -   Du point de vue procédurier : La disponibilité d'une procédure opérationnelle
      suffisamment précise mais souple ainsi que le système d'information comptable et
      de suivi évaluation adapté a permis une aisance opérationnelle pour l'atteinte des
      objectifs.
   -  Mémoire institutionnelle :
      Depuis le début de ses activités en 1993, le FID a engrangé une masse importante
   d'informations relatives au développement local qui peut être mis à la disposition
   pour une meilleure vision de la politique de développement de Madagascar. Cette
   masse d'information mérite d'être valorisée au mieux et le pays surtout en cette
   période où le processus de décentralisation est en cours.

   3.1.2. Externe :




                                              49

    -   Notoriété de l'institution vis-à-vis des autorités (gouvernement, administration,
        élus) :

        Les autorités tant nationales (gouvernement) que locales (élus communaux) ont
        toujours manifesté une confiance certaine au FID. Particulièrement au niveau
        national, aux moments critiques tels en 2002 (crise post électorale) ou en 2004
        (post cyclones), le FID a été choisi comme l'Agence d'Exécution des programmes
        établis. Dernièrement, dans le cadre des réponses aux menaces de la crise
        alimentaire et pour la gestion des situations post catastrophes (cyclones), le FID
        vent d'être choisi comme agence d'exécution du Projet EFSRP.

        De par ses statuts, le FID est sous la tutelle de la Primature. Toutefois, cette
        dernière, dans le cadre des Manuels de Procédures laisse le champ libre au FID
        dans la gestion quotidienne et les décisions opérationnelles mettant ainsi le FID à
        l'abri des trafics d'influence politique divers.

    -   Confiance des bénéficiaires :

        Les bénéficiaires ont toujours gardé à travers le FID l'image de « l'engagement
        tenu ». En effet, le FID a toujours tenu ses engagements pour la réalisation des
        requêtes des bénéficiaires dès qu'il s'est prononcé à les réaliser. L'affluence des
        demandes qui arrivent au FID justifie cette confiance et côté satisfaction, la
        dernière étude effectuée en 2006/2007 note un taux de satisfaction de 84 % de
        bénéficiaires aux interventions du FID.

    -   Qualité des réalisations ­ normes anticycloniques :

        D'une manière générale, la qualité des infrastructures réalisées par le FID est
        appréciée par les bénéficiaires/utilisateurs. Particulièrement concernant les normes
        anticycloniques, les ministères sectoriels en général et le ministère de la santé en
        particulier ont bien apprécié les infrastructures financées par le FID si bien que
        lors d'une récente évaluation faite en 2008 initiée par le Gouvernement14, le FID a
        été cité comme étant l'Agence de référence de mise en application des normes
        anticycloniques. De même, le FID est retenu par le MEN comme partenaire
        stratégique dans la construction de nouvelles salles de classe dans le Programme
        « Education pour Tous ».

    -   Disponibilité d'un réseau fiable de partenaires techniques (MPE, BE, PR, AGEX)
        formés.

        La présélection annuelle de ses partenaires techniques (MPE, BE, PR) suivie de
        cycles de formation ou de recyclage ont mis à la disposition du FID un réseau

reconstruction after the 2008 cyclone season in Madagascar ­ Cyclone Fame, Ivan and Jokwe"

   fiable de partenaires techniques (sous traitant) qui garantissent la bonne réalisation
   des activités menées.

   - Création d'emplois temporaires ou permanents très significative pendant la
   durée de vie du Projet. Cette création d'emploi s'est matérialisée par la naissance
   d'entreprises de BTP et de bureaux d'études techniques         ainsi que les emplois
   générés par les chantiers de Protection Sociale.

3.2. Points faibles :

3.2.1. Interne :

-   Mise en place tardive des études de référence pour l'évaluation d'impact du
    Programme.
-   Difficulté et retard dans la mise en place d'un système informatisé de suivi
    évaluation.
-   Insuffisance de formation du personnel à l'extérieur.

3.2.2. Externe :

   Bien que des conventions ont été établies entre le FID et avec les ministères
   sectoriels aux fins de bien coordonner les activités (particulièrement la mise en
   cohérence avec les programmations sectorielles des sous projets approuvées par le
   FID sur la base de requêtes communautaires), cette coordination a beaucoup
   souffert de la lenteur administrative, de la carence en communication entre les
   centres de décisions ministériels et leurs services déconcentrés à l'exemple des
   CISCO et des Services de Santé de District (SSD) pour ne citer que les cas des
   Ecoles et des CSB (carence en personnel d'exploitation, insuffisance de fonds de
   fonctionnement) qui s'est nettement amélioré par ailleurs depuis 2006.
   Toujours du point de vue externe, la soutenabilité des réalisations a des fois
   souffert de la non appropriation par les bénéficiaires des réalisations ce qui
   compromet la pérennisation des acquis.
   Par ailleurs, la faiblesse technique et financière des partenaires sociaux
   (communes et communautés) a été notée durant la réalisation du Projet.
   Enfin, il mérite de mentionner quant aux dérangements causés par les difficultés
   engendrées par l'irrégularité de la disponibilité des autres sources de
   financement telles les RPI (pour le paiement des TVA) ainsi que les apports
   bénéficiaires dans les régions très pauvres (cas de la province de Toliara).

4. Analyse des principaux facteurs ayant affecté l'exécution et les résultats.

   La rigueur et le professionnalisme qui ont prévalu dans l'exécution des activités
   par le FID ont affecté de manière favorable à l'atteinte des résultats. Ceci est dû
   d'une part à la qualité professionnelle et la motivation de ses agents mais aussi et
   surtout la disposition de manuels de travail (manuels de procédures et manuels
   d'exécution) clairs et très pertinents d'autre part.



                                         51

         Néanmoins, la saturation des charges liées aux activités de dégâts cycloniques de
         2004 a quelque peu        affecté défavorablement cette bonne performance en
         particulier au niveau de la capacité d'absorption des partenaires du FID.

  impacts du projet (en particulier, par rapport à l'objectif de développement du
  projet).

    6. Analyse de la pérennité des acquis et résultats du projet

        Les principaux résultats obtenus par le Projet s'articulent ainsi autour de trois
thèmes principaux :
                  a.     La mise en place d'infrastructure pour la fourniture des services
                         socio-économiques de base dans les zones rurales, généralement
                         pauvres,
                  b.     Les activités de renforcement de capacité des communautés de
                         base et des gouvernements locaux (communes)
                  c.     La mise en place d'un réseau de partenaires techniques en vue de
                         la mise en norme des prestations et la pérennisation du métier
                         (entreprises de travaux publics, bureaux d'études, appuis socio-
                         organisationnels et formation).

       Pour la mise en place d'infrastructure de base, l'on peut affirmer que le Projet a eu
un impact significatif relativement aux infrastructures sociales de base, notamment sur
l'éducation (écoles) et la santé (centres de santé de base).

           Quant aux mesures qui méritent d'être retenues afin d'assurer la pérennité des
   réalisations     du    projet,     celles-ci          devraient       s'articuler    principalement
   sur l'institutionnalisation de la culture d'entretien initiée et mise en place lors de la
   réalisation des infrastructures.

           Normalement, cette action devrait être coordonnée par les entités déconcentrées
   des départements concernés dans leurs secteurs respectifs avec la collaboration des
   bénéficiaires et communes eux-mêmes.

           Le manque de moyens est toujours évoqué comme un blocage substantiel pour
   l'atteinte de ces objectifs mais avec le processus de décentralisation et déconcentration en
   marche, l'espoir est      permis pour une meilleure gestion et entretien du patrimoine
   communautaire en terme d'infrastructure de base. C'est dans ce sens que le FID a
   systématisé l'intégration d'un fonds d'entretien dans le coût d'un sous projet qui est
   restitué à la réception technique.

       Enfin, la valorisation des acquis par les entités bénéficiaires (communautés et
   communes) qui ont collaboré avec le Projet est aussi un point qui ne saurait être négligé.
   En effet, les formations et encadrements fournis aux bénéficiaires méritent d'être
   valorisés au mieux et la mise en place du futur Fonds de Développement Local devrait
   profiter pleinement de ce terrain déjà déblayé par le FID.

       7. Analyse des performances des différentes parties prenantes :

           Les différentes parties prenantes du Projet sont principalement : l'agence
   d'exécution (FID), les communautés bénéficiaires et les autres partenaires techniques
   impliqués dans le projet, les communes et administrations décentralisées, la Banque
   Mondiale, le Gouvernement.

        7.1. Le FID :

           Le FID, en tant qu'agence d'exécution du Projet a toujours mené sa mission telle
   que celle-ci a été définie dans les accords légaux. En terme de performance, du point de
   vue gestion de Projet, les audits tant financiers que techniques ont toujours mentionné


                                                     55

une conformité de la situation managériale du Projet par rapport aux accords passés, les
manuels de procédures et la qualité des interventions.

        Néanmoins, s'il y a un point qui mérite d'être mentionné, le volet Renforcement
de Capacités a souffert d'une performance plus ou moins mitigée due principalement à
son caractère transversal et étant donné qu'en tant qu'investissement social, cette activité
aurait dû être perçue et menée sur le « long terme », les péripéties ayant affecté le Projet
avaient plus ou moins perturbé l'exécution de cette composante. Toujours est-il que, dans
des cas précis, l'on peut dire que le Projet a laissé une empreinte non négligeable en
ayant façonné une visibilité très objective du développement local tant au niveau des
communes que des communautés.

7.2. Les communes et communautés bénéficiaires :

             Dans la majorité des cas, les attentes des communes et communautés dans le
cadre de la réalisation du Projet ont été satisfaites.

             En effet, la participation de ces bénéficiaires directs dès la conception de leurs
sous projets, passant par les apports requis et à travers l'appropriation par la mise en
oeuvre des plans d'entretien a toujours été citée comme exemplaire.

             Toutefois, dans certains cas, la non appropriation des réalisations avec un
défaut d'exploitation ou d'entretien constitue la forme la plus évidente d'une contre
performance de ces entités. Les facteurs qui ont influé cet état des choses sont constitués
principalement par les conflits sociaux ou politiques15 et la faiblesse technique et
financière de la plupart des communes rurales.

7.3. Les partenaires techniques :

             Les partenaires techniques du FID sont le Petites et Moyennes Entreprise de
travaux publics, les Bureaux d'Etudes, les Partenaires relais sociaux et les Agences
d'Exécution d'activités de Protection Sociale.

             Les formations que le FID a prodiguées à l'endroit de ces entités et la
régularité des marchés ont permis sans conteste le développement de ces partenaires. Sur
la base de la préselection périodique effectuée par le FID, ces entités sont répertoriées
parmi les bons partenaires techniques en terme de développement socio-économique au
niveau local à la disposition de la décentralisation.

             Toutefois, l'instabilité du secteur de services a perturbé des fois le
développement de ces partenaires techniques et qui explique la difficulté d'une véritable
professionnalisation.

7.4. Les administrations décentralisées :

                                                      56

            L'implication des entités décentralisées (ou déconcentrées) dans le processus
de réalisation des sous projets a toujours été satisfaisante. Toutefois, souffrant d'une
communication déficiente par rapport aux instances centralisées à partir desquelles
certaines décisions ont dû être prises, ces partenaires locaux du Projet ont montré une
performance moyenne. Le manque manifeste de moyens constitue aussi l'un des facteurs
qui ne leur a pas permis de bien jouer le rôle qu'on attendait d'eux.

7.5. La Banque Mondiale

            La Banque Mondiale n'a pas été uniquement un bailleur de fonds pour le
Projet. Dans le cadre de relations cordiales et constructives, elle a été une partenaire
technique à part entière qui a permis la bonne performance du Projet en général et du FID
en particulier.

7.5. Le Gouvernement
            Depuis sa création en 1993, les statuts du FID le mettent sous la tutelle de la
Primature. Dans la préparation comme dans l'exécution des programme qui se sont
succédés dont le PDC, le FID          a bénéficié d'un fort soutien de cette dernière en
particulier et du gouvernement en général pour le prémunir de toute influence politique
néfaste qui pourrait nuire à l'atteinte des objectifs de développement du programme.

              9. Les principales leçons apprises de l'expérience du projet.

              -  L'expérience « polyvalence » des cadres en 2003 a rudement mis à l'épreuve la
                 qualité des prestations : il est indiqué de laisser les cadre exercer strictement dans leur
                 domaine d'expertise.
              -  L'expérience de 2004 lors des dégâts cycloniques a montré que :
                 o La capacité d'absorption nationale, notamment des partenaires locaux de
                     développement a une limite objective qu'il faut tenir compte à un moment donné.
                     De même, un changement significatif qualitatif ou quantitatif du Programme doit
                     toujours s'accompagner d'une évaluation de l'intégration aux fins d'une
                     adaptation de la structure organisationnelle en conséquence surtout en terme de
                     ressources matérielles et humaines.
                 o La soutenabilité des sous projets routiers du PDC est souvent difficile. Dans tous
                     les cas, le manque de moyens des communes biaise le résultat des activités de
                     renforcement de capacités financées par le FID dans ce domaine. L'adéquation de
                     la méthodologie avec les moyens gagne à être évaluée sérieusement pendant la
                     préparation d'un programme similaire.
              -  La dimension environnementale qui a été intégrée dans le processus de mise en oeuvre
                 des sous projets a été un des points qui mérite d'être mentionné étant donné qu'elle a
                 permis d'incrémenter la qualité des réalisations.



                                                           58

10. Conclusion :

La mise en oeuvre du Programme de Développement Communautaire a marqué un point
important dans le processus de développement local tendant à une bonne effectivité de la
politique de décentralisation à Madagascar.

En effet, le Programme a objectivement jeté les bases d'un développement harmonieux
émanant des véritables aspirations des communautés de base et partant d'une
participation citoyenne significative. De par les impacts des activités du Programme, le
gouvernement dispose ainsi à l'heure actuelle d'un terrain suffisamment « défriché » sur
lequel se développera sûrement la politique de décentralisation mise en oeuvre depuis
quelques années.

Le Programme a aussi permis le développement d'une institution qu'est le FID qui peut
être qualifié comme une agence d'exécution de référence en terme de réalisation d'un
programme requérant une bonne qualité d'expertise. Et c'est probablement pour cette
raison que, depuis le 16 Décembre 2008 que le FID fut retenu par le gouvernement et la
Banque Mondiale pour exécuter un nouveau programme de sécurité alimentaire et de
reconstruction post catastrophe, naturelle ou non.
