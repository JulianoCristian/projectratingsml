Those communes, selected based\n            on poverty indicators, will be improved through community\n            mobilization, and consultation processes, to be able to\n            identify specific investments, and contribute as well, a\n            percentage of its costs, in materials, labor, and money.\n            Financing of consulting services will be provided for\n            technical aspects of the investment, and training will\n            ensure the adequacy of the investment cycle; 2) support\n            capacity building activities for local government officials,\n            and personnel of commune governments. Training in community\n            participation, mobilization, and in drafting communal\n            development plans will be provided, in addition to\n            accounting, fiscal budgeting, and procurement training; 3)\n            transfer funds to communes for financing activities in their\n            communal development plans, with full powers over project\n            execution to commune governments; and, 4) finance the\n            operation of the FID entity, which will be responsible for\n            overseeing the implementation of activities financed by the project."}, "docdt": "2001-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
