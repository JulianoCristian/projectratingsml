                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The RCIP Rwanda project has made significant progress to achieve its objectives and its disbursement rate improved significantly (over 72% of the grant amount has been disbursed
                         and over 82% has been committed) over the last 2 years. The 2 largest contracts for the pre-purchase of international Internet capacity (IRU) were successfully awarded and signed
                         in mid-2012. The tender resulted in very competitive price for the capacity thanks to tender design and strong competition between the bidders. Both contracts have been successfully
                         implemented and the provided capacity brought great benefits to Rwanda's population in terms of cheaper and faster Internet. Several critical technical assistance assignments and
                         capacity building have been also completed in support of the Ministry of Youth and ICT, regulatory authority, and RDB. The sub-component supporting the roll-out of broadband
