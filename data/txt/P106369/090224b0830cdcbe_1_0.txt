 As of January 2015, the project team re-assessed the progress on several subcomponents and concluded that the activities undertaken had contributed
 significantly to the PDO, and was having substantial impact on the development of the country. As a result of this analysis, the ratings for the project
 were reassessed and raised to Satisfactory (except for FM). During the April and July missions, the project team confirmed that the ratings were
 appropriate. All the indicators in the PAD have been successfully reached or surpassed.

               This was added as a standard for the sector but it is not collected by the Government. This indicator should look at availability of access,
               which is 90% coverage in the country. The indicator which measures the number of internet subscribers, above, is more useful.

               This indicator was designed to measure 128 kbps but that unit is no longer used. The unit of measurement can be calculated to 256 kbps.
               Indicator value is USD51 for fixed and USD28 for mobile. Target has been greatly exceeded and is now measured in mbps.

               Comments
               The point of this indicator was to measure if the governmental units were able to fully expend their budgets, with the support of technology
               provided by the project. This indicator has been exceeded.

               This indicator was earlierstated as a percentage but it was deemed easier to understand as an absolute number and has been modified for
               this ISR. As of 31 July 2015, with the delivery and installation of the new Rwanda Online service centers all earlier 700 institutions have
               been connected and additional sites were also provided for, bringing the total number of institutions to 810, exceeding the target. This is
               under last mile connectivity. This includes schools, health clinics, government offices and Rwanda Online service centers.
