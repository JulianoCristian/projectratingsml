 As of January 2015, the project re-assessed the progress on several subcomponents and concluded that the activities
 undertaken had contributed significantly to the PDO, and was having substantial impact on the development of the
 country. As a result of this analysis, the ratings for the project have been reassessed and raised to Satisfactory. Nearly
 all the indicators in the PAD have been successfully reached or are near targets. The new procurement plan has been
 issued a No Objection, and activities are on track for a successful completion by end July 2015. Activities added were
 mostly a strengthening and consolidation of existing investments, and more capacity building for the team to
 implement them.

 Client never collected this information. However, the footprint of broadband services is nearly 90% of the country; fewer actually use it.

               MTN charges USD 50 per month for this service, which was originally 128kbps but is now measured in mbps. For this price, the value is
               USD 50 per 256kbps. So it is about twice as good as the number indicates.
