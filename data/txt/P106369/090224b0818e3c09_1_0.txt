                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The RCIP Rwanda project has made significant progress to achieve its objectives and its disbursement rate improved significantly (over 45% of the grant amount has been disbursed
                         and over 75% has been committed). The 2 largest contracts for the pre-purchase of international Internet capacity (IRU) were successfully awarded and signed in April 2012 and July
                         2012 respectively. The tender resulted in very competitive price for the capacity thanks to tender design and strong competition between the bidders. In addition, several critical
                         technical assistance assignments have been completed in support of the regulatory authority and RDB. The sub-component supporting the roll-out of broadband services and supply
                         of broadband connectivity to institutions is delayed by the Government.
