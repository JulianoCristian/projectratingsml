 NOTE: As of the date of this interim ISR, December 24, 2014, the TTL reports that the following text will be updated in the January 2015 mission after
 discussions with Government.
 The RCIP Rwanda project has made significant progress to achieve its objectives and its disbursement rate improved significantly (over 72% of the
 grant amount has been disbursed and over 82% has been committed) over the last 2 years. The 2 largest contracts for the pre-purchase of international
 Internet capacity (IRU) were successfully awarded and signed in mid-2012. The tender resulted in very competitive price for the capacity thanks to
 tender design and strong competition between the bidders. Both contracts have been successfully implemented and the provided capacity brought great
 benefits to Rwanda's population in terms of cheaper and faster Internet. Several critical technical assistance assignments and capacity building have
 been also completed in support of the Ministry of Youth and ICT, regulatory authority, and RDB. The sub-component supporting the roll-out of
 broadband services and supply of broadband connectivity to institutions is delayed by the Government and is at risk. The project has been extended by
 18 months to allow for the completion of the implementation of the second contracts for the pre-purchase of international Internet capacity and the
 implementation of the sub-component supporting the roll-out of broadband services and supply of broadband connectivity to institutions. The next
 Implementation Support mission is planned for June 16-18, 2014.
 The final decision by the Government on the way forward with the sub-component supporting the roll-out of broadband services and supply of
 broadband connectivity to institutions by end of August 2014 is key for its implementation by the closing date.
