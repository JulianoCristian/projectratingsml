                         The RCIP Rwanda project has made significant progress to achieve its objectives and its disbursement rate improved significantly (almost 60% of the grant amount has been
                         disbursed and over 80% has been committed). The 2 largest contracts for the pre-purchase of international Internet capacity (IRU) were successfully awarded and signed in
