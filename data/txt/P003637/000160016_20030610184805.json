The objective of the Program is to:\n            (1) address emergency needs for W&S-related diagnosis,\n            clinical management, and personal protection that are\n            necessary to bring the current epidemic fully under control;\n            and (2) support the Government's efforts to strengthen\n            the capacity of the public health system more generally so\n            that China's health system is prepared to combat the\n            possible re-emergence of SARS and, equally important,\n            similar infectious disease threats that might occur in the\n            future. There are 3 program components: Component 1 supports\n            program planning, coordination, and policy development\n            activities. Component 2 supports clinical management of SARS\n            patients including setting up fever clinics, renovating\n            designated SARS hospitals and wards, training female and\n            male health care workers, strengthening personal protection\n            measures for health care workers, providing emergency\n            supplies, undertaking regular supervision, and carrying out\n            operational research. Component 3 supports disease\n            prevention and control, with a focus on SARS and other\n            infectious diseases including strengthening disease\n            surveillance and case reporting. The eight operations\n            comprise: the Environmental Technical Assistance Project\n            (report no. P6056), the Loess Plateau Watershed\n            Rehabilitation Project (report no. 12593), the Yangtze Basin\n            Water Resources Project(report no. 13674), the Southwest\n            Poverty Reduction Project (report no. 13968), the National\n            Rural Water Supply Project (report no. 16380), the Basic\n            Health Services Project (report no. 17403), the Fourth Rural\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project (report no. 19226), and\n            the Enterprise Reform Project (report no. 19300).  In all\n            cases the reallocations would neither compromise the\n            original objectives nor the economic viability of the eight\n            projects concerned. The respective Development Credit\n            Agreement for each of the eight operations, listed will be\n            amended to add a new component covering activities to be\n            carried out under the SARS and Infectious Diseases Response\n            Program and to enable Credit proceeds to be used to fund the\n            activities. For activities that will be carried out by\n            provinces, agreements will be entered into with each\n            province for the carrying out of such activities using the\n            proceeds of the Credit."}, "docdt": "2003-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
