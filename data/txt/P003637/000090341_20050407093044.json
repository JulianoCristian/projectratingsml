The\n            lessons learned indicate that water plant management\n            practices need to be streamlined, with an emphasis on\n            strengthening financial management and accounting practices.\n            Standard accounting formats should be used in all Water\n            Treatment Plants (WTPs) with on-the-job training imparted to\n            plant staff. Demand management needs strengthening. More\n            emphasis needs to be put on: (a) accurately forecasting\n            demand for piped water supply to optimize plant size and\n            production capacity; and (b) stimulating demand for safe\n            water by conducting effective hygiene promotion campaigns as\n            well as raising revenues to finance the cost of production.\n            Procurement should be decentralized. Centralized procurement\n            led to delays in project implementation. Decentralizing\n            procurement responsibility to the provinces or even to the\n            counties would speed up implementation and also make the\n            local levels more accountable for timely implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
