The core\n            components are three: (1) Water supply -providing safe water\n            to poor communities currently lacking such supplies, by\n            maximizing community participation in selecting service\n            alternatives, and supporting water system operator and\n            accounting training to keep costs low and ensure project\n            sustainability; (2) Sanitation and health education,\n            involving working with primary school teachers, village\n            doctors, Women's Federation representatives, and public\n            health systems in their efforts to improve water use and\n            sanitation practices in the villages by supporting\n            demonstration programs to increase use of composting\n            latrines, preparing health education messages aimed at\n            expanding adopting improved sanitation and hygiene\n            practices, primarily among housewives, school-aged children,\n            and household decisionmakers, and training health education\n            specialists; and (3) Project management, supporting\n            increased project office capacity to service villages,\n            including surveys and research, and training in procurement,\n            water supply technologies, water quality protection, and\n            health message delivery."}, "docdt": "1997-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
