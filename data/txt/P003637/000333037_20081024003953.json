Some lessons learned included:\n            designed appropriately, projects provided a very good\n            platform for sound dialogue between international technical\n            assistance, national expert panels, and local institutions\n            which also enhances local capacity and ownership of\n            outcomes. A well-prepared Program Implementation Plan (PIP)\n            improves understanding of program objectives, activities,\n            and ownership. It also smoothes program implementation and\n            helps clarify implementation responsibilities when many\n            agencies are involved. Program training can contribute to\n            capacity building and institutionalization of management\n            systems when conducted systematically over the life of the\n            program. Ensuring active involvement of responsible\n            government department and officials in operational studies\n            succeeded in translating findings and recommendations from\n            operational research into policies. The joint donor\n            financing arrangements resulted in improved coordination\n            which assisted in ensuring good outcomes. Joint donor\n            financing of one Government of China (GOC) program made it\n            easier for government to make effective use of available funds."}, "docdt": "2007-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
