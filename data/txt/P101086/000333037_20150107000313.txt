 Synopsis

   Illiteracy and malnutrition are not easily visible: a child might appear healthy but be growing too slowly. A
   child may be enrolled at school and able to read but be below the age-appropriate standard. The Gov-
   ernment of Peru is defining and popularizing clear standards for such basic development outcomes, in
   order to strengthen the accountability of service providers to their clients and help improve results.
