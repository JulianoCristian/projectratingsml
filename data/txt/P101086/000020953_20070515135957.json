for FY 07, 08\n            and 09) to support the Government of Peru (GoP) in\n            strengthening the accountability framework and improving\n            results in health, nutrition and education the Peru REACT\n            DPL supports actions in primary education, health and\n            nutrition to define standards and set goals for the outcomes\n            which families should expect for their children. This will\n            be coupled with the development of robust monitoring systems\n            providing up-to-date information on the performance of\n            health posts and schools and individualized data for parents\n            on the health, nutrition and learning status of their\n            children. The operation also supports actions to reduce\n            exclusion, rationalize programs, to improve targeting and to\n            increase the participation of poor communities in budget\n            processes and program monitoring. The REACT DPL series is\n            expected to lead to improved outcomes in second grade\n            literacy (especially in rural schools); increased access to\n            institutional birth services in the 10 poorest departments\n            (covering a third of the population); and increased coverage\n            of individualized growth monitoring and counseling services\n            for children under 24 months of age in areas with a high\n            incidence of chronic malnutrition (stunting)."}, "docdt": "2007-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
