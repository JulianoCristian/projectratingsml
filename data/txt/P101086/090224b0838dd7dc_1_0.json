   Project for Peru were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: overall, the three-operation REACT DPL series has\n            been successful in supporting a coherent program of reforms\n            to strengthen accountability and improve outcomes in the\n            Peruvian social sector. A critical success factor is the\n            high level of government ownership of the policy reforms\n            supported by the program. The Peruvian government strongly\n            endorsed the case for more transparency about outcomes.\n            Support for the program came both from the Ministry of\n            Economy and Finance (MEF) and line agencies. Support was\n            also reinforced by the government of Peru\u2019s generally\n            participatory approach to policy reform. Multi-stakeholder\n            dialogues were carried out at critical stages of policy\n            design and implementation. This dialogue helped boost\n            support from governmental and nongovernmental actors and\n            counteract the resistance of interest groups potentially\n            affected by some reforms. The REACT program focused on\n            supporting universal reforms rather than pilots in a case\n            where there was no need to experiment and where reforms were\n            less costly than in other cases. A package of services,\n            including non-lending and lending in health, nutrition,\n            social protection, and education, was critical in\n            strengthening the implementation and sustainability of the\n            policies supported by the REACT series. Government\n            leadership was important for the development of a\n            sustainable metric for the universal standard test (UST)\n            system in education. It is also necessary to provide schools\n            and parents with timely and meaningful feedback about the\n            results and to be prepared to budget additional resources to\n            support improving teaching quality and better nutritional counseling."}, "docdt": "2015-11-23T00:21:01Z"}
