F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The development objectives of the REACT DPL series was to support policies that were expected
to lead to (a) improved parental understanding of expected outcomes in education, health, and
nutrition; (b) improved outcomes in second grade literacy (especially in rural schools); (c) reduced
maternal and neonatal mortality; and (d) better nutrition outcomes.

The development objectives remained the same throughout the series. However, the team changed
the indicators formulated for the First REACT DPL and replaced them in the Second REACT DPL
with indicators relying on regular survey and administrative information. Indicators for the first
series, which could not be measured, are presented at the end of annex 2.

1.      From 1990 onward, in spite of significant investment in basic education and health, which
greatly increased coverage, Peru exhibited a persistent lack of progress with respect to basic human
development outcomes. For example in 2005, only 15 percent of Peru’s second-grade students
were reaching grade-level sufficiency in literacy and roughly half were unable to read at all. In
terms of health, 30 percent of five-year old children in Peru were chronically malnourished. In
both cases, the outcomes were particularly poor in rural areas and among indigenous communities.
The resulting inadequate human capital formation, as reflected in the nutrition and education status
of children, threatened to become an obstacle to competitiveness and undermined efforts to
diversify into economic activities with more local value added, which require a more sophisticated
labor force. At the same time, the World Bank experienced some difficulties in engaging in the
social sectors in Peru. The only coordinating body across sectors was the Inter-ministerial
Commission for Social Affairs (Comisión Interministerial de Asuntos Sociales) based in the Office
of the Prime Minister, which, as such, did not have a strong mandate nor the technical capacity to
engage with the Bank as a reliable and effective crosscutting interlocutor. The Ministry of
Economy and Finance (Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas [MEF]) tried to fill this vacuum with
limited success, as sometimes the social sectors perceived its intervention as an imposition and
intrusion.

2.      In this context, the Bank elaborated the Rendición de Cuentas para la Reforma Social
(RECURSO) study, which focused on issues of service quality, results, and accountability and
suggested policy options to overcome stagnant Human Development (HD) outcomes. The basic
assumption was that increased spending alone is not enough. Improving outcomes will also require
better governance, which includes appropriate incentives and institutional arrangements for
holding service providers accountable. RECURSO was based on the analytical framework of the
‘accountability triangle’ (presented in the 2004 World Development Report) and on the lessons
learned in the implementation of a previous development policy loan (DPL), the Programmatic
Social Reform Loan (2001–2005). The initial hypothesis behind RECURSO postulated that in
Peru the improvement of social services quality was in need of an external ‘shock’. Clients,
providers, and politicians were seen to have fallen into a low-equilibrium trap, accepting the low
quality and with no incentive to redress that situation. The proposed external shock consisted of
defining and disseminating standards that will reveal the poor quality of services and outcomes
provided at that time, pointing to the gaps between users’ entitlements and actual services
delivered, and enhancing users’ knowledge of these entitlements. In the case of education, for
example, the expected result was that a better understanding by parents of how their children
should be developing will crystallize in the form of greater engagement between parents, schools,
and health posts, creating manifest pressure for improved service quality. The underlying idea is
that of promoting a notion of entitlement—rights–of households and communities to acceptable
development outcomes for their children, linked to clearly defined standards for those outcomes.

3.     Following extensive policy dialogue around RECURSO, policies to strengthen results and
accountability occupied center stage in the strategy of the government of Peru, which took office
in 2006. In October 2006, the MEF, the social sector ministries, and the Bank participated in a
two-day workshop on RECURSO’s findings in Lima. Following this, to complement the ongoing

                                                     1
analytical work being developed by RECURSO and translate it into action, the government
requested Bank support for the implementation of its results-orientation strategy in the social
sectors through a DPL series, called the Results and Accountability (REACT) Program.

4.      The REACT series consisted of three loans, processed in FY07, FY09, and FY11,
respectively. The operation’s policy matrix laid out strategies to strengthen the results and
accountability framework in Peru’s social sectors and helped basic education and health and
nutrition services break out of the aforementioned low-equilibrium trap. The REACT Program
supported the establishment of transparent performance standards, encouraged partnerships
between regulators, user organizations, parents, and subnational governments to demand
improvements and results, and developed complementary supply-side initiatives to help services
to deliver on the quality improvements induced by the demand-side interventions. While the last
DPL closed in FY11, because the second one included a Deferred Drawdown Option that has been
extended to FY16, this latter year is the official closing date of this programmatic DPL. Indicator
end target dates are therefore also dated FY11, but the text of this Implementation Completion and
Results Report (ICR) will report on indicators up to 2015, to illustrate the sustainability of reforms.

1.2    Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.     The objective of the REACT DPL series was to strengthen the results framework and
accountability relationships in education, health, and nutrition and this objective remained the
same throughout the series. The development objectives of the REACT DPL Program was to
support policies that were expected to lead to (a) improved parental understanding of expected
outcomes in education, health, and nutrition; (b) improved outcomes in second grade literacy
(especially in rural schools); (c) reduced maternal and neonatal mortality; and (d) better nutrition
outcomes. These outcomes are all highlighted as key development outcomes of the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS).

6.      The REACT Program supported policies to define standards for the outcomes which
families and service providers should expect for children, as a way to observe service quality. This
was coupled with the development of monitoring systems providing up-to-date information on the
performance of health posts and schools and individualized data for parents on the health, nutrition,
and learning status of their children. This set of policies aimed at reinforcing accountability
relationships in all three dimensions of the ‘accountability triangle’, by supporting policies to (a)
strengthen client power through reinforcing citizens’ entitlements and enhancing their capacity to
hold service providers accountable; (b) strengthen the compact of budget holders and service
providers; (c) initiate the rollout of performance budgeting in the social sectors; and (d) reduce
exclusion and improving targeting of social programs and policies by strengthening the voice of
user communities and increasing their participation in budgeting and program monitoring.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and key indicators, and
reasons/justification

7.     There were no revisions to the PDO. However, indicators initially selected to measure
parental understanding of expected outcomes in education, health, and nutrition were replaced by
key indicators measuring the implementation of the reforms supported by the series and their
expected outcomes. Indicators on parental understanding of outcomes were not available at

                                                      2
baseline and were only collected in 2009 as part of the Peru Standard Survey 2 supported by
RECURSO. It was therefore impossible to use them to measure the outcome of the DPL series.
However, the new indicators selected had the advantage of relying on periodic data produced by
recurrent surveys or administrative information, instead of on specific surveys made to cope with
the monitoring needs of the DPL program. The second and third REACT DPLs added an identity
indicator to the original results framework, to reflect the relevance of early identification of rural
children as a pivotal factor to improve their access to key social services. The new set of key
indicators aim at measuring expected education, health, and nutrition outcomes derived from the
policy reforms in terms of either improvements in the quality and coverage of services or final
results. The following were the key indicators used by the series:

         •   Education: Improved second grade reading comprehension reflected in an increase in
             students registered as fully proficient from 16 percent in 2007 to 35 percent by 2011,
             and improved second grade math performance reflected in an increase in students
             registered as fully proficient from 7 percent in 2007 to 30 percent by 2011.

         •   Health: Rural institutional birth coverage increases from 49.4 percent in 2007 to 70
             percent in 011. Maternal mortality is reduced from 164 per 100,000 live births in 2007
             to 120 in 2011, and neonatal mortality is reduced from 15.2 per 1,000 live births in
             2007 to 14.6 in 2011.

         •   Nutrition: By 2009, average frequency of nutritional monitoring of children reaches 4
             Child Growth and Development (Control de Crecimiento y Desarrollo [CRED])
             controls in the first year of life and 2 in the second year of life. Stunting rates for
             children under 5 years of age are reduced from the baseline of 28.5 percent in 2007 to
             23 percent by 2011, in line with the new World Health Organization (WHO) standard.

         •   Identity: Peruvian children born after 2008 automatically receiving a unique personal
             identity number (Código Único de Identidad [CUI] when their birth is registered.

1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

8.     The policy actions supported by the operation were organized into the following five broad
areas:

      (a)    Improved parental understanding of expected outcomes in education, health, and
             nutrition. The REACT DPL Program supported actions in primary education, health,
             and nutrition to define standards and set goals for the outcomes which families should
             expect for their children. This was coupled with the development of robust monitoring
             systems providing up-to-date information on the performance of health posts and

  The Peru Standard Survey is a nationwide survey of 7,000 households, implemented between June and August
2009. It provided a unique set of data about users’ perceptions on nutritional and educational services in Peru,
parents’ perceptions of the child’s current developmental status, how the parents get information about the services
their children are receiving and the child’s present state, and what the real developmental attainment of the child is
in terms of reading comprehension or nutritional status. The survey was carried out by Cuanto, under contract to the
MEF. Funding came from a Policy and Human Resources Fund Grant from the government of Japan, which
supported the preparation of the second REACT DPL.

                                                               3
            schools and individualized data for parents on the health, nutrition, and learning status
            of their children.

      (b)   Improved outcomes in second grade literacy (especially in rural schools). The
            REACT DPL Program supported the development of a system to monitor outcomes,
            through a universal standard test (UST), as the basis for school-level accountability in
            primary education performance. The program assisted the government in providing
            targeted support to help teachers, schools, and regions to close this gap.

      (c)   Reduced maternal and neonatal mortality. The REACT DPL Program supported the
            Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud [MINSA]) strategy to increase the coverage
            and quality of institutional birth (IB) services in Peru as a key standard for the
            performance of the primary health system, focusing on rural areas and the poorest
            departments, where coverage deficits are most marked.

      (d)   Better nutrition outcomes. The REACT DPL Program supported the development of
            a strong national monitoring and counseling system that will track individuals’
            trajectories on height and weight and provide parents with timely advice about how to
            improve their children’s nutritional status. The program also supported a change in the
            rules of the Integrated Health Insurance (Seguro Integral de Salud [SIS]) system to
            allow it to fund CRED services and the setting of goals for CRED production agreed
            between the health sector and the performance budgeting system for each health
            executing unit.

      (e)   Improved governance in social programs. The REACT DPL Program also supported
            complementary governance actions to facilitate the achievement of the preceding four
            outcomes. In particular, it sought to assist the government’s efforts to ensure that all
            citizens under 18 years of age were provided with a CUI as well as actions to strengthen
            the links between budgeting and outcomes, through the rollout of performance
            budgeting in the social sectors and increased participation of poor communities in
            budgeting and program monitoring.

1.5     Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

9.      In the health sector, the emphasis shifted from supporting performance agreements to
strengthening SIS, and Universal Health Insurance (Atención Universal de Salud [AUS]) in
2008/09. Therefore, the Bank team adjusted the third REACT DPL policy matrix to reflect this
shift in emphasis. This change was made to reflect lessons learned as program implementation
progressed. It did not, however, affect the REACT Program’s medium-term objectives or expected
outcomes.

1.6    Other Significant Changes

10.     The results orientation of the REACT DPL Program was successfully interpreted and
implemented at its introduction by the MEF as a requirement for social program administrators to
link new funding requests to a logical model that defined goals and specified results indicators.
Moreover, there were a number of other improvements to program budgeting and monitoring,
including (a) strengthening the high-level strategic planning process and reinforcing its links to
macro-budget allocation decisions that are relevant to financing strategic goals; (b) enhancing
dialogue with sectors and regions to improve alignment of actors with national and sector
priorities; (c) moving toward a more decentralized performance management system which creates
‘budget headroom’ beyond the precommitted line items, to allow budget holders (line ministries
and regional governments) greater discretion in resource allocation, in pursuit of targeted results
based on performance information; (d) relying less on ring-fencing and more on achieving results;
(e) improving the quality and relevance of cost analysis and identifying critical bottlenecks in the
process; and (f) aligning the incentives of service producing units (below the level of budget
executing units) with the high-level goals of the system.

11.     The size of the DPL loans was changed during the course of the series, although the timing
of roughly 15–18 months between loans was maintained. Rather than three loans of US$150
million each, as had been foreseen at the start of the program, the actual series included a first loan
for US$150 million in FY07 as planned, a second DPL in FY09 for US$330 million for which the
government elected the deferred drawdown option (DDO), and a third loan for US$50 million in
FY11. The changes in the size of the loans reflected changes in the government’s financing
requirements over the four-year period. In particular, the US$330 million DDO was provided and
fully disbursed on September 3, 2015, in support of a specific government strategy to secure
contingent financing in the face of the economic uncertainties generated by the 2008–2009 global
financial and economic crises.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

12.     All prior actions were fulfilled. A summary of the prior actions included in each of the
three DPLs under the REACT series is provided in table 1. A number of supporting actions aimed
at ensuring adequate implementation of the key prior actions were also included in the policy
matrix under each of the main pillars and were monitored and met. Design of prior actions and
supporting actions was drawn from dialogue with the government and based on lessons learned
from the implementation of the previous programmatic policy-based loan, the Programmatic
Social Reform Loan, and findings of the analytical work undertaken through the RECURSO
analytical and advisory activities (AAA) initiative, which was partially financed through grants
for US$1 million, principally from Great Britain’s Department for International Development.
More details concerning the analytical work and consultation undertaken as part of the
development of the REACT DPL series are described in section 2.2 (factors affecting DPL
implementation).

2.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation

13.     As the overall performance of the REACT DPL Program has been satisfactory, most of the
factors affecting implementation have been positive and conducive to the success of the program.
Even with the impact of the 2008–09 global financial and economic crisis, which had implications
for macro management and demands on policymakers’ attention, attainment of the identified
(ambitious) triggers was largely met. Although it will be inaccurate to attribute the substantive
achievements reached by Peru in education, health, and nutrition to the policies supported by the
program during the period of its implementation, outcome evidence has been consistent with the
expected direction of results.

14.     Strong government ownership and commitment. The reform program supported by the
REACT DPL series had the strong support of the government of Peru, which made many public
statements in support of improving quality and strengthening accountability in the social sectors.
The involvement of the president, throughout his administration, reduced the risk that changes at
the ministerial level could derail the program. Beyond the support of the president, there was clear
buy-in from stakeholders of many specific elements of the reform agenda that emerged from the
analytic and advisory activities of the Bank (especially RECURSO), and consultations made by
the government and the Bank throughout the implementation of the REACT DPL Program. Indeed,
in many instances the DPL process and the discipline and attention to detail it implied, came to be
viewed as an important tool for key champions of reform within both the concerned line ministries
and the central ministries. This was particularly important in bringing about the high-level policy
focus and bureaucratic consensus needed to advance and implement the reform agenda within what
was (and is) a highly complex institutional environment involving a range of subnational actors as

                                                              9
well as a number of line ministries at the central level. Last, but not least, the DPL program
objectives and prior actions were fully based on the government’s reform program (in turn
associated with the findings of Bank-supported AAA), thus ensuring that commitment was strong
and ownership was consistent from the outset.

15.     Stable political and economic environment. During the period of the DPL series, there
was considerable political stability, with the same government in place for the entire design and
implementation period. As mentioned above, the strong support of the Peruvian president helped
ensure that personnel changes at both the high- and mid-level echelons of the concerned line
ministries did not have an adverse impact on implementation of the DPL program. In terms of the
economic picture, the country remained generally stable despite a severe shock in the wake of the
2008 global financial and economic crisis. Peruvian officials, with support from external partners
(including the Bank through its complementary Fiscal Management and Competitiveness DPL
series), made important fiscal adjustments which both maintained fiscal balance and expanded
public spending to reduce the probability of a severe recession taking hold. This continuity at the
economic and political levels kept the reform agenda on track.

16.     Strong and continuous analytical support. The REACT DPL Program built on the
analytical and policy dialogue work of the RECURSO AAA study—A New Social Contract for
Peru. As mentioned above, RECURSO argued that to break out of prevailing ‘low-level
equilibria’, in which clients accept mediocre outcomes, it is necessary, after raising awareness of
these mediocre outcomes, to establish transparent performance standards, strengthen regulatory
systems by creating effective accountability mechanisms, and encourage parents and local
governments (which are assuming a growing role due to the decentralization process) to demand
better outcomes. Analytical work continued throughout the implementation of the REACT DPL
Program, through the RECURSO programmatic AAA for FY07–11, which supported the DPL
program through timely studies and technical assistance (TA) activities on the theme of standards
and accountability.

17.     Extensive consultations with civil society and subnational actors. The REACT DPL
series supported the mobilization of diverse social actors to press for change in service quality,
especially in poor rural communities (many with large indigenous populations). To avoid the risk
that conflicts could arise in this complex setting, the government undertook extensive consultations
with civil society on the rationale and strategies to be supported by the operation. The Bank also
carried out a poverty and social impact assessment (PSIA), which identified possible negative
impacts on vulnerable communities, traced points of support and resistance, and developed
suggestions on strategies that might be adopted to offset possible negative impacts and to
overcome obstacles (for example, through the adjustment of the strategy to avoid unnecessary
conflicts such as the reaction of the teachers to the introduction of standardized testing; and the
adequate design of communications strategies).

18.    Coordination with development partners. In keeping with the Bank’s agenda of strong
harmonization and coordination between partners, the DPL series was prepared in close
collaboration with a number of development agencies, many of whom were already engaged in
various aspects of the REACT agenda. For example, the Bank collaborated closely on issues of
macro management (especially fiscal issues) with the International Monetary Fund (in the context
of an FY07–09 Stand-By Agreement), with the Inter-American Development Bank on issues

                                                    10
surrounding public expenditure management (including PBB and participatory budgeting [PB] and
monitoring), and with a wide range of bilateral and multilateral agencies—Deutsche Gesellschaft
für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, United States Agency for International Development, Great
Britain’s Department for International Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency,
Cooperación Suiza de Desarrollo, Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional para el
Desarrollo, Cooperazione Italiana, and so on—through active participation in donor thematic
groups coordinated by the Peruvian government. There was also exceptionally strong coordination
with the United Nations system, the Gates Foundation, and the Nutrition Initiative (a coalition of
nongovernmental organization [NGOs] and United Nations and bilateral agencies) on the nutrition
component of REACT, as well as systematic support from a Japan Social Development Fund-
financed TA operation.

19.     Synergies with other Bank operations. As noted earlier, there were close synergies
between the REACT DPL series and other Bank operations, including the Fiscal and
Competitiveness DPL which, among others, supported the broad PBB framework within which
the strategic budget programs of the social sectors, backed and monitored by the REACT DPL
series were developed. Moreover, the dialogue between the government and Bank teams involved
in the preparation and supervision of the two DPL programs proved to be fruitful in addressing the
specific challenges posed by the application of PBB principles to the social programs.
Additionally, there was a synergistic interaction between the REACT series and a number of
human development sector investment operations in Peru, whereby the REACT series provided an
articulating framework for operations such as the Health Reform Program II Adaptable Program
Lending, the Social Sectors TA loan, the non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) program in
nutrition and education, and the preparation of the Results in Nutrition for Juntos Sector-wide
Approach (SWAp) and Basic Education projects. These latter operations, in turn, helped keep the
implementation of REACT policies and approach on track, also due to the long-term relationship
that task team leaders of the education, health, and social protection teams had developed with
clients in the country.

20.     Focus, with flexibility. The REACT Program focused on the standards and accountability
theme (which runs across all the sectors in the operation policy matrix) together with a limited set
of quantifiable program results and their associated baselines. However, within that framework’s
flexibility, it was important REACT’s policy matrix was adapted over time to accommodate a
developing policy agenda. As shown by the ‘accountability triangle’ framework, the set of
relationships related to accountability is complex and there is no single priority policy. The
REACT Program supported appropriate shifts in emphasis as it developed, without affecting the
overall medium-term program objectives.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

21.     Monitoring of the DPL program was based on continuous dialogue with the
government. With some team members in the field, and frequent visits by those based abroad,
monitoring was continuous and supported by complementary investment projects, as mentioned
in the preceding section. These projects, and the RECURSO programmatic analytical work, also
aided in refining program design and in supporting its implementation.



                                                    11
22.     The government-Bank dialogue on REACT was informed by systematic tracking of
relevant outcomes and output indicators from the start of the series. Specific indicators were
identified at the outset of the program to track key outcomes such as second grade reading and
math achievement, proportion of IB coverage in rural areas, maternal and neonatal mortality rates,
and nutrition monitoring and child growth outcomes. Automatic awarding of CUIs to children born
after 2008 was added with the second operation to improve early provision of health and nutrition
services to children and track their outcomes. These indicators allowed the government, with Bank
support as needed, to monitor program performance and therefore to make adjustments to
implementation approaches when needed.

23.      With the implementation of PBB, relevant indicators continue to be collected and
analyzed by theMEF and line ministries to track results under the PBB framework. The
sources of information for development outcomes are the UST for second grade students, annually
implemented by the Unit of Quality Measurement (Unidad de Medición de la Calidad) of
MINEDU; and the National Household Survey on Demography and Health (Encuesta
Demografica y de Salud Familiar - ENDES), annually applied by the INEI 3 for health and nutrition
indicators. Indicators related to the CUI registration of children are closely monitored by RENIEC
and indicators related to the Household Targeting System (Sistema de Focalización de Hogares
[SISFOH]) and Single Beneficiary Registry (Registro Único de Beneficiarios) are monitored by
the SISFOH office (MEF, now the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion [Ministerio de
Desarrollo e Inclusión Social , MIDIS]) and the Ministry of Women and Social Development (now
the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Population), respectively. Regarding nutritional
monitoring, administrative information collected in the Nutritional data information system
(Sistema de Informacion del Estado Nutricional - SIEN) operated by the National Center for Food
and Nutrition (Centro Nacional de Alimentación y Nutrición [CENAN]) provides nutritional data
for individual children. This data includes information on CRED monitoring. The associated
indicators are directly monitored by MINSA and they will also probably be required by the
Conditional Cash Transfer Program (Programa de Transferencias Condicionadas [CCT]), Juntos,
if its orientation toward nutritional objectives materializes. Finally, the PI that provided monetary
incentives to municipalities linked to a set of result indicators in the fields of identity, nutrition and
budget execution and the pilots to strengthen participatory monitoring will support local
monitoring, especially of output indicators. As long as both initiatives, the PI and the pilots, require
information at the local level, local governments as well as other institutions committed to
monitoring development (such as the decentralized agencies of the Citizen Roundtables to Fight
Poverty [Mesa de Concertación de Lucha Contra la Pobreza]) will demand this information.

2.4      Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

24.   As explained above, the government selected the DDO for the second REACT DPL,
meaning that although the third REACT DPL closed in 2011, from the financial viewpoint the
program remained open until the closing of the DDO in September 2015. 4 This circumstance has

  Although this survey is annually applied, some indicators such as maternal or neonatal mortality can only be
reported on a multi-annual basis.
4
  Operational policies for DPLs are silent about when to prepare an ICR in this context; that is, whether at the end of
the third DPL in the series or upon the closing date of the DDO. The decision to proceed with this ICR at this time
was based on advice from OPCS, which suggested preparing an ICR even though it may not be due until September
2016. No risks to the result indicators are foreseen from now until the possible official due date of the ICR.

                                                               12
urged the Bank to continue monitoring key indicators of the program and provided the opportunity
to assess the sustainability of its outcomes.

25.     The CPS for FY12–15 has been supporting the current government’s policy of ‘growth
with social inclusion’ to overcome social gaps and boost productivity in Peru. The Bank is
currently supporting the government’s commitment to coordinate design and implementation of
social inclusion programs through MIDIS via the Social Inclusion TAL (P131029) and the Social
Inclusion DPL (P131028). In this context, some of the strategic objectives are sustaining the
reduction of chronic malnutrition and increasing access and quality of social services for the poor.
Moreover, the Bank has been supporting the government in improving nutrition outcomes through
a results-oriented operation, the Results in Nutrition for Juntos SWAp (P117310); basic education
outcomes through the Basic Education Project (P123151) and health outcomes, including IBs,
through the (APL2) Health Reform Program (P095563).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, Implementation and Sustainability

26.    The REACT DPL series was at the core of the second pillar of the FY07–11 CPS,
which, in turn, was firmly rooted in the government’s own priorities. As already mentioned,
it was also grounded in extensive analytical work that both informed initial design as well as
enabled rigorous study of issues that emerged during program implementation.

27.    It is worth noting that the Peru REACT Program is one of a small number of
pioneering efforts in the Human Development (HD) sector to focus squarely on the nexus
between governance and service delivery. It more specifically focuses on a systematic effort to
make health, education, and nutrition services and service providers more accountable to the
communities they serve. The use of a DPL to accomplish such accountability was especially
innovative and viewed as generally successful and the model has since been adapted for other
countries, including the Dominican Republic. Because of the DPL series, the Bank went from
supporting isolated interventions in the social sectors in Peru to supporting the implementation of
PBB in the social sectors and a complementary package of interventions such as the analytical
underpinnings of the RECURSO series, the accompanying NLTA loans, the health lending
operation, and the Fiscal DPL series. Those interventions eventually led to important lending
operations such as the Results in Nutrition for Juntos SWAp and the Basic Education SWAp,
which contributed to sustaining some of the reforms initiated through the REACT series and
supported the performance-based lending approach put forward by MEF.

28.     The relevance of the objectives, design, implementation, and sustainability are high.
This is because the program addressed a critical need to improve human development outcomes,
which both the Bank and government had identified as a priority; employed an innovative design
supported by analytical work; was supremely operational and achieved its results in a sustainable
way. In this regard, it is important to underline the role played by the REACT series to mitigate
the risks of policy reversals (particularly budget allocations, in the context of tighter budgets amid
significant drops in commodity prices linked to less favorable external conditions) by supporting
provisions in subsequent budget laws to protect social expenditures and even increasing allocations
to key social programs, through the PBB. To create an institutional framework that fosters greater

                                                     13
inclusion, improves the coherence and effectiveness of social programs, and enhances mechanisms
for better access to basic services, the government created a new institution, MIDIS, on October
20, 2011. The ministry has been supporting some of the initiatives that were initially promoted by
the REACT series and RECURSO, therefore ensuring their sustainability, such as a focus on
results in nutrition outcomes, support for the identification of children, and the overhaul of the
targeting system for all social programs.

3.2    Overall Achievement of Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

29.      Given the broad national scope of the government policies supported by REACT, their
outcomes cannot be measured using ‘gold standard’ impact evaluation techniques. Many of the
outcomes cannot even be exclusively attributed to public policy interventions since impacts in
health and nutrition are strongly influenced by overall economic growth and private investment.
In this context, it is even less accurate to claim any attribution to the REACT series and associated
Bank interventions for the achievement of their development objectives. However, the following
paragraphs describe positive results indicating that the trend for indicator targets progressed in the
direction anticipated and that these results—although not exclusively—could be reasonably linked
to the set of policies supported by REACT Program and the related AAA. In a few words, even
though it is impossible to claim attribution of results to the DPL series, this ICR briefly explains
how the accountability framework created with the support of the REACT Program and the related
AAA contributed to the achievement of outcomes in education, health, and nutrition.

Key Program Outcomes

30.     The presentation of outcome indicators for each component of the program follows the
sequence of the causality chain implicit in its results framework: the achievement of accountability
results based on quality standards leads to improved outcomes in the policy areas supported by the
series. It also presents information about the status of the most recent indicators available at the
date of ICR preparation (2013/14), illustrating the sustainability of results.

Education

31.     Accountability Results. A UST is taken annually and is the basis for school-level
accountability in primary education. In 2007, it covered 90 percent of schools. The UST results
provide each school and child with information about their performance. In 2009 and 2010, the
UST results were delivered directly to schools and a media campaign was organized to advise
parents to request their child’s scores and to encourage schools to discuss their results and plan
future improvements. This was the first time Peru regularly carried out this type of school
achievement evaluations and publicly disclosed its results. The implementation of the second grade
UST was sustained beyond the REACT series and its expansion to other grades and subjects is
now being supported through the Peru Basic Education Project (P123151) which aims at
strengthening MINEDU’s capacity to evaluate student learning, among others. The introduction
and institutionalization of the UST has been instrumental in the design of results-based policies
and programs, the targeting of lagging schools and populations, and the strengthening of a culture
of results at the school, subnational, and national levels.

32.     Outcomes. Between 2007 and 2011, the proportion of second grade students reaching
Level 2 in reading comprehension increased from 16 percent to 30 percent and in math it rose from
7 to 13 percent. In the same interval, the proportion of students lagging below Level 1 decreased
from 46 to 23 percent in reading and from 57 to 51 percent in math. By 2014, the proportion of
students reaching Level 2 in comprehension and math rose to 44 and 26 percent, respectively, and
those lagging below Level 1 decreased to 13 and 39 percent, respectively. Although this set of
outcomes cannot be solely attributed to the implementation of the USTs and other related measures
supported by the REACT Program, like the public dissemination of their results and the teacher
coaching program, there is no doubt that these policy measures played a decisive role in the
achievement of these outcomes, as highlighted by the borrower’s ICR.

Health

33.     Accountability Results. Rural IBs coverage has increased from 49.4 percent in 2007 to
57.6 percent in 2009 and 62.2 in 2011. In 2013, coverage reached 68.5 percent, closer to the
program target of 70 percent. The INEI completed a census of all specialized birthing facilities
(FON centers) in 13 high-risk regions, producing data on capacity, service quality, and IB
production. This is helping the MEF and the health regional directorates to improve the way they
allocate strategic resources and set and monitor targets for IBs under the maternal and neonatal
strategic budget program. The FON census information is available to the public on the INEI
website.

34.     Outcomes. Maternal mortality decreased from 164 per 100 thousand live births in 2007 to
100 in 2011, reaching 89 per 100,000 live births in 2013. A similar positive trend can be observed
for neonatal mortality, which was 15.2 per 1,000 live births in 2007, decreased to 14 in 2011, and
to 13 in 2013. There is a broader acceptance that the increase in coverage and quality of IB has a
decisive impact on the reduction of neonatal and maternal mortality. The main contribution of the
accountability measures supported by the REACT Program to improving IB services was the focus
it placed on making reliable information available to decision makers and policy advocates to
improve the strategic allocation of resources to critical areas that were lagging behind the rest of
the country in terms of IB rates.

Nutrition

35.     Accountability Results. The average frequency of nutritional monitoring of children
reached 4.2 CRED controls per year in the first year of life in 2009, compared with 3.3 in 2005,
surpassing the target of 4 for 2009 that was set at the start of the REACT Program. The
intensification in high malnutrition areas of CRED growth monitoring and nutrition consultations
that are provided by the health system is considered a key health intervention relevant to improving
nutrition outcomes. By tracking the same individual from CRED consultation to CRED
consultation, health staff is able to monitor individuals’ nutritional status through time and give
immediate feedback to parents on children who are not growing well. During CRED consultation
parents receive information about the way their children are growing and what to do to improve
their growth when they are still in time. The lack of awareness of many parents about their child’s
nutritional failure, has been recognized as an important obstacle to changing outcomes. A parent
who does not understand their child is not growing properly is unlikely to do anything about it.
The Bank’s analytical work in the Andean region has shown a clear empirical link between the

                                                    15
lack of nutritional knowledge about normal growth to deficient outcomes for children 5. Stunting
can be observed only using careful measurement of height against age and with the help of
professional staff during CRED consultations. The children are not skeletal, nor do they have
grotesquely swollen bellies – they are simply far too small for their age. This is an invisible
epidemic.

36.     Outcomes. The stunting rate for children under five years of age has been reduced from
the baseline of 28.5 percent in 2007 to 24.2 percent in 2009, 19.5 percent in 2011, and further to
14.5 percent in 2014. This set of outcomes cannot definitely be attributed to the REACT Program.
However, the program played a critical role in the definition and dissemination of standards for
nutrition outcomes when malnutrition rates were still very high in Peru. Previous Bank research
highlighted how the extremely high prevalence of chronic malnutrition and its persistence in the
Andean countries was related, among other factors, to low expectations and lack of knowledge by
parents. Parents, nurses, teachers, and society at large often expected the children of the poor,
particularly of the indigenous families, to be small and therefore often no real effort was made to
change that. Providing parents with a clear understanding of the expectation for their children’s
growth was identified as a critical first step in changing the results. The definition and
dissemination of standards for child growth, together with the promotion of coverage of CRED
controls, during which children are monitored and parents receive basic information on how to
improve care and feeding practices, were two of the critical actions promoted by the REACT
Program to improve nutrition outcomes. The REACT team, in collaboration with MINSA,
produced a number of instruments targeted to the parents of poor children including videos, a radio
theater series, and numerous brochures and posters; many of these have been produced in Spanish,
Quechua, and Aymara. The videos in particular had a strong impact on public opinion. MINSA
has trained staff and community health support agents on effective communication with parents
who bring their children for monitoring. All these actions contributed to setting a new agenda on
combating malnutrition in Peru, making the malnutrition problem much more visible than before
and prioritizing prevention interventions such as CRED controls for the poorest populations.

Identity

37.     Accountability Results. As a result of policy measures supported by the REACT Program,
all Peruvian children born after 2008 automatically receive a unique identification number.
Currently, all new births certificates issued either by RENIEC Agencies, RENIEC’s Auxiliary
Offices, or Municipal Civil Registries include the CUI. Although there are no education, health,
or nutrition outcomes directly linked to the improvement of civil registration of children, which
was promoted by the REACT series, there is evidence that increased identification contributed to
enhancing the targeting mechanisms and the early detection of children at risk by social programs.
As explained below, the inclusion of the CUI in the birth certificate became the first step toward
the integration of the national civil registry. As of today, the unique birth-registry database is inter-
operational with the databases of key social programs like Juntos, SIS, MINSA, MINEDU, the
food programs, and the national targeting system, SISFOH.

3.3     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

38.     Success in the REACT Program has not always been linear and it has been greater in some
areas than others, but overall the DPL program has made highly relevant progress in an area that
has notoriously been difficult to affect—namely, improving the quality of social services delivery
in a sustainable and affordable way. As noted above, the REACT DPL series has been path
breaking in that it has provided a largely replicable model for improving the quality of HD services
by strengthening accountability relationships on all three axes of the ‘accountability triangle’
(voice, compact, and client power).

39.     The operation was also directly supportive of some broader CPS goals such as the
establishment of PBB or RBB) as a key means of improving the effectiveness of government
spending. While other Bank operations and analytical work laid out the general framework for
RBB, support from the REACT operation was fundamental to its adoption in the social sectors
(which absorb a significant proportion of public funds).

3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

40.    Besides substantially achieving the identified program results/outcomes, the REACT series
also had a number of externalities, not least the empowerment of poor communities with the
information and confidence needed to monitor and demand better social services. In a context
where indigenous groups and other vulnerable rural communities have long faced discrimination
and exclusion, the focus of the REACT Program on partnering with communities and civil society
organizations to hold government agencies accountable and help in the
planning/budgeting/monitoring of key programs is likely to have had an important—though
unmeasurable—impact on social inclusion.

41.     It is also clear that the outcomes achieved by the REACT Program are directly related to
increasing households’ welfare (that is, non-income poverty) in the immediate term as well as
likely to be contributing to reduced income poverty in the future as better nourished, educated, and
healthy children can be expected to become more productive workers in adulthood. Evaluation of
PB undertaken in association with REACT has also shown that municipalities that have made the
most progress in promoting PB planning and monitoring, also have a pattern of increasing pro-
poor spending. The PSIA of the participatory budget measured impacts at the district level by
comparing treatment and comparison groups. The main findings were as follows: (a) PB agents
are more likely to prioritize social infrastructure projects (that is, drinking water, sanitation, small-
scale irrigation) according to the needs of the poor than are the elected authorities; and (b) when
PB is strong, spending on social infrastructure is higher.

42.     The REACT Program has clearly had a direct impact on women’s well-being through its
focus on promoting IBs and the consequent reduction in maternal mortality. Moreover, to the
extent that women in Peru (as elsewhere) are the primary caregivers for their children, increasing
their awareness of better nutrition practices and appropriate health and educational outcomes for
their children is likely to have given many mothers a greater sense of confidence. Support to birth
                                                       17
certificate and identity coverage given by the operation also played an important role in
empowering women. Documented women are less dependent on their husbands to have direct
access to economic opportunities and social benefits, such as cash incentives of CCT programs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

43.     RENIEC. Historically, unique identification numbers were only issued to adults, as part
of their National Identification Document (Documento Nacional de Identidad [DNI]). But now, as
a result of reforms supported by the REACT Program and implemented by RENIEC, all registry
offices include CUI codes (and barcodes) in birth certificates. This CUI becomes the DNI number
when issued by RENIEC. As a result, from the moment of certification of their birth, Peru’s
children now have a CUI, which all the social programs systematically use as their single
registration code.

44.      According to a recent report prepared by the Inter-Agency Social Protection Assessment
Initiative, inclusion of the CUI in the birth certificate helped start the process toward the integration
of the country’s civil registry system and the establishment of a centralized civil registry database. 6
Social programs use this electronic database for program planning and targeting. Also, families
who have migrated can increasingly process birth certificate copies in any RENIEC office or any
municipal registry electronically integrated to the national system. In addition, the inclusion of
identification as one of the strategic RBB programs was a game changer for identity coverage.
Since 2008 when the RBB included identification as one of its strategic programs and allocated
incremental resources to achieve full DNI coverage of the population, the identity coverage gap
has decreased from 38.25 percent in 2006 to 2.90 percent in 2011. 7

45.     Performance budgeting. The MEF’s Performance Budgeting office has defined goals in
education, health, nutrition, and identity and has begun publishing on its website budget execution
and physical data for 19 health and nutrition outputs and has linked performance data to resource
allocations. The MEF based the planning for the 2010 budget on a detailed analysis of advances
toward the projected goals in the production of services, in intermediate outcomes, and in final
outcomes for the strategic programs of the PBB system (nutrition, maternal and neonatal health,
learning outcomes, and identity). Advances have been particularly strong in the areas of education,
nutrition, and identity. In 2010, the analysis of links from outputs to outcomes in these sectors led
to additional resources being assigned to help agents meet their targets. Similar actions have been
planned and carried out since 2011 in the fields of identity and health. In the case of the identity
strategic budget program, there was an additional assignment of resources to help meet adult DNI
universal coverage and expand child registration and child DNI issuance in rural areas. In 2013,
Peru’s ID program had an overall coverage of 98.7 percent of its adult population and of 94.5
percent of all minors, representing a total of 21,014,380 adults and 9,984,833 children and
adolescents.

46.     The MEF also increased the 2010 budget for CREDs by 330 percent, compared to the 2009
budget, and it allocated the additional funds to regions with a low level of CRED spending relative
to their malnutrition levels. Data from the SIEN nutrition monitoring system suggest that these

policy measures have enabled Peru to make significant advances toward the government’s target
of increasing the intensity of nutritional monitoring of children by 20 percent between 2005 and
2009.

47.     The DPL series had a large impact on strengthening local-level capacity to plan, monitor,
and implement social programs as a result of the accountability-based reforms introduced by the
government in support of REACT objectives. Reforms under REACT set quality standards for
service delivery and strengthened administrative systems to monitor these standards. Public
dissemination of budget information and its links to key program outputs is another long-term
benefit of the REACT operations. As previously mentioned, the MEF’s Performance Budgeting
office is now publishing budget execution and physical data for 19 health and nutrition outputs on
its website, enabling scrutiny of the information by stakeholders within and outside the
government. These data are being disseminated even more widely by the media, academics, and
other analysts.

48.      Juntos’ orientation to nutritional outcomes. From 2007 to 2010, Juntos consolidated its
expansion and densification policy and its efforts to strengthen the nutrition outcomes. At present,
program coverage goals have been achieved. In 2009, according to the program, 86 percent of
children aged under two years in the Juntos districts had received a CRED consultation within the
last three months, compared with 81 percent in 2007. In addition, the program is making important
efforts to strengthen the affiliation of newborn children and to promote better verification of the
health and nutrition co-responsibilities. These efforts are being supported by the Bank’s results-
based operation Results in Nutrition for Juntos SWAp Project.

49.     SIS. SIS coverage now reaches over 10 million people and SIS funding for CRED
consultations in the 10 poorest regions rose by 4.9 percent in 2008 and 23.4 percent in 2009,
reaching 1.39 million consultations. In 2010, the projected budget increase was 16.9 percent.
However, rapid expansion has threatened to undermine SIS’s targeting, especially in urban areas,
and the government is promoting the use of a targeting instrument (SISFOH) to correct this. In an
effort to limit the coverage of the fully subsidized benefit, a semi-subsidized SIS window was
launched in 2007. This covered about 62,000 people with an income below S/. 700. A pressing
problem for SIS is that the reimbursement to health networks based on the production of services
generates a huge volume of transactions, which is beyond the capacity of its outdated computer
systems. During 2008–2009, SIS completed a pilot of budgetary transfers to health posts calculated
on a per capita basis and linked to performance indicators, in Ayacucho, Apurimac, and
Cajamarca; and in 2010 the SIS budget was adjusted, based on per capita costs for the covered
population, to enable it to meet the estimated cost of the basic health insurance plan (Plan Esencial
de Aseguramiento en Salud) in the pilot regions for the AUS reform. This was achieved through
an executive decree issued in August 2010, which increased the SIS budget by S/. 44 million. Since
2011, SIS has signed financial agreements with the regional governments based on per capita costs.
SIS pays for basic health costs on a per capita basis to the regional governments (and not to the
health centers). However, it continues to use a fee-for-service calculation to pay for health services
provided by hospitals.

3.5    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

50.     Over the implementation period of the DPL series the government of Peru took a
participatory approach to the development and implementation of the reforms in the social sectors
supported by the operations. Analytical work and the policy dialogue undertaken by the Bank and
the government helped to inform the stakeholder consultations organized by the MEF, the
education and health sectors, and other agencies involved in the design and implementation of the
policy actions supported by the REACT Program.

51.    Annex 2 documents the surveys and research activities that informed the policy reforms
supported by the operation. Annex 3 summarizes main consultations and policy dialogue that took
place over the REACT series.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Rating: Moderate

52.     The DPL program has been strong, with solid government ownership and triggers
reflecting the government’s own reform agenda. Moreover, the strong emphasis on stakeholder
consultation and participation as well as intensive social outreach efforts through multimedia
methods have apparently entrenched the accountability approach, making complete reversal very
unlikely. The government of Peru has enthusiastically adopted and strengthened the approach and
direction of the set of policies supported by the REACT Program. Moreover, with the creation of
MIDIS in 2011 and the high priority that the president has assigned to improving quality and results
of the social programs, the accountability and results orientation of the reforms has been further
deepened and institutionalized. Given these actions, it seems very unlikely that the administration
elected in 2016 will propose any significant reversal of program objectives, regardless of the form
that future Bank involvement takes.

53.    At this stage, other risks deriving from macroeconomic shocks seem to be relatively low.
The current administration has maintained sound macro fundamentals and achieved impressive
growth, while also continuing to address poverty/inequality through cost-effective approaches.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

54.      The Bank invested heavily in analytical work at the start of the program (and throughout)
and worked closely with the government to identify reforms and to follow up on progress while
ensuring that government remained in the lead. Quality at Entry (QAE) was ensured not only by
sound AAA and consultation but also by a strong program of support outside of the DPL to help
facilitate TA and guidance in program design and identification of important milestones that can
be monitored. As a result, most triggers set out for the DPLs could be converted to prior actions.


                                                    20
55.     Importantly, the Bank also showed flexibility when there was a clear, justifiable need for
program changes (as in health) to incorporate emerging lessons of implementation. This
demonstrated the Bank’s ability to be a genuine partner and helped to strengthen the already close
relationship between the Bank and Peru. The Bank also demonstrated flexibility in calibrating the
timing of, and loan instruments associated with, the DPL operations to accommodate the
government’s financing needs, which fluctuated widely over the program period. As noted earlier,
the second DPL, which was processed soon after the onset of the global financial and economic
crisis, was increased to US$330 million and as a DDO provided support to the government’s
strategy of securing contingent financing to bolster market confidence in the Peruvian economy.

56.     The DPLs were also prepared in close collaboration with key external development
partners—both multilateral and bilateral—allowing for a harmonized approach to social sector
development and substantially reducing the transaction time for the government. This was possible
in part because of the Bank’s strong presence on the ground in Peru, with key members of the
country team able to regularly participate in government-led sectoral working groups with other
partners.

57.      A QAE review conducted for the third DPL rated it as Satisfactory. The QAE review
supported the operation as Highly Satisfactory in terms of strategic relevance and approach,
fiduciary aspects, and implementation arrangements. It was rated as Satisfactory in structural,
financial and macroeconomic aspects, poverty, gender and social development, environmental
aspects, policy and institutional aspects, and Bank inputs and processes. Only in risk assessment
was the DPL rated Moderately Satisfactory. In particular, the QAE highlighted the DPL’s strong
alignment with the government’s program, the Bank’s team strong inter-sectoral coordination, the
Bank’s flexibility to adjust to economic and political developments, and the DPL’s grounding in
sound AAA and other forms of policy dialogue and technical support. Of concern were weakness
in risk identification and prioritization and the need for a more relevant results framework given
the shifting focus in policy areas—and these issues were corrected in the third DPL’s program
document. The QAE for the third DPL also noted that some of the triggers “allowed an elasticity
of interpretation beyond that justified for the flexibility needed for programmatic lending triggers.”
On the other hand, flexibility in the trigger definition has meant that throughout the DPL series the
Bank was able to translate almost all triggers into prior actions and thereby maintain the vested
interests of a wide range of policy reformers in the DPL process. This kept the reform momentum
going, even when in some years less progress was being made in certain areas, but then picked up
in later years.

58.    The series was flagged as a problem program at some point during implementation, due to
the long time taken to negotiate the DDO terms for the second series.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

59.     The Bank carried out supervision during the duration of the REACT series with a stable
team that included focal points for different sectors responsible for multiple products and for the
sectoral dialogue with the government. The fact that REACT sectoral focal points led many of the
RECURSO Peru products contributed to enhance the quality of the dialogue around the policy

                                                     21
framework supported by the series and its supervision. The dialogue that took place during the
supervision missions included the participation of a broad range of stakeholders, including sector
leaders of line ministries, subnational governments, and nongovernmental actors. The Bank team
exhibited strong collaboration between headquarters and country offices and benefitted from the
unity of the human development sector which fostered strong collaboration between the health,
education, and social protection teams.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

60.     Overall rating for Bank performance is Highly Satisfactory. The Bank worked closely with
the government and development partners to develop a relevant reform agenda that strategically
addressed several core constraints in the country while delivering the program on time.
Supervision tasks went much beyond the standard check of the borrower´s compliance with policy
actions and the achievement of target values of key indicators. They involved substantive analyses
and dialogues about causality chains, barriers, and strategic allocation of resources assisted by
relevant reference to international best practice. The Bank team often played the role of a credible
broker on controversial topics, facilitating consensus building and broadening the support base of
the policy reforms supported by the series.

5.2    Borrower Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

(a)     Government Performance:

61.      The borrower’s performance is rated as Highly Satisfactory. As mentioned several times,
a key factor in the success of the DPL program was the government’s high level of commitment
to promoting a major change in social services through a renewed focus on accountability and
results. During the DPL process, the government designated a key counterpart government official
for the overall program and also for each related set of triggers. This greatly facilitated
communication and monitoring of progress by the task team, as well as identifying possible
bottlenecks. Moreover, the lead government counterpart regularly followed up with the respective
units to ensure that the triggers were being met. Particularly noteworthy was the tremendous effort
made by government with respect to participation and consultation with stakeholders. These
consultation activities involved significant preparation to inform the dialogue and to convene
relevant stakeholders on time.

6. Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

62.     Overall, the three-operation REACT DPL series has been successful in supporting a
coherent program of reforms to strengthen accountability and improve outcomes in the
Peruvian social sector. The advances are documented in policies related to social program
targeting (through the SISFOH system); citizen identification; PBB in the social sectors with
emphasis on nutrition, health, and education (Programa Articulado Nutricional, Programa de
Salud Materno-neonatal y Programa de Logros de Aprendizaje); the establishment of a UST for
second grade children; the strengthening of users’ rights in health through noncontributory and

                                                    22
semi-contributory insurance; and the intensification of nutritional monitoring and counseling in
high-risk areas. The Bank team did not encounter any major problems that arose from project
design or from Bank procedures. Flexibility played an important role in this. Critical success
factors and lessons learned are summarized in the following paragraphs. While some of these
lessons overlap with the factors influencing implementation discussed in a preceding section of
this report, they are repeated here because they also yield important lessons for the design of
similar operations in other sectors or other countries. The Bank teams in headquarters and country
offices collaborated closely and benefitted from the unity of the human development sector which
fostered strong coordination between the health, education, and social protection teams

63.     Ownership. A critical success factor is the high level of government ownership of the
policy reforms supported by the program. The Peruvian government strongly endorsed the case
for more transparency about outcomes. Support for the program came both from the MEF and
from line agencies. This was coupled with broad public support (among civil society, the private
sector, and the press) for many of the reforms being implemented under the REACT operation.
The MEF in particular played an important role in coordinating the different sectors and
guaranteeing the alignment of incentives at different levels of the government. It continued to do
so throughout the most recent DPL program in the social sectors. The MEF also plays a key role
in the sustainability of the reforms, not only in terms of budget allocation to the sectors but also in
its own budget allocation, by guaranteeing the sustainability of the RBB Unit across different
administrations.

64.     Participation. Support was also reinforced by the government of Peru’s generally
participatory approach to policy reform. Multi-stakeholder dialogues were carried out at critical
stages of policy design and implementation. This dialogue helped boost support from
governmental and nongovernmental actors and counteract the resistance of interest groups
potentially affected by some reforms. Stakeholder engagement has also helped mobilize the
necessary political support for additional budgetary assignments to fund critical interventions to
strengthen accountability and improve results in education, health, and nutrition. Perhaps more
importantly, the participatory approach was at the core of the bottom-up accountability measures
promoted by the reform agenda, which encouraged the establishment of voice and client power
mechanisms to promote awareness of poor quality in the provision of services among parents and
policy makers and demand and track improvements and results.

65.      Universality. The REACT Program focused on supporting universal reforms rather than
pilots in a case where there was no need to experiment and where reforms were less costly than in
other cases. This approach favored the implementation speed and coverage of the reforms and the
earlier and universal achievement of positive outcomes.

66.     Strong AAA work and accompanying operations. Much of the initial momentum for the
REACT Program was attributable to the impulse from RECURSO, which highlighted the scandal
of poor education, health, and nutrition outcomes and placed accountability and results issues at
the center of the public policy agenda from 2005 onward. RECURSO deliberately used mass media
as a way to mobilize support for change and as a communication channel to inform parents about
what they should expect for their children’s development outcomes. In addition, a package of
services, including non-lending and lending in health, nutrition, social protection, and education,
was critical in strengthening the implementation and sustainability of the policies supported by the

                                                      23
REACT series. The Bank went from isolated investment lending operations in the social sectors
to a coordinated package of AAA and policy lending interventions in the area of PBB in the social
sectors that eventually led to other important interventions such as the Results in Nutrition for
Juntos SWAp and the Basic Education SWAp. The fact that the REACT series team included staff
members leading other complementary interventions should also be highlighted. Having a unified
human development team manage the series, and the AAA that went with it, contributed greatly
to the success of the DPL series. Finally, the complementarity of this operation and its timing with
the Fiscal DPL-DDO series played an important role in achieving the desired results under the
REACT series.

67.    Focus, with flexibility. The REACT Program focused on the standards and accountability
theme but was flexible enough to adapt to evolving needs. Some examples are given in the
following list.

       •   Performance budgeting - the balance between accountability and budgetary
           sufficiency. The government began the reform program expecting that simply
           strengthening accountability mechanisms will transform outcomes. It was hoped that
           improving the effectiveness of existing budgetary resources will finance the necessary
           changes. However, by the end of the program, a more nuanced approach had emerged.
           It acknowledges that there is limited scope for reassigning existing budget
           commitments and highlights the complementarity between policy reforms to strengthen
           parents’ awareness of their rights and raise their expectations for their children’s
           development outcomes and carefully calibrated incremental spending to improve the
           services that affect outcomes for children. For example, in health, the expansion of
           insurance rights and strengthening of nutrition and maternal/neonatal programs have
           implied increases in spending. Similarly, in education, the government has identified
           the need for significant incremental expenditure on TA and supervision for teachers in
           poorly performing schools and assigned the necessary resources. Thus, it is critical to
           bring about more flexibility and discretion to implementing agencies at the national
           and subnational levels. Another lesson learned is that arbitrary budget freezes are often
           the enemy of good policy and of fiscal effectiveness. A mid-year budget freeze
           introduced in 2008 is a case in point. It disrupted important elements of the reform
           effort (such as the SIS pilot in capitation payments) without leveraging significant gains
           in efficiency or effectiveness.

       •   Targeting and exclusion. An important lesson learned is that the birth certification
           process offers great scope for assigning universal citizen identification numbers, which
           can be used to reduce inclusion and exclusion errors in social programs even before
           full-fledged citizen identification cards are issued. In relation to the development of
           targeting systems, the main lesson learned is that systems like SISFOH can only have
           a strong impact when they are adopted by important programs such as SIS or Juntos.
           Moreover, there should be a balance between the control of inclusion and exclusion
           errors. When the control of errors is overplayed or becomes the main goal of the
           targeting system, it may increase the risk of higher exclusion errors. Financial gains
           obtained from strict controls can be overturned by the insurmountable social costs of
           exclusion. A good example is the 2012 Budget Law that required all children to have
           their DNI (instead of their birth certificate) to be covered by targeted social programs.

                                                    24
           The lack of DNI among rural children became a barrier for their registration in critical
           programs like SIS.

68.     Using performance metrics appropriately. Government leadership was important for the
development of a sustainable metric for the UST system in education. The initial proposal of
RECURSO for a standard in education based on a fluency standard of 60 words a minute in second
grade proved difficult to use as the basis for a UST. MINEDU decided instead that this should be
based on a pen and paper reading comprehension test, which the Bank supported. Similarly, in
nutrition, the Bank worked with sector specialists to develop standards that are consistent with
technical norms. The standard for nutrition was based on the WHO growth curves.

69.     Getting the results to the parents. Another lesson learned is that it is not sufficient to test
students and measure infants’ growth. It is also necessary to provide schools and parents with
timely and meaningful feedback about the results and to be prepared to budget additional resources
to support improving teaching quality and better nutritional counseling. The related RECURSO V
report presents new findings on the empirical relationship between parental understanding of child
development outcomes and the real outcomes achieved by children. The findings provide strong
support for continued efforts to better inform parents and communities about the outcomes being
achieved by their children and to promote intensified parental engagement with services to
improve quality. One important dimension of quality is the effectiveness with which the service
provider conveys timely information to the parents about their child’s advances and relevant advice
about how to do better.

Annex 2: Results Framework

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

1.     The objective of the REACT DPL series was to strengthen the results framework and
accountability relationships in education, health, and nutrition. The development objectives of the
REACT DPL Program was to support policies that were expected to lead to (a) improved parental
understanding of expected outcomes in education, health, and nutrition; (b) improved outcomes in
second grade literacy (especially in rural schools); (c) reduced maternal and neonatal mortality;
and (d) better nutrition outcomes. These are all highlighted as key development outcomes of the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

2.        PDOs were not revised.

3.     Note that the team changed the indicators formulated for the first REACT DPL as they
were based on new surveys that were not implemented. The indicators were replaced in the second
REACT DPL with indicators relying on regular survey and administrative information. The PDOs
however never changed. Indicators of the first series are presented in this annex.

Annex 3: Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      The REACT DPL series builds on the analytical and policy dialogue work of the
RECURSO AAA study—A New Social Contract for Peru—and other analytical work on strategic
social programs and decentralization reforms. RECURSO produced studies and TA activities since
FY06 with a focus on informing the policy dialogue to strengthen accountability arrangements for
improved results in education, health, and nutrition. RECURSO 1 (FY06) had the definition of
service delivery standards as its main focus of research and policy dialogue. It responded to the
government’s request for Bank support on the implementation of its results-based strategy in the
social sectors. In FY07, RECURSO 2 focused on nutrition. Activities included the development
of communication tools on nutrition standards through a video and other media resources like radio
and TV spots; the provision of TA to Peru’s CCT, Juntos, to become a more powerful means to
strengthen the demand for nutrition counseling and basic services; and the implementation of a
study to identify main factors explaining the prevalence of ‘low-level equilibria’ in social
assistance programs. RECURSO 3 (FY08) focused on subnational management of social
programs, including an assessment of procurement practices of the municipal Vaso de Leche
program, and a case study on management challenges and opportunities facing the regional
government to improve education outcomes in the Junin Region. RECURSO 4 (FY09/10) focused
on the strengthening of users’ entitlements, accountability, and incentives to improve outcomes in
the health sector, including IBs.

2.      Other analytical work underpinning the operation has included an evaluation of the access
and friendly use of the Consulta Amigable portal by civil society organizations and citizens made
by a national nongovernmental organization (CAD) and financed by the Social TAL; a rigorous
assessment of prevailing gaps in identity documentation of children; an in-depth study of the
participatory budget, assessing its impact on local investment prioritization and budget
assignment; and a PSIA on the recently launched Municipal Incentives Plan that promotes the use
of a results management approach by local governments to improve nutrition, identity and
targeting outcomes. Table 3.1 describes the main analytical documents supporting REACT.

Social Safety Nets     This report appraises the scope and performance of Peru’s Social Safety Net (SSN) system and
in Peru, 2007          recommends a strategy for its future development. It argues that the limited impact of Peru’s SSN
(Report No. 42093-     programs to reduce poverty or malnutrition is the result of a generalized ‘low-level equilibrium’ in
PE)                    the social assistance and nutrition sector, which is rooted in the lack of clear objectives and
                       measurable goals. This has opened the way for the ‘capture’ of programs by interest groups and
                       for their political manipulation. To break out the low-level equilibrium, the report recommends
                       establishing clear objectives and quality standards and setting targets for improved outcomes.
                       Program accountability should be strengthened through robust monitoring and evaluation systems.
                       This line of action is now being pursued through the work of the RBB and the Quality of
                       Expenditure offices in the MEF. The report argues that the central, strategic goal of SSN programs
                       should be to tackle child malnutrition, which was identified in the analysis of vulnerability and
                       exclusion as Peru’s predominant social protection challenge.
What can a             The report intends to answer the question: What can a regional government that is truly committed
regional               to education do to improve in quality? Recommendations are useful not only to the regional
government do to       government of Junín but also to other regional governments committed to education. Different

                     if they know how well their children are growing.

evaluation, 2009      utilization of health services for both children and women and it improves nutritional intake of
                      program households. In education, the analysis shows that as in other CCT contexts where primary
                      school attendance is high, Juntos has impacts mainly at transition points, ensuring that children
                      enter and finish primary schooling. The majority of these indicators are also improving with the
                      length in the program. There is also no evidence to suggest that the program creates unintended
                      effects in a number of potential areas (reduction in adult work, increases in fertility rates, or
                      increase in consumption of alcohol). Despite these positive effects, no impacts are found on final
                      outcome indicators such as malnutrition or anemia. This result is consistent with the international
                      experience, which suggests that for these types of impacts, CCT schemes need to be
                      complemented by adequate supply of health services (in both quantity and quality) as well as
                      interventions that can better promote health and education practices.

                      arrangements surrounding the plan at the local and sector level; identifying potential tensions and
                      coordination obstacles in the delivery of services and the accountability system. Finally, the PSIA
                      also evaluates the potential impacts on social sector indicators and policies covered by the PI, such
                      as identity, health, and nutrition. Since the plan has been in implementation for less than a year,
                      potential impacts will be assessed using prospective models based on intermediate results such as
                      budget allocation. The analysis also looks at potential impacts on other allocations (displacement
                      or crowding out effects) and on budgeting processes (for example, PB).

 3.      The analytical work contributed to frame the policy dialogue throughout the DPL
 programmatic series and to monitor progress and results. Additionally, the analytical work
 informed broader social policy debates in the country. In 2010, it played a part in framing specific
 reforms linked to identity and accountability goals. As a result of the analysis on undocumented
 children, the MEF included in the Municipal Incentives Plan a goal to ensure the flow of
 information between registries at local governments and RENIEC, the central registry managed
 by the National Civil Registry. At the same time, the evaluation of the PB provided the grounds
 for modifications in the PB Guidelines that now incorporate a results orientation in the
 prioritization of projects.

Annex 5: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Evaluation of the Objective, Design, Operation, and Implementation

1.      The programmatic series promoted substantial reforms in the social sectors, with the
objective of strengthening the accountability framework and improving results in health, nutrition,
and education, in a context when the government was promoting economic growth, poverty
reduction, and improvement in social indicators. Based on the experience, the objective of the
series was adequately set within the priorities of the respective sectors.

2.      The solutions identified through the series are still relevant and constitute the basis for the
future agenda of the sectors involved, particularly in rural areas.

3.       During the design phase the problems were adequately identified, focusing on the critical
areas needed for the solution. Given the multidimensional characteristic of the intervention, several
institutional actors had to be involved, making the coordination and management of activities quite
complex. At the same time, the series included an extensive quantity of conditionalities, which
could have created difficulties during implementation. However, the series maintained consistency
throughout its implementation and the necessary flexibility to adapt to legal or institutional
changes.

4.      The design identified some of the institutional and social risks that could have resulted in
opposition to the activities of the series by sectoral or subnational groups. The risks were
strategically managed by considering public support, transparency of information, and the
definition and dissemination of standards.

Evaluation of Results

5.     The Bank monitored and supervised the results indicators regularly. Overall, the results
were positive (they all improved with respect to the baseline) and it is expected that they continue
to improve and are sustainable over time.

Evaluation of the Role and Participation of the Public Sector

6.      The participation of the different entities of the public sector contributed to the
achievements of the results defined in the reform, promoting discussion and alternative solutions.
The different entities actively participated in the design and implementation phase of the reform
as well as in the consultations promoted by the Bank. The participation of the MEF guaranteed the
needed coordination across the different sectors. Also, the relative stability in the technical teams
and the fact that the series’ objectives were consistent with government priorities contributed to
maintaining the commitments despite legal and political changes.

Evaluation of the Role and Participation of the World Bank

7.      The role of the Bank has been very satisfactory, promoting ample participation of all the
relevant actors of the sector, defining the necessary conditionalities needed to ensure the
contribution of the different institutions involved in the reform. It is also worth highlighting the
participation of Bank professionals who provided expert and opportune TA proposing adequate

                                                      41
solutions. The different sectoral teams valued the TA received by Bank experts, which led to agile
definition and implementation of the proposed reforms and a strong institutional support for the
program.

Conclusions

8.     Based on the analysis, the implementation of the programmatic series had a positive
impact. The evidence shows that the strategic framework of the series was based on the
government’s priorities, as well as sector diagnostics, which contributed, in general, to the
sustainability of the reforms despite institutional changes.

9.     The design of the series included an extensive number of conditionalities which made its
supervision complex. However, given the focus of the intervention, it was necessary to ensure
progress on the various areas covered by the reform.

10.    The coordination between the Bank and the different government teams contributed to
promoting the reforms advocated by the series, which facilitated their approval and their
sustainability, beyond the implementation period.
