project is\n            satisfactory, sustainability is likely, and the\n            institutional development impact was substantial. Lessons\n            suggest that sectoral reforms, cannot be entirely effective\n            without the accompanying investments, needed to support the\n            transition into a new policy environment. In addition,\n            substantial delays in project start-up, and implementation\n            can be avoided if institutional capabilities - technical,\n            financial, and administrative - are properly assessed, and\n            an agreed action plan formulated with the involved\n            institutions for focused capacity building interventions.\n            Additionally, there is the need for communal responsibility\n            in promoting sustainable natural resources management, as\n            well as the critical need of community organization, to\n            focus on building partnerships at the local levels.\n            Communities need to be fully engaged in the process, and\n            with proper capacity building measures to sustain their\n            needs. Formal long-term tenurial agreements for the\n            utilization of State lands, provide concrete incentives for\n            farmers, and upland settlers to invest time, and capital, in\n            ensuring high standards of land management. However, funds\n            transfer mechanisms need to be set, for channeling national,\n            and donor financial resources to the local government units,\n            during the transition stage, prior to their full\n            decentralization. Enforced legislation would curb\n            environmental degradation, and deforestation."}, "docdt": "2000-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
