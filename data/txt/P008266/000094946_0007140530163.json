As for sustainability, the\n            project was very unique in that it aimed to complete\n            unfinished apartments begun during the socialist era and to\n            facilitate the development of a private housing sector.\n            Because there will be no opportunity to carry out a similar\n            Bank-financed operation in Albania, the project is classed\n            as unsustainable. Overall, World Bank and Borrower\n            performances were marginally satisfactory. The project\n            proved that public sector involvement in building public\n            housing is extremely difficult in Albania. While there were\n            several changes in government after the demise of the\n            socialist regime, no government dared to amend the\n            overly-generous laws for housing programs for fear of losing\n            popularity. Under these circumstances, the project was\n            politically and socially mandated to focus on implementing\n            social housing programs. In short, the project should have\n            assisted the Government in developing a strategy to phase\n            out the socialist housing policy. Such a strategy should\n            have included reviewing the social housing issues,\n            developing an affordable social housing program for targeted\n            beneficiaries, and developing a legal framework to stimulate\n            private sector investment. It also should have focused on\n            technical issues, such as technical reviews of the\n            unfinished apartments. Lastly, high turnover and low morale\n            in the national housing authority substantially affected the\n            overall performance of the project."}, "docdt": "2000-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
