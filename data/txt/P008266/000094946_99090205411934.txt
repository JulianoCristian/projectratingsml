Project Objectives and Description
1.      Objectives.   The main purpose of the project is to support Albania's
first step in developing a housing system that will eventually be based on
the response of private supply to effective market demand. In this respect,
the project aims to accomplish the following objectives:
(a) complete construction of a substantial share of the unfinished public
housing that was begun during the socialist era;
(b) establish the National Housing Agency as an effective agent for
facilitating the transition to a market-based housing sector; and
(c) broaden the role of the private sector operators in housing supply such
as developers, contractors, suppliers, and brokers.
Description
2.      The project partially finances the completion of housing projects
initiated by the Ministry of Public Works during the socialist era. About
180 building complexes comprising some 2,900 apartments have been completed
under the project so far.
3.      In addition, in April 1998 the Board of Directors approved a
reallocation of about US$1 million for emergency repairs to government
buildings that were damaged or destroyed during the civil turmoil of 1997.
As of July 31, 1999, about 40 buildings have been repaired and restored to
normal business operations.
Financing
4.      The total project cost is US$40 million, of which US$15 million is
financed by IDA. The Government's contribution, estimated at US$23.5



million, comprises: (a) land sites and associated infrastructure (US$3.8
million), (b) sunk costs of building complexes(US$16.0 million), and (c)
counterpart funds (US$3.7 million). USAID provided technical assistance for
financial management, engineering, and project administration in the early
stages of the project, estimated at US$1.5 million.
Implementation
5.      The National Housing Agency (NHA) was established to implement the
housing program developed by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport. The
proceeds of the IDA credit are transferred to NHA under the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement. NHA's responsibilities, stipulated in the Project Agreement,
include: preparing designs; organizing tenders for the completion of
buildings; authorizing the municipalities' selection of buyers; and
collecting completion costs from buyers.
6.      NHA is also responsible for repairs to damaged government buildings.
Based on a list damaged buildings compiled by the Ministry of Local
Governments, NHA examines the extent of damages, prepares tender documents,
organizes tenders, and supervises civil works contracts.
7.      Implementation of the project began in December 1993 and will continue
through December 1999. The project is progressing well: as of May 31, 1999,
187 buildings comprising about 2,900 apartments have been finished, and the
Government has effectively completed all other unfinished buildings. The
project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1999.
Poverty Category
8.      The project is not classified as a poverty targeted operation.
Environmental Aspects
9.      No adverse environmental impact is expected from the project.    In fact,
the project has helped to eliminate the environmental problems arising from
abandoned and unfinished buildings. Left unfinished, these buildings would
accumulate debris, encourage garbage dumping, and become a source of dust.
The project was placed in environmental category "C".
Program Objective Categories
10.     The project is designated to support Private Sector Development.
Project Benefits
11.     The project has increased the supply of scarce urban housing in a
relatively short period. In addition, the project has enabled Albania to
recover the Government's substantial sunk costs in unfinished housing,
estimated at US$16 million. In addition, timely repairs to local government
buildings have enabled the resumption of disrupted municipal services.
12.     The project has also helped to establish private residential
construction activities, generating jobs for Albanians and enabling small
scale private entrepreneurs to compete for the award of contracts.

Project Risks
13.     At appraisal, the following risks were identified: (a) the Government's
commitment to housing sector reform, (b) affordability of the completed
apartments, and (c) capacity of the NHA to implement the project.
