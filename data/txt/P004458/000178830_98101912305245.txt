PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Recent Developments
1.01      After a period of rapid development of the manufacturing sector
until the mid-fifties, which was the result of a highly sheltered import
substitution drive, the sector entered into a prolonged period of slow
growth. After investment activities seemed to pick up again in late 1972
the manufacturing sector was particularly hard hit by the recessionary
influences in the second half of 1974 and growth rates of the sector dropped
again to below 5% in 1974 and 1975, as gross value added in the manufacturing
sector grew by 4.8% in 1974 (13.9% in 1973), 3.5% in 1975 and 5.8% in 1976.
Sectors which have shown lower growth rates (at constant prices) over the
past three years and which by the end of 1976 had not recovered to the high
production levels of 1973, include wood and wood products, products of
petroleum and coal, metal production and non-electrical machinery. Some
other sectors, however, showed satisfactory annual growth rates including
transport equipment (15.1%), publishing and printing (10.3%), textiles
(8.8%), and paper and paper products. Food processing, the largest manu-
facturing sector accounting for 26% of the gross value added in manufac-
turing, grew by 5.6%. The manufacturing sector now represents the second
,largest sector in the Philippine Economy accounting for 24% of GDP in 1976,
absorbing about one-third of fixed investment and providing employment for
15% of the total labor force./l
1.02      Preliminary estimates of production for the first half of 1977
indicate that the modest growth performance of 1976 continued in 1977. The
physical volume of manufacturing production grew by an estimated 4.7% in the
first half of 1977, compared to 4.4% during the same period of 1976. Growth
leaders during the first half of 1977 include textile and wearing apparel,
chemicals, petroleum, base metals, fabricated metal products and machinery and
equipment.
/1  The contribution of the manufacturing sector to employment in the
Philippines is discussed in more detail in paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14.

While manufacturing value added grew by an average annual rate of 6.8% over
the six year period, the relative sectoral share did not change significantly.
The first half of the period saw intermediate goods increase their share of
total value added at the expense of consumer goods which subsequently regained
some of the lost ground, and during 1976 accounted for 52.5% of total gross
value added. The fastest growing sector was chemicals and rubber products
(16.5%), followed by beverages and tobacco, printing and publishing and trans-
port equipment (9.6% each). It is interesting to note that all these sectors
are mainly producing for the domestic market. Hence the share of sectors with
good export potential/i dropped from 57.8% to 51.1% between 1970 and 1976. The

export group may be classified into two categories: traditional manufac-
turers (incl. sugar, coconut products, plywood, veneer, etc.) and non-tradi-
tional manufactures (incl. electrical machinery, electronics, garments,
handicrafts, etc.). Traditional export products proved very vulnerable
to slackening of demand in export markets and slumping world market prices.
However, non-traditional manufactured exports have begun rising rapidly in
recent years; average annual growth rate has been 34% during 1970-76.
1.04      The manufacturing sector is predominantly privately owned and is
generally concentrated in large scale, vertically integrated, relatively
capital intensive units. In 1973-74, medium and large scale enterprises
accounted for around 88% of industrial value added. In terms of employment,
however, the small scale sector (establishments with 1-50 workers) is consider-
ably more important, and in 1973-1974 employed close to 1 million people, or
68% of the total industrial labor force. Of the total share of the small
scale sector in gross industrial value added, roughly one half is accounted
for by firms employing less than 5 workers, and the remaining half by es-
tablishments employing 5-49 workers.
1.05      Geographically, manufacturing enterprises are concentrated in
Greater Manila area and its adjoining provinces. Statistical data relating
to industrial establishments employing 5 or more workers indicate that
Greater Manila area alone accounted for 39% of all such establishments, 59%
of total industrial employment, 49% of gross value added, and 43% of total
fixed assets. If the adjoining Luzon province is also included, these
percentages would further rise by 20-30%. The geographic concentration of
industrial enterprises in and around Manila has not lessened in recent years
as 75% of BOI projects approved in 1971-74 were located in Southern Tagalog
region which includes Greater Manila area.
Industrial Investment
1.06      Capital expenditures for durable equipment of the manufacturing
sector in 1975 increased at the high rate of 27% reflecting investment
decisions made in 1973 and 1974 when the strong economy encouraged
entrepreneurs to expand existing capacity. From the beginning of 1975
onwards, the commitment rate for new investment steadily declined reflecting
delayed investor response to the recessionary influences which had first
begun to be felt in mid-1974. This was reflected by a drop in the paid-in
capital of new business organizations registered during 1975. The declining
trend in investments was also confirmed by the Economic Development Founda-
tion's survey of business expectations which showed a clear downward trend in
investment plans right through 1975 from the peak levels of 1973 and 1974.
For a brief period between March-May 1976, investment plans rose sharply with
the business community perceiving encouraging signs of recovery in the U.S.
and Japan (based on economic data released in the first quarter). However,
later indications that the world wide recovery was slower than initially



-4-
expected once again caused a sharp dip in investment inclinations in July
1976 and onwards. Actual growth of expenditures on durable equipment of the
manufacturing sector fell to 5% in 1976 (from 27% in 1975) and since overall
economic recovery has been slow domestically as well as abroad, is not expected
to grow significantly in 1977.
Industrial Sector Issues and Policies
1.07      As outlined in the World Bank Economic Report/I, future Philippine
industrial growth will, in broad terms, need to be based on a balanced
expansion of investment in export industries coupled with the diversifica-
tion of intermediate and consumer goods production for the domestic market.
In terms of scale, the World Bank report suggests that the "only rational
policy appears to be one that encourages the development of the most efficient
industries regardless of size". However, to the extent that valid gen-
eralizations can be made at the aggregate level, the analysis indicates that
traditional cottage-type industries are unlikely to play a significant role
in future industrialization although they will need to be relied upon to
maintain their present employment levels over the next decade. It also
stresses the singular importance of reviving and sustaining growth in the
labor-intensive modern small and medium industries sector and orienting the
output of this sector more toward export products. The need for investment
in a few large capital intensive projects to deepen the industrial
structure and render it less import dependent is also acknowledged. Although
these projects are not expected to provide substantial opportunities for
direct employment, they are nonetheless regarded as essential, at this stage
of Philippine industrial development, to utilize more effectively the country's
natural resource base. tMoreover, the "downstream" industrialization permitted
by the output of these industries is expected to generate a large number of
additional job opportunities.
1.08      The following is an outline of the major industrial issues facing
Philippine policy makers and of the policy measures, which in some instances
have already been initiated, that would help set the Philippine industriali-
zation on right course.
1.09      Import substitution and tariff reform.  The present tariff struc-
ture provides relatively high protection to import substituting consumer
goods industries and relatively low or no protection to producer goods
and export industries. As a consequence, investment for the production
of intermediate goods has badly suffered. Also, many of the locally pro-
duced intermediate goods have been of low quality, impeding the ability of
the export manufacturers to compete in world markets. Furthermore, over
protected import substitution industries have become inefficient and have
also been unable to establish themselves in world markets. On the other
hand, it appears that import substitution possibilities have not yet been
fully realized in some intermediate and capital goods industries with a
ready domestic market because of the practically duty free imports of these
items.
/1 The Philippines: Priorities and Prospects for Development; The World
Bank, June 1976.



1.10      A tariff reform in 1973 resulted in administrative improvements
as well as in substantial reduction in the number of tariff categories and
a narrowing of the spread of tariff rates. However, the general allocative
effects of the tariff structure remained largely unchanged. Recent studies
of the Philippine tax system by the government and by international agencies
recommend the following reforms:
(a)  definition of criteria for expiration or gradual reduction of
excessive tariff protection to be implemented in the short term;
(b)  comprehensive review of existing tariff incentives to determine
what changes are needed to support better the government's export
promotion and employment creation policies, to be implemented in
the medium term;
(c)  overall leveling of tariffs at an average rate of 20-30%, with
occasional exceptions as dictated by thLe government's policy -
to be implemented in the long term; and
(d)  administrative reforms by the Tariff Commission and the Bureau
of Customs to allow increased coordination with other agencies
involved in industrial planning and an improved approach to
tariff reform - to be implemented in the short term.
The Government recognizing the importance of consistency between the tariff
structure and other investment incentive programs for the Philippine industrial
development, is planning a major tariff reform and for that purpose has already
taken several important preliminary steps. Because such an overall ration-
alization of the tariff structure will probably take several years to plan
and implement, the Government has in the meantime acted to offset the biases
mainly through fiscal incentives, credit measures and higher interest rates.
1.11      Export potential and promotional policies.  Historically, exports of
primary goods have been the main sources of foreign exchange earnings for the
Philippines. Manufactured exports (except the traditional agriculture-based
exports), on the other hand, did poorly until 1970 because of an overvalued
exchange rate and the high protection policies outlined above. Under growing
realization that exports in general and nontraditional exports in particular
needed to be encouraged to relieve what was becoming a serious balance of
payments constraint on growth, the Government took a series of ameliorative
actions. A realistic (and flexible) foreign exchange rate has been established.
Fiscal incentives were provided for investment and exports under the Investment
Incentives Act (1967) and Export Incentives Act (1970). Tariff rebates were
allowed to the exporting industries. An Export Processing Zone was set up and
the facility of bonded warehouses for exporters was provided. Various govern-
ment agencies, especially the Board of Investment, launched a campaign of
export promotion. These efforts, ranging from training of entrepreneurs to
credit extension and to marketing, have raised export consciousness and
improved administrative procedures. The effect of these measures has been an
impressive growth in nontraditional manufactured exports between 1970 and
1976, increasing 5.8 times in current terms during that period.



- 6 -
1.12      To continue the momentum of non-traditional manufactures' exports,
the Government has undertaken many actions: a Philippines Export Council
comprising both public and private representatives has been established to
study and make recommendations on various aspects of export promotion; a study
is being done to establish large trading houses in the style of South Korea and
Japan, the Government has already established a trading corporation in the
public sector; various credit agencies are making an effort to expand credit to
the export-oriented industry, a Presidential Decree has been issued to simplify
export procedures. But more importantly and effective in the long term would
be for the Government to change the existing tariff structure from its strong
bias in favor of import substitution to a freer trade regime. This would mean
removal of quantitative restrictions on imports and a leveling of tariffs. A
freer trade regime would especially help the smaller and less organized firms
which have not been able to benefit from the facilities of bonded warehouses
and tax and tariff concessions on account of either limiitation of size or lack
of information. A movement towards free trade regime should also help ration-
alize the industrial structure as a whole by reducing distortions and increasing
efficiency and should accelerate industrial growth generally.
1.13      Employment creation.  Except for the past two years, Philippine
industrialization has contributed disappointingly little toward alleviating the
persistent problems of unemployment and underemployment. Between 1960 and
1971, employment in manufacturing grew at an annual rate of about 2.5%, while
between 1971 and 1974 it did not grow at all. Employment growth rates in the
manufacturing sector were, however, higher in 1975 (7.6%) and 1976 (8.4%).
The share of manufacturing in total employment has actually dropped from
12.1% in 1960 to 10.4% in 1974 and is estimated to have reached 10.9% in 1976.
The distribution of manufacturing employment in the Philippines is unusually
skewed, with heavy concentration at both ends of the industrial spectrum,
i.e. in the "unorganized" cottage industry sector and in very large firms.
Employment growth in the cottage industry sector has been very slow, and,
between 1968 and 1973, was actually negative, while around 95% of the
incremental employment was absorbed by the modern manufacturing sector.
Confronted with an estimated 3% growth in labor force over the next decade,
the economy will have to employ annually almost 500,000 new entrants into
the labor force over this period. Because the absorptive capacity in the
agricultural sector is low, the provision of more work opportunities in the
manufacturing sector than in the past will be crucial.
1.14      The industrial incentives system has been strongly biased in favor
of the use of capital. For instance, over the period 1970-1971, 80% of the
total estimated amount of tax relief enjoyed by 3a. BO! approved projects was
on account of capital-favoring incentives. Attempts to counterbalance this
bias by introducing incentives for the use of labor in the modern sector have
had some limited success. But the overall industrial employment picture did
not show any improvement because of absolute decline of employment in the
large traditional cottage sector and by stagnanit employment in mining. If
the manufacturing sector is to provide a substanLial share of the required job
opportunities, then labor intensive export industries and some intermediate
and capital goods industries with a ready domestic market offer the best hope
to achieve this objective. The Government has introduced some policy changes



- 7 -
and is currently reviewing the entire incentive system to make it more con-
ducive to employment, export and import substitution needs. In restructuring
the present system, a two pronged approach could be followed by (a) changing
the selection of industries eligible for incentives and by (b) changing the
incentives mix itself. The objective of employmient creation under the
first approach, for instance, could be fostered lby confining incentives to
industries meeting certain labor-intensity criteria. Under the second
approach, some of the incentives favoring the use of capital could be reduced
or abolished and new incentives favoring the use of labor (e.g. income tax
deduction related to wage bill, or direct employment subsidy) could be
introduced.
1.15      Promotion of small-scale industry.  As in many other countries, the
small-scale sector faces many problems and artificial disadvantages usually
steming from incentives systems favoring the large scale sector. Inefficiencies
caused by lack of expertise in organization, management and choice of technology,
difficulties in penetrating the market, deficiencies in the quality and suita-
bility of machinery and equipment employed, restricted access to institutional
sources of finance and difficulties in formulating and implementing project
concepts are some of the areas of concern. Through recent efforts by the
Government some progress has been achieved. The basic organizational framework
has been set up to provide a wide range of technical services and expertise.
A fairly widespread program (MASICAP) exists since 1973 that helps small
businessmen formulate projects and that has led to a substantial number of
projects being actually financed by various financial institutions. In 1975,
with assistance from the Bank through a small cormponent of Loan 1120-PH, the
Department of Industry began to establish Small Business Advisory Centers
(SBAC's), of which there were 12 by July 1, 1977, with the objective to form a
broad network of technical assistance extension services to be provided to
small and medium industries throughout the country. Various financial programs
have been set up designed to provide easier access to institutional finance for
small-scale industries.  DBP's Small and Medium Industries Program (partly
financed by the Bank), the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (see para. 2.10)
(also partly financed by the Bank), and PDCP's Small Business Program (see
paragraphs 3.36 - 3.39) are cases in point.
1.16      Despite the progress made so far, more could be done.  A separate
cottage industry organization needs to be established. Producers and traders
cooperatives, if well organized, could perform mLny useful functions on behalf
of small industrialists, particularly in such areas as loan mediation, the
organization of bulk purchases, joint marketing services, the dissemination
of technical advice, and training. MIore needs also to be done to multiply the
linkages between small and large-size industries, especially under specific
development schemes sponsored by BOI. The establishment of information ex-
changes (both with respect to supply and demand and technological information)
could greatly contribute to this end, and some fiscal encouragement would also
be advisable. The Government has successfully set up various organizations and
mechanisms for the promotion of small industries, but there still exists little
knowlege about the existing cottage and other small-scale industries, and
particularly about where the true potential for sound growth lies. A compre-
hensive survey of the small-scale sector is needed, as are subsectoral and
regional studies. With some financial support, the Institute for Small-Scale



- 8 -
Industries could conduct such surveys and studies. As a result of the planned
programs of rural electrification, and agricultural mechanization, the growth
in rural incomes, the labor-intensive exports drive, and the policy of indus-
trial decentralization, a fresh look into new opportunities for small producers
is becoming more and more necessary. Planning authorities might consider
establishing a separate unit to study these issues on a permanent basis.
1.17      Regional dispersion of industry.  As outlined earlier, manufac-
turing activity in the Philippines is heavily concentrated in the Greater
Manila area and its surrounding provinces. The Government, well aware of
the consequences of increasing regional imbalances, has undertaken several
steps in order to check the expansion in the Manila area and to create condi-
tions for more balanced growth in the future. These steps include: fiscal
incentives to encourage projects to be located in less developed areas
(which have, however, proved to be of little impact); promotional measures
by the BOI such as regional seminars and an experimental regional develop-
ment pilot program in Northern Mindanao; BOI's practice of negotiating the
location of a project before it is approved; a ban on the establishment of
new plants within a 50 km radius of Manila, except for export industries;
and the requirements that financing institutions in the provinces allocate
75% of their accumulated deposits for loans to projects in their respective
areas. These measures may have had a positive impact but judging from most
recent figures of BOI-sponsored projects in recent years, it is obvious that
new and stronger efforts are needed in order to shift the balance of indus-
trial investment in favor of other provinces. A real shift in the balance of
industrial growth will take place only when it occurs in labor-intensive
sectors, such as in wood processing, textiles, and the production of other
goods for mass consumption and export.
1.18      An absolute condition for investments to be directed into desired
locations is the provision of adequate supporting infrastructure, such as
electricity, water, transporation and communications, financial and tech-
nical services, and the availability of qualified labor. Fiscal incentives
without such i4nfrastructure are unlikely to induce many new investments
in the outer provinces and, with such infrastructure, are probably not
needed. The Government has launched several programs in order to improve
the basic infrastructure in areas outside Manila (such as substantial
electricity generation projects in Mindanao and the Visayas, road construc-
tion, and a 10-year shipping and shipbuilding program). These efforts should
be continued and extended to other types of infrastructure as well as to
other regions. To promote the creation of other areas of industrial concen-
tration away from Manila, the Government in recent years has put considerable
emphasis on planning and promoting the establishment of industrial estates
and export processing zones in a few selected growth centers. Another policy
change that might be explored relates to the stipulation which permits an
almost indiscriminate proliferation of industrial units in the Manila area
if they are producing for exports. It is possible that many of these export-
oriented projects would have been established anyway, even if the Manila
area had been closed to them. Therefore, a modification of this policy,
together with the establishment of more free trade zones and bonded factories
and warehouses in the outer regions, could greatly contribute to an effective
decentralization of industries.



-9-
Prospects
1.19      During 1977, the manufacturing sector is expected to achieve a
growth of 7-8%. The lackluster performance of the manufacturing sector
over the past few years was due to slow growth of domestic demand and slow
recovery of the economies of Philippines' major trading partners. It is
expected that with stabilizing terms of trade, consumption demand would
revive in 1978 giving the necessary impulse to the manufacturing sector.
Concomitantly, investments in durable equipment that were at low levels since
mid 1975 following the investment boom of 1974/75, are expected to rebound.
1.20      Over the medium to long term, the Government is committed to a
strategy that includes emphasis on accelerated industrialization, both
in capital-intensive basic industries and labor-intensive export indus-
tries. The performance of the industrial sector will have to be signifi-
cantly improved if the Philippines is to be reasonably successful in easing
the foreign exchange constraint and particularly in expanding productive
employment as at least 75,000 jobs a year will need to be provided by the
industrial sector by the early 1980s. To achieve these targets the
Philippines will need to expand investment in export industries and in a
wide range of intermediate goods industries where domestic demand prospects
are reasonably good. According to the provisional five-year Plan 1978-1982,
manufacturing is expected to grow at an annual rate of 9% over the five-year
period. To achieve this target, investments will have to grow by 15.5% p.a.
between 1978 and 1982 to total P 86 billion, of which about 65% would go
to larger industries.
1.21      Finished consumer goods industries producing for the domestic
market are generally labor-intensive; their accelerated growth would be
very beneficial in terms of employment generation and low-cost investment.
While the prospects for further growth of the traditional cottage industry,
which still employs over two-thirds of the industrial labor force, are
not bright, there is considerable potential for developing modern small
scale sector in such areas as food processing, handicrafts and apparel.
Domestic demand should rise in the future as a result of rising incomes.
A large group of intermediate goods industries also offers room for accele-
rated growth and significant foreign exchange savings in the decade ahead.
Domestic demand in these areas is likely to rise much faster than in most
final demand categories. Investment plans for the coming years also include
some large import-replacing capital intensive projects for intermediate and
capital goods. In addition to import replacement, industry will have to
play a much greater role in the country's exports. After allowing for the
probable increase in agricultural and mineral exports, some $4 billion of
nontraditional manufactured exports would be needed by 1985 (compared to
$550 million in 1976) to finance the projected level of imports. Industries
with significant export potential include textiles, apparel, leather goods,
handicrafts, electronics, and goods manufacturecd from nickel, copper and
aluminum.

2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Overview
2.01      The Philippines has a relatively well developed and increasingly
sophisticated financial system, with Manila becoming a regional financial
center of increasing prominence. The core of the system is a large commercial
banking sector, both local and foreign, regulated by the Central Bank of the
Philippines. There are in addition two specialized development finance
institutions providing long-term capital, and a variety of other financial
institutions, e.g. investment houses, savings and loan associations, rural
banks, regional development banks, etc. The Land Bank was recently revitalized
to finance the Government's agrarian reforms. The Government has also encour-
aged the rapid development of a network of small independently owned and oper-
ated rural banks and private development banks which concentrate on providing
needed financial resources to their localities. In late 1976 the Government
allowed the establishment of Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) and expanded Foreign
Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs) to undertake foreign currency credit operations.
There is also a well developed and very active short-term money market on which
a variety of commercial and industrial issues are traded. Various regulatory
shortcomings and microeconomic considerations, however, have adversely affected
*the development of a long-term capital market. Although three stock exchanges
exist, activity on them is concentrated on a relatively few and speculative
issues. Lease financing and mortgage financing are also relatively less
developed.
Insitutional Structure
2.02      Commercial banks.  As of December 31, 1976, there were 25 privately
owned domestic commercial banks, and two owned by the Government. Of various
foreign banks four also operate branches in the Philippines. Commercial
banks operate under a branch banking system (there are over 1,100 branches
and offices) and are the main source of working capital and trading credits.
The largest bank is the Government-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB). With
almost 200 branches, it accounted for over 36% of the banking system's total
assets (1 80.0 billion) at the end of 1976. The commercial banking system has
grown rapidly over the past five years increasing its assets almost four
times. Domestic credit provided by commercial banks during the first seven
months of 1976 amounted to P 72 billion, 28% of which went to the manufac-
turing sector, mainly for short-term working capital. To strengthen and
rationalize the commercial banking system, the Central Bank instituted a
program aimed at doubling the capital base of the private commercial banking
system to P 3 billion which by the end of 1975 was exceeded by almost 20%.
That program also encouraged increased equity participation by foreign banks
in commercial banks and other intermediaries (by the middle of 1977, 11
foreign banks and financial institutions held equity interests in 8 domestic
banks) and a much needed program of bank consolidation and merger which
resulted in bringing the number of commercial banks down to 27 from 34 in
1973.



- 11 -
2.03      Development finance institutions.  Two institutions, the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and PDCP are the main providers of long term
finance with DBP (total assets of P 12.7 billion compared to P 867 million
of PDCP at the end of 1976) by far the larger of the two. During FY76
DBP extended financial assistance totalling P 3.9 billion. As of June 30, 1976,
DBP had over 247,000 loans outstanding amounting to P 6.4 billion. While in
amounts of loans outstanding industrial loans accounted for the greatest share
(50%), over 200,000 agricultural loans accounted for 82% of the number of
loans. DBP's resources come from government equity contributions, deposits
(principally of the government), borrowings from the Central Bank, sale of
bonds, foreign borrowings guaranteed by the Government, and internal cash
generation. Nearly all of DBP's resources come either directly from public
funds or are raised with government support. Its securities carry rela-
tively low interest rates that would make them unattractive in the absence
of special features such as exemption from taxation and eligibility for
reserve requirements. Because of the sheer volume and diversity of its
operations, DBP plays a prominent and unique role as the Government's arm
for financing economic development.
2.04      Although PDCP is considered an investment bank under Philippine law,
its main business is the extension of long term loans which accounted for 81%
of its total assets as at June 30, 1977. PDCP also makes equity investments,
provides guarantees, underwriting and private placement of equity and debt
instruments and syndicates loans. Its operations are mainly geared towards
assisting private manufacturing enterprises but it also assists all other
productive sectors if considered economically beneficial. Up to now, PDCP's
main resources were loans from IBRD and ADB (88%) and equity contributions
(8%). In terms of quality of projects financed, PDCP has done well and through
its various developmental programs has had considerable overall impact on the
financial scene in the Philippines.
2.05      Rural banks.  The rural banking system consists of approximately
800 privately owned banks in rural areas with total assets at the end of 1976
of P 3 billion with a deposit base of P 850 million. 93% of the loans made
by rural banks during 1976 were for agricultural purposes and, most of them
were seasonal production credits. The Government supports the growth of rural
banks by providing counterpart equity contributions, loans and technical
assistance from the Central Bank along with tax exemption privileges and
special rediscounting schemes to supplement their credit extension abilities.
Over the past 5 years rural banks have grown almost four times, slightly more
rapidly than the whole banking system.

2.06      Private development banks (PDBs).  These institutions of which
there are now 33, have been promoted by DBP in various regions (with much the
same assistance as provided by the Central Bank to rural banks) to specialize
in the mobilization and lending of long term resources for small local
ventures. As of December 31, 1976, total assets of PDB's amounted to about
p 482 million and they had a deposit base of P 139 million. Outstanding
loans and investments of PDB's as of end 1976 totalled about P 382 million,
three fourths of which were in the form of medium and long term loans.
During 1976, PDB's made loans totalling P 242 million. Agricultural loans
accounted for about 49% of total lending while industrial loans accounted for
26%, the remainder being for trading/commercial firms (15%) and consumption
(10%).
2.07      Savings banks.  There are 10 savings banks in the Philippines with
a network of around 60 branches. Drawing funds mainly from households and
industrial savers in the form of time deposits, these thrift institutions had
aggregate total assets of P 2 billion and deposits of F 1.3 billion as
of December 31, 1976. Savings banks lend mostly for housing and real
estate, although in the past few years an increasing proportion of their
resources have been channelled into Government securities (24% of total
portfolo in 1976).
2.08      Savings and loan associations (SLAs).  SLA's, of which there are
200, can be either "stock" (132) companies i.e. they can engage in deposit
and banking business with the public at large or "non-stock" (68) companies
which means they are limited in their banking transactions to members only
(credit union). Almost two thirds of all SLAs are located in Greater Manila
area. As of January 31, 1977 SLA's had total assets of about P 511 million
and a deposit base of P 371 million. Most of the business of "stock" SLA's
is in the financing of home mortgages while non-stock associations specialize
in personal consumption loans. With the assistance of Central Bank, SLA's
have begun to diversify their lending operations into financing agricultural
and home based cottage industries.
2.09      Other term-financing institutions.  Several other institutions
provide term finance, a very small proportion of which goes to industry.
These include: the National Government and Development Corporation (NIDC),
a subsidiary of DBP; private investment houses; insurance companies, and
pension and trust funds including the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS) and the Social Security System (SSS), whose resources for industry
are financed mainly through DBP. While the outstanding loan portfolios of
GSIS and SSS totalled about P 6.1 billion at December 31, 1976, the bulk
of their lending is for real estate (53%) and consumer loans (19%).
2.10      The Investment Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF).  IGLF is a long-term
compensatory financing and guarantee fund owned by NEDA and administered by
the Central Bank. It was established with USAID assistance in 1952 to
encourage private banking institutions to provide long-term financing to
small entrepreneurs. Its compensatory financing function is discharged



- 13 -
through a special time deposit provided to sponsoring banks at an interest
rate of 7% (to be on-lent at 12%). IGLF also provides an automatic guarantee
for 60% of the amount being loaned, at a cost to the borrower of 2% p.a.of the
guaranteed amount. As of Mlarch 31, 1977, 10 institutions, 5 commercial
banks and 5 nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFI's), had been accredited
to the IGLF. Since 1974 the IGLF approved 626 loans totaling P 114.8 million
and at March 31, 1977 its total assets amounted to P 134.1 million.
2.11      Investment houses.  Defined as any enterprise which engages in the
underwriting of corporate securities, an investment house is prohibited from
engaging in deposit banking business. However, it can engage in "quasi-banking"
operations by creating deposit substitutes. The minimum paid-in capital
requirement for an investment house is P 20 million and the majority must be
owned by Filipino nationals. There were 12 investment houses at the end of
1976 with 5 institutions dominating the industry. Most are linked with major
international financial institutions and large local commercial banks. Their
operations and revenues so far have been heavily based (about 80% on average)
on money market operations rather than on development of the securities market
or the provision of corporate merchant banking services. Total assets of the
investment houses amounted to about P 4.3 billion at the end of 1976. The
total capital base of the industry amounted to P 494 million, with paid-in
capital stock amounting to P 335 million. Over a third of paid-in capital
was contributed by foreign sources. For eight years until 1974, the assets of
this segment of the financial sector grew at over 50% annually; however, growth
over the last two years has been at about 8%, mainly due to Government efforts
to curb the growth of the short term money market (see para. 2.17) as a means
to develop the long end of the market. The investment houses have great
potential for further development. They are depositories of sophisticated
financial skills, but the direction of their growth in the past veered markedly
alway from the intentions guiding their establishment, largely because of an
inappropriate policy environment.
2.12      Finance companies.  There are 194 finance companies registered
with the SEC, the 42 largest accounting for 80% of the total business.
These companies, mostly subsidiaries of major commercial banks, are heavily
engaged in financing consumer durables on installment payment plans, short
and medium term credits for local manufacturers or traders for financing
inventory, receivables or transport equipment. A few such companies have
diversified into equipment leasing. Such firms typically rely on paid-in
capital and direct borrowings for cash generation; a few have successfully
placed medium term debentures with the public. As at the end of 1976 total
assets of these companies stood at P 4.6 billion with a total capital base
of P 713 million and outstanding lending volume of P 3.6 billion.

2.13      Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) and Foreign Currency Deposit Units
(FCDUs). A signifcant development in the Philippine banking system was
the establishment of offshore banking facilities in September 1976. The
major purpose of these facilities is to transform Metro-Manila into a
regional center of financial activity in the ASEAN group of countries and to
help develop the traditional banking system of the country. It is intended
that the newly established Offshore Banking System will function as it has
in other financial centers, such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. In
addition the Government has expanded the foreign currency lending authority
of a number of commercial banks that had been already acting as FCDUs.
2.14      Presidential Decree 1034 issued in September 1976 authorizes a
branch, subsidiary or affiliate of a foreign banking corporation, referred to
as OBU, to conduct banking transactions in foreign currencies involving the
receipt of funds, principally from external sources, and the subsequent
utilization of these funds for borrowers inside or outside the country.
Under the system, funds in foreign currencies which are accepted and held by
an OBU in the course of its business, are considered as "deposits". The
withdrawal of equivalent amounts of such funds including interest by owners
of the "deposits" is not subject to restrictions. These transactions are
primarily offshore operations. However, a certain amount of offshore-to-
onshore operations are permitted, subject to prior licensing by the Central
Bank. Presidential Decree 1035, also issued on September 1976, expands the
functions of the FCDUs by exempting them from the 15% reserve requirement to
be held in the form of foreign exchange deposits with the Central Bank and by
allowing them to extend up to the amount of foreign currency deposits, foreign
currency loans to any domestic enterprise. As a major incentive to encourage
foreign banks to set up OBUs, exemptions are provided from all forms of local
licenses, fees, dues, or any other local taxes or burdens. However, as with
transactions of FCDUs, a tax of 5% on offshore income is imposed. For gross
onshore income, a tax of 10% is imposed, based on the amount of gross interest
income from loans granted to on-shore borrowers. All regular commercial
banking income is subject to the usual corporate tax.
2.15      As of July 30, 1977, the Central Bank had approved 16 foreign banks
to operate OBUs in the country. As of the same date, four branches of foreign
banks and 13 domestic commercial banks were authorized as expanded FCDUs. As
of August 10, 1977 most FCDUs and OBUs were occupied with organizational
matters with three OBUs having formally inaugurated their offices.
2.16      Suppliers' credits.  Foreign commercial borrowings guaranteed by
domestic financial intermediaries (principally DBP) have in the past accounted
for 30-35% of total investment in manufacturing. At the end of 1976, the
private sector accounted for 43% of the outstanding external debt just over
one half of which went to the manufacturing sector. Prior to 1970, such
borrowings were obtained on relatively hard terms. As a result of the
stringent debt management measures taken since 1970 by the Central Bank
and the substantial increases in export earnings, the burden of servicing such
debt has been reduced to a manageable level.
2.17      The money market.  The Philippine money market provides the
mechanism through which commercal banks and large corporations keep their
liquidity position in balance. There are basically three specialized



- 15 -
sub-markets. (i) interbank; (ii) government securities and (iii) inter-
company. The government securities market is the principal segment, with
the government being the largest trader in funds. The main security instru-
ments traded in this market are short-term Treasury Bills, medium-term
Central Bank Certificates of Indebtedness (CBCI's) and Treasury Notes, and
long-term Progress Bonds issued by DBP. Direct trading in Treasury Bills is
generally quite heavy, trading in longer term securities however is mainly
"indirect" i.e. the securities themelves are not traded, they serve as
collateral for "repurchase" agreements between sellers and buyers. Partici-
pation in the intercompany market is restricted to financial and non-financial
public firms with prime credit ratings. The Central Bank circulars of
January 2, 1976 (see para. 2.23) limited previously unregulated yields of money
market instruments with a maturity of less than two years to 17% (inclusive
of all charges), and in order to curb the flow of funds into the money
market, the minimum denomination of deposit substitutes was raised from
P 50,000 to P 200,000 for instruments with less than 2 years maturity and
P 100,000 for instruments with longer maturities. Commercial banks were
required to maintain a 20% reserve against deposit substitutes of up to 2
years while non-bank financial institutions were required to maintain 20%
reserves against all deposit substitutes. As a consequence, the growth of
deposit substitutes since the beginning of 1976 has slowed considerably to
only about 11% p.a. compared to more than twice that rate during the previous
two years.
2.18       The Securities Market: The Philippine financial system does not
have an active and quantitatively important stocks and bonds market. In
recent years only a small proportion of the capital expansion of Philippine
corporations has been financed through issues sold in the three stock exchanges,
which are located in MIanila, Mlakati, and Quezon City. New firms have generally
been unable to sell equities. The same applies to corporate bonds.
Recent Developments
2.19       Since 1975 the principal objectives of selective monetary and
credit policies have been to promote growth with stability, both in the
external and internal sectors, and to improve the mobilization of financial
resources and their allocation to priority sectors. In particular, monetary
policy was aimed at the containment of inflation and improving the external
balance, while selective credit policies were geared toward promoting growth
through financing investment expenditures. Major areas of concern for the
authorities included the shift of funds from traditional commercial bank
deposits to nonbank financial institutions and deposit substitutes with
commercial banks, and the inadequate growth of facilities for medium- and
long-term financing. Both phenomena were the result of low interest rate
ceilings on deposit rates and Usury Law limits on many lending rates. The
problems were exacerbated by high inflation during 1973-74 when real interest
rates became negative.
2.20       Total liquidity rose by 24% in 1976 and a further 10% during the
first six months of 1977 to P 39.6 billion as of June 30, 1977. Over the
past 18 months money supply grew by 27%. Various Government measures to
check the growth of deposit substitutes seem to have been successful as



- 16 -
deposit substitutes increased only 16% over the 18 month period ending June 30,
1977, after having more than doubled over the preceeding two years. In con-
trast, time and savings deposits rose by 70% during the same period ending
June 30, 1977 while they had grown only 30% during 1974/75.  Outstanding
domestic credit grew by 24% in 1976 (30% in 1975) and during the first six
months of 1977 by only 5%, to reach P 50.5 billion.  Through 1976 credit to
the public sector rose by 51%, to P 9.3 billion at the end of 1976, mainly
because of unusually high credit demand by Philexco (the Government sugar
marketing company). During the first half of 1977, net credit to the Government
declined by P 0.2 billion, mainly for seasonal reasons and also Philexco's
credit demand was 8% below the level a year earlier because of a changed
pricing system and a sharp increase in sugar exports. Private sector credit
grew much more slowly, 18% in 1976 and only 3% in the first half of 1977,
reaching P 34.6 billion at June 30, 1977. The weak investment demand in the
private sector was caused by various factors including market outlook of
economic recovery, higher real cost of borrowing due to receding inflation, a
reduced supply of funds in the money market and excess capacities resulting
from the 1974/75 investment boom. After having risen by 12% in 1973 and 40%
in 1974, the growth of consumer prices has slowed markedly to 7% in 1975 and
6% in 1976. The rate for the first half of 1977 was 7%, and for the next five
years is expected to be between 7% and 8%.
2.21      During 1975/76, several measures were taken to strengthen and expand
the financial system. First, the final phase of the capital build-up program
for the banking system, which required every private domestic commercial bank
to increase its paid-in capital to at least P 100 million, was completed in
1975. As of the end of that year, the aggregate paid-up capital of domestic
commercial banks amounted to P 3.6 billion or P 400 mllion more than the
Central Bank target. That program also encouraged: (a) increased equity
participation by foreign banks in commercial banks and other intermediaries;
and (b) a much needed program of bank consolidation and merger which resulted
in reducing the number of commercial banks to 27 from 34 in 1973.  In 1975, the
Central Bank also embarked on a program of more systematic and stringent
regulation of NBFIs and quasi-banking institutions. Other measures taken
toward increasing effective intermediation included: the opening of Central
Bank rediscounting window for thrift banks and encouraging the establishment
of bank branch offices, savings agencies and pawn shops in areas inadequately
served by commercial banks. At the beginning of 1976, the Central Bank issued
a series of circulars with the main objective of improving the interest rate
structure (see para. 2.24) and in September of that year issued two decrees on
offshore banking operations (see para. 2.14). On June 3, 1977 the Government
issued a decree instituting a 35% final transaction tax on interest earned on
commercial papers issued in the money market, while a 15% withholding tax on
investment paid on savings and time deposits was set. This measure was
designed on the one hand to improve tax collection and on the other hand, to
increase borrowing rates on money market instruments and thus reduce yields so
that financial savers could be induced to place their funds in medium and
long-term deposits rather than in short-term money markets.
2.22       Interest Rates.  Until January 1976, the interest rates charged by
the banking system were governed by the Usury Laws which allowed a maximum
nominal rate of 12% p.a. for loans secured by real estate mortages and 14% p.a.



- 17 -
for unsecured loans. As the discounting of interest due for up to a maximum
of a year was usually applied, the banks in fact realized an effective
yield of 13.6% and 16.3% depending on the security offered. In addition, the
Central Bank allowed financial institutions to charge service fees ranging
from 0.75% p.a. to 2% p.a. on a graduating scale. In 1974, in response to
tight money market conditions, interest rates on savings and time deposits
ranging from 5% - 9.5% p.a. were increased to 6% and 11.5% p.a. However,
in spite of the increase in the nominal rate of interest, the real rate of
interest continued to be negative due to high inflation. While the banking
sector was subject to the interest rate regulations, the same was not true of
the NBFI's which, in 1974, were occasionally charging rates, on an annual
basis, of well above 30%.
2.23       At the beginning of 1976, the Central Bank enacted a series of
changes in interest rates and reserve requirements aimed at both the banking
sector and NBFIs. Mtaximum deposit rates were increased and, for the first
time, a distinction was made between short and long term lending rates. The
major changes enacted were:
(i)   ceilings on loans with maturities of more than 2 years
were raised to 19% p.a.;
(ii)   loans of less than 2 years remain subject to the Usury
Law ceiling of 12% for secured loans and 14% for unsecured
ones. Service charges of 2% - 3% p.a. can be added;
(iii)   yields on money market instruments are also subject
to regulations; the maximum yield including all charges
being 17% on instruments with maturities of up to 2 years,
(iv)   no ceiling on yields in the case of instruments with
maturities greater than 2 years.
In the absence of official statistics, it is not clear whether there has been a
shift towards the long-term end in the structure of deposits, but deposits as
a whole have risen quite fast since the-beginning of 1976 at the expense of
deposit substitutes. On the credit side, while some investment houses and
commercial banks did arrange long term peso accommodations, the market for
medium and long term finance remained thin (the decline in LIBOR and the ready
availability of suppliers' credits to corporate clients at relatively low rates
may have been contributing factors).  It is important to note that with the
unusual level of inflation in 1973-74 having been curbed, these measures have
resulted in real or positive rates of interest on loans, and positive yields on
savings; hence, they represent an important step toward rationalizing the level
and structure of interest rates and provide the basis for increasing domestic
savings to levels necessary for sustaining the investment program necessary for
steady long-term growth. A list of interest rates charged by financial insti-
tutions in the Philippines is shown in Annex 1.1.
Financial Sector Issues
2.24      Aggregate savings performance in the Philippines has improved
generally during the last decade and is comparable to that of other countries



- 18 -
at a similar stage of economic development. Since 1975, gross domestic sav-
ings have been at a level of 25% of GNP and financed approximately 80% of
total investment. However, in order to reach a gross investment level of
more than 31% of GNP by 1982 and reduce the country's dependence on foreign
savings, the Five-Year Development Plan (1978-82) calls for an increase in
gross domestic savings to a level of more than 28% of GNP at the end of the
Plan period. To achieve this objective, the savings of the household sector,
which is expected to contribute approximately 40% of the total domestic sav-
ings requirement, will need to increase by more than 17% per annum during the
next five years.
2.25       As more savings flow from households to Government and the corporate
sector through financial intermediaries, interest rate and credit policies
will become increasingly important. The Government's role will be a critical
one in ensuring that the interest rate level and structure are in line with
the opportunity cost of capital in the economy and satisfy both savers and
investors with rates that reflect different maturities and risks. With the
change in the interest rate structure of 1976 and subsequent regulations to
control the growth of short-term financial assets, the Government has made a
step in the right direction. However, the 19% ceiling on loans and debt instru-
ments with a maturity of over two years still effectively limits the rate on
long-term deposits and the ability of financial institutions to raise long
term resources. In addition, efforts will be needed to strengthen the
institutional framework of the financial system in order to enable it to
undertake its increasing responsibilities. The Government, through the
Central Bank, has started this process with a program, already completed, to
increase commercial banks' capitalization and attempts are being made through
various Government programs to increase allocation of institutional credit to
small-scale industry. More needs to be done, however, to clarify the alloca-
tional role of each type of institution and to improve the quality and
broaden the coverage of financial services. This would involve stimulating
the growth of thrift banks, insurance institutions, and the rural banking
system. It would also involve encouraging the emergence and development of a
stronger securities market which so far has been hampered by the limits on
longer term interest rates and to some extent by the dominance of the term
market by Government financial institutions because of the preferential
treatment given to their debt instruments. The recent introduction of a 5%
development tax on closely held corporations to encourage them to go public
is a step in the right direction. Finally, financial institutions and credit
programs in the Philippines have experienced considerable deterioration of
loan recovery rates during recent years which has seriously affected their
financial performance. However, the Government is devoting increased atten-
tion to the problem of arrears so that recovery will be improved without
closing the essential credit channels.
2.26      The Bank attaches considerable importance to a systematic long-term
plan to develop the Philippine financial sector along rational lines. As a
first step towards that end, a detailed discussion and review of the various
issues facing the financial sector is presently underway within the Bank. It
is intended that a special financial sector mission should then visit the
Philippines to undertake a thorough first-hand study. The findings of this
mission would provide the basis for a dialogue with the Government on the
measures needed to be taken by the Government.

3. PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
A. Institutional Aspects
Corporate Purpose
3.01      PDCP was incorporated in February 1963 as a privately owned and
managed development finance company with the active support and financial
assistance of the Bank and IFC. Its objective is to assist in the creation,
expansion and modernization of private productive enterprises in the
Philippines, to encourage private capital participation from local and
foreign sources and to help develop technical, financial, managerial and
administration knowledge in the country. For that purpose, its Articles
of Incorporation entitle it to extend medium and long-term loans, invest
in equity capital, underwrite and take up equity and debt security issues,
guarantee loans, act as an insurance agent and/or broker, and provide mana-
gerial and technical assistance to its borrowers. By Philippine law, PDCP is
considered an Investment Bank because it also performs investment banking
functions.
Ownership and Share Capital
3.02      A list of shareholders as of June 30, 1977 is provided in Annex 2.1.
In 1963 PDCP's share capital was P 25 million; its authorized share capital now
is P 100 million, of which P 60.4 million has been paid-in and there is
also a capital premium of P 13.1 million. As of June 30, 1977, PDCP's paid in
capital comprised 6,037,500 shares (P 10 par value): 4,226,250 Class A
shares (held by Filipinos only) /1 and 1,811,250 Class B shares (which may be
held also by non-Filipinos). PDCP's share ownership has a fairly wide disperson.
There are currently 1,280 Class A shareholders and 119 Class B shareholders.
Individuals accounting for 83% of Class A shareholders hold 18% of Class A
shares while institutions, such as foreign banks and insurance companies,
accounting for 26% of Class B shareholders hold 98% of Class B shares. PDCP
has made considerable attempts to widen the ownership of Class A shares but
only with modest success. At the last share issue which was completed in early
1976, Class A shareholders owning more than 10,000 shares agreed to waive 50%
of their preemptive rights, thus making available 242,795 shares for the
general public. Though the subscription price was slightly lower than the book
value of PDCP's shares, smaller individual investors in the Philippines were
not attracted, evidently because they considered PDCP's profitability and
dividend yield to be low in comparison with alternative investments. In the
event the closing date had to be extended and some of the larger shareholders
who had waived their preemptive rights had to be approached to complete the
share offering.
/1 There is no difference in the rights of the two types of shares. A
distinction was only made to ensure that at least 70% of the share
capital is in Filipino hands.



- 20 -
Board of Directors
3.03      PDCP has an active and representative Board of 11 members, which
takes a keen interest in its affairs. It approves PDCP's annual business plan
and receives detailed monthly reports on actual operations, profitability and
financial position with an analysis of variance from approved targets and
budget. On the basis of an agreed rotation system, one of the three Directors
representing Class B shareholders resigns each year, thus giving an opportunity
to every major shareholder to be represented on the Board. Mr. R. Villanueva, a
prominent industrialist has continued to be the Chairman of the Board but he
relinquished his position of President in 1976. Mr. Vicente R. Jayme, who was
the Executive Vice President for many years, was elected a member of the Board
and appointed PDCP's President at the same time. The Board continues to
include two influential members of the Government, lIessrs. J. P. Enrile,
Secretary of Defence (and Chairman of the Philippine National Bank) and Gerardo
Sicat, Director General of NEDA. The composition of the Board of Directors as
of June 30, 1977 is given in Annex 2.2.
Organization, Management and Staff
3.04      Organization.  PDCP's organization chart is shown in Annex 2.3.
All policy guidelines are laid down by PDCP's Board which also authorizes all
investment decisions. Day to day operations are overseen by the President. All
appraisal and promotional work is handled in one department, headed by the
Senior Vice-President who also oversees the Investment Banking Department. In
a recent change of the organizational set up, the supervision unit was split
into two units with one unit being exclusively concerned with the follow-up of
problem projects (see para. 3.13).
3.05       During 1976, PDCP acquired a controlling interest in a stock
brokerage and a management consultancy firm. The stock brokerage firm, R.
Machado and Company, with a seat on the Manila Stock Exchange, has an autho-
rized and issued share capital of P 500,000 and P 274,731 respectively.
PDCP acquired its 100% interest in this firm at a cost of P 1.3 million,
which also included the cost of the Manila Stock Exchange seat of P 1.1
million. During the past three years, lMachado suffered losses which,
at June 30, 1976 had accumulated to P 429,000. PDCP's rationale for
acquiring the subsidiary is to be able to play a more active role in the
Philippine capital market. Through the acquisition of the stock brokerage
firm, PDCP hopes to develop a secondary market for the issues it underwrites.
The acquisition would also help PDCP to be more active in its equity invest-
ment operations. PDCP is now in the process of strengthening the management
of its subsidiary so that the company may achieve the objectives for which it
was acquired. PDCP also wants its subsidiary to induce foreign institutional
investors to buy Filipino securities and for this purpose has recently set
up a joint venture with another securities company.

3.06      The management consulting firm whose name was subsequently changed
to Asia Business Consultants Incorporated (ABC) was established in 1959 with
personnel management and industrial relations as its special field. The
scope of its operations was subsequently broadenecl to include industrial
engineering and general management consulting.  PDCP paid P 200,000 to
acquire 60% of the subscribed capital in the firm., The present staff of the
firm comprises four principals who are also the Directors of the company, six
consultants and analysts and five administrative and support staff. During
1976, ABC Consultants suffered losses of P 216,000 but PDCP has estimated
that in the long run, its investment will yield 26%. The rationale for
acquiring a controlling interest in ABC was to enhance PDCP's ability to
provide management consulting services to its clients. Requests to PDCP from
its clients for help in preparing project feasibi:Lity studies, management
audit, personnel administration and training and development programs will
henceforth be handled by ABC. ABC will continue to cater to non-PDCP clients
also.
3.07      Management and Staff.  PDCP is one of the most efficiently managed
DFC's with which the Bank is associated. First as the Executive Vice-President
and now as the President, Mr. Vicente R. Jayme proved to be a first rate
professional manager and he is held in high esteem by the World Bank Group.
With the growing size and complexity of PDCP's opierations he is contemplating
a strengthening of PDCP's senior management which is likely to take place
early in 1978.
3.08      The generally high quality of PDCP's staff is apparent through all
levels of the organization. Unfortunately, the necessarily limited scope for
promotions within PDCP together with the demand in the Philippine financial
community for PDCP trained staff has resulted in a high turnover of pro-
fessional staff over the last few years ranging from 29% (1974) to 13% (1975).
While this rate is high by any standard, a closer examination shows that the
majority of the staff members who left had been with PDCP for less than three
years. The senior and more experienced staff members have remained relatively
stable. For this reason and also because PDCP has a well developed training
program (see following paragraph), the quality of PDCP's output has not been
affected adversely by the high staff turnover. PDCP's management is fully
aware of the consequences of a prolonged high staff turnover and is attempting
to slow it down (it concedes that it cannot bring it much below 10%) through
the introduction of a career development program and a flexible and responsive
salary administration. At June 30, 1977, PDCP had a total staff of 207, of
which 63% were professionals.
3.09      Training.  All training activities are coordinated by the Develop-
ment Finance Institute (DFI), a unit within PDCP having a staff of three
training officers and one secretary. DFI was established with the objective
of providing PDCP's new recruits with an orientation to various aspects of
its operations. In recent years, the DFI has expanded the scope of its
activities and the training courses have become more formal. In addition to
PDCP's own personnel, the DFI now trains staff from several government
departments and agencies (such as the Philippines National Bank) as well as
personnel from development finance companies in other countries (recent



- 22 -
trainees being from Korea, Indonesia, Mlalaysia, Thailand, Nigeria, Sri
Lanka). In addition to its own staff, DFI depends on outside Filipinos
and non-Filipinos, including staff from established DFCs, as visiting
lecturers. In 1977, DFI offered two project courses: a short one-month
course catering to participants from financial institutions within the
Philippines and PDCP's clients, and the usual two-months project course for
PDCP's new recruits and staff of foreign development finance companies. In
addition, several special seminars were offered.
Operating Policies and Development Strategy
3.10      PDCP's statement of General Business Policies is given in Annex
2.4. It provides for the usual financial prudence limits, portfolio diversi-
fication, protection against foreign exchange risk, criteria in processing
loan applications, dividend policies, etc. PDCP's normal exposure limit in
any single enterprise is now just over P 30 million ($4 million). The policy
statement was last amended in 1972 to emphasize PDCP's intention to increase
its assistance to small and medium sized enterprises.
3.11      Development Strategy Statement.  Following discussions with the
appraisal mission, PDCP has formulated a Development Strategy Statement
(Annex 2.5) for the next few years, which outlines specific activities and
main thrusts in its operation. The major elements of this strategy are
outlined below:
(a) Capital formation in the economy. PDCP will step up its contri-
bution to domestic capital formation by establishing higher targets
of financial assistance to productive enterprises.   Specifically,
PDCP will focus on financing BOI approved projects and will place
particular emphasis on lending to export industries, intermediate
and capital goods industries with potential for backward and forward
linkages, food production industries that help meet the basic needs
of the people and labor intensive industries for which purpose it
plans to use a portion of the proposed Bank loan for urban poverty
related projects as defined by the Bank, provided the foreign
exchange risk problem is satisfactorily resolved (see para. 4.06).
(b) Resource mobilization and capital market development. PDCP will
also endeavor to diversify its sources of foreign exchange
funds and for this purpose is currently negotiating with several
foreign commercial banks for a loan of $10 to $15 millon. PDCP has
also acquired a stock brokerage firm (see para. 3.05) which would
help it on the one hand to develop a market for issues it underwrites,
thereby directly aiding in domestic resource mobilization, and on
the other hand to promote the development of the Philippine capital
market. It is also intended that the stock brokerage firm should
be a vehicle for inducing foreign institutional investors to buy
Philippino stock and shares. Bringing into play its expertise,
track record and ability to take on direct long-term credit exposure,
PDCP will seek out mutually beneficial working arrangements with
newly established Offshore Banking and Foreign Currency Deposit
Units (see para. 2.13).



- 23 -
(c) Regional development. To support the Government's policy, PDCP will
continue to diversify its portfolio to reflect a more regionally
oriented distribution of assisted projects. For this purpose it
will expand its branch network with tentatively one or two new
branches in 1978 and five or six in 1979. After some further
studies, PDCP also plans to make additional investments in private
development banks.
(d)  Small-scale industry development.  For the purpose of encouraging
and promoting small and medium scale iLndustries, PDCP intends to
further expand its Small Business Program, started in 1972. The
accreditation to the IGLF, the earmarking of part of the proposed
Bank loan for labor intensive and small projects (see para. 4.02)
and the expansion of its branch network are specific measures and
should help PDCP achieve its objectives.
(e)  Manpower training and entrepreneural development.  Existing programs
of DFI will continue to train PDCP's own staff and to disseminate
PDCP's expertise to the private and government sector. In addition
PDCP will: offer during 1977 a public projects course, hopefully to
be repeated in the future, that intends to transfer project evaluation
technology to client firms and other f-inancial instiututions; conduct
and improve entrepreneural as-sistance workshops for the different
branch offices, and will augment the corporation's client service
facilities through increasing promotion of PDCP's consulting company.
Procedures
3.12      Project evaluation and follow-up.  PDCP's project evaluation is
generally thorough and detailed, its appraisal reports usually precise,
informative and incisive. The analyses of technical, market and financial
aspects of projects are normally complete and competent. The developmental
impact of the projects is considered in some detail and the economic rate of
return is routinely calculated. PDCP's future appraisal reports will, as
agreed with the mission, bring out more explicitly the employment impact in
terms of jobs created and, in that context will discuss the aspect of choice
of technology and cost per job.
3.13      Once the project has been approved by the Board, the Project Mlanage-
ment Group takes over, being responsible for ovearseeing procurement, arranging
disbursement, and supervising the project during construction and on comple-
tion. The extent of supervision varies from project to project. The project
supervision teams attempt to visit the project site at least once during the
construction period and receive six monthly reports from the client. Once the
project is fully operational, it is reviewed annually. Audited accounts are
also required on an annual basis. Projects with difficulties, whether during
construction or after completeion, receive closer attention, site visits and
meetings with clients being arranged whenever deemed necessary. Because of
the growing number of projects in its portfolo and number of clients facing
problems, PDCP has split the Supervision Department into two units with one
concentrating exclusively on problem projects. Through this organizational



- 24 -
change PDCP hopes, on the one hand, to be able to better focus on its problem
accounts and on the other hand to continue to give due attention to projects
which are meeting their financial commitments and reporting requirements.
3.14      Procurement and disbursement.  PDCP's procurement procedures attempt
to ensure that the equipment it finances is suitable for the clients' purposes
and is being procured at a competitive price. Disbursements are made only
after PDCP has satisfied itself that expenditures have been, or are about to be
incurred for the purposes approved, through a detailed scrutiny of supporting
documents supplemented by site inspections wherever appropriate. PDCP's
procurement and disbursement procedures are appropriate and thorough without
being unduly time consuming.
B. Operations
Summary of Operations
3.15      PDCP offers a wide range of financial services in the form of
medium and long-term loans, equity investments, provision of guarantees,
underwriting, private placement of equity and debt instruments and syndication
of loans. PDCP is also active in the short-term money market. During the
last complete year (1976), PDCP approved 58 medium- and long-term loans in the
amount of P 128.1 million, made 7 equity investments for P 6.6 million,
guaranteed the repayment of four loans amounting to P 24.2 million, under-
wrote two share issues for P 12.5 million and syndicated 3 loans totalling
P 59.4 million. The average monthly turnover of money market instruments
was P 49.9 millon. A summary of PDCP's operations since 1972 is given in
Annex 3.1.
Loan Operations
3.16      A summary of PDCP's loan operations is given in Annex 3.2  Owing to
the improved investment climate, loan approvals in 1976 (P 128.1 million)
increased by 31% over 1975 levels. Approvals in the first half of 1977 were
46% higher than those during the corresponding period in 1976, indicating
that approvals for the whole year would show a significant rise. By the end
of 1977, PDCP expects to surpass the record 1974 approvals of P 192.8 mil-
lion, which were 79% above 1973 level and 96% over 1975 level. The decline
in 1975 over 1974 resulted from a deterioration in the investment climate in
the Philippines which in turn was the result of low domestic demand and the
world wide recession. Commitments and disbursements follow the approval
pattern, but with a time lag.
3.17      During 1976, PDCP continued essentially to be a foreign exchange
lending institution with only 8% of total approvals being in domestic currency.
For the first half of 1977, however, foreign currency loans accounted for only
65% of total approvals, as a result of a rapid rise in small business loans,
which usually have very small foreign exchange requirements, and a higher
level than usual of regular domestic currency loans. Since its inception in
1972, PDCP's Small Business Program grew only slowly to reach around 5% of



- 25 -
total approvals during 1976. During the first half of 1977, however, SBP loans
accounted for 15% of total approvals. The increase was principally due to
PDCP's accreditation to the IGLF in September 1976 (see para. 3.38) which eased
the resource constraint.
3.18      Characteristics of loan portfolio.  Characteristics of PDCP's
approved loans are shown in Annex 3.3. In terms cf sectoral distribution,
PDCP's portfolio is well diversified. As of June 30, 1977, 67% of loans
outstanding went to manufacturing, 17% to transportation, mainly inter island
shipping, 6% to the electricity sector and the remaining to communication
(4%), mining (2%) and agriculture (4%). Within the manufacturing sector, the
three largest subsectors were wood and wood products (14%), textiles and
wearing apparel (14%) and chemicals (13%). There has been no discernible
shift in the industrial distribution of PDCP's loan approvals in the last few
years.
3.19      Geographically, PDCP's portfolio continues to be concentrated in
the Southern Tagalog region which comprises Greater Manila and its adjoining
areas, reflecting the heavy concentration of Philippine industry in that
region. As of June 30, 1977, 58% by number and 44% by amount of total loans
outstanding were in Southern Tagalog. This compares to about 65% and 55%
respectively for all manufacturing activities in the Philippines indicating
that PDCP has met with some success in its efforts to increase its lending to
projects located in areas other than Southern Tagalog. PDPC was able to
finance more projects outside of Greater Manila area during the past three and
a half years, as only 26% by number and 14% by amount of its approvals went
to Greater Manila compared to 48% and 30%, respectively, of loans outstanding
at June 30, 1977.
3.20      Looking at PDCP's loans by type of projects, expansion projects
continue to account for the major portion of PDCP's lending activities and
accounted for 67% of all loans outstanding as of June 30, 1977.
3.21      PDCP has attempted with considerable success, to promote new
clients.  Of the total of 406 loans approved so far, 62% have been made to new
clients, accounting for 57% of total approvals, while 92 loans (23%) are second
loans to existing clients, 36 (or 9%) are third loans and 28 (or 7%) are fourth
or more frequent loans to the same clients.
3.22      Over the past three and a half years, the average size of a PDCP
loan was P 2 million ($261,000). Loan sizes range from a high of about
$3 million to as low as less than $10,000 for sma:Ll loans under the Small
Business Program (see para. 3.24). SBP loans (be:Low P 500,000 each),
accounted for 47% of the number and 5% of the amount approved, while loans
above P 3.5 million (approximately $500,000) accounted for 18% by number
and 72% by amount of the total loans. Apart from PDCP's increased emphasis
on small loans through the SBP, there has been no clear trend in the average
size of loans which (excluding SBP loans) has fluctuated during the last four
years between a low of P 2.7 million in 1975 to a high of P 4.2 million
in 1976.



- 26 -
3.23      Over the past three and a half years, a majority of PDCP loans
(69%) had maturities between three and seven years. This is mainly due to
the fact that the maturity of SBP loans (accounting for 47% of all loans
during the period) is relatively short. PDCP's regular loans had much longer
maturities with 54% exceeding 7 years; the larger loans usually have maturities
of 10 to 12 years. The average maturity of loans approved since 1974 was 10.1
years if weighted by amount5 and 6.7 years, if weighted by the number of
loans.
3.24      PDCP's Small Business Program.  Some characteristics of loans
approved under the SBP are shown in Annex 3.4 The SBP was slow in getting
established and loan approvals were initially small. By 1975, however, half
of PDCP's loans were for small business, though they still accounted for only
4% of the amounts approved. In September 1976, PDCP obtained accreditation to
the IGLF (see para. 2.10) which largely removed the peso resource constraint.
Consequently, approvals of SBP loans rose sharply in 1976 to P 6.0 million
for 28 loans (from F 3.6 million for 21 loans in 1975) and during the first
half of 1977 reached P 11.4 million for 47 loans. As of June 30, 1977, 124
projects worth P 25.9 million had been approved under the SBP. The manufac-
turing sector (mainly food, wood based industries and metal working) accounted
for 81% of the projects approved under SBP (both by number and by amount),
with most of the other projects being agricultural. Wlile up to 1976, more
than half of small business term loans went to Manila and suburbs, only 23%
went to that area during the first half of 1977. Up to June 30, 1977 only 8%
of loan approvals were for financing foreign currency expenditures. The
average size of a loan was P 214,000 ($28,500), the average project cost
P 368,000 ($49,000). The average cost per job of 82 of the projects for
which data was available was $4,955.
Equity Investments
3.25      A summary of PDCP's equity investments since 1972 is contained in
Annex 3.5. PDCP makes equity investments usually in conjunction with its
lending operations. The objective usually is either to put companies on a
better financial footing, to help projects get off the ground, or simply to
earn a profit. Equity investments usually are outright purchases but occas-
ionally come about through conversion of debt securities. underwriting take-ups
or exercise of options. As of June 30, 1977 PDCP had 37 equity investments in
its portfolio totaling P 42.8 million (at cost). PDCP estimates the realizable
value to be P 60.3 million implying an unrealized capital gain of P 17.5
million. In the past five and a half years PDCP has sold only four investments
worth P 1.7 million on which it made a net capital gain of P 2.3 million.
Of the 37 companies in PDCP's portfolio, 16 (accounting for 20% of total equity
portfolio) are operating in the manufacturing sector, four each are in mining
(31% of total) and transport and communication (4% of total), three are in
agriculture (21% of total) and 10 are in various other sectors (13% of total),
including banking, consulting, trading and electricity.
Cuarantee Operations
3.26      On an approval basis, PDCP's guarantees have increased sharply
since 1975 when it guaranteed 4 loans of P 16 million (1974:0, 1973: one



- 27 -
guarantee of P 16 million, 1972: 0). There were four guarantees also in
1976 (F 24.2 million) and three for P 20.7 million during the first half of
1977. On a disbursed and outstanding basis, however, guarantees have come down
from 17 worth P 36.5 million in 1972 to 10 worth P 27.2 million at June 30,
1977. Of these only P 3.5 million were in domestic currency. Guarantee
clients are mostly manufacturing companies for whom PDCP guarantees the repay-
ment of suppliers credits.
Syndications and Underwritings
3.27      A summary of PDCP's syndication operations since 1972 is provided
in Annex 3.6. Since 1972 PDCP has undertaken a total of 19 syndication
operations in which it took up $18 million and P 4.3 million and syndicated
$20.2 million and P 60.5 million to other banks. The number of financial
institutions, both foreign and local, with whom PDCP syndicates loans
has grown. This trend is likely to continue given the new offshore banking
regulations (see para. 2.14).   Syndications are an indirect method of resource
mobilization and also help PDCP overcome the limiLt placed by its policy state-
ment regarding maximum exposure in a single enterprise.
3.28      PDCP's underwriting/private placement operations have been only
small being limited to one or two operations a year. They totalled 9 opera-
tions involving E 35.1 million over the past five and a half years. In
three cases of firm underwriting, PDCP was forcecd to take up P 5.2 million.
In the immediate future, no significant increase is anticipated.
lioney Market Operations
3.29      A summary of PDCP's money market operations is contained in
Annexes 3.7 and 3.8. PDCP's money market operatiLons are conducted in accord-
ance with guidelines issued by its Board. These guidelines place a limit on
PDCP's aggregate volume of short-term borrowings (presently P 150 million),
specify the companies to which PDCP can lend short term (presently 30 of the
better companies in the country), prescribe a limit on the exposure in each
approved company (ranging from P 1 million for a manufacturing enterprise to
P 30 million for PNB), and also specify the companies from which PDCP can
raise short term resources. As of June 30, 1977, PDCP's short term investment
portfolio amounted to P 47.1 million (4.9% of total assets). Of the total
amount, about 19% was in the form of bank deposits, 32% in government securi-
ties, and 12% in commercial papers purchased from primary and secondary sources,
respectively, and 3% in miscellaneous short term investments. PDCP's short
term investment portfolio has come down considerably from the very high level
in 1973, when it temporarily employed proceeds of the IFC loan to bridge the
time of drawdown and disbursement for project loans. This decline also resulted
because of increasing regulation of short-term money market and curbs on
expansion of deposit substitutes (see para. 2.17).
3.30      During the first 6 months of 1977, the total volume of PDCP's money
market operations (investments and borrowings) amounted to P 669 million,
compared to a total of P 1.4 billion for 1976 and P 1.5 billion for 1975.
The monthly average of money market investments increased during the first
half of 1977 to P 53.2 million after it had come down to P 49.9 million



- 28 -
in 1976 from P 59.0 million in 1975 and P 78.2 million in 1974. Over the
past 12 months, the monthly volume of investments ranged between a low of
P 23.2 million in August 1976 to a high of P 107.1 million in March of 1977.
Average monthly cost of borrowings ranged between a low of 11.7% in August of
1976 to a high of 15.8% in December 1976, while average monthly yields were
between 13.4% in July 1976 and 15.4% in March 1977. There were two
months (December 1976 and January 1977) when average costs were actually
higher than average yields, as financial institutions attempted to increase
their liquidity during a period of financial unrest brought about in the
money market by the collapse of one of the investment houses.
Interest Rates
3.31      A general discussion of interest rates in the Philippines is con-
tained in paras. 2.22 and 2.23. The structure of PDCP's current interest
rates and other charges is shown in Annex 3.9. As of June 30, PDCP's basic
lending rate was 12% which, except for loans under the SBP financed through
IGLF, was effectively raised through service and supervision fees of up to
2% for foreign exchange loans (with the client carrying the foreign exchange
risk) and up to 7% for domestic currency loans. Because of increasing
competition from OBUs and FCDUs (see paras. 2.13 - 2.15) PDCP lowered,
in October 1977, its basic interest rate on foreign currency loans, from 12%
p.a. to 10.5%-12.0% p.a., the higher rate being charged for longer term
and more risky loans. Considering the present level of inflation of around
7%, PDCP loan clients pay real rates which are significantly positive. The
effective average rate charged on the outstanding portfolio as of June 30,
1977 was 14.5% on domestic currency loans and 12.1% on foreign currency
loans, the overall weighted rate charged on the portfolio outstanding was
13.3%, up from 13.2% at the end of 1976 and 11.6% at the end of 1975.
C. Economic Role of PDCP
PDCP in Perspective
3.32      Apart from DBP, PDCP is presently the only specialized long term
lending institution in the Philippines. It is the only privately owned and
managed institution providing term capital to the private sector, principally
to manufacturing. While in qualitative terms PDCP has done well, its quantita-
tive contribution to total investment in the country has been small. Between
1974 and 1976 its disbursements accounted for only 1% of total fixed capital
formation in the country and the total cost of the projects it financed came
to only about 3% of all investment expenditures. PDCP's impact on the
financing of the manufacturing sector, its principal field, was considerably
larger. Between 1972 and 1974 (the last year for which comparable data was
available) its disbursements to the manufacturing sector accounted for 5% of
fixed investment in that sector while the total capital cost of the projects
it financed came to about 15% of total investment expenditures in the manufac-
turing sector. In relation to the Philippine banking system as a whole,
PDCP's operations are small. In 1976 its loans outstanding accounted for
only 2% of loans outstanding by the banking sector while its share in debt
financing by banks of the manufacturing sector came to 4%.



- 29 -
Economic Impact of PDCP Lending
3.33      As of June 30, 1976, PDCP had provided financial assistance of
P 1.6 billion (US$248 million) to 577 projects whose total investment require-
ments were P 4.6 billion (US$668 million). Of the project loans made by PDCP,
71% are dependent almost entirely on local raw materials. PDCP financed
projects are estimated to have created 35,000 jobs with an annual payroll of
P 230 million. The cost per job created is estimated to be about U$S19,0OO./1
An amount of $448 million in foreign exchange earnings and savings has been
generated by all projects assisted by PDCP since 1963. With negative effects
totaling about US$99 million, the net positive impact on the Philippines
Balance of Payments is estimated to be $348 million so far.
Regional Dispersal of Loans
3.34      In recent years PDCP has made a conscious effort to direct its
lending to areas other than Southern Tagalog, which comprises Greater Manila
and its adjoining areas. To support its efforts, PDCP has established branches
in Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu and most recently in Iloilo, it has also made
equity investments in two private development banks, and committed to invest
in two more. By participating in PDBs, PDCP will. have increased access to
project opportunities in the areas served by the PDBs and will augment the
sources of credit available to small-scale enterprises in these areas. PDCP
hopes that joint-financing arrangements with PDBs will help to broaden the
regional distribution of PDCP's investments and reduce the cost of evaluation
and supervision of small industry loans in remote areas. While a major shift
in the geographic distribution of PDCP's portfolio will take time, PDCP's
efforts are already beginning to show positive results: over the past three
and a half years, 46% by number and 37% by amount of PDCP's loans went to
Southern Tagalog, considerably less when compared. with 58% and 44%, respec-
tively, of PDCP's outstanding portfolio.
Economic Profile of a Sample of PDCP-Financed Projects
3.35      Annex 4.1 gives a summary of economic indicators of a sample of 106
PDCP projects financed since 1970./2 The sample is representative of PDCP's
sectoral diversification, but does not include ma,ny very small projects.
It includes all 66 projects financed with the Bank's most recent two loans
(630-PH and 1052-PH), 16 projects with loans exce!eding $500,000 and completed
since January 1974, and 24 other projects for which relevant information was
available. From this sample analysis, it emerges' that PDCP typically financed
a large share of the foreign exchange component c,f medium to large sized
projects that are usually based on the use of locally available raw material,
show good financial and particularly economic returns on investment and which
have a wide range of capital cost per job created.. The various partial
economic indicators give the following picture:
/1 BOI projects approved between 1968 and 1972 showed an average cost per
job figure of around US$30,000.
/2 The sample accounted for one third by number and two thirds by amount of
all projects approved by PDCP during this period.



- 30 -
(a) Internal Rates of Return./_ The FRR was calculated for 100 and
the ERR for 54 of the projects. Rates of return calculations for
24 projects were based on revised estimates of projects that had
been in operation for at least one year. The average FRR was 30%
ranging from a low of 7% to a high of 80% and the average ERR was
43% ranging from a low of 13% for a textile plant that had start-up
difficulties to 134% for a wood based project. The high average
ERR indicates that the projects financed had either little protec-
tion, were largely based on local raw materials or were producing
for exports and were thus efficient by international standards so
that the inherent advantages of Philippine industrial production
were fully realized. A comparison of the revised rates of return
of projects in operation (see Annex 4.2) shows that while a few
original estimates were too optimistic, they were in most cases not
far below the revised estimates based on actual data. The rates of
return figures indicate that by and large PDCP made the right
investment decisions.
(b) Size of companies financed. Forty percent of the companies financed
had total assets exceeding $5 million, 24% had total assets of less
than $1 million, and the average size of total assets was $6.4 mil-
lion. Bank financed projects in the sample were one-third smaller
than other projects, though it is not clear whether there was a
causal relationship. Fifty-two percent of the sample projects
had less than 200 employees while 18% had over 1,000 while the
average size was 544 employees.
(c) Project cost and PDCP financing. Thirty-one percent of the
projects had total project cost exceeding $5 million, while 22%
cost less than $500,000, with the average project costing $2.2
million. The need of funds for some projects was so large (up to
$17 million) that, because of its limited lending capacity (maximum
allowable loan size is about $4 million, insufficient domestic
currency resources), PDCP could finance only a small part of the
total cost; the average proportion financed by PDCP was only 34%
of total project cost. Its average share in foreign currency
financing was naturally much higher than its domestic currency
financing .(-59% of foreign currency cost versus 11% of domestic
currency cost).
(d) Export intensity. A good proportion of PDCP's clients are in non-
exporting sectors such as inter-island shipping, communications,
electricity, etc. This is also reflected in the sample analysis
which shows that 51 of the 101 projects in the sample did not export.
However, the export performance has been good of those projects
where export element is relevant. Thus, most sample projects in
the manufacturing sector had at least some exports; 46% of them
exported more than half of their output (principally textile and
wood based projects).
/1 In its rate of return calculations, PDCP uses guidelines prepared by the
Bank for use by dfcs.



- 31 -
(e) Cost per job created. While PDCP has financed some very capital
intensive projects such as sugar refineries, basic chemicals and
basic metals, it has been financing an increasing number of highly
labor intensive projects with low cost per job created (see the
following section). Thus, while 38% of the sample projects had
cost per job of over $20,000, there were also 20 projects (20%)
that had cost per job figures of less than $3,000 and the average
of the projects in the sample was $14,600, which is not high for
industry by Philippine standards.
The Small Business Program
3.36      As a result of a policy decision to give more emphasis to lending
to small businesses, PDCP established the Small Business Program (SBP) in
1972. PDCP adopted the Government's definition cf small business as one with
total assets of less than P 1 million and requiring assistance of not more
than P 300,000. However, in September 1976, when PDCP was accredited to
the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund Scheme, the limit on the amount of
assistance to be provided under SBP was raised to P 500,000 to correspond
with IGLF regulation.
3.37      Organizationally, the SBP has a Head Office staff of six.  This unit
identifies and appraises small business projects and presents them to the
Staff Investment Committee (SIC) for approval. PDCP's four regional branches
are also active in identifying and appraising small business projects in
their respective regions. In these cases, project reports are sent to Head
Office for comments and SIC approval. To date, t:he SBP has operated as a
unit separate from the regular appraisal department as PDCP feels the needs
of the small entrepreneur are very different from those of its larger clients.
3.38      The SBP was slow in getting established and loan approvals were
initially small. By 1975, however, half of PDCP"s loans were for small
businesses, though they still accounted for only 4% of the amounts approved.
In September 1976, PDCP was accredited to the IGLF which partially removed the
peso resource constraint, the major obstacle to an expansion of PDCP's
SBP. It now appears that PDCP's considerable investment of money and staff
resources in its SBP will start bringing returns: during the first half of
1977, PDCP approved 47 small business term loans (72% of all term loans)
totaling P 11.4 million (15% of all loans approved). Since the time it
was accredited, PDCP has become the largest user of IGLF funds. PDCP now has
the potential, provided the right resource mix is available, to have a con-
siderable impact on helping small businesses get off the ground, thereby pro-
viding job opportunities to the poorer segment oE the Philippine population.
3.39      As of June 30, 1977, 124 projects wortlh P 25.9 million had been
approved under the SBP. Eighty-one percent of tlhe projects (by number and
amount) were in the manufacturing sector; most of the others were agricultural
(mainly livestock/ poultry). While up to 1976, more than half of small busi-
ness term loans went to Manila and suburbs, the first half of 1977 showed a
reversal of this concentration as only 23% went to Manila and suburbs. Up to
June 30, 1977, only 8% of loan approvals were for financing foreign currency
expenditures. Fifty-seven percent of the loans had maturities between five



- 32 -
and seven years. The average size of a loan was P 214,000 ($28,500) and the
average project cost P 368,000 ($49,000). The average cost per job of 82
of the projects, for which data was avaialble, was $4,955, which compares
with the Bank's cut-off point for urban poverty directed lending of $3,560 in
1976 prices.
Resource Mobilization
3.40      PDCP's resource mobilization efforts have to be viewed in the
context of macroeconomic situation as brought out in Chapter 2. There
have been severe constraining factors inhibiting PDCP from raising resources
directly - both in foreign as well as domestic currency - in the capital
markets in the form of long-term bonds and debentures. In effect, the
principal reason has been the unavailability of long-term resources at a
cost which would have enabled PDCP to lend them at a reasonable positive
spread. PDCP has however continually explored ways to augment its long-term
resources, with some success It has had better success in indirect resource
mobilization e.g. through underwriting operations, syndications etc.
3.41      Foreign currency resources.  Up to June 30, 1977, PDCP had obtained
a total of US$182.1 million in foreign currency resources, 91% of which came
from the Bank ($95 million) and ADB ($70 million), the remainder from IFC
($15 million) and DEG ($2 million), the German Development Organization.
Repeated attempts by PDCP to raise funds from foreign commercial sources
were not successful in the past, because it found that medium- and long-term
funds at acceptable cost (including the withholding tax) were simply not
available. With increased international liquidity and the general downward
drift of interest rates since the beginning of 1977, however, PDCP has now
been able to arrange a loan of $10 million from commercial sources on satis-
factory terms.
3.42      Domestic currency resources.  PDCP's domestic currency long-term
resources have come primarily from share capital increases and retained
earnings which accounted for 76% of total domestic currency long term
resources, and from a long term low interest subordinated AID loan (16%).
Long-term domestic currency resources also include P 12.8 million (8%) in
long-term deposits which PDCP required from some of its foreign exchange loan
clients who would otherwise have exceeded PDCP's exposure limits of lending
to individual clients.  In an innovative deal to raise long-term peso re-.1irce.
PDCP sold in November 1976, without recourse, accounts receivable amounting to
P 7.9 million to the Family Savings Bank (FSB). The notes sold had maturi-
ties between 1 and 5 years and PDCP paid 16% p.a. for FSB's advances. PDCP
had made arrangements with FSB to sell additional notes in mid-1977. This new
deal, however, was shelved, at least temporarily, because of the 35% with-
holding tax (see para. 2.21) which the Government imposed in June 1977, since it
was not clear whether the sale of the notes receivable would be liable to
such a tax. Similarly, PDCP had planned to issue 3 to 5 year bonds in the
domestic market during the second half of 1977. PDCP has temporarily halted
its preparation of the bond issue until it becomes clear whether the 35%
withholding tax would be applicable. As another way of raising domestic
currency resources, PDCP is seriously considering a planned sale of some of



- 33 -
its equity investments. For this purpose, PDCP is working on a stock disposal
program which forsees the sale of shares of 19 of the 37 companies in its equity
portfolio over the next 18 months. The investments in the 19 companies were
chosen on the basis of specific criteria: (a) that PDCP's "seasoning"
function has been achieved, (b) that the market prices for securities are at
reasonable levels; and (c) that losses should be taken on investments in
companies whose projects have proved to be failures.
3.43      Apart from raising resources directly for its own account, PDCP
has been able to mobilize resources indirectly by inducing its clients to
increase the proportion of this equity financing in total project cost. PDCP
has also been active in assisting clients through loan syndications (21 cases
totaling $26.8 million and P 71.3 million) and has underwritten, or placed
privately, shares and bonds for 21 clients totaling P 61.5 million.
Other Developmental Activities
3.44      PDCP is engaged in several other developmental activities.  Its
Economic and Corporate Research Unit, in addition to providing advice and
guidance to PDCP's clients, publishes a monthly and a quarterly economic
review which is widely circulated. In addition, it has carried out and
published on a regular basis, studies on such diverse sectors as wood based
industries, commercial deep sea fishing. industrial alcohols and the electric
power industry. The DFI provides valuable trainiLng facilities (ses para. 3.09).
The Bank has also used PDCP frequently as trainirng ground for staff of other
Bank assisted DFC's in areas in which PDCP's know-how is considered particu-
larly strong (e.g. follow-up). PDCP has always been extremely cooperative in
receiving Bank-recommended candidates. At the request of the Government and
jointly with it, PDCP also organizes special conferences and hosts important
foreign delegations to the Philippines. The conference to attract private
investment in the Philippines organized in 1974 and held in Paris and the
hosting of the French Mlachinery Suppliers' Mission jointly with the Government
are particularly worth noting. PDCP's President has frequently accompanied
Philippine investment and trade promotion missionIs overseas. Finally,
Mr. Jayme, PDCP's President, was elected as the first Chairman of the Asso-
ciation of Development Finance Institutions in Asia and the Pacific in
recognition of PDCP's active role in the Association's creation.
D.   Financial Condition, Operational Performance,
Quality of Portfolio and Resource Position
Financial Condition
3.45      Composition of assets and liabilities.  Summarized audited Balance
Sheets for the period 1972 - June 30, 1977 are shown in Annex 5.1. During
the past four and a half years, PDCP's total assets grew at an average
annual rate of 13.8% and reached P 856.6 million as at June 30, 1977. The
growth rate has considerably slowed down during the last 18 months reflecting
the lower business volume since 1975 (see para. 1.06). As of June 30, 1977,



- 34 -
the single largest component of assets was, as is to be expected, the long
term loan and equity portfolio, which, net of current receivables (included
in current assets) and provisions for doubtful accounts, accounted for 68.2%
of total assets. Current assets accounted for 29.3% of which 16.9% was in
the form of current portion of loans receivable. Bank deposits and invest-
ments in bonds, notes and stocks, which represent PDCP's short term money-
market oriented portfolio, accounted for only 5.9% of total assets, declining
steadily from the high level of 23.8% in 1973.
3.46      Over the past four and a half years, the composition of liabilities
and equity has remained fairly stable. Long-term borrowings in foreign currency
(from the Bank Group and ADB) accounted for 72.2% of total liabilities while
long-term borrowings in domestic currency (AID and compensatory advances from
clients; see para. 3.42) accounted for 5.5%. Short-term liabilities accounted
for 22.3% of total liabilities; current portion of loans payable was 55.9% of
the short-term liabilities. PDCP's short-term placements were fully covered
(104.6%) by cash and short-term investments.
3.47      Capital structure and liquidity.  At the time of PDCP's establishment
in 1963, the Bank Loan Agreement set a maximum long-term debt/equity ratio
limit of 3:1. This ratio has, over time, been increased to the present 8:1.
Over the period 1972 - June 30, 1977, the debt/equity ratio, as defined in the
Bank Loan Agreements, has ranged between 4.5 in 1972 and 5.8 in 1974 and stood at
5.0 at June 30, 1977, mainly as a result of an increase in PDCP's paid in
capital in 1976. According to PDCP's projections (see para. 3.71), the debt/equity
limit would not be exceeded until 1981 and no increase in the debt/equity
ratio is therefore necessary, nor is recommended, at this time.
3.48      PDCP is subject to two limitations on its short-term indebtedness.
The Bank Loan Agreement provides that "short-term debt" should not exceed
twice the amount of PDCP's capital and reserves. The IFC Loan Agreement
provides that PDCP's "net liquid assets" should not be below 4% of its total
assets. The actual position over the last five years has been as follows:
1972    1973    1974    1975    1976
Short-term debt/equity   0.43    1.00    0.62    0.67    0.58
Net liquidity ratio       6.80%   5.66%   4.51%   7.00%   9.49%
As the above figures indicate, PDCP has been well within the prescribed
limits.  As a result of the experience gained during the last three years
during which PDCP's overdues increased (see para. 3.51), it was felt that
the requirement on maintaining a minimum liquidity position needed to be
redefined to make it more meaningful. The main difference in the defini-
tion currently used and that proposed and accepted by PDCP is to exclude
from current assets accounts receivable (including interest receivable)
which are overdue and have remained unpaid beyond a certain period. Over-
due and unpaid accounts receivable (including accrued interest) are included
in current assets for the purpose of calculating the present liquidity
ratios. The refinement is to exclude overdue accounts receivable (including
accrued interest) which are unpaid for more than 180 days on the grounds
that such unpaid balances cannot be considered as readily convertible into



- 35 -
cash. More specifically, PDCP has agreed to adopt the following two
additional guidelines:
(a) PDCP shall always maintain a liquid position. "Positioning"
(i.e. taking a variety of unmatched short-term borrowing and
lending maturities) may be undertaken but, in aggregate, the
current assets shall always exceed the current liabilities by at
least a margin of 15%, i.e., a current liquidity ratio of at least
1.15 shall be maintained at all times. In calculating the aggre-
gate amount of current assets for this purpose, the amount of
principal and interest receivable which has been overdue and
remained unpaid for more than 180 days shall be excluded.
(b) PDCP shall always maintain a minimum debt service and interest
cover of 1.1 times. In calculating this ratio, interest receivable
which has been overdue and remained unpaid for more than 180 days
shall be excluded from income.
Operational Performance
3.49      PDCP's summarized audited Income Statements for the years 1972-76
and the first half of 1977 (unaudited) are shown in Annex 5.2. During 1976,
profit before tax and provision reached-d 31.5 million or 3.5% of average
total assets, having come down from 4.7% in 1972. PDCP made a net profit in
1976, of P 19 million, or 16.7% of average equity, compared to a high of
17.9% in 1972 and 1974. Earnings per share reached P 3.14 (P 10 par value),
down from P 3.64 in 1975, due to the capital increase in 1976. Interest
income from long-term loans remains the principal source of income (91.4% of
total). Income from short-term money market operations has declined in
relative importance in the last few years. Between 1972 and 1976, income
from term loans as percent of average term loans outstanding has ranged
between 11.6% (1972 and 1974) to 13% (1976) and, after deducting the cost
of term debt, has resulted in a gross spread of 3.5% to 4.1%. Financial
expenses accounted for 80.9% of total expenses in 1976, mostly in the form
of interest and bank charges. Between 1972 and 1976, administrative expenses
rose from P 4.7 million to P 13.8 million or from 1.0% of average total
assets to 1.6%. The principal reasons for the higher administrative expenses
are the increased cost associated with branch operations and small business
lending and the very slow growth in assets during the last 18 months. PDCP's
operational results for the first half of 1977 (unaudited) were in line with
those of 1976.
Quality of Portfolio
3.50      Loan Portfolio.  Various aspects of the quality of PDCP's loan
portfolio at the end of June 30, 1977 in comparison with the preceeding three
and a half years are shown in Annexes 5.3 through 5.7. Of the 203 companies in
PDCP's portfolio with principal outstanding of P 696.8 million, 74 companies



- 36 -
were still in grace period (principal outstanding of P 204 million or 29% of
the total) and 69 companies were paying regularly (principal outstanding of
P 341.6 million or 49% of the total). There were 54 companies in arrears /1
of principal and/or interest totalling P 29.4 million, or 4.2% of total loans
outstanding. The principal outstanding of the 54 companies was P 135.8 million
or 19.5% of total loan portfolio. Of the 54 clients in arrears, 35 were
regular clients accounting for 96% of arrears while 19 received loans under
the SBP. Foreclosure proceedings were underway against 6 companies with
principal outstanding of P 15.4 million (2.2% of total). As of June 30, 1977,
there were 29 companies (principal outstanding of P 66.8 million or 9.6% of
total) which had principal and/or interest payments in arrears for more than
12 months with actual arrears of P 15.8 million or 38.3% of all arrears.
During the past 18 months PDCP rescheduled loans to 5 companies with total
exposure (principal plus interest) of P 45.5 million. To date PDCP did not
have to writeoff any loans as it has been able to fully collect on all loans
foreclosed.
3.51      PDCP's arrears have been relatively high in the last few years.
The outstanding principal amount affected by arrears has ranged between
14.0% and 21.9% during the 1972-76 period; portfolio affected by arrears as
of June 30, 1977 was 19.5%. Because of intensified efforts by PDCP to
collect, actual arrears were lower at June 30, 1977, compared with those
at the end of 1976 and 1975. The age structure of arrears has also improved
considerably in the last 18 months: only 38% of arrears were overdue for more
than 12 months as compared to 68% at end-1976 and 50% at end-1975.
3.52      According to a recent PDCP evaluation of its loan portfolio as of
June 30, 1977, 9 of the 35 regular loans and 10 of the 19 small business loans
were judged to be problem projects. While PDCP expects that 6 of the 9 regular
and 5 of the 10 SBP projects are still viable, it feels that the other projects
hnay have to be foreclosed. The 19 problem projects have total arrears of
P 20.1 million (70% of total arrears) involving a portfolio of P 51.5 mil-
lion (37.9% of total principal affected or 7.4% of total principal outstanding).
Loans which PDCP thinks it may have to foreclose had arrears of P 7.2 million
(25% of total arrears) involving a portfolio of P 11.6 million (8.5% of
total principal affected or 1.7% of total principal outstanding). In all
cases but one, the conservatively estimated collateral value was sufficient to
cover PDCP's exposure.
3.53      Causes of arrears.  An analysis of PDCP's 20 largest clients in
arrears which accounted for 89% of arrears as of June 30, 1977 reveals a
variety of problems faced by PDCP clients over which they have sometimes no
control. The most frequent cause of delays in repayments has been a deteri-
oration in the external market situation to which some of PDCP's clients are
very vulnerable. Particularly hard hit in this respect were PDCP's clients
in the wood based industry who came under tremendous pressure after 1973 and
only now are recovering slowly. While exporting clients were susceptible to
the world wide recession, producers for the domestic market were faced with
/1 Loans are considered in arrears if amounts are overdue for more than three
months.



- 37 -
different problems. One was the initial difficulty penetrating the domestic
market, which has particularly affected the producers of more technology
oriented products, as they often had, in the absence of high protection, to
compete with low import prices. Some of PDCP's clients in the power sector
were adversely affected when the Government decided to take over some
generating facilities causing uncertainties between the time of takeover
planning, negotiations and implementation. Another industry facing problems
beyond its control is the fishing industry which has badly suffered from the
oil price hikes. There is one large client in PD'CP's portfolio accounting
for 14% of arrears, which found that its liability to PDCP has increased
three times because of revaluation of the deutsche mark and devaluation of
the peso. No loss is expected, however, as the company has been operating
profitably. /l
3.54      Summary evaluation.  The appraisal mission analysed and discussed
in detail with PDCP's management and staff all accounts in arrears. PDCP's
staff was fully aware of all aspects of the problems involved, thorough in
analysis and innovative in finding solutions and pragmatic in implementing
agreed action programs. It was reassuring that PDCP's senior staff and
management give close personal attention to difficult projects. While being
very selective with reschedulings but not hesitant to take drastic actions
like going to court and foreclosing mortgages in appropriate cases, PDCP
gets closely involved in the decision making process of many companies and
is very active in finding new sponsors, including from abroad, who are thought
to be well qualified to assist or take over projects in difficulties. Organi-
zationally, PDCP has recently split the Supervision Department into two units
(see para. 3.13) with one concentrating exclusively on problem projects. PDCP
has also acquired a management consulting company (see para. 3.06) which it
hopes will be of help, inter alia, in solving serious management and organiza-
tional problems faced by some clients.
3.55      In evaluating PDCP's arrears statistically, it should be remembered,
to provide perspective, that PDCP's arrears are simall in relation to those
of most other financial institutions in the Philippines. Secondly, PDCP
has been very stringent with loan rescheduling. Thirdly, the arrears reflect
at least to a certain extent, PDCP's philosophy as a development bank of
accepting financial risk when projects seem econoimically attractive. Fourthly,
PDCP's actual loss record has been excellent so far - there have been no
write-offs on its loan portfolio and even in cases of foreclosures, PDCP
recovered all its outstandings. Finally, PDCP's provisions for loan losses,
which stood at P 17.1 million at June 30, 1977, appear to be adequate, a
judgment supported by independent auditors. PDCP's loan portfolio, in
summary, continues to be sound.
3.56      Equity and guarantee portfolio.  Annex 5.8 shows PDCP's equity
portfolio as of June 30, 1977. As of that date, PDCP had 37 companies in its
portfolio with total investments amounting to P 42.8 million (or 6% of total

of Loan 467-PH, so far has already repaid mor,e than twice the amount
originally borrowed in peso terms.



- 38 -
loan portfolio). According to PDCP, the realizable value is P 60.3 million.
It is difficult to judge the accuracy of this estimate as only 11 of the 37
companies are presently listed. A provision of P 1.25 million or 3% of the
equity portfolio has been made for possible decline in the value of total
investments, which the auditors consider adequate. Of the 37 companies in
PDCP's portfolio, 16 were operating profitably in 1976, while 12 were operating
at a loss; 3 companies had temporarily halted operations while six were still
in preoperational stage. Overall the investment portfolio looks sound, reflec-
ting basically PDCP's twin objective of commercial profitability and helping
worthwhile projects get off the ground.
3.57      As of June 30, 1977, PDCP had 10 guarantees to 8 companies totalling
P 27.2 million. All of the guarantees were extended to PDCP loan clients,
mostly in conjunction with a loan. So far, PDCP has been asked to step
in and honor its guarantee three times, paying an amount of P 1.8 million.
PDCP is in the process of restructuring the accounts of the two companies
involved and does not expect to suffer any losses from its guarantee portfolio.
Resource Position
3.58      Domestic currency resources.  PDCP's resource position as of June 30,
1977, is shown in Annex 5.9. As of that date PDCP had long term domestic
currency resources of P 166.4 million, comprising P 128.7 million in
equity, P 27.5 million in a subordinated loan from AID and P 12.8 million in
long term borrowings in the form of compensatory deposits of foreign exchange
loan clients who would otherwise have exceeded PDCP's exposure limits of
lending to individual clients. Of total resources, P 34.0 million was
available for new commitments, and P 10.1 million for new approvals. PDCP
has had limited success in mobilizing long-term peso resources owing to the
structure of the Philippine capital market, prevailing interest rates and the
statutory ceiling imposed on PDCP's lending rates. Increases in PDCP's long
term resources have primarily come from periodic share capital increases and
retention of profits though recently, in November, 1976, PDCP was able to
sell, without recourse, accounts receivable amounting to P 7.9 million to
the Family Savings Bank (see para. 3.42).
3.59      Foreign currency resources.  PDCP's long-term foreign currency
resources comprise four loans from the Bank totalling $95.0 million, four
loans from ADB for $70 million, a $15 million loan from IFC and a $2.1 mil-
lion loan from DEG, the German Development Organization. As of June 30, 1977,
$136.9 had been committed, leaving $45.2 million for further commitment of
which $14.1 million had been already approved by PDCP's Board leaving
$31.1 million for further approvals. Repeated attempts by PDCP to raise
funds from foreign commercial sources were not successful in the past,
because it found that medium- to long-term funds at acceptable interest
rates in relation to its lending rates were simply not available. Since the
beginning of this year, however, PDCP again has been exploring the possibility
to borrow from foreign commercial sources and it has now been able to arrange,
for the first time, to raise a foreign commercial loan of $10millionin con-
junction with the proposed Bank loan.

E. Prospects
General Outlook
3.60      During 1977, the manufacturing sector is expected to achieve a
growth of 7-8%. The lackluster performance of the manufacturing sector
over the past few years was due to slow growth of domestic demand and slow
recovery of the economies of Philippines' major trading partners. It is
expected that with stabilizing terms of trade, consumption demand would
revive in 1978 giving the necessary impulse to the manufacturing sector
resulting in its faster growth. Concomitantly, investments in durable equip-
ment that were at low levels since mid 1975 following the investment boom of
1974/75, are expected to rebound.
3.61      Over the medium to long term, the Government is committed to a
strategy that includes emphasis on accelerated industrialization, both
in capital-intensive basic industries and labor-intensive export indus-
tries. The performance of the industrial sector will have to be signifi-
cantly improved if the Philippines is to be reasonably successful in easing
the foreign exchange constraint and particularly in expanding productive
employment as at least 75,000 jobs a year will need to be provided by the
industrial sector by the early 1980s. To achieve these targets the
Philippines will need to expand investment in export industries and in a
wide range of intermediate goods industries where domestic demand prospects
are reasonably good. According to the provisional five-year Plan 1978-1982,
manufacturing is expected to grow at an annual rate of 9% over the five-year
period. To achieve this target, investments will have to grow by 15.5% p.a.
between 1978 and 1982 to total P 86 billion, of which about 65% would go
to larger industries.
Business Forecast
3.62      Although PDCP's lending in domestic currency for small industries
is expected to increase, its main business has been, and will continue to be,
lending in foreign currency for medium to large industries. In the last
several years, the demand for foreign exchange funds has been increasingly
generated by investment projects approved by th,e Board of Investment (BOI).
PDCP has assumed therefore that it will derive its foreign exchange loan
business principally from the investment projects approved by BOI. The
amount of foreign exchange funds in non-equity form needed by BOI investment
projects has increased, on a cumulative basis, from US$393 million in 1970
to an estimated US$2.2 billion in 1976. PDCP's share in this "market" has
varied from a low of 6% in 1974 to a high of 12% in 1973 during the period
1970-76. for the latest year, PDCP's share was an estimated 7%.
3.63      PDCP estimates, on the basis of BOI statistics on planned investment
and the Survey of Investment Behavior conducted by its own Economic and
Research Department, that BOI approved projects will, in 1977, increase only
marginally to US$2.8 billion, Thereafter PDCP expects the historic annual
growth rate of 25% to be maintained until 1981.  The annual "market" for
PDCP's foreign exchange lending is estimated to be $542 million, US$822 mil-
lion, US$1,301 million, US$1,294 million and US$1,623 million for the



- 40 -
period 1977 to 1981. Although PDCP's annual approvals are expected to
increase in absolute terms, PDCP expects its share of the market to show a
decline.
3.64      PDCP has estimated its share in the domestic currency market in
similar fashion. In the past, its share of domestic currency investment
generated by BOI approved investments has ranged from 13% in 1975 to 24% in
1972; in 1976, PDCP's share was an estimated 14%. PDCP estimates that the
"?market" for domestic currency in 1977 will amount to P 404 million
increasing to P 1,451 million in 1981. PDCP expects its share in the
domestic currency market to stabilize at around 24%, including guarantees,
equity investments, underwritings and syndications, a level which seems
optimistic, and around 7% if only domestic currency loans and equity invest-
ments are taken into account, a level which is attainable if PDCP is success-
ful in raising domestic currency resources.
3.65      PDCP's forecast of approvals for 1977 through 1981 is given below
with details in Annex 6.1.

3.66      The forecast of loan approvals in 1977 is based on the results of
the first half of the year and on the project pipeline as of June 30, 1977.
According to this pipeline, which was thoroughly reviewed by the appraisal
mission, PDCP had 41 applications pending at various stages of appraisal,
totaling resource requirements of $46.8 million and P 39.3 million. The
forecast of approvals for subsequent years is based on a 20% annual rate of
growth. PDCP's business forecast for the next few years, though optimistic,
should be attainable from an institutional view point.
Resource Requirements
3.67      Assuming that the projected volume of lending and equity investments
is realized (and assuming all underwriting operations are successful), PDCP's
total resource needs for the period 1977-81 would amount to P 1,978 million.
Of this amount, US$212 million would be in foreign currency, the remaining
P 388 million being in domestic currency.



- 41 -
3.68      Foreign currency resources.  Over the two and a half year period,
July 1, 1977 - December 30, 1979, PDCP would require foreign currency resources
of US$97 million to meet its projected business. As of June 30, 1977, PDCP
had foreign exchange resources of US$31 million available for further approvals.
These consisted principally of the balance of the last IBRD loan ($7.3 million)
and the fourth ADB loan ($24 million). In order to meet its target of US$97
million in foreign exchange lending in 1977-79, PDCP will, therefore, require
US$66 million in additional foreign exchange resources. PDCP hopes to raise
additional resources through fith and sixth IB1D Loans in 1978 and 1979
($30 million and $35 million) a fifth ADB loan late in 1978 or early 1979 ($30
million), and commercial borrowings in 1978 and 1979 ($15 million each). If
all these loans were to materialize, and if PDCP's projected volume of
business is achieved, then PDCP would start 1980 with $54 million available
for new approvals. However, it is likely that some of the loans may slip
(e.g. it is unlikely that there will be a new Bank loan in calendar 1979).
In any case, PDCP expects that it would run out of its presently available
resources by the second quarter of 1978. The proposed Bank loan is, there-
fore, timely and its commitment on subprojects is expected to start almost
immediately after its effectiveness.
3.69      Domestic currency resources.  For the period 1977-1979, PDCP would
require P 194 million to finance its domestic currency loans and equity
investments. As of June 30, 1977, PDCP had P 34 million uncommitted domestic
currency resources for long-term investments so that it would need to raise
P 160 million in new resources to achieve its lending targets. It expects
to finance these requirements from retained earnings, net collections and
borrowings.
Projected Financial Condition and Performance
3.70      The projected Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Cash Flow
Statements for the period 1977-1981 are given in Annexes 6.2 through 6.4
respectively. Total assets are projected to increase from P 989 million in
1977 to P 2,322 million in 1981 or an annual average growth rate of 24%
p.a. The net long term loan portfolio is projected to increase from P 633
million to P 1,665 million. The ratio of term portfolio to total assets
was 64% at the end of 1976 and is projected to be 72% at the end of 1981.
3.71      Total long term debt is projected to increase from P 605 million
in 1977 to P 1,653 million in 1981, while shareholders' equity is projected
to increase from P 135 million in 1977 to P 259 million in 1981. The
increase of P 124 million is accounted for by an increase in retained
earnings of P 104 million and a share capital increase of P 20 million
scheduled for 1981. The total debt equity ratio is projected to increase
from 6.3 in 1977 to 8.0 in 1981, while the debt-equity ratio as defined in
the Bank Loan Agreement would increase from 5.1 in 1977 to 7.9 in 1981
(maximum allowed is 8:1). Assuming no signifiLcant increase in overdues, the
current ratio and net liquidity ratio are also projected to remain within the
new limits agreed with PDCP (see para. 3.48).



- 42 -
Earnings Forecast and Debt Service Coverage
3.72      PDCP's net earnings after tax are projected to increase from
P 23.1 million in 1977 (actual net profit in 1976 was P 18.9 million) to
P 50.0 million in 1981. Income from loans and short term investments are
projected to be 79% and 16% of total revenue in 1977 and 83% and 13% in 1981.
Financial expenses are projected to be 77% of total expenses in 1977 and 80%
in 1981. Profit before tax and provisions as a percentage of average total
assets is estimated to vary between 4.0 to 4.2 (it was 3.6% in 1976). Net
income (after tax and provisions) as a percentage of average equity is pro-
jected to increase from 17.9 in 1977 to 21.6 in 1981. The debt-service
cover appears adequate and is projected to vary between 1.26 and 1.30 during
the 1977-81 period. Forecast Indicators of Financial Performance are contained
in Annex 6.5.
4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Objectives of the Proposed Loan
4.01      The proposed loan of US$30 million will be the fifth Bank loan to
PDCP. The proposed loan will serve the purpose of resource transfer to pro-
vide scarce foreign exchange for the important industrial sector. PDCP has
demonstrated ability to perform the resource allocation function in an
effective and efficient manner and the proposed loan would enable the Bank to
help finance a fairly large number of economically desirable and financially
viable small, medium, and medium-to-large scale projects, mostly in the
manufacturing industry.
4.02      A special feature of the proposed loan is to use it as a
catalyst for the mobilization of complementary external medium term funds
from private financial institutions through co-financing arrangement. More
specifically, PDCP has made arrangements to secure a loan of US$10 million
from private commercial sources in conjunction with the proposed Bank loan.
The terms and conditions of the private commercial loan have already been
agreed between the lender and PDCP.
Expected Utilization of the Proposed Loan
4.03      The proposed loan will meet a part of PDCP's needs for long-term
capital to meet its projected commitments during 1978 and 1979. PDCP will
utilize the proceeds to finance the foreign exchange needs of its subprojects.
Disbursements of funds from the proposed loan for subprojects would normally
be to finance 100% of foreign currency expenditures for direct imports.
PDCP would also be allowed to use the proceeds for financing indirect
imports i.e. the foreign exchange component in off-the-shelf purchases of
machinery and equipment. Estimated disbursement schedule of the proposed
loan is given in Annex 7.



- 43 -
4.04      As in the case of the previous four loans, the proposed fifth loan
to PDCP will be made to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) for use by PDCP,
because the Government may guarantee a loan to a government institution
only. PNB will charge PDCP a service fee of 0.75% p.a., the same as in the
past. It is expected that most of the subloans will have maturity periods
ranging between 5 and 12 years. The amortization schedule between PDCP and
the Bank will approximately reflect the aggregate of the amortization
schedules between PDCP and the subborrowers. A maximum grace period of five
years has been agreed because PDCP may finance some projects using both the
Bank and commercially raised funds; a longer grace period should enable PDCP
to use the commercial funds effectively. PDCP is expected to charge interest
at the rate of 12.5-14% (including all service fees) for its foreign currency
loans, with the borrowers assuming the exchange risk, as at present. PDCP
may, therefore, get a maximum gross spread of up to 5% on Bank funds; the
average spread will be lower and is considered appropriate. PDCP's current
"free limit" is US$1.5 million; no increase is recommended. As in the case
of the fourth loan, there will be a limit of US$2.5 million on the maximum
size of a single subloan.
Agreements Reached During Negotiations
4.05      During negotiations, agreements were reached with PDCP regarding:
(a)  the maintenance of a current liquidity ratio of
at least 1.15 as defined in para. 3.48;
(b)  the maintenance of a debt service and interest cover
of at least 1.1 times, as defined in para. 3.48;
(c) its future appraisal reports that they will deal
explicitly with the aspect of employment creation and
the impact that its investments will have on employ-
ment, and in that context to discuss the implications
of choice of appropriate technology (see para. 3.12).
Recommendation
4.06      A loan of US$30 million is recommended for use by PDCP, to finance
a number of small, medium and medium-to-large subprojects, mostly in the manu-
facturing sector.

PHILIPPIINES
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
General Business Policies
(Adopted by the Board on MIarch 10, 1964 and amended by Board
Resolutions No. 264-66 on July 15, 1966, No. 333-68 on
January 16, 1968; No. 456-70 on June 19, 1970; and No. 559-72
on September 12, 1972.)
I. Economic Role of PDCP
The Corporation shall assist in the economic development of the
Philippines. To this end, it will assist in the development of private
productive enterprises in the country by providing medium, long-term and
equity financing to such enterprises, assisting in the development of a
wider market for corporate securities, encouraging a wider distribution of
ownership in such enterprises.
II. Privately-Controlled Industrial and Other Productive Enterprises
The term "privately-controlled" as used in the Articles of Incor-
poration will be taken to mean all enterprises which are privately operated
and managed, and where private ownership is of controlling interest (at least
2/3 of the voting stock). The mere fact that such firms have secured loans
from government financial institutions, or that the Government holds a
minority equity position (up to 1/3 of the voting stock) will not exclude
such firms from receiving assistance from the Corporation.
III. Non-Control of Enterprises Financed
The Corporation will not seek to control any of the enterprises
that it finances and will not participate in the management of such firms.
IV. Diversification of Investments
In managing its portfolio, the Corporation will endeavor to diver-
sify its investments - in terms of the type of industries being financed, the
location of such industries, and as to whether funds are used for medium-
or long-term loans, or for equity investments. Having regard to its develop-
mental objectives, the Corporation will give priority to increasing the
number of enterprises it finances, to assisting miedium and small firms as
well as large, and to diversifying the ownership of client enterprises.
In this latter connection, the Corporation will seek to broaden the entre-
preneurial base in the country, by making special efforts to assist qualified
enterprises that` by virtue of their size, age or ownership, do not have as
ready access to other financial institutions as the larger, better established
industrial enterprises in the country.



ANNEX 2.4
Page 2
V.. Maximum Investment
(a) The Corporation shall not normally make an investment in any one
investment enterprise, if at the time or as a result thereof the total expo-
sure in the investment enterprise shall exceed an amount equivalent to 20%
of the sum of paid-in unimpaired capital, surplus and reserves of the Cor-
poration and the amount of the A.I.D. loan not due and payable.
(b) In general, the Corporation's investment in any one investment
enterprise shall not exceed 50% of the total assets of the investment
enterprise including PDCP's investment.
(c) For the purposes of this policy, the term "investment" shall
refer to loans, equity participation and guarantees.
VI. Retirement of Equity Investments
The Corporation looks upon its equity investments more as an
assistance to productive enterprises and will seek to retire and dispose of
its shares, as soon as this become feasible and a fair price can be obtained
for its shares.
VII. Dissemination of Ownership
The ownership of the Corporation will be disseminated as widely
as possible, and reasonable efforts will be taken to prevent any one person,
entity, or group from dominating the ownership or management of the Corpora-
tion.
VIII.  Reserve and Dividend Policy
The Corporation will pursue a prudent dividend policy that will
enable it to provide shareholders with a fair return on their investment,
while at the same time ensuring that its surplus reserves grow at a reason-
able rate. The Corporation will from time to time appropriate a portion of
its retained earnings to surplus reserves. The Corporation will also provide
by charges against income valuation reserves consistent with the size and
quality of the Corporation's loan and equity portfolio.
IX. Exchange Risk
The Corporation will protect itself adequately against foreign ex-
change risks arising out of its operations.
X. Criteria in Processing Loan Applications
Loan applications filed with the Corporation will be processed on
the basis of their economic and business merits. The projects will be
analyzed as to their economic desirability, technical feasibility, financial
soundness, management competence, etc., to insure that only sound productive
ventures are financed.



ANNEX 2.4

IX. Technical Assistance to New Enterprises
The Corporation will endeavor to provide the necessary technical
services to the enterprises being financed, whenever necessary.

PHILIPPINES
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
Outline of Development Strategy for the
Rest of the Seventies
1.        The Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP)
hereby presents its strategy statement for the remaining years of the seven-
ties in consonance with its role as a development finance company and with
national development goals and plans for the rest of the decade. The state-
ment includes:
(a) A recapitulation of corporate commitments as enumerated in the
company's credo. These commitments underlie the strategies that
PDCP has to pursue for the rest of the decade; and
(b) a summarization of PDCP's corporate and operating strategies for
the rest of the decade following the guideposts derived from the
government's development objectives and strategy. Such strategies
are reviewed yearly.
Corporate Commitments
2.        The company has committed itself since its inception in 1963 to
help accelerate the development of the country and to help Filipinos enjoy a
fuller and higher level of living. This it can do by actively encouraging
the emergence and growth of private productive Filipino enterprises through
the extension of various financial as well as managerial and technical
assistance.
3.        As a development finance institution, PDPC assumes the important
entrepreneurial function of promoting developmental projects, and bringing
them to fruition by acting as a channel for the flow of external and domestic
capital resources; with the resultant transfer of know-how and expertise to
the domestic economy.
Corporate Strategies
On Capital Formulation in the Economy and Industrialization
4.        Realizing that capital formation is the principal process through
which the country can bring about higher levels of industrialization, PDCP
must step up its contribution to domestic capital formation in the form of
higher targets of financial assistance to productive projects. At the same
time, to esnure that such assistance is directed along the industrialization
path charted by the national government PDCP must closely ally its priorities
along those set by government. Along this line, the following strategies
will be pursued:



ANNEX 2.5
Page 2
(a)  the company and its officers will maint:ain close contact with
the Office of the President, the Central Bank, the National
Economic and Development Authority, the Board of Investments and
other regulatory government agencies. At the same time, while
maintaining close communication with the government sector, PDCP
will also establish direct consultations with private business and
industry by regularly conducting industry and investment opportunity
dialogues. These dialogues aim to bring together business leaders
of specific sectors or industries and government policy makers for
an exchange of views and opinions concerning current developents
affecting such sectors. By actring as a link between government
and the private sector, PDCP as a deve:Lopment finance institution
helps make possible industrialization planning and implementation,
a truly joint and cooperative effort.
(b) PDCP will also help set the industrialization effort along the
path desired by government by focusing on BOI approved projects as
the principal target market for PDCP financial assistance. These
projects closely fall under government priority industries and
comprise an increasingly larger share in investment activity.
Specifically, the following industries will be assisted:
(i)  Export industries which utilize indigenous raw materials
and/or excess capacity, and will further process traditional
export products. These industries will put to productive use
idle resources, enhance value-added to the economy, while
helping achieve the government goal of stabilizing the
country's balance of payments (BOP) position for the rest of
the decade.
(ii) Industries which utilize and favor relatively abundant manpower
resources of the country, especially those which will provide
skilled labor training. These industries will help promote
and create employment opportunities which is another important
component of the national industrialization objective.
(iii) Industries producing intermediate and capital goods particu-
larly those with potential for backward and forward linkages.
These industries will bring about faster industrialization and
thereby strengthen and provide depth to the country's indus-
trial structure.
(iv) Projects involved in food production, as these help achieve
the national objectives of self-reliance and meeting the basic
needs of the populace.
On Resources Mobilization and Capital Market Development
The sophistication of the Philippine financial system has become
more apparent and the requirements of private business for financial services



ANNEX 2.5
Page 3
have rapidly grown in the recent past. PDCP must therefore gear its financial
expertise to funds mobilization activities to meet the more complex and
diversified funding requirements of large industrial ventures.  Along this
line, the following strategies will be pursued:
(a) PDCP will maintain adequate sources of foreign currency funds
to be able to contribute to capital formation and help bring about
greater industrialization in the country. This will be achieved
through closer relationships with international lending institutions
such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
the Asian Development Bank, and the International Finance Corpor-
ation. For such purposes, a new IBRD credit line, the fifth, will
be negotiated this year. The line will be between $25 to $30
million with a maturity of 15 years and a grace period of 3 to 5
years. This line will be necessary to enable PDCP to meet its
target levels of financial assistance to Philippine industry for
the rest of the decade.
(b) Although the above institutions will remain to be the principal
sources of funds, PDCP will also endeavor to diversify its sources
of funds from Europe, the United States and Japan to give PDCP
maximum exposure to lending institutions in these areas. In 1976,
a loan of DM 5 millin was obtained from the German Development
Company with subsequent release of the funds duringl977. This
year, PDCP will secure funds from about four foreign commercial
banks under a cofinancing arrangement with the IBRD credit line
aforementioned above. These commercial bank loans will amount to
between $10 to $15 million in the aggregate, with a maturity of
from 5 to 7 years and a grace period of not more than 2 years.
Negotiations with these banks are viewed as paving the way to
further loan availments of similar nature in the future, and
enhance PDCP's capability in meeting the expanding investment
requirements of Filipino enterprises.
(c) In addition to performing development banking functions, PDCP
aims to fully wield its capability as a leading institution in the
field of investment banking. As the largest investment house in
terms of total resources as well as total medium- and long-term
assistance it has extended to Philippine industries, PDCP will
expend its peso-based operations (guarantees, equity investments,
underwritings and syndications), as shown in Table I, alongside its
direct lending activities.
(d) Increasing sophistication of the Philippine financial system is
also shown by the keener competition in the long-term and of the
funds market. The entry of offshore banking units (OBU's) and the
establishment of foreign currency deposit units (FCDU's) into the
system giving them direct access to domestic clients is one specific
evidence of this. Hence, PDCP commits to develop more fully its
long-term financial intermediation capabilities not only through
its development banking operations but also through its investment
banking operations. to improve PDCP's competitive position, PDCP
will seriously study the possibility of a flexible interest rate

evidence of this. Hence, PDCP commits to develop more fully its
long-term financial intermediation capabilities not only through
its development banking operations but also through its investment
banking operations. to improve PDCP's competitive position, PDCP
will seriously study the possibility of a flexible interest rate
to a specific borrower will vary according to its credit standing
and the maturity of the loan. Conceptually, this would mean an
interest rate matrix plotted against credit rating and matuity
so as to enable PDCP to have rate flexibility from client to client
while at the same time achieve the desired average lending rate on
its total lending operations.
(e) Cognizant of the fact that the other side of competition is oppor-
tunity, especially for promoting the development of the country's
capital markets, PDCP will seek out mutually beneficial working
arrangements with FCDU's, OBU's and other financial institutions,
bringing into such arrangements PDCP's expertise, track record and
ability to take on direct long-term credit exposure.
(f) still pursuing the need for PDCP to expand its investment banking
capability, PDCP acquired the stock brokerage firm of R.H. Machado
& Co., Inc. last year with the objective of enhancing PDCP's
contribution to capital market development. With a stock brokerage
arm of its own, PDCP can develop a market for the issues it under-
writes and provide liquidity as well as continuity to underwritten
issues. To further enhance the stock brokerage firm's role in
capital market development, PDCP's Board of Directors approved the
joint venture between itself and Manila Pacific Securities in R.H.
Machado. This joint venture is expected to bring about increased
volume of stock brokerage activity. The thrust of the joint
venture of being actively involved in international institutional
brokerage is in line with PDCP's developmental role of channelling
and mobilizing much needed foreign funds into the local capital
market; with the resultant effect of accelerating such market's
development.
On Regional Development
To avoid concentration of industrial development in urban areas and
to bring the benefits of industrialization to the different regions of the
country, the government has embarked on a conscientious effort to encourage
regional dispersal of industries. Doing its share in carrying out this
economic policy, PDCP has and will continue to diversify its portfolio to
reflect more regionally oriented distribution of assisted projects. In
addition to this continuing fundamental strategy, PDCP wil also pursue the
following:



ANNEX 2.5
Page 5
(a)  To give the small- and medium-scale industry entrepreneurs access
to PDCP financial assistance, the program of establishing branch
offices will be continually evaluated and implemented. Already,
PDCP has branch offices in Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu and Iloilo.
Other offices will be opened as the feasibility studies on opening
offices in specific growth areas are completed. These offices will
offer the complete line of PDCP services at the opportune time.
For the rest of the decade, the following growth rates are slated
to be reached by PDCP:
Branch Location               Tentative Date
Legaspi or Naga City in Bicol             1978
Zamboanga City in SW Mindanao       1978 or 1979
La Union or Dagupan in WN Luzon           1979
Isabela in NE Luzon                      1979
Butuan in Central Mindanao                1979
Bacolod in W Visayas                     1979
Cotabato in S. Mindanao                  1979
(b)  PDCP's involvement in regional development will further gain
momentum with the program to make investment commitments in private
development banks (PDB's) in key growth regions of the country.
This corporate thrust is meant to provide a mode for mobilizing
voluntary savings for developmental projects and to augment sources
of credit for small and medium scale enterprises in these regions.
PDCP has bough shares of the Davao City Development Bank and
Southern Negros Development Bank and is now involved in the organiztion of a
Northern Mindanao Development Bank. Negotiations to buy into the Iloilo City
Development Corporation is in its final stages. Studies will be made for
eventual investments in other reputable and well-managed private development
banks situated in other regional growth centers.
On Small- and Medium-Scale Industry Development
Part of the government's industrial strategy involves the encourage-
ment and promotion of small and medium-scale industries. This thrust actually
goes hand in hand with the thrust towards accelerated regional development.
Taking its cue from this recognition by government of this sector's role in
the country's overall growth and development, PDCP formally launched its
Small Business Term Lending (SBTL) Program in 1972. PDC will, however, step
up its activities along this direction by pursuing the following specific
strategies:
(a) the SBTL Program was strengthened last year with PDCP's
accreditation in the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund.



ANiNEX 2.5
Page 6
This accreditation program will be sustained with the end in
view of making the SBTL viable so that in the process, PDCP can
continue expanding its assistance to the small industry sector.
(b)  As mentioned earlier, PDCP will allocate a portion of the Fifth
IBRD line being negotiated, anywhere from $3.0 million to
$5 million, for the assistance of Urban Poverty which are labor-
intensive. Most likely, such projects will be small or medium in
scale and therefore this program will be in sonsonance with PDCP's
objective of promoting small and medium size enterprises.
(c)  Furthermore, the strategies adopted to help promote regional
development in thecountry are also designed to help encourage the
growth of small- and medium-scale industries.
On lIanpower Training and Entrepreneurial Development
A country's manpower is its most important resource for development.
What is true for the country is also true for the corporation; the company's
staff members constitute one of its most important asset for growth. PDCP's
Development Finance Institute (DFI) was established to put to practice this
principle. In implementing this for the rest of the decade, PDCP will adopt
the following strategies:
(a)  continued pursuit of DFI's two-prongecl objectives of training
PDCP staff members and disseminating PDCP's expertise to the
private and government sectors on a national and international
level have been realized in the past in a number of training
and development activities. The present program designed to
fulfill these objectives will be sustained with renewed vigor.
Hence, the DFI will continue to conduct and improve the content of
the Industrial Projects Course for its staff members and for select
groups of foreign trainees. The holding of other in-house training
programs to upgrade staff skills will be maintained. Qualified
staff members will also be sent to external seminars and courses
conducted by outside training institutions, locally and abroad.
PDCP will also maintain its scholarship program for those who wish
to pursue higher studies in management.
(b) still part of its manpower program is DFI's development and imple-
mentation of the company's systems on career development, management
training, performance appraisal and test development for selection
purposes. These were accomplished in coordination with the Admin-
istration and Personnel Department this year. These programs will
be reviewed with the end in view of refining and improving the
system set up.
(c)  for the first time and hopefully to be a continuing program,
the DFI will offer this year a Public Projects Course for the
purpose of sharing PDCP expertise with other sectors involved with



ANNEX 2.5
Page 7
the effort of national development. This will involve the transfer
of project evaluation technology to client-firms of PDCP and to
other financial institutions with the resultant benefit of improving
skills in the economy and education entrepreneurs on the aspects of
disciplined financial management.
(d) still in line with entrepreneurial development, PDCP will continue
to conduct and improve on the entrepreneurial assistance workshops
for the different branch offices.
(f) PDCP's investment in Asia Business Consultants, Inc., a management
consultancy firm was designed to augment the corporation's client
service facilities particularly its management consultancy services.
With the increasing need for such services, ABC will be geared to
assist PDCP in the promotion and development of viable projects and
provide clients with advanced management and entrepreneurial
expertise.
