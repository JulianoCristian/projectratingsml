Some lessons learned included: the\n            beneficiary's capability to undertake a project should\n            be assessed realistically. The services of a private sector\n            consulting firm should be included as part of the project\n            under an adequate scope of work which include project\n            construction management. Proper project engineering\n            including designs and adequate studies and investigations,\n            and bidding documents for major works, equipment and\n            materials should be available for review during the\n            appraisal phase. Bidding of the major works, equipment and\n            materials should start during the appraisal phase in\n            accordance with project implementation schedule. Contractors\n            for civil works, equipment and materials should be screened\n            carefully and selected through a rigorous method of\n            prequalification or post qualification.
