    objectives are: (i) to assist in meeting the electricity\n            demand in Kerala and the Southern Region of India through\n            the construction of a 180-MW hydropower station; (ii) to\n            improve the performance and efficiency of the existing\n            system through the reinforcement of the distribution\n            networks in the major cities of Cannanore, Kozhikode, and\n            Cochin and through the installation of reactive power\n            compensation equipment; and (iii) to strengthen Kerala State\n            Electricity Board's (KSEB) managerial, commercial, and\n            financial practices through an institutional development\n            program. The project provides for the construction, on the\n            lower Periyar River in the Idukki District, of a powerhouse\n            housing three generating units each of 60-MW capacity, and\n            the construction and installation of about 415 km km of\n            220-KV double circuit transmission lines, additional\n            transmission substations of 1,180-MVA capacity, 760 MVAR of\n            reactive power compensation devices, additional distribution\n            substations (110-kV, 11-kV) or 270 MVA capacity, and the\n            associated distribution cables and lines, switching\n            stations, and distribution transformers."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
