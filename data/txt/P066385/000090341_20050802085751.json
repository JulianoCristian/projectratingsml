substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned: The presence of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (PRSP) underscores the Government of Rwanda (GoR's)\n            strong commitment and ownership of the IRC. The adoption and\n            institutionalization of the principle of Budget Program\n            Priorities (BPPs) of the PRSP and the Medium Term\n            Expenditure Framework (MTEF) constitute effective measures.\n            Effective implementation and monitoring mechanisms for\n            reform programs are those that are supported at the highest\n            levels of a country's political hierarchy and civil\n            service. Reforms carried out on a more comprehensive and\n            multifaceted basis, are also more likely to have a greater\n            impact and sustainability. To facilitate supervision of the\n            development policy credit, it would be recommended to have a\n            policy matrix or indicators of outputs and outcomes.
