The\n            entire population of Lome, of which 55 percent have incomes\n            at or below the poverty level, would benefit from the\n            project. Financing would be provided for: (a) improvement of\n            present production bore-holes, 13 km of transmission mains,\n            a neutralization plant, a ground reservoir, a pumping\n            station and remote control center; (c) reinforcement and\n            extension of the distribution network through the provision\n            of 210 km of pipelines, 5,000 house connections and 33\n            standpipes; (d) consultant services to carry out project\n            preparation and other studies; (e) vehicles and office and\n            training equipment; and (f) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
