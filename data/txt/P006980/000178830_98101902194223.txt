INTERNATIDNAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE DCMINICAN REPUBLIC
MOR AN IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Dominican Republic in an amount equivalent to $13.0 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance an irrigation project in the valley
of the Rio Yaque del Norte. The Inter-American Development Bank would be
a co-lender.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
the Dominican Republic" (CA-8a) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 24s, 1971. In the Fall of 1972 an updating economic mission went to
the Dominican Republic to focus particularly on the balance of payments
situation and outlook. Satisfactory growth, an expanded public works
program, and domestic tranquility have all contributed to bringing about
a more confident attitude on the part of domestic and foreign investors.
3.        The main stimulus to growth - GDP went up by 7 percent during 1971
and 1972 - came from the export side. Sugar earnings went up considerably,
as the Dominican Republic, favored by two consecutive years of excellent
weather, was able to respond to a buoyant world market. World sugar prices
went up by 20 percent in 1971 and 60 percent in 1972, reaching the very high
level of 7.3 cents per pound. At the same time the U.S. price, which deter-
mines the preferential purchase price, went up by 5.5 percent a year. The
Dominican Republic now has the second largest quota after the Philippines
in the preferential U.S. market. Total sugar exports amounted to 1.35
million short tons in 1972 but further investments in processing plants
will be necessary to exceed this level in the future.
14.       Besides sugar, other sectors of the economy also showed a great
deal of dynamism. The Falconbridge ferronickel operation, partly financed
by the Bank began production in 1972. Meat and tobacco production and ex-
ports, although minor compared to sugar, increased substantially. Cons-
truction, industry, and services also grew rapidly, partly as a result of
stepped-up public works. Two major dams and important additions to the
trunk highway network kept the level of public investment high. In the
near future the Government intends to place less emphasis on infrastructure
and more on directly productive investment, notably in agriculture and
tourism.



- 2 -
5.        The increase in public investment went hand in hand with a
strengthening of public finances because of a continued restraint in
current expenditure and satisfactory growth in revenues. Public capital
expenditure rose from RD$118 million in 1970 and RD$158.5 million in 1971
to roughly RD$187 million in 1972. The share of public investment in GDP
went up from 6 percent in 1967/68 to about 9 percent in 1971. Public
savings increased rapidly and now finance nearly 70 percent of public
investment.
6.        The country's longer-term economic prospects depend on how
successfully two major constraints can be overcome. One is a very weak
project preparation and execution capacity. International institutions
have assisted the Dominican ministries and public agencies in project
preparation and encouraged the retention of consultant services to help
in project execution. While external technical support is helpful in
proceeding with key projects, more fundamental actions are needed, part-
icularly through training programs and salary adjustiments, to strengthen
the currently weak middle-upper management in the Government.
7.        The other main constraint is the limited availability of foreign
exchange earnings for development purposes in spite of the improved export
performance noted above. Net international reserves are negative, taking
into account some $20 million of import payment arrears. Although external
debt management has somewhat improved - most of the contractual debt in
arrears has been repaid or renegotiated - there remains a backlog of accrued
commercial arrears. The recent economic mission has found evidence that the
"parallel" foreign exchange market, in which the Dominican peso is traded
freely at 8 to 14 percent above the official parity with the dollar, has
expanded rapidly since 1967 at the expense of Central Bank reserves. The
Government has tolerated the existence of the "parallel" market in the past.
Because of the return of confidence, recent improvements in exports, favor-
able sugar prospects, and several recent Government actions, it expects that
this market can be ended within the next couple of years.
8.        Although the short teram export prospects are favorable, analysis
of the Dominican Republic's longer term prospects suggests that the economy
will be able to grow at 5-6 percent per year only if the balance of payments
management can be substantially improved. Sugar production and- exports are
reaching a plateau that will be difficult to exceed without a major expansion
in processing capacity. Other exports are too small or not dynamic enough to
influence the medium-term balance of payments situation much. While promoting
those exports with the best prospects - sugar, minor agricultural products,
and tourism - the Government is also considering much needed measures to curb
the growth of imports. Indiscriminate promotion of industry has up to now
involved. excessive imports of machinery and equipment and subsequent duty free
imports of raw materials for high-cost industrial processing. At the same
time, the high profits of the newer protected industries have discouraged pri-
vate investment in agriculture and export-oriented industries. The Government
is now reassessing its industrial policies to estab]lish a more selective pro-
tection policy relying on efficiency tests in each particular case. These



- 3-
changes will be crucial if the Government is to channel the expected in-
creased private investment into more export-oriented output. A more
efficient protection system would also favor employment in the long run,
through increased effective demand for industrial products and a productive
structure better adapted to the country's abundant labor supply.
9.        If fiscal performance continues to improve, and if further progress
is made in overcoming some of the other problems referred to above, the Domin-
ican Republic may become capable of servicing some external loans on conven-
tional terms. For the present, however, its relatively low per capita income
($350), its high unemployment rate, and the limited prospects for further ex-
port expansion justify financing on concessional terms. While the excellent
public savings performance has greatly increased the proportion of domestic
resources applied to public investment, the past reduction of concessionary
assistance has contributed to the balance of payments constraint. U.S. net
assistance - most of it on very soft terms - has dropped from $34 million
yearly in 1966/1967 to $17 million during 1970/1971. At the same time, net
multilateral assistance has risen from $3 million to only $8 million annually,
while public fixed investment more than doubled from $48.3 million to $112.5
million. The present shift toward a better-prepared investment program should
make it possible, in the course of time, to meet the Dominican Republic's ex-
ternal capital requirements by financing the direct and indirect foreign ex-
change component of selected projects. In the meantime, however, there will
be a need for external lenders to finance some of the local expenditures on
the selected projects for which they lend, if they are to make an adequate
contribution to the country's development program. This need is made greater
by the decline in U.S. Government assistance, referred to above, since much
of this assistance has been for budgetary support rather than for specific
projects.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
10.       To date the Dominican Republic has received a $25.0 million Bank
loan - for the Falconbridge enclave project in FY1970 - and $9.0 million of
IDA credits - for education and livestock development projects in FY1971.
The IFC has made no investment or commitment in the Dominican Republic. A
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits and brief notes on current projects
are included in Annex I.
11.       External financing to the Dominican Republic has been mainly by
the U.S. Government through the Agency for International Development (US-AID),
for budget support and projects in the fields of agriculture, education and
health, and industry. The IDB has been active in the fields of power, water
and sewerage, industry, agriculture, and education. The main sources of ex-
ternal financing to the Dominican Republic are summarized below (in $ millions):

=                 _=               .
12.       As in the past, the main objectives of prospective Bank Group
lending to the Dominican Republic are to help overcome the balance of
payments constraint and strengthen Dominican institutions. A tourism
project, which has as a major aspect building a new department in the
Central Bank to plan and carry out tourist infrastructure projects, is
expected to be ready for Board consideration early in FY1974. A project
to rehabilitate the road network, as well as strengthen t-he Public Works
Ministry's maintenance capability, is at an earlier stage of preparation.
Follow-up projects are also planned for education and livestock development
with the latter expected to include processing facilities to aid in ex-
panding Dominican agricultural exports. Our lending plans are on the basis
that US-AID will concentrate on health, family planning, and other social
projects and that the Inter-American Development Bank will continue to
focus its lending mainly in the fields of agriculture, rural development,
power, urban housing, and water and sewerage.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
13.       Agriculture is the most important sector of the Dominican economy,
accounting for 25 percent of GDP, about 60 percent of total employment and
more than 90 percent of commodity exports value. Of the total land area of
4.8 million ha, somewhat less than one-half is in farms and only about one-
third of the farm areas is cultivated. Much of the unused land is owned by
the state or by absentee individuals or corporations. Despite a heavy in-
flow of development aid and technical assistance after 1965, the record of
agricultural production over the l960-s has generally been poor. The growth
of agricultural production has been hampered by the poor production and
inarketirng technology, the absence of medium- and long-term credit facilities
1/  US-AID and PL480; excludes PL480 grant funds and loans to be repaid
in local currency.
2/ Loan to Falconbridge Dominicana, S.A., guaranteed by the Dominican Republic.
3/ Mainly budget support.



and extension services, the inefficient use of water resources, the unco-
ordinated activities of numerous poorly managed and staffed public agencies,
the antiquated land tenure system, and absentee management.
14.       The Government is attacking this situation mainly through (i) an
IDB financed agricultural development project to strengthen extension services
and credit facilities and provide technical assistance to the various agencies
involved in the sector; (ii) starting several irrigation schemes (including
the proposed Taque del Norte project); and (iii) an agrarian reform program.
Several land reform laws have been enacted since 1970. Thus far, the Govern-
ment's main efforts have been focused on the application of a law limiting
holdings of lands under rice cultivation to a maximum of 31 ha. The Govern-
ment has decided, however, to apply the whole land reform legislation in the
proposed Yaque del Norte project area, thus making it the first integrated
land reform-agricultural development project in the country.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
15.       A report entitled "Yaque del Norte Irrigation Project, Dominican
Republic (PA-148a)" is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
16.       A UNDP-financed feasibility study was undertaken in 1966 for im-
provement and extension of existing irrigation systems in the Yaque del Norte
valley, one of the country's most important areas. The resulting project,
based on run-of-the river diversion without a dam, was appraised by the Bank
in 1968. The Government decided to proceed with the construction of the
Tavera Dam upstream, however, and subsequently arranged for the feasibility
study to be reformulated, taking into account the regulation of the river
flow by the Dam. The revised feasibility report, completed in 1971, consti-
tutes the basis for the proposed project. The project was reappraised in
March 1972. Negotiations for the proposed IDA credit were held in Washington
November 13-17. The Dominican Republic delegation was led by Mr. Diogenes
Fernandez, Governor of the Central Bank, and Mr. Lulo Gitte, Director of the
Hydraulic Resource Institute (INDRHI).
Project Description
17.       The project would provide full water supply to 27,500 ha by re-
placing and improving the existing but inadequate irrigation system. The
main canal capacity would be adequate to serve 40,000 ha, a feature which
would allow for future expansion of the project. Such expansion would be
possible with construction of a dam on the Bao River, a tributary to the
Yaque del Norte river.
18.       Project works would include:
(a) headworks on the Yaque del Norte river at Santiago de los
Caballeros, consisting of a diversion dam, a sluice struc-
ture, a desilting works and intake structure designed for
about 40 m3/s;



(b)  a concrete lined  main canal of about 73 km;
(c) a distribution system of concrete lined canals with a
total length of about 300 km;
(d)  a drainage system of about 500 km, about half of which
would consist of reconditioned natural drains;
(e)  on-farm irrigation and drainage canals and land leveling;
(f) a pumping plant to serve about 1,600 ha above the main
canal; and
(g) about 375 km or roads along the main and secondary canals.
Technical assistance for extension services, marketing, formation of co-
operatives, operation and maintenance and agrarian reform would also be
made available under the project, as well as in-service training for local
staff working with the consultants and operation and maintenance equipment
and vehicles for project personnel. Funds to meet the credit needs of the
area's farmers would be provided by the Government.
19.       The proposed project would be integrated with the Government's
ongoing agricultural and land reform programs, in which several Government
agencies and ministries are involved. The construction, operation and main-
tenance of the irrigation system would be the responsibility of INDRHI, an
autonomous organization under the office of the President. INTRHI would
engage a firm of engineering consultants to be responsible for all surveys,
design and superVision of construction. The Agrarian Institute (IAD) will
prepare a detailed plan for land acquisition and settlement of farmers in
the project area; the plan will be submitted to IDA for approval within 18
months after the date of the Credit Agreement. IAD will carry out the plan
during the course of construction of the project, in accordance with a time-
table to be agreed with IDA, so that appropriate changes in farm size and
boundaries to carry out the land reform program will be correlated with the
layout and construction of the irrigation and drainage system. Extension
and training services, as well as agricultural credit, are currently pro-
vided in the project area by various agencies, including the Secretariat
of Agriculture. Under the proposed project these services would be
strengthened.
20.       Close coordination among the various Government agencies oper-
ating in the project area will be achieved through a Central Policy Committee
and a Project Coordinating Committee. The Central Policy Committee would
consist of top officials of the ministries and agencies with functions re-
lating to the project and would be concerned primarily with policy decisions
and the allocation of responsibilities among the agencies involved. The
Project Coordinating Committee would consist of field representatives of the
agencies involved in the project and would be responsible for day-to-day
operations. This Committee would be headed by a Project Coordinator who
would also be in charge of organizing and carrying out the extension serv-
ices through a Project Unit.



-7-
Financing
21.       The project is estimated to cost $39 million including a $23
million foreign exchange component. It would be by far the largest
irrigation scheme ever undertaken by the Dominican Republic and is close-
ly interconnected with IDB activities, particularly under its 1969 loan
for the Tavera Dam and its recent loan for agricultural development.
Accordingly, arrangements are being worked out for the IDB to join with
IDA in providing external financing for the project. IDA, IDB and the
Government would each cover one-third of the cost of the project, with
the financing allocated as follows:
Total             Financing
Item                        Cost       IDA        IDB       Govt.

and main canal to km 3.5                  2.3       1.7        -          .6
Second Contract - Main canal
to km 36.5, distribution and
drainage systems, on-farm
development                             12.7         -        8.8        3.9
Third Contract - Pumping plant,
distribution and drainage
systems, on-farm development             1.9         -        1.3         .6
Fourth Contract - Main canal to
km 72.8, distribution and drainage
systems, on-farm development              8.5       6.2        -         2.3
Buildings                                   .2        -         -          .2
Land Acquisition and Resettlement          3.2        -         -         3.2
Contingencies                              6.5       2.5       2.5        1.5
39.0      13.0      13.0       13.0
The Government would pass the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit, together
with its own budgetary contribution, onto INDHI as a grant to finance the
construction and operation and maintenance components of the project. The
credit would be disbursed against the C.I.F. cost of imported equipment, the
foreign exchange cost of consulting services, and 73 percent of the cost of
civil works.



- 8 -
22.       The IDB Board has indicated its agreement in principle to provide
financing for the project on soft terms from IDB' s Fund for Special
Operations. The necessary loan documents are expected to be ready for
consideration by the IDB Board within the next three to four months. A
condition to the disbursement for the proposed IDA credit is that all
conditions to the disbursement of IDB's loan have been fulfilled, except
that up to $1,200,000 would be available earlier to finance the final
engineering design and equipment needed by the consultants.
23.       The $13 million loan by the IDA, as well as that by IDB, would
finance about $11.5 million of foreign exchange costs and $1.5 million of
local costs. Some financing of local expenditures is justified because of
the project's high priority and the circumstances set forth in paragraph 9
above.
24.       Contracts for civil works and equipment to be financed by IDA
will be awarded in accordance with the Bank/IDA procurement Guidelines.
Components of the project to be financed by the IDB would be awarded under
the guidelines applicable to its Fund for Special Operations, with bidding
accordingly limited to firms in IDB member countries.
Water Tariffs
25.       The present legislation governing charges for water does not
allow INDRHI to recover the full costs of operation and maintenance and
makes no provision for the recovery through water charges of any part of
the capital costs of irrigation works. During the first two years of the
project, the Government would undertake a study of the level of charges
that would be required for the recovery of operation and maintenance costs
in full, and for the recovery of a reasonable proportion of investment costs
taking into account the various types of farms. The Government would review
the findings of the study with IDA, would agree on appropriate schedules of
rates, and would ensure that INDRHI applied them in the project area.
INDRHI would be given the necessary legislative authority to do so, as a
condition of effectiveness.
Rate of Return
26.       The project would expand production for export - mainly tobacco
but also sugarcane, and, to a minor extent vegetables - and in substitution
for imports - mainly rice, peanuts, and soybeans in an area which is well
suited for these crops. Through implementation of agrarian reform the
project would also create in the area some 2,000 new smallholder farms of
an average size of about 5 ha for landless families, thereby establishing
new employment opportunities and improving the distribution of income among
the population. The expected economic rate of return on the project would
be 14 percent assuming a 50-year project life and taking into consideration
expected world market prices for the crops produced.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUHENTS AND AUTHORITY
27.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Dominican
Republic and the International Development Association, the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
28.       The draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 8.01, includes
as conditions of effectiveness: (a) the execution and delivery of an agree-
ment between the Government and INDRHI for the transfer of the proceeds of
the credit to INDRHI; (b) the employment of the consultants who will assist
the Borrower in carrying out detailed surveys, final design, and supervision
of construction of the civil works for the irrigation and drainage systems;
(c) the establishment of the Central Policy Committee and of the Project
Coordinating Committee and the appointment, after consultation with the
Association, of the Project Coordinator referred to in paragraph 20 of this
Report; and (d) the granting to INDRHI of powers to impose and collect annual
water fees, at such levels as shall be necessary to recover the full amount
of operation and maintenance costs of the irrigation component of the Project
and a reasonable proportion of investment costs, taking into account the
partial recovery, if any, of such costs through land expropriations.
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

An initial delay of about four months occurred in the selection
of the Project Director. There have been further delays in the selection of
project sites and in the provision of counterpart funds. All but one of the
sites have now been selected and counterpart funds are usually being provided
as needed. Progress of the project is now generally satisfactory and current
prospects are that it will be completed by the closing date.
j   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

technique as the 1972 World Atlas. All other conversions to dollars in this table are
at the average exchange rate prevailing durinigthe period covered.
2/ Because the census of 1970 placed over 30 percent of the work force as "unallocated", the assumption
has been made-that these were rural residents working on own account and thev have beer placed in
"agriculture".
