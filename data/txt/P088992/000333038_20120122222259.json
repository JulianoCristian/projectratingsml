Continued training needs\n            identification is critical to ensure the effectiveness of\n            Technical Assistance (TA). Close monitoring of the\n            macroeconomic conditions of the borrower's country is\n            critical to the completion of a line of credit operation.\n            Necessary resources should be allocated to both the bank\n            supervision and borrowers Project Implementation Unit (PIU).\n            High degree of borrower ownership of the project aids the\n            successful implementation of the project.
