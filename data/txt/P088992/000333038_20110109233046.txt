SUMMARY
1.     Following the Government of Mongolia request (letters sent by the Ministry of
Finance dated August 17 and August 20, 2010), this paper is to propose: (i) reallocation
of the credit proceeds in order to fully utilize the remaining funding in line with the
Project Development Objective of improving the capacity of the financial sector
regulators and the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs); and (ii) the assignment and
assumption of the rights and obligations under the Zoos Bank's Project Agreement with
the Bank in favor of the new State Bank of Mongolia reflecting the recent changes in
Mongolia's banking sector.

PROJECT STATUS
2.     The Project implementation was rated Satisfactory until February 2009, when it
was downgraded to Marginally Satisfactory in view of the slowdown in the credit line
component as a result of negative impact of global financial crisis on Mongolian
economy and banking sector. In early 2009, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA)
was amended to support the Bank of Mongolia's (BOM) urgent needs related to failed
bank resolution and bank restructuring, for a reallocation of US$1 million from the credit
line component for the BOM technical assistance sub-component. The closing date for
the Project has been extended by one year in April 2010 (until April 30, 2011), to allow
for the orderly completion for the ongoing and planned activities towards the
achievement of the Project Development Objective.

3.      Since late 2009 there have been signs of economic recovery. The conditions of
the external markets for Mongolia's exports have improved, and major mining
concessions awarded to international consortia resulted in renewed capital inflow. The
liquidity situation in banking sector has improved, and positive growth has been
registered for both deposits and loans in the first three quarters of 2010. In particular,
there has been renewed interest of PFIs and private enterprises in the longer term
investment funding offered by the credit line component of the Project.

4.     As of early October 2010, 86 percent of the credit proceeds have been disbursed
(US$ 9.2 million out of total US$ 10.7 million). In particular, the credit line component
disbursed US7 million in support of 31 investment sub-projects by private enterprises.
The Project helped create about 500 new jobs in Mongolia. During the latest supervision
mission held in June 2010, the authorities and PFIs have reiterated their commitment to
complete the project implementation by the extended closing date.

PROPOSED CHANGES
5.      In reflection of changed circumstances, the Ministry of Finance has requested that
the DCA is amended to replace Zoos Bank, which is one of the original PFIs under the
Project, with the newly created State Bank of Mongolia. The latter was established
                                            3
following Zoos Bank's bankruptcy in November 2009, through transfer of good assets
and liabilities of Zoos Bank to the newly established institution with 100% state capital.
For the purposes of the Project, State Bank will be considered as a successor institution to
Zoos Bank, and will carry all the associated rights and obligations. As confirmed by
BOM, State Bank is currently fully compliant with eligibility criteria established for PFIs
in the DCA. An Assignment and Assumption Agreement has been signed between IDA,
State Bank of Mongolia and Zoos Bank Receivership (see Attached).

6.      To better align the usage of remaining credit proceeds with the evolving needs
and priorities of the Project beneficiaries, the authorities have requested a number of
reallocations between disbursement categories, as follows (see Annex 1 for more detail):

   ·   Reallocation of a total of US$ 200,000 equivalent from Credit Line category to
       Training category, with an allocation of US$ 100,000 each to BOM and MOF,
       respectively. The additional training budget will be used for continued
       strengthening of supervisory and regulatory capacity, which will be critical for
       successful implementation of sector-wide bank restructuring program proposed by
       the authorities.

   ·   Reallocation of US$ 75,000 equivalent from Trade and Development Bank's
       allocation for Consulting Services to Goods. The reallocated funding will be used
       for upgrading the bank's card security system.

   ·   Reallocation of US$ 75,000 equivalent from Zoos Bank's (to be changed to State
       Bank's) allocation for Consulting Services to Goods, and US $63,000 equivalent
       from allocation for Training to Goods. The reallocated funding will be used for
       the establishment of Disaster Recovery Facility which is critically important for
       State Bank's reliable operation.

7.     The proposed changes would allow the project beneficiaries to complete a number
of planned activities critical to the achievement of the project objectives.        This is
expected to be the last reallocation of credit proceeds required under the Project.

8.      The Closing Date for the Credit remains April 30, 2011. In accordance with the
current practice of the Association, further disbursements from the Credit will be made
for withdrawal applications receive by the Association by close of business on August 31,
2011 in respect of eligible expenditures made before the closing date (i.e. payments made
or due for goods, works, and services that have been provided prior to the Closing Date).
Proceeds of the Credit remaining unwithdrawn after disbursements have been made in
respect of theses withdrawal applications will be cancelled.
