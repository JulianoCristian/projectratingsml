      Requirement of above equipments: Since its establishment in November 2011, State Bank has taken over most of the assets of Zoos Bank some of which
      are obsolete. Also a Disaster recovery site has been set up ready for the required equipment. The items listed above will help with this and improve security,
      efficiency and business continuity when operations are effected by external influences. The IT equipment of rural branches will also be upgraded to improve
      their efficiency in the regions.
