The extension is necessary\n            to allow the project entities to complete a number of\n            planned activities critical to the achievement of the\n            project objectives. The completion of the special\n            assessments of systemic and related banks undertaken at the\n            request of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) under the project is\n            critical to the success of a sector-wide bank restructuring\n            strategy currently under consideration by the Government of\n            Mongolia; hence to the longer-term financial stability. The\n            unused funding for Technical Assistance (TA) under the\n            project would allow the Participating Financial\n            Intermediaries (PFIs) to strengthen their system security\n            and reliability, which is a lesson learned from the two\n            failed banks. The TA funding would also support well-planned\n            staff training. Due to the need to address the crisis-like\n            situation, the Government has not finalized the action plan\n            for completing all the planned activities during the\n            extended implementation period, but has discussed with the\n            Bank's task team on the contents of the action plan.\n            The Government has reiterated its commitment to complete the\n            project implementation by the end of the extended closing date."}, "docdt": "2010-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
