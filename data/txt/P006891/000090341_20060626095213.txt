                     ProposedAmendmentto the LoanAgreement

1. IntroductoryStatement

   This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors for the amendment
   of the financial clauses o f three Variable Spread Loans (VSLs); (i) No. 4021A-
                                                                            Loan
   CO (Bogota Urban Transport Project), 4243-CO (Antioquia Education Project) and
   (ii)LoanNo. 4507-CO (Cartagena WaterSupply, Sewerage andEnvironmental
  Management Project).          Effectively the proposed amendments would convert the
   existing VSLs into Fixed Spread Loans (FSLs). The proposed changes will provide
   the Borrowers and the Republic o f Colombia with access to IBRD's financial
   products for the purpose o f managing the interest rate and currency exposure they
   have inU S Dollars under the existingVSLs. The proposed amendments would allow
   the Borrowers to (i) the currency of denomination ofthe loans; (ii) the
                          change                                                  change
   interest rate basis o f the loans from floating rate to fixed rate and vice versa; and (iii)
  place a cap or a collar on the interest rate applicable to the loans.

2. Backgroundand Reasonsfor the ProposedAmendments

   The municipalities of Bogota and Cartagena and the department o f Antioquia in
   Colombia each are the borrower-of-record for a US$-denominated VSLs signed with
  the IBRD. These three loans do not incorporate in the loan documentation the risk
  management tools to manage the volatility o f interest and currency rates that were
  subsequently introduced by IBRD for its Fixed Spread Loans (FSL). However, these
  three Borrowers have approached the Treasury Financial Advisory Team working
  with Colombia and expressed their wish to reduce the interest rate and currency
  exposure inherent in these three loans by changing their currency o f denomination
  from US$ to Colombian Peso (COP)

  Under the IBRD's current operational procedures, the currency o f denomination o f
  existing VSLs can only be changed through a currency swap, which transforms, on a
  net basis, future loan servicing obligations from one currency to another. In order to
  enter into such currency swap, it i s necessary for the IBRD and a borrower to sign a
  Master Derivatives Agreement (MDA) that provides the legal and operational
  framework for entering into such currency swap transaction. Although such an MDA
  has already been signed between the IBRD and the Republic o f Colombia, the
  borrowers-of-record for the three loans in question are local authorities, none o f
  whom has signed an MDA with the IBRD. The laws and regulations o f Colombia do
  not permit the republic to act as a financial intermediarybetweenthe local authorities
  and a third party. The option o f having Colombia enter into a currency swap with the

      IBRDon the one handand into an off-setting currency swap with the local authorities
      on the other i s therefore not legally feasible. As a result, the Borrowers have so far
      been hampered in the pursuit o f their stated objective of mitigating the interest rate
      and currency risk inherent inthese loans.

 3. ProposedChanges

      Giventhe above considerations, the parties (IBRD, the Republic o f Colombia and the
     Borrowers) have agreed, subject to the approval o f the ExecutiveDirectors, to amend
     the existing Loan Agreements to permit interest rate and currency conversions in
     accordance with procedures existing under the FSL framework', Through these
     proposed amendments, the existing VSLs will, from a financial perspective, be
     changed to FSLs by incorporating in the existing loan agreements the standard
     financial clauses allowing for currency conversions and changes in the interest rate
     basis for FSLs and the application o f the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and
     Guarantee Agreements for FSLs to the said agreements. All other provisions in the
     existing loan agreements will remain unaffected. Once these amendments have been
     completed, the three VSLs will be legally and operationally "converted" into FSLs.
     The Ministry of Finance of Colombia and the Borrowers have agreed to the proposed
     amendments.

4. ExpectedOutcomes

     Once the amendments are executed, the interest rate and currency conversions can be
     implemented following standard operating procedures for such conversions2.

5. Advantages andDisadvantagesof the Proposal

    The main advantages of this proposal are that it: (i)                   responds to the Borrowers' needs
    in a timely manner; (ii)allows the Borrowers to fully hedge their currency and
    interest rate risk by converting their outstanding debt into fixed interest rate andor
    into other currencies, including Colombian Pesos; (iii)gives the Borrowers the
    possibility to manage the financial risks inherent in IBRD VSLs without the need for
    negotiating a Master Derivatives Agreement; (iv) facilitates the conversion o f the
    loans into Colombian Pesos which will have, as a by-product, the added advantage o f
    converting Colombia's contingent liability under the related guarantees into
    Colombian Pesos, thereby reducing Colombia's currency risk; and (v) allows the
    application o f the process to disbursingas well as fully disbursed VSLs. Inaddition,
    these amendments will allow the World Bank to learn from the process and,
    potentially, offer these amendments as a facility aimed at offering added flexibility o f
    our loan products to our clients.
