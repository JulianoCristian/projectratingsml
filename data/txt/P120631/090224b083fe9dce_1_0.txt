1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Union of the Comoros (UoC) is a small post-conflict island country (estimated
population 680,000) consisting of three islands (Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli).
The UoC’s determining characteristics are geographical isolation and limited resources.
Moreover, the country has had a challenging political history, including more than 20 coups
and secession attempts since its independence from France in 1975. In 2001, a carefully
crafted constitution known as the Fomboni Accord was adopted, but it could not prevent
yet another secession attempt by the island of Anjouan in 2007–08, which was ultimately
resolved only through a joint military intervention by the Union Government and the
African Union. An embargo imposed by the African Union on the islands during the
conflict caused a sharp deterioration in social and economic infrastructure. The economy
of the Comoros is dominated by subsistence agriculture (including fishing) and small-scale
retail, accounting for about one-half and one-fifth of the gross domestic product,
respectively. The bulk of export earnings come from three high-value export crops—
vanilla, cloves, and ylang-ylang. There is a high dependence on food imports (mainly rice,
meat, and cooking oil) and remittances account for about one-fifth of the gross domestic
product, which make the country extremely vulnerable to external shocks.

2.      The country’s political and economic situation for two decades has contributed to
low per capita incomes (US$1,391 per annum in 2010) and very limited development of
public infrastructure and government. A 2005 household survey conducted by the
government with support from the United Nations Development Program had estimated
the national poverty rate1 to be 36.9 percent, with higher rates in rural areas (41.1 percent)
and in Anjouan. The Union of the Comoros ranked 139 out of 182 countries on the United
Nations Human Development Index in 2009. Basic social and economic infrastructure
(schools, water, roads) is very limited, especially in poor and remote communities. Surveys
conducted by the government about access to social services showed that less than half the
Comorian population thought they had adequate access to primary education and less than
a quarter to adequate safe water and sanitation. In terms of employment, most of the jobs
are in the informal sector2 with few opportunities for paid work in rural areas, driving as
much as 15 percent of the population to seek work outside the country.

3.       In 2010, the UoC faced a challenging situation created by a series of successive
crises, including (a) the political secession attempt on the island of Anjouan in 2007–08;
(b) the food price crisis that peaked in mid-2008; and (c) the global financial and economic
crisis in 2009. The conflict in 2007 caused a sharp deterioration of social and economic
infrastructure as a result of poor maintenance. In 2008, food price increases of over 50
percent hit the poor particularly hard, straining their already weak coping mechanisms.
Households that relied heavily on remittances were further hit as a consequence of the
global economic crises and the international economic slowdown in 2009.

4.      The Emergency Crisis Response (ECR) Project was intended to complement the
responses of both the government and other donors3 to these successive crises through cash
for work as well as community-based infrastructure sub-projects. The need to quickly reach
affected communities, often the poorest and most remote on the islands, meant that the
project design had to be kept simple, and preferably based on tried and tested means of
reaching these communities. The ongoing Services Support Project (P084315, 2004–2010)
included a community-based basic infrastructure component that was helping communities
restore or develop basic infrastructure for the provision of social services. Furthermore,
IDA had added a cash-for-work component to the Services Support Project in 2008,
financed from the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (TF097191).

5.      The ECR project had three decisive design features: First, it built on and expanded
the scope of two tested interventions—cash-for-work and community-based basic
infrastructure - as these interventions would meet the requirements of an emergency
response. Second, it used a very experienced implementing agency, the FADC, which had
the proven institutional capacity to implement the project. Third, the ERC was well
targeted: the project used the fund allocation formula which parallels the inter-island fiscal
formula included in the 2001 Fomboni Accords, so as not to exacerbate any regional
tensions. Within the islands, it used a poverty ranking of communities on each island
provided by the Planning Commission based on household survey data. For the selection
of the poorest households in these poorest communities, a community-based selection
process was used. These three important design elements would ensure a successful
emergency response while laying the groundwork for a more development oriented follow
on operation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

6.    The PDO was to increase access to short-term employment and to basic social and
economic services in areas affected by the crises, both global and internally generated.

7.        The key performance indicators of project outcomes were the following:

          (i)      Provide manual labor employment to at least (5,600)4 11,000 beneficiaries
                   among poor segments of the population in areas affected by the global
                   economic crisis
          (ii)     Increase enrolment through the building and rehabilitation of schools or
                   classrooms by (2,400) 3,200.
          (iii)    Increase the number of people in project areas with access to an improved
                   water source by (2,000) 11,200.

        (iv)     Increase the number of people in project areas benefiting from improved
                 roads by (2,000) 28,000.
        (v)      Directly benefit at least (12,000) 53,400 people affected by the crises, of
                 which at least 40 percent are women.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators
and Reasons/Justification

8.       There were no revisions to the PDO and key indicators. However, as a result of
speedy implementation and the availability of a grant for additional financing to scale up
activities under existing components, the quantities/physical targets to be achieved under
each component increased from what was originally envisaged.

    1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.      The original project was intended to directly benefit 12,000 poor households
affected by the crises with special emphasis on benefiting women. This included 5,600
cash-for-work beneficiaries, 2,400 students enrolled in rehabilitated schools, and 2,000
people each in urban and rural areas with improved access to water. With additional
financing, the number of direct beneficiaries increased to 53,4005, including 11,000 cash-
for-work beneficiaries, 3,200 students enrolled in rehabilitated schools, 11,200
beneficiaries of improved water sources, and 28,000 beneficiaries of improved roads. The
project also benefited poor communities by building capacity of community organizations
for local development planning and for managing community-based sub-projects, as well
as in nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), engineering offices (les bureaux d’etudes)
and contracted firms (les entreprises) which all contributed to implementing the
subprojects.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.    The project was approved on June 1, 2010 and became effective on September 25,
2010, after the operational manuals were satisfactorily updated. The project comprised the
following three components:

Component 1: Social Safety Net (Cash-for-Work) (US$2.6 million, US$1.4 million
original credit + US$1.2 million additional financing)

11.     This component financed the implementation of a labor intensive (Projets à Haute
Intensité de Main d’Oeuvre) cash-for-work program designed to increase access to short-
term employment for poor households in areas affected by the global economic crisis and
consisting of activities selected by communities. Each subproject provided at least 25 days’
work per beneficiary household at a wage slightly below the going market wage of
KMF2000 per day. Wages accounted for 75 percent of the cost of each subproject. The
FADC validated the selection of subprojects and ensured they complied with safeguard
5
  The higher revised numbers are due to the inclusion of all members of the community as beneficiary of
improved roads, although only identified beneficiary households were originally included in the estimate
                                                   12
policies and were not on a negative list of investments. Subprojects included basic road
maintenance, light rehabilitation of feeder roads, prevention of soil erosion, etc. The FADC
contracted established NGOs to implement these activities and agencies involved in
implementation received training in sub-project planning, community organization etc.

Component 2: Community-driven Basic Development (US$4.1 million, US$2.9
million original credit + US$1.2 million additional financing)

12.     This component financed community-based infrastructure subprojects to increase
access to social and economic services among participating communities. It included the
rehabilitation and construction of small-scale basic social and economic infrastructure
subprojects identified by communities, such as classrooms and schools, small-scale water
supply and sanitation, feeder roads, and soil erosion activities. Component activities
covered the planning, selection, appraisal, implementation, and supervision of these
infrastructure investments for the benefit of selected communities, including support to
engineering design firms (les bureaux d’etudes) and contractors (les entreprises), as well
as grants for this purpose to community associations. The component also provided training
to members of community associations and staff of implementing agencies engaged in the
implementation of the above activities.

Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Audit
(US$1.25 million, US$1million original credit + US$0.6million additional financing)
13.     This component provided support in the form of technical advisory services,
training, and other material assistance for the project implementing agency, the FADC. The
FADC is an autonomous institution created by a presidential ordinance in 1993 as a public
service entity (organisme d’intérêt public) charged with providing financial, technical, and
material support to disadvantaged rural and urban communities. Its central office is located
in the capital of the Comoros, Moroni, and headed by a national executive director
(Directeur Exécutif National). Each of the three islands also has an office headed by a
regional executive director (Directeur Exécutif Régional). Policy guidance and overall
project oversight are provided by the Central Coordination Committee (Comité Central de
Coordination) whose members also constitute the Board of Directors of the FADC along
with representatives from the beneficiary communities and the government. The
component financed salaries/fees, travel expenditures, and training of FADC staff;
operating costs; and technical and advisory services such as technical audits,
M&E/assessments, and outreach and communication activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

16.     Project preparation. The project was processed with the accelerated and more
flexible procedures provided under OP/BP 8.00 for emergency operations. Emergency
procedures were justified given the need to mitigate the effects of food price and economic
crises and to rebuild local infrastructure after the political crisis. The project was able to
continue activities that were being successfully implemented in the FADC’s previous
World Bank financed operation, the Services Support Project, which had been designed for
the provision of basic social services for vulnerable communities and had added a cash-
for-work component during the food price crisis of 2009, with US$1million from the Food
Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (TF94537). The project was successfully implemented
by an autonomous agency, the FADC, which became the implementing agency of the
follow on Social Safety Net project financed by IDA.

17.     Design factors. The project’s design was based on the Bank Group’s past and
ongoing social protection and crisis response experience in the country and the Africa
Region, and more specifically on the Comoros Services Support Project that had included
community development and social protection activities. Experience from the Services
Support Project indicated a strong demand for small infrastructure sub-projects for the
provision of social services (such as classrooms and rural roads) in poor and remote
communities. There was also a demand for income-generating activities that were seen to
have immediate results (the Services Support Project had created 7,500 person-days of
work, benefiting over 600 persons within a year) and such activities had been successfully
piloted to mitigate the food price crises using a trust fund set up for the purpose. An
effective targeting mechanism, using poverty data and combining geographical and
community-based targeting, had been established for identifying the poorest households in
poor communities. Implementation capacity for these activities in an autonomous agency
was also an important factor in project design, as the main lesson learned from previous
operations in the Comoros was that the implementation capacity of the government was
weak, particularly to respond effectively in times of crises.

18.     Quality at Entry. There was no formal Quality at Entry assessment done for this
project. Quality at Entry is assessed as satisfactory overall given its rapid response to the
emergency situation in a fragile state, as well as the fact that it was based on successful
ongoing project and its simple design. Effectiveness was made contingent on the updating
of the FADC’s existing operational manuals, which have enabled the project to roll out
implementation as soon as funds were available.

19.    Assessment of risks. The overall risk level of the project was rated Substantial.
Country-level systemic risks were identified as political instability (High) and poor
governance and corruption (Moderate), as the project would be implemented by an
autonomous agency that functioned with strong oversight from an independent board.
Project-level risks were rated Moderate to Substantial. The risk of project benefits not
reaching intended beneficiaries as a result of poor technical design of subprojects and lack

                                             14
of capacity for implementation of the components was rated Moderate and addressed
through multi-level targeting, community participation, transparency, and using proven
implementation capacity as well as adequate support and training of the implementing
agencies, including the FADC and NGOs. Other identified risks included weaknesses in
financial management (Substantial), including potential nonpayment to beneficiaries by
NGOs acting as implementing intermediaries, and shortcomings in the management of
procurement (Moderate) by the FADC. These were addressed through the development of
strong financial management and procurement systems, continued training and capacity
building of FADC staff, and external audits including independent technical audits, and
beneficiary consultations. Of the identified risks, only the ‘poor technical design’ risk
materialized in some sub-projects in the initial years, and thus the lack of implementation
capacity did materialize early in the project, but these were effectively addressed by the
implementing agency with the assistance from the Bank’s supervision missions (including
procurement training) and recommendations from the first technical audit.

2.2 Implementation

20.     The cash-for-work component was successfully implemented from the start, with a
pipeline of projects and experience gained from the implementation of the Services Support
Project and the associated trust fund referred to earlier. The community-based basic
infrastructure subprojects faced some initial delays due to difficulties in the recruitment of
les bureaux d’etudes that were responsible for the design of the subprojects, but this was a
temporary setback. By mid-2012, both components were on track for early completion, a
year ahead of schedule.

21.     The Bank responded to a request from the government to assist in alleviating the
impacts of catastrophic floods in early-2012 by reallocating funds (US$128,000) from the
cash-for-work component to the community-based basic infrastructure component, which
resulted in project coverage in areas not initially targeted by the project but which qualified
for assistance as a result of the new emergency. Further, Additional Financing of US$3
million was granted for the project in March 2013, along with a one-year extension of the
project’s closing date to June 30, 2015.

22.     Implementation was rated Satisfactory throughout the life of the project. The
project met almost all its implementation targets ahead of schedule. The project midterm
review was conducted in 20146 and the following external reviews were also undertaken:
(a) an assessment of the cash-for-work component and (b) technical audits for the
community-based basic infrastructure component, both at the beginning and toward the
end of the project.

23.     The review of the cash-for-work component was carried out in 2012 by an external
consultant, who visited a random sample of work sites, reviewed the works carried out, and
interviewed implementing NGOs as well as beneficiaries to discuss implementation issues
and confirm payment of wages. The review noted that the selection of beneficiaries and

 Scheduled somewhat late in the project, but facilitated learning by the new TTL who took over after the
mission
                                                   15
subprojects were satisfactorily carried out and that the FADC had put in place an effective
oversight mechanism to ensure the proper management of funds by the implementing
NGOs. The FADC representatives made frequent visits to the community for training and
supervision and used those opportunities for troubleshooting. A detailed description of
community capacity building is provided in the government portion of the Implementation
Completion Report (Annex 7). A telephone ‘help line’ was created for beneficiaries to
report any complaints related to the program (for example, non-receipt of wages) although
few complaints were received through this channel, possibly in view of the frequent direct
contact of FADC staff with the beneficiary communities.

24.      The first technical audit of the community-based basic infrastructure component
was carried out in 2013 by an external engineering consultant. Audit terms of references
included reviewing all documentation relating to the subprojects under this component and
visiting every subproject to review the quality of the work. The audit made a number of
recommendations, including improving technical specifications in the request for proposals
(for example, by developing standards for classrooms and toilets—such standards had not
existed until then); strengthening the supervision of contractors (les enterprises) by the
engineering design consulting firm (les bureaux d’etudes); filling up key vacancies in the
regional offices of the FADC; improving the utilization of the information system; and on
the filing and archiving of documents. The final technical audit (2015) noted that these
recommendations were followed up by the implementing agency and also gave an overall
satisfactory rating for the quality of small infrastructure works created under this
component. The FADC viewed the technical audit more as a technical consultancy to
improve implementation and followed audit recommendations to ensure a satisfactory
outcome for the subprojects.

25.     Participation and ownership of the communities in the creation of basic
infrastructure was notable and evinced not only in the community contribution of 10
percent7 of the cost of the project but also in the selection and oversight of construction of
the assets. Communities also assumed responsibility for the routine maintenance of the
assets, as there was no local government structure8or system of maintenance of social
infrastructure by the government.

26.     The performance of the implementing agency FADC was rated satisfactory in
financial and procurement management, M&E, and implementation of safeguards
throughout the project after some minor difficulties in the initial phase with the office in
Anjouan, which were promptly dealt with by replacing non-performing staff. The FADC
had progressively built up its own capacity and that of beneficiary communities to
implement community-based projects. It also provided adequate support and continuous
training to the intermediary implementing agencies, les bureaux d’etudes and NGOs, to
enable them to meet implementation timetables and standards. Having established its
capacity for implementation of this project, the FADC attracted other sources of financing,

and from the Union and Island Governments.9

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

27.     M&E design. The PDO, as well as outcome and intermediate indicators were
appropriate and easily monitored. FADC was appraised to have an adequate monitoring
system for the purpose. The system covered (i) management of sub-projects
implementation (from selection of beneficiaries and identification of sub-projects to their
completion); (ii) management of the annual work program; (iii) management of contracts
with local consulting firms (les bureaux d’etudes), contractors (les entreprises) and NGOs;
(iv) preparation of detailed monthly and quarterly progress reports; and (vi) monitoring
performance of outcome and intermediate results indicators. The system enabled the FADC
to prepare the reports needed for monitoring the project’s physical and financial progress
as well as intermediate and final results. The system had been progressively improved
under the project and FADC will further upgrade this system to automatically link physical
progress with procurement and financial management under the new IDA Social Safety
Net Project (P150754). Evaluation of project implementation was covered by an
assessment of the cash-for-work component and two technical audits of the community-
based basic infrastructure component, both of which seem appropriate for evaluating the
results of an emergency operation.

28.     M&E implementation. The successful implementation of the management
information system (MIS) can be deduced from the regular reporting of results indicators
right from the beginning of the project and informative half-yearly reports regularly
prepared by the FADC based on the MIS and shared with the Bank. Each report consisted
of a summary of the activities undertaken during the previous six months and their physical
and financial achievements, the status of the result indicators, as well as the plan for the
next six months. Details of activities under each subcomponent were provided in the main
report. Apart from the routine monitoring activities, an assessment of the cash–for-work
component and two technical audits covering the community-based basic infrastructure
component, both by external consultants, were carried out as planned.

29.     M&E utilization. The M&E system made it possible to troubleshoot lagging
performance by one of the islands at the start of the project and also highlight and address
the initial slow progress in the community-based basic infrastructure component. The
assessment confirmed the satisfactory implementation of the cash-for-work component and
the technical audit made substantive recommendations for improving the implementation
of the community-based basic infrastructure component. The recommendations on the MIS
and other findings of the first technical audit were addressed by the FADC to the
satisfaction of the auditor, who noted overall compliance in his final audit report. It is
noteworthy that the technical audit was a detailed process evaluation with the audit team
visiting every one of the sub-projects, and the implementation of its recommendations

  These funds were administered in parallel and targeted poor communities that were not reached by the
IDA project.
                                                   17
enabled the FADC to greatly improve the management and outcomes of the infrastructure
sub-projects.

2.4. Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

30.     The project complied with the safeguards that were triggered: Environmental
Assessments (OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). The Government
prepared and disclosed an Environmental and Social Management Framework and a
Resettlement Policy Framework and developed social and environmental operational
guidelines to be observed during implementation, in accordance with Bank standards. The
FADC appointed a safeguards specialist to ensure implementation of the frameworks. A
screening process was put in place during the subprojects identification stage and
environmental and social assessment reviews were conducted alongside the technical audit.
Safeguard measures were included in bid documents and contracts and field visits to
subprojects noted the adequacy and consistency of mitigation measures used to manage
any negative impacts of the subprojects. There was no resettlement as a result of project
activities.

31.     Citizen engagement and social accountability. To reinforce accountability and
transparency of project activities, the FADC staff were trained in citizen engagement and
social accountability. The operational manual included guidelines for community
monitoring and complaints redress mechanisms. Positive social impacts were noted,
including integration of women in community activities; democratization of local decision
making; and improved community capacity for planning, executing, and maintaining
public social infrastructure.

32.      Procurement. Although the procurement risk was rated High due to the country
and business environment, the performance of the FADC in procurement is rated
Satisfactory as the FADC continued to demonstrate its ability to implement procurement
activities according to plan and follow up on the recommendations of post-procurement
reviews. For contract management, all recommendations, including one for the
appointment of a contract supervisor, were implemented, which significantly reduced
delays in contract execution. The FADC has successfully implemented several small-scale
social and economic infrastructure subprojects using local contracting firms (les
entreprises) in the past and it continued to improve the efficiency of this innovative
procurement modality. In addition, in this project, the FADC also contracted NGOs for
implementing the cash-for-work program and the results were satisfactory.

33.     Financial Management. An overall assessment carried out at project closure rated
the performance of the FADC related to Financial Management as Satisfactory highlighting
that (a) the FADC fiduciary staff conducted the necessary activities in accordance with
their terms of reference, (b) the operation has been regularly and properly recorded from
an accounting point of view during the life of the project, (c) the FADC appropriately
replenished the designated account when needed, (e) the institution submitted Interim
Financial Reports on time throughout the life of the project and in accordance with
standards, (f) audit reports have been conducted annually by qualified external auditors
throughout the life of the project, and (g) no complaints about violation of the Governance
                                            18
principles nor any act of corruption have been raised at any point. Annual audits have been
performed on a regular basis, in compliance with the Bank’s rules, and no major financial
issues have been identified. The overall financial management performance has been rated
satisfactory consistently.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34.     In response to a recommendation from the technical audit, the FADC management
met with the different stakeholders to try and develop a maintenance program. As a result
of strong community ownership of the assets, routine maintenance of the basic
infrastructure created under the project has been assumed by the respective communities
concerned. Each primary school also has a director who is responsible for ensuring regular
maintenance of schools. However, the government does not have a system in place or a
budget for regular maintenance of social infrastructure and, in particular, for infrastructure
created by communities. The lack of support for maintenance is systemic and not confined
to the assets created under the project. In discussions of the ICR mission with the Ministry
of Finance, it was agreed that there was a need for each ministry to set aside a small
proportion of the government infrastructure budget for the maintenance of existing assets.

35.      Institutional capacity building, particularly of the FADC staff, has continued with
Bank support, with good effect. The capacity, transparency, and effective work of the
institution at the community level is well-recognized in the country, which has allowed it
to continue to enjoy autonomy and support of the government under different
administrations and throughout political uncertainties.

36.     A new IDA-financed Social Safety Net project which became effective on July 4,
2015, continues to work with the FADC to meet new challenges in the delivery of essential
social services and provide assistance to the country’s poorest communities. Its objective
is to increase poor communities’ access to safety net and nutrition services. Building on
the cash for work experience, the project provides (i) support for the establishment of a
productive safety net that will provide selected poor households with cash for work
opportunities over three years with a view to strengthen their productive capacity while
improving the productive infrastructure and climate resilience of their communities, (ii)
improve the nutrition of children under 5 years of age, and (iii) strengthen the institutional
capacity for safety net management, coordination and monitoring and evaluation. Given
other development partners’ engagement in small infrastructure (e.g. UNICEF, EU etc.),
the new project does not include new infrastructure but provides some funding for disaster
response through cash for work and the rehabilitation of damaged community
infrastructure.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37.     The relevance of the project objectives—to provide access to short-term
employment and basic social and services —was High at the time the project was prepared
in the aftermath of the successive crises. They continue to be highly relevant in the context

                                             19
of a country with widespread poverty and high vulnerability to natural disasters which
continues to lack social services and social protection for the poor and vulnerable given
recurring natural disasters, political instability, and global macroeconomic volatility. The
project objectives are consistent with the Bank’s global objectives of reducing poverty and
promoting shared prosperity, and are also reflected in the Government’s Poverty Reduction
and Growth Strategy (2009). They also fit within the Government’s draft Social Protection
Policy (2014) which includes labor-intensive public works and cash transfers to vulnerable
households as a priority and was developed with broad support from development partners.
Further, the objective of reducing social vulnerability is one of the two pillars of the Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy (FY14 – FY17) with Comoros. Providing employment
through cash for work and support to public works that build productive assets (with a
focus on increasing agricultural productivity and promoting environmental protection)
continue to be key elements in the recently approved Comoros Social Safety Net Project,
confirming the continuing relevance of the ECR Project’s objectives.

38.     The relevance of the project design is substantial. The project was designed in
response to the country’s needs to cushion the impact of multiple crises on the most
vulnerable sections of the population. Such communities and households were being
successfully targeted by strategies developed under the Social Services Project and hence
building on that experience was appropriate. Keeping the design simple by focusing on two
key service delivery components that were in high demand and selecting an implementing
agency that had demonstrated capacity in the previous Bank-financed Services Support
Project also proved to be a good approach. While there were other possible mechanisms
for social protection such as conditional cash transfers, it would not have been appropriate
to experiment with new initiatives in the context of an ECR Project and a country with
weak implementation capacity. There were no policy or strategy changes after project
approval that required any changes in project design.

39.     Implementation of the project exceeded expectations with physical and financial
targets being met by the FADC before the closing date, so much so that the Bank was able
to accede to the government’s request for additional financing. Moreover, quality,
transparency, and community ownership were important characteristics of project
implementation. Demonstrating capacity and a process to get things done in a difficult
physical (remoteness of the islands and communities within them) and political milieu was
valuable in itself. It also established an avenue for other donors and IDA to continue their
engagement with development in the Comoros. The unique institutional features of the
FADC, with its autonomy from government interference in operations while enjoying
government support, its presence on each of the three islands, its credibility with
communities, and the multi-sectoral composition of its board, which includes
representatives of the beneficiary communities and a broad set of sectors of the
government, was also an important aspect of successful implementation.

40.    The relevance of the project is therefore rated as High.




                                              20
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

41.     The ECR Project sought to increase access to short-term employment and to basic
social and economic services in areas affected by the crises, both global and internally
generated.

42.     At closing, the project over-achieved all of its project development indicators with
direct project beneficiaries of 67,926 (about 10 percent of the population) against a target
of 53,400, including:

            12,343 cash-for-work beneficiaries (target of 11,000);
            3,686 students enrolled in new/rehabilitated classrooms (target of 3,200);
            10,815 people in rural areas with improved water supply (target 11,200); and
            41,029 people benefitting from improved roads (target of 28,000).

43.      Details of project outputs are provided in annex 2. The results chain assumption is
that cash for work would provide short term income opportunities for poor beneficiaries,
at least half of whom were women, by increasing access to short-term employment in areas
affected by the global economic crisis. This was achieved. The project created 309,900
person-days of employment for 12,343 beneficiaries of which 62 percent were women. An
assessment of the implementation of this component confirmed that the targeting process
was effective in selecting poor households affected by the crisis that the works had been
satisfactorily executed, and that beneficiaries had effectively received the payment for the
25 days of work at a daily wage of KMF 2,000 as promised. A beneficiary assessment
conducted by the FADC revealed that beneficiaries primarily used the money received to
purchase food and that the public work opportunity was the first paid employment for many
of the beneficiaries.

44.     The assumption behind the basic infrastructure sub-project component was that the
outputs would create or restore access to basic economic and social services. These results
were achieved. Fifty-four community-based subprojects were completed (against a target
of 48), including 87 classrooms (against a target of 60), 18 community water points (target
9), and 10.44 km of roads rehabilitated (target of 14 km). The number of beneficiaries for
each of the social infrastructure works met or exceeded targets10. Moreover, there was
considerable community capacity building, ownership, and participation in project
implementation, which ensured that the subprojects selected for implementation were of
high priority to the community. In many of the communities visited, schools still followed
the shift system (morning and afternoon classes) because of a shortage of schoolrooms.
The FADC also received requests from more communities for employment and basic
infrastructure than it could accommodate in the project, although project coverage was
significant. The cash-for-work component, besides reaching more than 100 percent of the
end of project beneficiaries, is estimated to have reached 30 percent of the pool of poor

10
   Sub-projects were implemented in targeted poor communities and all members of the community were
counted as beneficiaries for roads and water projects. For schools, all children utilizing the new/improved
classrooms were counted as beneficiaries, while individual beneficiaries were counted for the cash for
work.
                                                    21
beneficiaries11who could be eligible for the program on Grand Comore, 42 percent on
Anjouan, and more than half on Moheli. Basic infrastructure subprojects were implemented
in 15 percent more communities than was targeted under the project nationwide, and
covered 13 percent of all eligible communities on Grand Comore, 26 percent on Anjouan,
and 58 percent on Moheli.

45.       Achievement of the PDO is rated as High.

3.3 Efficiency

46.     The project’s appraisal document did not estimate a rate of return on the grounds
that the type and number of subprojects could not be known beforehand. It noted that
several process features (for example, the FADC’s method for community-managed
development) and the selection of poor households and communities would ensure
efficiency and high rates of return. These assumptions have proved to be largely valid. The
targeting system was successful in selecting some of the poorest populations as seen from
the beneficiary assessment which details how the additional income was spent primarily
on food, reached single women with large households, and provided first time paid
employment to several of the beneficiaries. The speed of project implementation is also an
indicator of the project’s efficiency, as well as the full and immediate utilization of social
and economic infrastructure (schools, roads and improved water sources) by communities.

47.    ,Further, an economic analysis was prepared in 2011 for the ICR of the Comoros
Services Support Project12 which computed rates of return for projects identical to those
implemented here as follows13:

         Rural roads. 53.7 percent (benefits include the creation of direct jobs, increase in
          product flows and people movements, the creation of new economic activities,
          and so on).
         Improved water sources. 27.6 percent (benefits include the reduction of health
          care costs associated with the use of safe water and the reduction of the time spent
          fetching water).
         Schools/classrooms.14 The impact on households is realized mainly by the
          reduction of time students spent walking to reach school and attendance benefits.
          The ECR Project was also instrumental in helping the Ministry of Education
          develop standards for wider adoption in the country, increasing the cost-
          effectiveness of all future school buildings.

48.     The cash-for-work activities, which were satisfactorily implemented according to
the external review, effectively transferred 75 percent of the financing of this component15
directly as wages to very poor beneficiaries who were affected by the crises. This ratio
compares favorably with cash-for-work programs in other countries (example, 60 percent
in India’s Employment Guarantee Scheme). The average wage of KMF 2,000 was probably
somewhat on the high side, based on the analysis of an appropriate wage rate for the
recently approved Social Safety Net Project. The utilization of wages (overwhelmingly for
food and some toward education and health expenses) also confirms the efficiency of the
beneficiary targeting.

49.     The technical audit of the community-driven basic infrastructure project
component rated the overall quality of the basic social infrastructure as Satisfactory,
although the first audit noted several points for improvement in the execution of
subprojects. Administrative shortcomings included poor record keeping (but with
considerable improvement between the first and second audits) and delays in
implementation (about half the projects required an extension or supplementary contract to
complete the work). Technical shortcomings included lack of standardization of design,
inadequate and poorly designed toilet facilities, and shortcomings in provisions for
drainage (all corrected after the first audit). The emergency works undertaken after the
floods in 2012 did not adhere to the design and supervision standards of the other works
under this component, but accounted for less than 5 percent of the budget for the
component.

50.     Project management costs exceeded the 18 percent targeted at the outset and
together with the 7 percent supervision and implementation costs of the subprojects
(incurred by les bureaux d’etudes and NGOs/les entreprises) appear to be high in absolute
terms. However there are several mitigating factors to explain management costs: the poor
accessibility of targeted communities and resultant high transportation costs; lack of
technical capacity for implementation of the subprojects resulting in considerable support
to implementing NGOs/contractors; frequent visits and supervision required to ensure
transparency; and proper accounting during implementation. Further the global economic
crisis had increased the costs of all inputs, particularly transportation. Overall the project
was efficiently executed despite a context of low capacity and poor infrastructure.

51.     Internationally, the cost-effectiveness of public works programs has been
calculated based on data sets from countries as diverse as Ethiopia, India, Liberia, Niger
and Sierra Leone16. Four measurements have been used: (i) The average share of wage
costs for some successful public works programs in low income countries ranges from
around 60% to 85%. Comoros ranks high with 75% of costs going to wages. (ii) Targeting
performance measures the proportion of wages that went to beneficiaries in the two poorest
deciles of the population. Programs range between 87% (Ethiopia) to 67% in Bangladesh.
While no exact data exist for Comoros, given the targeting process (selection of poorest
communities on each island, community selection of poorest households within these), the

15
  Other expenses include cost of materials, equipment, and so on.

others, 2013, The World Bank, Washington DC
                                                 23
low daily wage rate and the results from the beneficiary assessment (including the use of
the cash), it is reasonable to assume the targeting efficiency in Comoros was at least as
good as in the other countries. (iii) Net wage gain measures the share of gross wages
received by participants after taking into account any income that would have been
expected in the absence of the program. International evidence ranges widely, from 50%
in the Jefes Program in Argentina (where more work alternatives are available) to around
75% in India, 79 in Sierra Leone and 93 in Liberia. Liberia’s high percentage reflects the
fact that approximately three-quarters of the program participants had no other income or
employment before the program began, and so forgone earnings were very low. A majority
of the Comorian beneficiaries seem to have been in a similar situation. (iv) The indirect
benefits derived from public work programs are more difficult to measure but have been
estimated to be around 80-85 percent in Ethiopia, Liberia and Niger. It is difficult to assess
this measurement for the UoC.

52.    Overall, efficiency is rated Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

53.    The relevance and efficacy of the project were high. The technical audit noted
shortcomings in efficiency in the execution of the small infrastructure subprojects as
discussed in section 3.3, but accepted that most deficiencies had been corrected and that
the quality of works was Satisfactory. Overall, the outcome is rated as Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

54.     The project contributed to short-term income generation for poor households in the
poorest communities of the country and put in place some basic social infrastructure in
these communities. By ensuring that more than half the beneficiaries were women, the
project, according to the beneficiary assessments, increased the bargaining power and
status of women within households. The process of developing local development plans
resulted in engaging communities in a dialogue about development priorities and building
their capacity as well as their ownership and interest in realizing these plans, for example,
by seeking funds from other sources for items included in the plan.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

55.      In this project, IDA supported the FADC for a fourth successive phase in its
institutional development, the previous rounds also being financed under IDA projects, the
most recent from 2007 to 2011, during which the FADC successfully implemented the
Services Support Project. Successive investments in the institution have built different
types of capacity (e.g. monitoring, procurement) to execute development projects
successfully, for which there does not appear to be another parallel in the Comoros. As a
result, the FADC is sometimes called on to act as interlocutor for the government in its

                                             24
discussions with other donors and has been used by other donors to implement community-
based development projects.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

56.    Investment in the preparation of local development plans had the unintended effect
of motivating communities to implement the plans by raising funds for activities included
in those plans from other sources, including approaching other donors for funding. The
implementing agency noted that the requirements of the environmental assessment raised
the quality of works.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

57.     The FADC completed two beneficiary assessments covering about a third of the
beneficiaries under the cash-for-work component. The assessment revealed that
beneficiary households were large, with five children on average. Agriculture and family
support (often remittances) were the main sources of income. For several of the
participants, this was the first paid work in their lives. Beneficiaries were happy to receive
the KMF 50,000 each earned under the cash-for-work component. The income was spent
on food (75 percent of beneficiaries), education (9 percent), health (8 percent), and other
expenses (7 percent). Beneficiaries regretted that the duration of the work was short (25
days) and would have liked for work to be available for 75 days, to be able to save money
to invest in a small business or income-generating activity.

58.    Both the cash-for-work beneficiary assessment and technical audits of the
community-based basic infrastructure component included extensive meetings with
beneficiaries, including visits with every community in which infrastructure subprojects
were implemented. Bank missions, especially procurement staff, also regularly visited
communities and talked with beneficiaries.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

59.     The cash–for-work component augmented incomes for poor families adversely
affected by the crises and there is no risk to that outcome in the future. The community-
based basic infrastructure works could face the risk of being adversely affected by a future
political or economic crisis or a natural disaster, which would impoverish communities
again, but these are risks that the project can neither anticipate nor fully mitigate. There is
also a moderate risk of insufficient maintenance of the assets. Continuing support to the
FADC under a follow-on Bank project to develop institutional capacity in new areas such
as social accountability mechanisms like community scorecards, and to strengthen capacity
for procurement, safeguards and the management information system will also ensure
sustainability of works, as FADC continues to focus its interventions on the poorest
communities. . The Agency also receives support from the Government. Overall risk to the
development outcome is rated Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

60.     Project design was appropriate to the needs and circumstances in the country at the
time of preparation and closely aligned with the government’s priorities. Lessons were
learned from the poor implementation of early IDA projects in the Comoros. The choice
of a relatively simple approach to meeting the emergency and crisis needs of poor
communities in the country through the cash-for-work component, while laying the
groundwork for more long-term and sustainable impact through the community-based
basic infrastructure component, proved to be appropriate. The progressive approach that
the team adopted by starting with an average size project and scaling it up with Additional
Financing based on good results is also noteworthy. Selecting an implementing agency
with a proven track record (the FADC was successfully implementing both components
under the Services Support Project) and further building its capacity was also a good
approach. Even though the project was prepared under the accelerated process (under OP
8.00), there also appears to have been a good understanding with the government on the
priorities and the mode of implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

61.    Bank supervision missions took place regularly (about twice each year) and closely
followed the project process. Significant contributions include troubleshooting poor
performance by the local offices of the FADC, including the early assessment of the cash-
for-work component and the technical audits of the community-based basic infrastructure
component. The latter audit provided the basis for improvements in the implementation of
several aspects of this component including record keeping, standardization of some
designs, and contract management. The Bank was also able to meet the government’s
requests to provide assistance in flood-affected areas in 2012, not envisaged in the original
scope of the project, and also to meet its request for additional financing given the early
achievement of many of the project’s goals.

62.     In terms of documentation, Project Implementation Status and Results Reports
include limited information and do not adequately reflect the aide memoires, issues arising
from implementation, and support provided by the team. The counterparts in the FADC
appreciated the fact that the same task team leader managed the project from conception to
processing the additional financing, which they said gave the Bank the necessary
understanding of the country and project circumstances. They also appreciated the fact that
the Bank acted as a technical partner in the implementation of the project rather than just a
financier. The FADC noted that Bank supervision missions provided considerable
technical assistance in the areas of procurement and financial assistance and that they
would have liked to receive similar assistance with the engineering and community-based
development aspects of the project, particularly early in the implementation of the project.

                                             26
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

63.     Bank performance was Satisfactory, particularly in the selection of project design,
close supervision and incorporation of a technical audit. The shortcomings in project
documentation were minor in comparison and hence Bank performance is rated
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     For the purposes of the project, the Government’s performance was satisfactory in
the quick processing of the project’s effectiveness, and of Additional Financing, effective
oversight as part of the Central Coordination Committee (of the FADC), regular follow up
through closing mission meetings, and other supporting measures. It provided the FADC
the necessary support and autonomy to implement project activities. In fact, the
Government leaned heavily on the FADC to provide necessary input to the preparation and
implementation of other donor projects. The President visited some project sites. Although
political challenges and lack of financing have meant that the Government provides
virtually no services to remote rural communities through its Ministries for Human or
Social Development and does not assume any responsibility for the maintenance of social
infrastructure developed by these communities, the Departments of Finance and Planning
have provided solid support to the FADC to enable it to fulfill this gap to some extent. The
Government’s performance is therefore rated Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency and other Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

65.    The performance of the FADC is rated Highly Satisfactory. It has quickly and
adequately provided services in the most remote and poor rural communities, assisting
them in articulating and fulfilling their needs for basic infrastructure and income generation
in very difficult circumstances. Virtually no other part of the government is serving this
need and these populations, and is thus so highly regarded in rural communities as is the
FADC, by development partners (AfD, Japan, etc.), and last but not least central
government agencies like the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning Commission and
relevant line ministries.

66.     Moreover, the processes and implementation methods of the FADC have been
widely recognized to be transparent and effective. Its reputation is so well-established in
the Comoros that the FADC has been requested to provide training/support to other
implementers of Bank-funded projects (Ministry of Fisheries, Planning Commission) and
to help prepare projects for funding by other donors. Other funding agencies have requested
the FADC to implement projects for them or have adopted FADC procedures to implement
their programs. Effective leadership, staff skilled in Bank procedures, and ability to provide
support and capacity building to NGOs, consultants, and communities have all contributed

                                             27
to the effectiveness and reputation of the institution. Continued Bank support over a long
period has also helped stabilize the institution and build its capacity.

67.     The performance of les bureaux d’etudes, the consulting firms charged with
preparing the design and procurement dossier, was moderately satisfactory. Despite severe
skill shortages for engineers and technical specialists in the country, the sub-projects have
been executed to satisfactory standards. NGOs/les entreprises, responsible for
implementing sub-projects under the cash-for-work and community-based basic
infrastructure components respectively, performed satisfactorily with considerable support
and training from the FADC and les bureaux d’etudes. Notably, the FADC successfully
built capacity in these entities for project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

68.    The rating for the government is Satisfactory, and the performance of the main
implementing agency, the FADC, is rated Highly Satisfactory given its excellent
performance in a difficult country crisis situation. Hence, overall borrower performance is
rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

69.    Modified cash-for-work activities. The most important needs of disadvantaged
communities—those that are remote, poorly served, and have few opportunities for
employment—are for basic social infrastructure and employment/investment
opportunities. Reaching the poorest households in such deprived communities is especially
challenging. Cash-for-work programs may be useful even in a nonemergency situation (for
longer-term development) if a technically robust roster of public works selected by
communities can be built up and implemented through closely supervised intermediaries
(engineering consultants and contractors) as was done in this project. Building a savings
component into the program may have added development benefits.

70.    Community-managed development. In a situation where the government does
not assume the responsibility of ensuring the provision of basic social infrastructure in
remote and poor communities, the project demonstrated that community-managed
development is feasible even in today’s context and has highly desirable characteristics
such as creating assets that are of high priority to the community, engendering community
ownership and full use of the assets.

71.    Attention to Gender. The inclusion of indicators related to the participation of
women in the public works ensured that women were prioritized as beneficiaries. This
smart focus also helped to ensure that the weakest and most vulnerable households were
included. The overachievement of the targeted indicator may also reflect the fact that the
head and a significant proportion of FADC staff are female which may have also
contributed in some measure to the success of the organization.



                                             28
72.     Need for technical support to improve capacity for implementing quality
infrastructure works. The low capacity environment of the country meant that it would
have been beneficial for the implementing agency as much as its partner institutions to
receive more technical support for the works, specifically regarding engineering &
planning. While the project contributed somewhat to improving the capacity of local
partner institutions, more could have been done to directly enhance the growing capacity
of the various bureaus.

73.     Donor collaboration. Governments can get more value for each donor dollar and
reduce transaction costs if they can get donors to collaborate and fund more of the
successful projects/models of development in each sector. The Japanese and the French,
for example, have recognized FADC’s successful model for community development and
have routed some of their assistance in the same manner. Furthermore, the Bank’s Fisheries
project is using FADC to implement some of their community based activities.

74.     Implementing agency. The unique character of the implementing agency with its
capacity for semiautonomous operation despite strong government support and a multi-
sectoral board, including representatives of the beneficiary communities, is worthy of
emulation, especially in difficult economic and political circumstances. An implementing
agency experienced in handling Emergency Projects is a good resource in a disaster prone
country to deal with all potential/future shocks. The development of such an agency is also
one of the recommendations of the Bank’s Social Protection and Labor strategy.

75.     Market forces and contracting of NGOs. Even in a limited capacity context, there
is a supply response to the call for NGOs and technical consulting agencies to assist in
project implementation. With the assistance of the project implementing agency, these new
les bureau d’etudes and les enterprises managed to build requisite capacity, which is then
used in the wider country context. Intensive and continued training and ‘on the job’
supervision have contributed to developing the country’s capacity as a whole, to build more
solid small-scale infrastructure.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agency.
A draft ICR has been shared with the borrower/implementing agency. Although no
comments were received, the Borrower did prepare its own ICR (see Annex 7). It points
to the perceived strengths of the project, as described above. Frist, the project built on
earlier ones and thus there was a strong institutional capacity for implementation within
FADC. The authorities expressed appreciation for the rigor and professionalism of FADC
and underlined the importance of having decentralized implementation units on each
island to ensure deep penetration in the most deprived areas. They also highlighted that
the various mauals had also contributed to the quality of the basic infrastructure and cash-
for-work activities. Finally, the authorities pointed to the fact that there was continuity in
team leadership: the TTL who oversaw the former project also prepared the ECR and
thus had a solid understanding of the local context and key stakeholders.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

     1.4.1.1 The PAD did not estimate an economic rate of return as the type and number of
             subprojects could not be known beforehand. It noted that the project is expected
             to have a high social rate of return as a targeting mechanism was in place to
             reach those affected by the crisis, the most deprived communities, and the
             poorest households within them. It also factored that the FADC’s established
             processes for targeting the poor would ensure efficiency and high rates of
             return. These assumptions have proved to be largely valid.

     1.4.1.2 An economic analysis was prepared in 2011 for the ICR of the Comoros
             Services Support Project17 which computed rates of return for sub-projects
             identical with those implemented here as follows:

           Rural roads- 53.7 percent. Benefits include the creation of direct jobs and jobs
            induced by subproject construction, increase in product flows and people
            movements, the creation of new economic activities within the communities
            served by roads, the development of the key economic agents’ activities that are
            operating in these localities, and the impacts on the availability and prices of
            commodities.

           Improved water source- 27.6 percent. Benefits include the impact on health,
            including the reduction of health care costs associated with the use of unsafe
            water and the reduction of the time spent fetching water.

           Education. For classrooms, the impact on households is realized mainly by the
            reduction of time students spent walking to reach school. There are also
            attendance benefits as the communities are located in remote villages and
            inclement weather and flooded walkways are serious detriments to regular
            attendance of primary school age children attending school outside the village.
            The ECR Project was also instrumental in helping the Ministry of Education
            develop standards for wider adoption in the country, increasing the cost-
            effectiveness of all future school buildings.

     1.4.1.3 These estimates continue to be fully valid for the ECR Project as the subprojects
             are identical with those implemented under the SSP.

     1.4.1.4 The main objective of the cash-for-work program under Component 1 was to
             transfer cash directly to poor beneficiaries affected by the crisis, using an
             established targeting mechanism and adding an element of self-targeting by
             fixing a wage slightly below the minimum wage rate to attract only those
             households who were unable to find work otherwise. The component was
             satisfactorily implemented, with minor points noted by implementing agencies
             (les entreprises) during the ICR mission, notably the difficulty in maintaining

       the same workers over a period of 25 days continuously and the lack of
       durability of such small projects. The average wage of KMF 2,000 was
       probably somewhat on the high side (given that the project was implemented in
       rural areas), based on the analysis of an appropriate wage rate for the recently
       approved Social Safety Net Project (P150754). However, the component
       transferred 75 percent of the available funds for wages as planned, meeting the
       cash transfer goal and hence, there were limitations on the kinds of projects that
       could be financed. A post-implementation beneficiary assessment found that
       the majority of the cash received was spent on food. Beneficiaries noted that
       with more number of days of work, they may have been able to effect some
       savings for small productive investments at the household level.

1.4.1.5 Overall efficiency of the cash-for-work component appears to have been
        moderate. Perhaps efficiency could have been increased by adding a savings
        component to the cash transfer. Such a model is currently being piloted in the
        Comoros (Moheli) with French bilateral assistance.

1.4.1.6 The final technical audit of the community-driven basic infrastructure projects
        pointed out that the overall quality of the basic social infrastructure was
        satisfactory, but the first audit noted several points for improvement in the
        execution of subprojects. Administrative shortcomings included poor
        recordkeeping (but with considerable improvement between the first and
        second audits) and delays in implementation (about half the projects required
        an extension or supplementary contract to complete the work). Technical
        shortcomings included lack of standardization of design (corrected after the first
        audit), inadequate and poorly designed toilet facilities, and inadequate
        provisions for drainage. Some works had been accepted even though they did
        not meet the quality standards specified in the contracts. The emergency works
        undertaken after the floods in 2010 did not adhere to the design and supervision
        standards of the regular program. Supervision costs were on the high side (7
        percent), and oversight provided by some contractors was not fully satisfactory.
        The final audit noted that most of the recommendations made after the first
        audit had been implemented. The FADC noted that it had treated the technical
        audit as technical assistance and had learned how to address shortcomings in
        implementation of Component 2. Overall, the level of efficiency was acceptable
        in the context of low capacity and poor infrastructure. Further, given that the
        government was unable to provide basic services in remote communities, the
        community-managed model, though more difficult to implement, was virtually
        the only option available to provide such communities with basic social
        infrastructure.

1.4.1.7 Community selection and management of the subprojects, backed by close
        technical oversight, increased the cost of supervision and project management
        but have also increased rates of return to the investments. With regard to
        infrastructure management, management committees are formally set up in
        most cases and the committee members have received training in routine

                                         34
            maintenance and management of infrastructures. Despite the dynamism of local
            management structures, they lack the financial means to ensure adequate long-
            term maintenance of infrastructure, and there is an absence of local government
            or decentralized departments to provide necessary support.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      A beneficiary assessment was conducted by the FADC in 2012 to receive feedback
from beneficiaries of the cash-for-work activities, with a special focus on the impact of the
additional income accruing from the work and the cash transfers’ value as a social
protection measure in the aftermath of the crisis. The assessment was conducted on all 3
islands of the Union and covered focus group discussions of beneficiaries between 5 to 10
persons in 28 communities, with 215 respondents in total. In these 28 communities, 33
cash-for-work subprojects had been implemented and they provide income opportunities
for 1,650 beneficiaries.

2.      Methodology. A questionnaire was prepared for use by the survey staff, covering
the following categories:

       1) Profile of the respondents

       2) Food security situation of the household

       3) Utilization of wages received

       4) Suggestions and recommendations for improvement

3.     Communities for the survey were chosen randomly, and at least 50 percent of the
respondents were women.

4.      Sociodemographic profile of respondents. Respondents were between the ages
of 18 and 68 years. Most of the respondents had children and family size ranged from 4 to
12 persons. More than half the women were heads of their households and had more than
5 children on average. The majority of the male respondents had never had paid work till
their participation in the cash-for-work program. They survived on subsistence agriculture
and family support.

5.     Food security situation. The staple diet of the families was rice, bananas, and
cassava. The number of meals per day varied with the time of year and was often only one
meal a day.

6.      Utilization of cash received. Every respondent confirmed having received cash of
KMF 50,000. Their food security had improved considerably after the program and the
number of meals increased to two or three per day. More than 75 percent of the cash had
been spent exclusively on food. About 10 percent had been spent on education expenses
for children, 8 percent for health-related expenses, and 7 percent on other activities,
including for income-generating activities.

7.      Beneficiary response. Beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with the project and the
fact that it covered many persons in distressed circumstances. There was a perceptible
improvement in their food consumption during and after the work. However, they were


                                             37
concerned that they would not be able to sustain these improvements after the work
stopped.

8.      Conclusion. The assessment confirmed that poor and distressed families have
benefitted from the cash-for-work program and that it made an impact on their lives, at
least temporarily, particularly with regard to their food consumption. Beneficiaries
expressed the desire to have work for a longer period—75 days, for example—so that they
could save money to start a small business or other income-generating activities.

The Development Objective
The Project Development Objective is to improve access to short-term employment
and access to social and economic services in areas affected by crises, globally and
internally.

Project Components:

The 3 ECR (PURC in French) components are:
     A. Social protection (Cash for Work) component finances
   i. access to short-term employment in areas affected by the crises through labour
        intensive activities works
  ii. training of Execution Entity - ENEX
 iii. support to the Steering Committee (CPS) for identification of sub-projects,
        selection and prioritization of workers and site supervision.

    B. The Community Based Basic Infrastructure component that aims to improve
       access to basic socio-economic services, finances:
  i. Sub-projects to rehabilitate or build basic infrastructure identified by the selected
       disadvantaged communities that developed their “community development plan”
       under direct project funding.
 ii. activities aimed at developing the institutional and operational capacities of local
       communities particularly in participatory local planning

     C. The project management and monitoring and evaluation component intended
        to support
   i. monitoring and evaluation of both the results and impact of the project.
  ii. operating costs of the FADC and
 iii. technical assistance for technical and annual financial audits are also part of this
        component.

Implementation Experience:

The experiences gained during the three previous financing rounds (FADC I, FADC II,
FADC III) under earlier IDA projects constituted significant expertise comprising
operational and competent project managers. Moreover the successful implementation of
the Services Support Project and associated grant that financed basic infrastructure and
ash-for-work component provided useful experience.

The rigor and professionalism that have prevailed in the implementation of activities by
the FADC led to the achievement of results. No major problems occurred during the
implementation of the ECR Project and, all external financial audits were not subject to
reservations as required by the Funding Agreements. This is due first to the professional
quality and motivation of its staff but especially the clear and relevant working manuals
available (procedural manuals and implementation manuals). Furthermore, the presence

                                           40
   of decentralized units in each island (Regional Executive Secretariats (SER) allowed
   national coverage that allowed a high penetration rate in the most deprived areas.

   It is important to note that the Task Team Leader (TTL) at the time of project preparation
   was also the TTL of the implementation of the ECR project. The design of the ECR
   benefited significantly from this continuity due to a solid understanding of the local context
   and familiarity with key stakeholders and institutions.

   (ii) Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives;

   The project succeeded in achieving the overall objective which was to improve access to
   short-term employment and access to basic social and economic services in areas affected
   by global and internal crises.

         Impact on economic development

         Under Argent Contre Travail (A) (Cash for Work) project:
         Through the implementation of projects under Cash for Work,, the ERC (PURC) project
         created significant temporary or permanent employment through the recruitment of NGOs
         (NGO personnel) and the jobs generated by the Social Protection sites.
         The work done through the ECR (PURC) consisted in the development of feeder roads of
         interior villages, schools and public squares, environmental protection works, remediation,
         etc.with the following benefits:
              The rehabilitation of roads facilitated population movement and access. Some
                 communities made the roads using concrete.
              Development of agricultural tracks facilitated access in agricultural areas
                 contributing to the agricultural production of the beneficiary communities.
              The development of school grounds and fences improved student safety.
              The environmental protection work that consisted mainly in reforestation and
                 erosion control in hedges decreased soil degradation and runoff of rainwater,
                 improving soil fertility and contributing to the replenishment of groundwater.
              The establishment of ganivelle type of dam favored slopes in the beaches, which
                 decreased the rise of sea water in the village and coastal erosion.

Under Community Based Basic Infrastructure (Infrastructure deBase - IDB)
Schools

School infrastructure construction improved access to primary education and enabled the
resumption of classes in the communities affected by the disaster of April 2012. In addition,
the allocation of school furniture, trash incinerators and systematic provision of latrines
and water that accompanied the majority of buildings have improved the physical
environment in the three islands and improved environmental education and health.
Furthermore, all this has resulted in improved access conditions including the growth of
schooling for girls and their retention in the education system.
In total, 38 schools built to benefit 38 communities in which 95 classrooms were built
and equipped with school furniture, rubbish receptacles, incinerators and latrines
and water points to benefit 3,686 beneficiary students.

Feeder Roads
The coatings of feeder roads, construction of culverts, and road surfaces have improved the
living and sanitary conditions in poor communities. The buildings have greatly contributed
in improving the movement of goods and people in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
In total 21 feeder roads of 10.23 KM to benefit 41,029 people.

Water supply
The construction of reservoirs of drinking water distribution networks through standpipes
and the supply of drinking water gravity systems allowed the communities to have access
to water and has promoted increased hygiene and health.
In total 8 water supply tanks and 33 fountains were constructed for the benefit of
14,335

Dykes / ramp-lifting
In a geographical context marked by recurring flood risks, protection of goods and people,
ease of access by boats, construction of dams and ramp hoisting presents particular
economic significance. The construction of this infrastructure has been undeniably useful
for the fishermen of these areas that have suffered the destruction of property and the risk
of loss of lives.

Community Capacity Building :

Between 2010-2015, FADC identified and provided technical and financial support to 32
communities for the creation or restructuring 32 Steering Committees (Comités de Pilotage
- CP), 32 management committees (Comités de Gestion - CG) and 64 village development
agents (agents villageois de développement - AVD).
Members of the 32 Steering Committees, the village development agents, and members of
the management committees were trained in community management, financial
management and procurement, monitoring and evaluation; participatory evaluation and
development of local plans of development (PDL) and environmental management in the
3 SER which led to the realization of participatory surveys.
The objective is to strengthen the capacity of various actors at the local level to improve
their effectiveness in the identification, preparation, evaluation and implementation of sub-
projects capable of inducing a long lasting impact and in the life of communities and
promote greater stakeholder participation in local development processes, such as
participatory community planning, control and management of expenses.

The following modules were delivered to beneficiary communities :
   1. Community management training aimed to familiarize beneficiaries of the essential
       concepts of community management, identify suitable persons to staff committees,
       clarify the roles and responsibilities of the committees and familiarize them with
       the essential tools of community management.

   2.    Financial management training and procurement, which aimed to strengthen the
        capacity of members of the CP, CG, and AVD in the financial management of
        projects and beneficiary communities to initiate the principles of procurement.

   3. Training in monitoring and evaluation aiming to provide communities with the
      basic concepts enabling them to identify performance and impact indicators for the
      sub project, providing information on techniques of data collection and analysis as
      well as on the process of making subsequent decisions to allow participatory
      monitoring of community activities.

   4. Environmental Management Training which aimed to give members of the CP, CG
      and AVD basic knowledge on environmental protection techniques related to
      community management.

   5. Participatory evaluation training which aimed to provide CP members and AVD
      with the basics for conducting participatory surveys and the steps for developing a
      Local Development Plan.

   6. Technical maintenance whose objective was to provide technical support to the CP
      beneficiary of a project under the technical maintenance of the works.

The 32 targeted communities received technical and financial support for the conduct of
participatory surveys, the development and validation of their Local Development Plans.

                                             44
Following these sets of training teams of FADC Regional Officers supported communities
in carrying out participatory interviews and in the development of their Local Development
Plans. The process allowed 32 communities to recognize, identify problems and
socioeconomic specific needs by all members of the community, including vulnerable
groups. The process also allows the community to identify their existing capacities
(material, financial and human) and those required to solve priority problems in the village.

The results of this participatory survey process allowed communities to identify and
classify the priority actions of the community and the baseline (indicators). The SER
worked with the CP and AVD to draft the 1st draft of the Local Development Plans (PDL)
and organize community outputs. FADC developed the PDL on the basis of the 1st draft
and submitted them to the Management Committee (CR) for approval to the 3 SERs. After
integrating improvements made by the members of the CR, FADC edited and finalized the
PDL and then made 3 copies.

The 32 village communities carried out the validation of PDL by acclamation in an open
ceremony attended by local authorities and partners. The purpose of this ceremony was to
validate the PDL but also to popularize the investment plan and sensitize partners to get
involved financially and technically in the implementation of the priority needs expressed
by the communities.
Among other committees, beneficiary communities of basic infrastructure were formed
for (i) basic hygiene, protection of sources and prevention of diseases related to water, (ii)
the operation, maintenance and maintenance of the structures.

(iii) Evaluation of the borrower's own performance during the preparation and
implementation of the operation, with special emphasis was lessons learned that may be
helpful in the future;

a)    Government involvement

The FADC has establish a good institutional reputation vis-à-vis the authorities.
National and island authorities have always shown a very positive appreciation of FADC.
Through its statutes, the FADC is under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance and the
General Planning Commission. However, the latter, gives FADC autonomy in daily
management and operational decisions as detailed in the Operational Manuals, leaving
FADC free from political influence.

At the time of its creation in 1993, the Statute of FADC put it under the Ministry of Finance
through the General Planning Commission. Recently it was directly attached to the
Presidency of the Union. In the preparation and in the execution of the ECR project, FADC
received strong support from the latter in particular and Government in general, protecting
it against any adverse political obstacle which could affect the achievement of project
objectives.

The Comorian government especially the president of the Union of the Comoros and the
Vice President in charge of the Ministry of Finance, have mobilized en masse members of
the government, the Comorian parliament to take all necessary steps to achieve project
objectives.

b)     Trust from the beneficiaries:
The beneficiaries describe FADC as an “Agency that keeps its promises". Indeed, FADC
has always met its commitments to respond to the requests of the beneficiaries as soon as
it was decided to execute them. FADC had committed to realize 220 projects under Cash
for Work modalities, 48 basic infrastructure works (IDB) and 32 Community Development
Plans for the benefit of the poorest communities and in the end managed to complete 246
under Cash for Work (ACT) project, 69 basic infrastructure (IDB), and 32 Community
Development Plans (PDL). Communities that have not yet benefited are very eager to be
selected for the ACT or IDB works and other communities have spoken directly to FADC
seek intervention.

In general, expectations of the communities as part of the execution of the ECR Project
have been met. Indeed, the involvement of the direct beneficiaries from the design phase
to the reception of the project was beneficial.

c)    The FADC:

FADC, as the execution agency of the Project has always pursued its mission as defined in
project agreements under the supervision of Central Coordination Committee (CCC) which
serves as the Board of Directors. In terms of project management, financial audits and aide-
memoires have noted managerial compliance with respect to signed project agreements,

                                             46
procedural manuals and the quality of interventions.

The project has left a significant mark in the approach to community managed development
for remote and poor communities. To ensure project sustainability, it is crucial that the
project supports the beneficiary communities for two to three years in income-generating
activities or in productive work by increasing the number of working days.

Lessons learned
Two important lessons were learned during the implementation of the ECR Project
(PURC). First, the initial funding was implemented faster than expected thanks to the
mobilization of the staff of FADC which led the Bank to grant the Comorian Government
additional funding. Second, the visibility of the activities of the FADC is an important
mechanism of accountability and transparency, which is used to restore trust between
Government at all levels and other stakeholders in particular the direct beneficiaries. Other
lessons include:

a) Monitoring and Evaluation. During the implementation of the previous t (Services
Support , a computerized monitoring and evaluation system (EMIS) was set up in addition
to the computerized Integrated Management System using a software package called
TOMPRO, acceptable to the World Bank. Excel was also used as database. However these
systems have limitations because there are no automated links between financial and
operational systems that will allow an automatic transfer of financial data in the Excel
database. FADC with the support of the World Bank will obtain software that will integrate
financial and technical data in a new project.

b) The environmental dimension has been integrated into the implementation of projects
and was one of the notable points that helped to increase the quality of achievements.
During the execution of the ECR Project (PURC), no involuntary displacement has been
observed and all the projects are implemented in accordance with environmental safeguard
guidelines.

c)      Cash-for-work and basic infrastructure community development approach
The project confirmed that these components may (i) provide a better quality of life for
poor households, (ii) be an effective mechanism for building small-scale in infrastructure,
(iii) build social capital and (iv) have an impact on development. Indeed, these operations
can serve as catalysts for a process in which the targeted communities, especially in rural
environment over time can participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of
projects that meet the common interest the community.

d)    Importance of targeting the most vulnerable workers in particular women:
Since the cost of a project is limited under high intensity manual labor projects (HIMO),
the mechanism targeting the most vulnerable beneficiaries was clearly successful and
achieved the desired objectives of the project. There was massive participation of women.
Priority was given to single women with dependent children.

e)    Links with the priorities and government policies:

                                             47
It is important to note that during the preparation of the project, FADC referred to the
national policies of the Union of the Comoros in basic infrastructure. In contrast, for social
protection component, no sectoral policy defines social protection in the Union of
Comoros.
However, Social Protection included in Axis 3 "Increasing access to basic social services
and household resilience" of the "Accelerated Growth Strategy for Sustainable
Development (SCA2D) ".

Among other things, the Comorian government with the support of the World Bank
prepared a paper on inclusive social protection policy based on a “rights” approach to meet
the basic needs of people and vulnerable groups. The document recommends new safety
net strategies, with particular attention to the promotion of provisions promoting the
resilience of communities to individual or collective shocks.

(iv) Evaluation of the performance of the Bank,

The World Bank, in addition to being the financier of the Project, has been a technical
partner for the Comorian government and especially FADC, which allowed the good
performance of the project in general and FADC in particular.

The World Bank team led 9 Supervision missions between July 2010 and May 2015. The
team responded proactively to the deterioration of the quality of FADC t management,
supporting various personnel changes, strengthening staff capacity and technical audit,
which has helped to ensure that development objectives were achieved.

The Bank team responded quickly and effectively during supervision missions and
different specialists including financial management, procurement and environmental and
social safeguard provided necessary technical support and identified problems. The
supervision mission of the World Bank during the period of the ECR Project (PURC)
allowed FADC to implement the project satisfactorily. The various bank supervision
missions have significantly contributed to the achievement of project objectives in
compliance with the project documents. The recommendations of the Bank's mission
allowed FADC to improve quality management, service delivery and especially the quality
of the design of the books. The Technical Audit report of Daniel DUPETY Architect
Consultant helped improve (i) the design of the works following the remarks made by the
audit, (ii) improvement of technical studies, (iii) improved archiving of files. Following the
recommendations, FADC organized various training courses for the benefit of the
companies responsible for the execution of works and engineering office in charge of
studies, control and monitoring of the works.

The Team of the World Bank mobilized additional resources to the project in 2013 to
strengthen ECR project (PURC) activities without changing the original purpose of the
project.

Overall supervision by the World Bank of the ECR Project (PURC) was satisfactory.

                                             48
During project preparation, the Bank team engaged with government and other partners to
ensure that project objectives were aligned with the country's development strategies and
well-coordinated with interventions in development.

The World Bank was not the only one to work with FADC. With the experience of FADC
in community outreach the French Government through the French Development Agency
has granted a donation in the form of budget support in 2013 to the Comorian government
for the implementation of a cash for work program.

(v) Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project.

It was found that much of the Comorian population has no access to basic social services.
A recent evaluation of social protection carried out by the World Bank analyzed access to
social services for each phase of the life cycle and identified significant gaps that hinder
the development of the country. Despite these needs, the Comoros have no effective social
protection system capable of meeting these challenges. The recent assessment of the Bank's
social protection policies and systems found that social protection programs cover only a
small part of the population, despite the high rates of poverty and vulnerability in the
country.


In addition, the study highlighted the lack of coordination in the sector and a lack of
available data and information on programs, while the analysis of the budget revealed the
predominance of funding by the external sector. Based on these observations, the analysis
concluded that the Government of the Comoros needed to develop a strategic framework
for its social protection system and improve coordination and information exchange
between its programs of social protection.

The Government has prepared a draft social protection policy, which stresses the
importance of developing a social safety net consisting of the provision of public work-
intensive labor and cash transfers to rural households, and initiatives to reduce malnutrition
among young children and pregnant women. The policy also highlights the importance of
creating jobs, especially for youth and women, and to increase access to health services
and basic education.

The Comoros social safety net project will be prepared on these lessons and support the
government in the transformation of cash-for-work in a social net intervention of
productive safety net which increases household incomes at the same time strengthening
their basic productive assets and developing community nutrition activities
