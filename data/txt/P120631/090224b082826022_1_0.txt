                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project supports both cash-for-work activities and community-based sub-projects. Given the project's satisfactory performance, an Additional Financing (AF) of US$ 3 million was
                         approved by IDA in March, 2013. The AF became effective on July 8, 2013. The results framework in ISR reflects the revised targets. The closing date of the Project is June 30, 2015.

                         The project is proceeding well. All indicators have progressed and some have already exceeded the end target. The operational cost ratio is slightly higher than the agreed target, but
                         slowly coming down as activities increase (financed with the AF).

                         It is very encouraging to note that FADC has been able to capitalize on its success and attract additional sources of financing including Euro 1.0 million from the Budget support
                         provided by the French bilateral agency (Agence Francaise de Developpement, or AFD) , $1.2 million from the Co-Management of Coastal Resources for Sustainable Livelihood
                         Project (CoReSuD) as well as other funds from the Union and Island Governments. FADC is now also helping the Government implement a Project Preparation Advance for a

                         proposed DPO financed by IDA. The mission discussed with the Ministry of Finance the possibility of FADC receiving more funds from other sources as their implementation capacity
                         is not fully used, particularly for community infrastructure. We will follow up on this issue during upcoming missions.
