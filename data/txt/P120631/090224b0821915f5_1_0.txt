                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project supports both cash-for-work activities and community-based sub-projects. Given the project's satisfactory performance, an Additional Financing (AF) of US$ 3 million has
                         been approved by IDA on March 28, 2013. The AF became effective on July 8, 2013 and FADC has started implementation. The results framework in this ISR has been updated to
                         reflect the revised targets. The closing date of the Project has been updated to June 30, 2015.

                         The project is proceeding well. All indicators have progressed and some have already exceeded the end target. The operational cost ratio is slightly higher than agreed at this point

                         because of the recent initiation of the activities financed under the Additional Financing. However, this ratio is expected to return below the agreed indicator of 18% at the beginning of
                         2014 when disbursements for a number of sub-projects that are under preparation will be made.

                         It is very encouraging to note that FADC has been able to capitalize on its success and attract new sources of financing including Euro 1.0 million from the Budget support provided

                         by the French bilateral agency (Agence Francaise de Developpement, or AFD) , $1.2 million from the Co-Management of Coastal Resources for Sustainable Livelihood Project
                         (CoReSuD) as well as other funds from the Union and Island Governments. FADC is now also helping the Government in implementing a Project Preparation Advance for a proposed
                         DPO financed by IDA.
