                         The objective of the Project is to increase access to short-term employment and to basic social and economic services in areasaffected by the crises, both global and
                         internally-generated.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project supports both cash-for-work activities and community-based sub-projects. The implementation of both the cash-for-work activities and the community-based sub-projects
                         remain Satisfactory. FADC's implementation performance also remains satisfactory: the fiduciary aspects (financial management and procurement), monitoring and evaluation,
                         internal audit as well as the implementation of safeguards are all rated Satisfactory.

                         The Union Government, the Governorates of the three islands as well as the communities report to be extremely satisfied with FADC's Project implementation and its benefits for the

                         population. FADC has actively responded to the impacts of catastrophic floods which devastated the country in early 2012 while maintaining the Project's objectives.

                         The Project has been implemented faster than initially anticipated. As of March 31, 2013, 89 cash-for-work sub-projects have been completed (the end-of-project target is to complete
                         110 cash-for-work sub-projects) creating 112,000 person-days of employment which have provided direct benefits to 4,500 individuals (of whom 59% are women) while another 45

                         community-based sub-projects have been completed (versus an end-of-project target of 32 community-based micro-projects).

                         An Additional Financing for US$3.0 million has been approved by IDA on March 28, 2013. It is expected to be come Effective by end-June 2013. As such, the Results Framework
                         included in this ISR has not been updated to incorporate the revised targets after Additional Financing. This will be done in the next ISR after the Additional Financing becomes
                         effective. The closing date of the Project has been updated to June 30, 2015.

                         It is very encouraging to note that FADC has been able to capitalize on its success and attract new sources of financing including Euro 1.0 million from the Budget support provided
                         by the French bilateral agency (Agence Francaise de Developpement, or AFD) , $1.2 million from the Co-Management of Coastal Resources for Sustainable Livelihood Project
                         (CoReSuD) as well as other funds from the Union and Island Governments (see attached aide-memoire).
