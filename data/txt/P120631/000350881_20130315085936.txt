﻿UNION OF THE COMOROS
EMERGENCY CRISES RESPONSE PROJECT
I. Introduction
1.    This Emergency Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide
an additional emergency recovery grant in the amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 2.0
million (US$3.0 million equivalent) from regular IDA resources to the Union of the Comoros for
an Emergency Crises Response Project.
2.    Additional financing: The proposed additional emergency recovery grant would help
finance the costs associated with scaling up the activities that are currently being successfully
implemented under the Emergency Crises Response Project (P120631) to further improve the
project's impact and development effectiveness.I More specifically, in areas most affected by the
crises, the additional emergency recovery grant would finance: (i) 150,000 days of cash
employment to benefit 6,000 individuals of whom at least half are women; and (ii) the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of at least 15 basic infrastructures facilities at the community
level to help restore access to basic social and economic services.
3.    Implementation and partnership arrangements: The entity responsible for the
implementation of Emergency Crises Response Project, the Fonds d'Appui au Developpement
Communautaire (FADC), would also be responsible for the implementation of the proposed
additional emergency recovery grant. FADC was created in 1993 to contribute to community
development and has an accomplished record of implementing cash-for-work activities and
community-based basic social and economic sub-projects. Since September 2010, FADC has
been implementing these activities under both the ongoing Emergency Crises Response Project
and the Emergency Food Security and Unemployment Support through Cash-for-Work
(P121550) financed in an amount of US$2.366 million from Japan Social Development Fund
(JSDF). The French bilateral agency (Agence Franqaise de Developpement) has recently
allocated 1.0 million Euro from its budget support operation to scale up FADC's cash-for work
program.2 FADC is currently the only institution in the Union of the Comoros with the
management, staffing, administrative capacity and decentralized structure necessary to
implement the additional grant on all three islands of the Union of the Comoros under
emergency conditions.
II. Background and Rationale for Additional Financing in the amount of $3.0 million
4.     Country context: The Union of the Comoros is a small post-conflict island country
(population 680,000), consisting of three islands. Its economy is characterized by geographical
1 The Emergency Crises Response Project benefits from an IDA Grant (IDA Credit H572-KM) in the amount of
SDR 3.5 million (SDR 2.5 million from regular IDA resources and SDR 1.0 million from IDA's crisis response
window) equivalent to US$5.31 million approved on June 1, 2010.
2 FADC's current disbursement capacity hovers around US$3.0 million per year so that FADC should have no
difficulty to implement this Additional Financing (US$3.0 million for 2 years) as well as 1 million Euro from AFD.

﻿isolation, limited resources, a small domestic market, a narrow export base and a high
dependence on food imports and remittances, which makes it vulnerable to domestic and external
shocks.  About half the population lives below  the poverty line, while poverty varies
significantly across islands and is generally higher in rural areas and in Anjouan, particularly in
the South. In 2009, the Union of the Comoros ranked 139 out of 182 countries on the UN
Human Development Index.
5.     Original Project: The original grant of SDR 3.5 million (US$5.31 million equivalent)
for the Emergency Crises Response Project was approved on June 1, 2010, and became effective
on September 25, 2010. The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to increase access to
short-term employment and to basic and social services in areas affected by the crises, both
global and internally-generated. There has not been any change to the original objectives, design
or scope. The project includes the following three components: (i) cash-for-work program; (ii)
provision and rehabilitation of basic infrastructures following a community driven development
approach; and (iii) Project monitoring and evaluation, and audits.
6.     Project performance: The project is reaching its development objectives at a faster pace
than originally anticipated. As of September 30, 2012, 71 cash-for-work sub-projects (versus an
end-of-project target of 110 cash-for-work sub-projects) were implemented, providing direct
benefits to about 4,000 individuals (of whom 53% are women) while another 16 community
based sub-projects were completed (versus an end-of-project target of 32 sub-projects). The
Government of the Union, the Governments of the three islands as well as communities report to
be extremely satisfied with the Project and its benefits for the population.
7.     For the past 12 months, the project has been rated Satisfactory in terms of both
implementation progress and likelihood of achieving development objectives. FADC is also in
full compliance with the loan covenants.
8.     Rationale for the proposed Additional Financing: The Union of the Comoros is
currently facing a very challenging situation created by the lingering effects of a succession of
crises. Prices of staple goods mostly rice, vegetable and meat which cover about 60 percent of
food consumption have increased by close to 10 percent in the past year. In early 2012, the
Union of the Comoros was also affected by severe floods which resulted in loss of income
opportunities and important damages to a number of critical infrastructures including schools,
small bridges and feeder roads. As a result, the vulnerability of the population has increased
substantially while poverty remains widespread -- particularly in rural areas. Forty percent of
children are estimated to be stunted due to malnutrition, which is particularly acute on the island
of Anjouan. According to an assessment by United Nations International Children's Fund
(UNICEF) about one third of the children under 5 years of age suffered from chronic
malnutrition in 2008.3 There is no evidence that the situation has improved in the last five years.
9.     Request for the proposed Additional Financing: Following a request from     the
President of Comoros and a letter from the Minister of Finance dated May 16, 2012, proceeds
from the project were used to actively respond to the impacts of the floods which devastated the
country in early 2012 -- while not compromising the achievements of the Project objectives. As
a consequence, disbursements have moved faster than initially anticipated. However, the heavy

des Comores. UNICEF Comoros, December 2008.

﻿rains impacted nearly all sectors of the economy with total damages estimated at US$20
million. 4
10.    To mitigate the impacts of the crises and the damages from the floods, the borrower
requested an additional emergency recovery grant to scale up the activities financed under the
Emergency Crises Response Project. More specifically, the incremental resources would finance
the rehabilitation of community-based infrastructure and the cash-for-work program while
directing incremental funds towards those most affected by the lingering effects of the successive
crises, including the more recent floods.
11.    Consistency with the ISN: The proposed Additional Financing is consistent with IDA's
Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for the Union of the Comoros for the period FY10-12, which was
presented to the Executive Directors on April 29, 2010. The objectives of the ISN are to: (i)
reduce social vulnerability and (ii) build state capacity and accountability. The ISN highlights the
impacts of the global economic crisis in Comoros and the negative effects of high food prices in
the context of declining remittances on the most vulnerable groups. It explicitly identifies the
Emergency Crises Response Project as an important instrument to provide rapid and targeted
support to affected households.
12.    Instrument and procedures: The proposed Additional Financing would deliver much
needed assistance by contributing to build and rehabilitate basic social infrastructure and to
preserve household incomes in affected areas on an emergency basis. Scaling up the activities
currently implemented under the Emergency Crises Response Project is a perfect means to reach
these objectives. Also, the flexible and accelerated procedures provided under OP/BP 8.00 are
vital to the rapid and effective implementation of the proposed Additional Financing. The
proposed operation is consistent with guiding principles of OP 8.00 including to: (a) address
major adverse economic and social impacts resulting from natural disasters and actual man-made
crises; and (b) continue Bank's assistance to alleviate poverty.
III. Proposed Changes
13.    Project Development Objectives. The Project Development Objective would remain
unchanged: to increase access to short-term employment and to basic and social services in areas
affected by the crises, both global and internally-generated.
14.    Expected outcomes. The Results Framework including the PDO level and intermediate
results indicators would remain the same as that of the Emergency Crises Response Project.
However, the indicator target values would be revised upward to take into account the
incremental activities from the Additional Financing. Table 1 indicates the new target for the
PDO level indicators. Annex 1 includes the revised Results framework including revised targets
for PDO level and intermediate results indicators. The Project Manual was updated prior
negotiations.

15.    Institutional arrangements. The institutional arrangements would remain unchanged:
the Fonds d'Appui au Developpement Communautaire (FADC) would implement the activities
under oversight from the Central Coordination Committee (Comite Central de Coordination, or
CCC), which is also the Board of Directors of FADC.
16.    Procedures Manuals. The Procedures Manuals used for the implementation of the
Emergency Crises Response Project would also be used to implement the proposed Additional
Financing. They include: (i) Administrative and Financial Manual (Manuel Administratif et
Financier); (ii) Operational Manual with chapters on Institutional Framework, Community
Development, and Monitoring and Evaluation; (iii) Direct Financing of Community Manual
(Manuel Financement Direct des Communautes); (iv) Social Protection Manual (Manuel
Protection Sociale); and (iv) Environmental Manual (Manuel de Gestion Environnementale).
17.    Activities. The total cost of the activities financed under the proposed Additional
Financing would be US$3.0 million, including taxes and duties. Table 2 provides a breakdown of
key changes in estimated costs.

18.    Financial management. Financial management of the AF would remain the same as that
used under the Emergency Crises Response Project. FADC has an experienced Financial
Management unit headed by the finance and administrative director (Directeur Administrative et
Financier, or DAF), who would be responsible for the financial management of the proposed
Additional Financing. FADC would maintain its financial staff, including the internal auditor,
during Project implementation. Independent auditors acceptable to IDA would continue auditing
7


﻿the accounts of FADC including the proceeds from the Additional Financing in accordance with
International Standards of Auditing.
19.   Disbursement. Disbursement arrangements under the Additional Financing would
remain the same as those used under the Emergency Crises Response Project. The proposed
Additional Financing would finance the Emergency Crises Response Project's single
disbursement category.
20.   Procurement. Procurement arrangements for the Additional Financing would remain
identical to those used for the implementation of the Emergency Crises Response Project.
However, procurement under the Additional Financing would be carried out in accordance with
the following World Bank guidelines: (i) Guidelines: Procurement under International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Loans and IDA Credits dated January 2011; (ii)
Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers dated January
2011; (iii) Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed
by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants dated October 15, 2006 and revised in January
2011; and (iv) the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement.
21.   A Procurement Plan with procurement methods or consultant selection methods,
estimated costs, review requirements, and a time frame for contract implementation has been
discussed and agreed for the additional financing between the Borrower and IDA.
22.   Safeguard arrangements. The safeguard arrangements for the proposed project would
be the same as those used by FADC for the implementation of the Emergency Crises Response
Project. In particular, FADC would screen all sub-projects to determine whether they trigger any
safeguard policies. The cash-for-work sub-projects that trigger any safeguard policy other than
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) would not be eligible for financing and the
community-based sub-projects that trigger any safeguard policy other than Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) or Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP4.12) would not be eligible for
financing. These are clearly outlined in the Environmental Manual (Manuel de Gestion
Environnementale).
23.   Implementation schedule. Implementation of the Additional Financing would start as
soon as it is effective and the closing date of the Additional Financing would be June 30, 2015.
IV. Appraisal Summary
24.   Economic and social assessment. The economic analysis and social assessment of the
sub-projects financed under the Additional Financing remain the same as those of the original
project.
25.   Technical assessment. Sub-projects financed under the Additional Financing would
benefit from FADC's cumulative experience in the technical design of sub-projects. The
Additional Financing would promote the use of simple, appropriate and environmentally sound
technologies and investments, to allow for ease in operations and maintenance of sub-projects.
26.   Institutional assessment. FADC would remain responsible for project implementation,
while the National Executive Director (Directeur Executif National, or DEN) would remain
responsible for day-to-day project implementation. The National Director would continue to be
8


﻿assisted at the national level by an administrative and financial director, a procurement specialist,
an internal auditor, a monitoring and evaluation specialist and an environmental specialist.
27.   Assessment of Financial Management. The Financial Management (FM) arrangements
for the Additional Financing would remain the same as those of the original project given their
effectiveness.
28.   An audit of the project would be carried out annually by an international auditing firm
acceptable to IDA in accordance with International Standards of Auditing. This audit would
cover the activities financed under the Additional Financing.
29.   Procurement assessment. The procurement arrangements for the Additional Financing
would remain the same as those of the original project given their effectiveness. FADC has
submitted to IDA a Simplified Procurement Plan to cover the first 18 months of project
implementation including the Additional Financing.
V. Environmental Category and Safeguards
30.   The environmental classification of the project would remain Category B.
31.   New activities financed under the Additional Financing would be remain the same as
those of the original project and the proposed Additional Financing would not trigger any new
safeguard policies. More specifically, activities financed under the Additional Financing could
potentially trigger the following safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)
and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). In addition, cash-for-work sub-projects would not
be eligible if they trigger Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).
32.   As the subprojects being financed under the Additional Financing are very small
(classrooms, community water sanitation, market place, rehabilitation of rural road in earth,
construction of water reservoir in community level etc.), the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
developed an Environmental and Social Manual under the original project, to ensure compliance
and the implementation of mitigation measures during the sub-projects cycle. This manual
contains: (i) detailed Safeguards Procedures for Inclusion in the Technical Specifications of
Contracts, (ii) the Checklist of Possible Environmental and Social Impacts form for the potential
identified subprojects, and (iii) relevant specific environmental and social mitigation measures.
The specific environmental mitigation measures for each subproject have been integrated in all
bidding documents and both Contractors and Supervisors have been compliant with
implementing the safeguards policies. The project's implementation of environmental and social
safeguards policies have consistently been rated as Satisfactory.
33.   In addition, no land acquisition was identified during the implementation of subprojects:
proper measures have been put in place to address any potential issues arising from potential
land acquisition. These measures include publicly disseminating the nature and type of sub-
projects to communities and local government, as well as publicly displaying land certificates at
least one month prior to commencing sub-project implementation. To date no rejections have
been noted by the PIU.
34.    During the preparation of original project, intensive consultations were held with the
affected population in the local communities and at the national level. Both ESMF and RPF
documents have been disclosed in all three islands of the Union of the Comoros and to the
Infoshop in July 2012. During the identification of sub-project to be financed, extensive
9


﻿consultation were held at the local community level on the design of sub-projects led by the local
authority and the PIU team. Under this Additional Financing, both the current Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) have
been re-disclosed to the Infoshop on January 30, 2013.
35.    FADC has the institutional capacity to manage the safeguard aspects brought about by
the proposed Additional Financing.

38.    Supervision, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements. Based on the above risk
assessment and due to the emergency context, the project would continue to be supervised
closely, including at least two supervision missions per year. FADC has the capacity to
successfully monitor the activities implemented under the Additional Financing.
VII. Terms and Conditions for the proposed Additional Financing
39.    The proposed Additional Financing would consist of a US$3.0 million grant from IDA.
The country financing parameters allow for 100 percent project financing, including taxes. The
financing parameters also allow for recurrent cost financing when required.
40.    The terms and conditions are as follows:
(i)    Condition for Effectiveness
a. The Subsidiary Agreement has been executed on behalf of the Recipient and the
Project Implementing Entity; and
(ii)   Covenant
a. Recruit within three months after effectiveness an auditing firm to review the
activities included in the proposed grant.
