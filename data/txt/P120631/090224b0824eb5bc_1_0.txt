                         approved by IDA in March, 2013. The AF became effective on July 8, 2013. The results framework in ISR reflects the revised targets. The closing date of the Project is June 30, 2015.

                         recommendations to further strengthen the community infrastructure's quality.

                         It is very encouraging to note that FADC has been able to capitalize on its success and attract new sources of financing including Euro 1.0 million from the Budget support provided
