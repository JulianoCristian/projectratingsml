Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project supports both cash-for-work activities and community-based sub-projects. Given the project's satisfactory performance, an Additional
 Financing (AF) of US$ 3 million was approved by IDA in March, 2013. The AF became effective on July 8, 2013. The results framework in ISR reflects
 the revised targets. The closing date of the Project is June 30, 2015.

 The project is proceeding well. All indicators have progressed and some have already exceeded the end target. The operational cost ratio is slightly
 higher than the agreed target, but slowly coming down as activities increase (financed with the AF).

 It is very encouraging to note that FADC has been able to capitalize on its success and attract additional sources of financing including Euro 1.0 million
 from the Budget support provided by the French bilateral agency (Agence Francaise de Developpement, or AFD) , $1.2 million from the Co-
 Management of Coastal Resources for Sustainable Livelihood Project (CoReSuD) as well as other funds from the Union and Island Governments.
 FADC is now also helping the Government implement a Project Preparation Advance for a proposed DPO financed by IDA. The mission discussed with
 the Ministry of Finance the possibility of FADC receiving more funds from other sources as their implementation capacity is not fully used, particularly for
 community infrastructure. We will follow up on this issue during upcoming missions.
 No issues.

 Overall Comments
 The targets for the original project plus the additional financing had been revised during the preparation of the additional financing. For some
 reason, the revised targets have not been reflected in the new ISR format. We have thus now included the revised targets in the ISR and updated
 the actual numbers as of April 30 2015.
