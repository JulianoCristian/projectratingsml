REPORT AND RECONMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO EMPRESA NACIONAL DE
TELECOMUNICACIONES
FOR A
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$15 million to
Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM) for a Second Telecommu-
nications Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's second lending operation
fr. the Colombian telecommunications syetem. The first was the US$16
million loan made in 1967 to TELECOM. It helped finance a modern long-
distance network and the improvement and expansion of local and inter-
national telephone, telegraph and telex services. Due to delays in build-
ing construction and late deliveries of equipment, the Closing Date of
this loan has been postponed by one year to December 31, 1971. The full
amount of this loan is now covered by Bank approved purchase orders and
the project is expected to be satisfactorily completed and the loan fully
disbursed by the new Closing Date.
3.        Bank missions to Colombia appraised the proposed project during
June-August 1970, and negotiations were held at the Bank during January
15-17, 1971. The Government was represented by Dr. Douglas Botero
(Ambassador to the United States), Ing. Humberto Chaves (Vice-Minister
of Communications), and Dr. Boris Plazas (Chief of the Communications
Division of the National Planning Department). TELECOM's negotiatiors
were Dr. Francisco Lozano (President), Dr. Emilio Saravia (Financial
Vice-President), and Dr. Augusto Gongora (Chief Planning Engineer).
4.        The proposed loan which would be the forty-fifth made to
Colombia would increase the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to
US$741.8 million (net of cancellations), of which US$572.4 million is
now held by the Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$19.5 million for
highways in Colombia. A summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
to Colombia and their status of disbursements as of March 31, 1971 was



-2-
included in nmy Report and Recommendation on the proposed loan for the
Caqueta Land Colonization Project (P-921), dated April 21, 1971.
5.        IFC has made 35 investments and underwriting commitments in
18 enterprises in Colombia, totalling US$18.5 million (net of cancella-
tions).
PAR II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
6.        Borrower:                Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones.
Guarantor:               Republic of Colombia.
Amount:                  The equivalent in various currencies
of US$15.0 million.
Purpose:                 To assist in financing the expansion
and improvement of the local services
and the long-distance network of the
Borrower.
Amortization:            20 years, including a four-year period
of grace through semi-annual install-
ments, beginning September 15, 1975
and ending March 15, 1991.
Interest Rate:           7¼- percent per annum.
Commitment Charge:       3/i4 of 1 percent per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        A detailed description of the Project is given in the attached
report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Telecommunications Project -of
the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones - Colombia" (PU 57a).
8.        TELECOM, established in 19l47 as a government-owned national
entity, is licensed to provide international and national long-distance
telephone, telegraph and telex services in Colombia and to provide local
telephone services in any area where the local authority concerned,
with the concurrence of the Ministry of Communications, permits it to do
so. Thus, with local and ministerial approval, TELECOM is allowed to
take over existing entities or to develop telephone systems in unserved
areas.
9.        The responsibility for providing local telephone services is
divided among many entities. More than 60 different entities, including
TELECOM, provide services to about 600,000 subscribers. More than one



-3-
half of these cntities oper3te 1,000 lines or less.    This fragnren-
tation of local services is the major problem of the telecommunications
sector in Colombia.   Thc eight largc-t entities are financially
viable and are providing good services at reasonable tariffs, while the
smaller entities tend to experience financial and technical difficulties.
Because of the small scale of their operations they are unable to attract
experienced engineers and they have to purchase imported plant and equip-
ment in small quantities at high prices. The proliferation of small
telephone entities also makes for duplication of planning; and the
varicty of thcir equipncnt impedes the tochnical integration of
the sector.
10.       The ideal solution for the problems of the sector would be
the integration of the many local operating entities into a single
national telecommunications enterprise, but this is impeded by the re-
sistance of the Municipalities and Departments, which have a great degree
of autonomy under Colombia's federal constitution. In these circumstances,
two approaches towards a rationalization of the sector seem feasible. The
eight larger municipal enterprises could expand progressively by develop-
ing unserved areas and absorbing the entities around them; or TELECOM
could gradually develop into a national enterprise by installing new ex-
changes in the unserved areas and by absorbing those small entities which
are in financial difficulties and ready to merge. The latter approach
is the most promising at this time. TELECOM is financially strong and
its countrywide organization is capable of further expansion. With the
concurrence of the Bank, TELECOM has already purchased in 1970 the North
Santander Departmental Telephone Company, thus adding 6,800 lines to its
local systems, and negotiations for the take-over of three other Depart-
mental telephone companies are under way. Arrangements have also been
made for the acquisition in 1974 of 8,000 local lines to be installed
by the Regional Corporation for the Bogota Plain in various localities
near Bogota. To ensure that these transactions do not interfere with
the proposed Project, detailed procedural arrangements for the take-over
of local entities, including adequate consultation with the Bank, were
agreed during negotiations. In the expansion program which was reviewed
by the Bank appraisal mission, TELECOM had assigned US$2.2 million of
its funds to the purchase of local entities. Subsequent to the appraisal,
the Government has approved a rate increase expected to yield US$13
million equivalent during 1971-74, and TELECOM plans to use a large part
of these additional revenues for the acquisition of local systems. Thus
TELECOM would be in a position to spend up to about US$15 million equiv-
alent in 1971-74 on the purchase of small telephone enterprises. This
could be a significant step towards the integration of the sector,
bearing in mind that the total value of all of the small telephone enter-
prises in Colombia is estimated at US$30-35 million.
11.      The proposed Project uaould help finance part of TELE0OI's 1971-
74 expansion program.  It would have a total cost of US$32.4 million
equivalent including foreign exchange costs of US$18.2 million. The
proposed Bank loan of US$15 million would finance part of the foreign



exchange cost with the balance of US$3.2 million to be covered by sup-
pliers' credits. The Bank funds would be used mainly to provide for
42,000 local service lines (of which 18,000 would be in areas where
little or no local service exists) and for the expansion of the long-
distance network to alleviate present congestion and to cover the
estimated demand until 1975. The suppliers' credits would be used to
finance the foreign exchange cost of a small amount of long-distance and
telex equipment which, for reasons of standardization, has to be procured
from specific sources.
12.       The proposed Project is expected to have an internal rate of
return of 29 percent. It would make an important contribution to the
development of Colombia by increasing the efficiency of operations in
public administration, industry and commerce. By continuing its asso-
ciation with the Colombian telecommunications sector, the Bank would
have the opportunity to further strengthen the proposed Borrower's manage-
ment and to support the consolidation of the sector. The financial pro-
jections in the appraisal report show that present tariffs are adequate
for the foreseeable future to meet the financial requirements of the
enterprise and to produce an adequate rate of return.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
13.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Empresa
Nacional de Telecomunicaciones and the draft Guarantee Agreement between
the Republic of Colombia and the Bank as well as the Report of the Com-
mittee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
14.       The draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in
agreements for public utilities projects. Under Section 5.o6 of the
Loan Agreement the Borrower would be committed to obtain the Bank's con-
currence before making any major capital expenditure outside the agreed
investment program, including any expenditure for the acquisition of
telephone operating entities.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
15.       A summary of recent developments and a favorable conclusion
regarding Colomabia's creditworthiness for additional external borrowing
was contained in paragraphs 20-23 of mny Report and Recommendation on the
loan for the Caqueta Land Colonization Project (P-921), dated April 21,
1971.



PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREE]ENM
16.       I am satisfied that the prcposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
17.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
