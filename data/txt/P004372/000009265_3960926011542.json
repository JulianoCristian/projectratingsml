efficiency\n            of road maintenance; and (d) strengthen institution building\n            and improve the domestic construction industry.  To achieve\n            these objectives, the project includes several components.\n            They comprise (a) reconstruction and upgrading of about 80\n            km of national roads; (b) rehabilitation and replacement of\n            about 50 bridges totaling about 1100 linear meters; (c)\n            regravelling of about 500 km of national gravel roads; and\n            (d) provision of road maintenance equipment and materials.\n            The project further involves (e) replacement of\n            navigational, meteorological and communication equipment at\n            14 national airports, resealing/regravelling of runways,\n            taxiways and aprons at 16 airports, rehabilitation and\n            improvement of drainage works and fire stations at four\n            airports.  It also includes (f) technical assistance to the\n            Department of Works (DW), Department of Transport (DT) and\n            Department of Civil Aviation and Tourism (DCAT); and (g)\n            on-the-job, local and overseas training of DW, DT and DCAT staff."}, "docdt": "1986-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
