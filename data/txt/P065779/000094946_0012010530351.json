objective of\n            the Federal highway Maintenance Project is primarily to\n            improve transport efficiency on the federal road network.\n            Complementary objectives include improving the\n            rehabilitation and maintenance planning performance of the\n            Secretariat for Finance and Public Credit (SCT); and\n            enhancing private sector participation in road maintenance.\n            There are four project components. The first supports the\n            SCT's 2001-2003 programs for highway maintenance and\n            bridge rehabilitation along key segments of the federal\n            highway network. The second component introduces\n            comprehensive maintenance by contract through a pilot\n            program, including technical assistance for design and\n            implementation. This three-year program includes\n            comprehensive maintenance, repair of selected segments of\n            roads and bridges, some minor works preparation of\n            short-term implementation programs, and training and\n            management of the program. The third component constructs\n            vehicle weight control stations. The fourth component\n            supports the implementation of the Highway Development and\n            Management Model in the General Directorate for Maintenance\n            of Roads (DGCC) and its departmental offices; develops a\n            strategy for road decentralization; implements a road\n            financing mechanism; implements a strategy for toll roads;\n            and trains staff in the SCT directorates most involved in\n            the project, emphasizing technical, managerial, and\n            administrative training."}, "docdt": "2000-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
