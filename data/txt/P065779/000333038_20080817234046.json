Highway\n            Maintenance Project for Mexico were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: contracting and road management innovations can\n            improve maintenance budgeting practices as well. The two\n            innovations introduced by the project, the Pilot Project for\n            Comprehensive Maintenance by Contract (PPMC) and the Highway\n            Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-4), contributed to improve\n            Direccibn General de Concesibn de Carreteras (DGCC's)\n            maintenance budgeting. First, the PPMC, a three year\n            comprehensive maintenance program required three years for\n            implementation and therefore, its contracting made necessary\n            the approval of a multiyear budget until then not used by\n            the DGCC in its contracts. The introduction of multiyear\n            contracts will allow in Secretariat of Communications and\n            Transport (SCT) to tender bigger works in the future, which\n            until now have been split in different contracts to allow\n            for execution in one year and a half for budgetary reasons\n            (there is a six month grace period to end the works\n            contracted out in the previous fiscal year. Second, the\n            HDM-4 requires improved and expanded inventories and basic\n            data on road condition and allows for in-depth analyses of\n            current asset capacity and condition, service demand over a\n            considerable horizon, detailed assessments, and multi-year\n            maintenance plans. Funding for road maintenance becomes more\n            stable when the planning process improves and enough\n            resources are allocated to projects. The project routine\n            maintenance share was originally 30 percent periodic\n            maintenance was 50 percent, reconstruction was 9 percent,\n            and highways signposts represented 10.5 percent. A SCT\n            recommendation at the end of the program was that the share\n            of routine maintenance in future similar contracts should be\n            higher, not less than 50 percent. In this respect, it is\n            worth to mention that the PPCM, as designed, had a routine\n            and periodic maintenance share of about 80 percent."}, "docdt": "2007-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
