However, the report stipulates that the right of\n            way will not be affected, i.e., resettlement issues\n            resulting from land acquisition will not occur, since\n            basically, the federal road network encompasses already\n            developed urban areas. Furthermore, the Ministry of\n            Communications and Transport should provide progress reports\n            on the implementation of each subproject in compliance with\n            the right of way, and, relevant information on the traffic\n            generated should be made available, to estimate beneficial,\n            or negative impacts on local populations, a measure which\n            should be incorporated in all roads and highway projects. In\n            addition, the SA indicates that highway projects mostly\n            generate beneficial social aspects, since they improve the\n            economy, as commercial activity increases; promote cultural\n            activities, as regional, national, and international tourism\n            increases; and, improve social aspects, as increased access\n            to education, health, and social benefits facilitate the\n            well-being of distant populations."}, "docdt": "2000-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
