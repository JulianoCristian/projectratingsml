The program will continue to focus on the same\n            thematic areas supported by preceding operations, with the\n            proposed addition of infrastructure --in particular, of\n            roads, water, and electricity-- under the service delivery\n            component. Therefore, the program will support the long-term\n            improvement of the supply side of the economy by\n            strengthening service delivery in the human development and\n            infrastructure areas while also providing a short-term\n            stimulus to the demand side. The program's focus on\n            governance, moreover, will strengthen the institutional\n            framework and external accountability mechanisms that are\n            essential to growth and poverty-reduction. The program will\n            follow four principles of engagement, which are consistent\n            with the Country Assistance Strategy for Timor-Leste:\n            deepening the results orientation, fostering transparency\n            and communications, building institutional capacity, and\n            strengthening partnerships."}, "docdt": "2005-09-07T00:00:00Z"}
