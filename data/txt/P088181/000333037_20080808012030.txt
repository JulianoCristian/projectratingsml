F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The First Consolidation Support Program emphasizes three thematic pillars and four key
principles of engagement. While the thematic pillars constitute the 'what' or substantive
content of the results sought by the program, the principles of engagement attempt to
address the 'how' or the political economy of achieving the results identified.

  The three thematic pillars, as in previous programs, are service delivery for poverty
reduction, good governance, and job creation. Gender and monitoring and evaluation
have received special attention as cross-cutting issues.

  The four key principles of engagement are : deepening the results orientation; fostering
transparency and communications; building institutional capacity; and strengthening
partnerships with donors.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., Program Document/ISR,
not evaluative):

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale
for Bank assistance)

In the three years following the restoration of independence in May 2002, Timor-Leste
made solid progress in nation building, maintaining peace and political stability, and
restoring public services. A Constitution was adopted, and nearly all of the institutions it
mandated were created. The Government put forward a National Development Plan
(NDP), a Stability Program (SP), and Sector Investment Programs (SIPs) to guide the use
of public and donor resources. Security was broadly restored, and macroeconomic
stability was reestablished and maintained through the adoption of the US dollar as legal
tender and cautious fiscal management. Financial sector activity expanded rapidly,
particularly in commercial banking. The country had seen gradual improvement in health
indicators and school enrollment, and around-the-clock access to electricity had been
reestablished in the capital, together with a cost-recovery system.

Following the ratification of the Timor Sea Treaty in March 2003, petroleum production
came on stream in April 2004 and petroleum revenues grew faster than expected, as oil
prices were higher than assumed. In the interest of prudently managing this financial
windfall, the Government adopted a legal framework for petroleum production, taxation,
and revenue management that is considered international best practice and is consistent
with the principles endorsed by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),
for which Timor-Leste is a pilot country. By the time of program approval, it was
estimated that the sustainable income from the Petroleum Fund would be about
US$ 100 million per year, well over that year's budget of US$ 80 million.

With the initiation of petroleum production, real GNI grew by 63 percent in 2004. After
two years of decline, growth in non-petroleum GDP had recovered slightly to just under 2
percent. Given population growth rates of well over 3 percent, real non-petroleum per-
capita GDP had declined steadily to US$ 311 in 2004, indicating that poverty was most
likely increasing. Moreover, since non-petroleum growth was not sufficient to keep up
with the rapidly growing working-age population, unemployment rates were high and
likely growing, especially in urban areas and among young people. Despite solid progress
in restoring public services, Timor-Leste continued to lag behind the East Asia and
Pacific region in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Slow budget
execution hampered the Government's ability to translate increased income into
improved results on the ground, and there were signs that these difficulties were
worsening. Administrative capacity was weak in both public and private sectors, and
physical infrastructure was inadequate to support effective service delivery and private
sector development.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

In the three years after independence, Timor-Leste faced a financing gap of
approximately US$ 30 million per year. This gap was filled by the Transition Support
Program (TSP), a multi-donor program of grant-financed budget support to help the
Government implement the NDP during the lean years before petroleum revenues came
on stream. The program focused on three policy areas reflecting the country's strategic
priorities: service delivery for poverty reduction, job creation, and good governance.
Coordinated by the World Bank, the TSP was co-financed by nine development partners.
Total financing over the program's three years amounted to US$ 99.4 million, of which
US$ 14.1 million was financed by IDA,1 US$ 76.2 million by bilateral co-financing
partners through IDA-administered trust funds, and US$ 9 million through parallel
financing.2

At the conclusion of the three-year TSP period, the Government requested that the Bank
schedule three further operations for FY2006 through FY2008, under the title of
Consolidation Support Program (CSP) to reflect the move from transition to the
consolidation of gains made thus far. On the policy side, the Government of Timor-Leste
argued that the CSP--like the TSP before it--would bring critical assistance in
establishing priorities, monitoring progress in policy implementation and achievement of
results, building institutional capacity, and strengthening donor coordination. On the
funding side, despite growing petroleum income, the continuation of multi-donor budget
support was appropriate, as it allowed the integration of off-budget expenditures onto the
central Government budget to address pressing development needs while respecting the
country's prudent savings policy and safeguarding against the effects of highly volatile
petroleum prices. In addition, CSP budget support would help facilitate an increase in
overall combined sources expenditure, in an effort to boost aggregate demand and job
creation.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The principal objective of the three-year CSP series was to foster poverty reduction and
sound governance by supporting the implementation and monitoring of Timor-Leste's
strategic planning instruments (notably the NDP, the SP, sector policies, and SIPs). In
line with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2006-08, CSP I (FY2006)
emphasized three thematic pillars and four principles of engagement. The three pillars, as
in previous programs, focused on service delivery for poverty reduction, job creation, and
good governance. Gender equality and monitoring and evaluation received special
attention as cross-cutting issues. The four principles of engagement included:


1 On a gross basis using exchange rates from SDR to US$ on September 23, 2004, leading up to the
presentation of TSP III to the World Bank's Executive Board.

2 Bilateral partners included Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. Parallel budget support financing was provided by Portugal, in
conjunction with the TSP process and matrix of actions/results.

   (i) deepening the results orientation; (ii) fostering transparency and communications;
   (iii) building institutional capacity; and (iv) strengthening partnerships with donors.

   The key performance outcomes envisioned for the end of the three-year CSP series, and
   the indicators by which they would be measured, are outlined in Table 1.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The original objective and indicators were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

CSP I focused on three policy areas, reflecting NDP and SP priorities: (i) Service
Delivery for Poverty Reduction, which covered health, education, and registration of
veterans (as in the TSP) as well as infrastructure services such as power, roads, and water
and sanitation; (ii) Job Creation, especially through private sector development and
agriculture; and (iii) Good Governance, including strengthening oversight institutions and
core government functions, public sector management, justice, and planning and public
expenditure management.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

The original policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The CSP was originally envisioned as a three-year series of annual multi-donor budget
support operations, beginning with CSP I (FY2006). Implementation progress was
severely affected, however, by the advent of a political and security crisis in April 2006
(see Section 2.2 below for more details). The attention of Government and donors shifted
sharply from the broader policy directions laid out in the CSP to maintaining a minimum
degree of stability in a fragile security environment. In addition to stalling progress on
CSP I, most of the prior actions for CSP II (FY2007) were not met and it was not
possible to move forward with the second operation in the series.

With the stabilization of the post-crisis environment, the new government, elected in mid-
2007, requested the continuation of the CSP series to guide policy and donor coordination
around the Government's national development agenda. Given that CSP II triggers have
still not been met, and the need to further prioritize the overall government program in
the wake of the crisis, preparation of the CSP has been stopped. Discussions are
underway regarding the appropriate scope and content of a new program drawing on the
successes and lessons of the CSP.

Rather than preparing a programmatic Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR) at the conclusion of the three-year series, as originally planned, this ICR reviews
the implementation experience of the completed operation, CSP I.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)


                                              4

As in the TSP series, CSP I was designed as a grant-financed budget support operation
with a strategic whole-of-government approach. Given the reduced need for bridging
finance, total financing for CSP I amounted to US$ 10 million, of which IDA's
contribution was US$ 0.5 million (SDR 342,000). The IDA grant was disbursed in a
single tranche upon effectiveness.

Prior actions were derived from a subset of key outputs defined under the preceding
operation, TSP III (Table 2), which in turn represented a subset of priority areas drawn
from the Government's overall program, in agreement with Government and in
consultation with Parliament and civil society. The reason for choosing only a portion of
the triggers proposed under TSP III was two-fold. First, despite credible progress in the
most critical areas included in TSP III, a number of triggers were not fulfilled and it
became clear that the ambitious nature of the program warranted revision under CSP I.
Second, at the time of CSP I appraisal, there remained a considerable level of uncertainty
on what would be achievable in the context of weak administrative capacity. To address
this issue more squarely, CSP I was twinned with a new multi-donor grant-funded
program of capacity building for accountable financial management in support of service
delivery, the Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Program
(PFMCBP). Additional technical assistance was also provided to support procurement
and budget execution in particular. With this in mind, some of the measures that were
identified originally as triggers were included as actions to be completed over the course
of CSP I implementation. Progress was evaluated in the context of TSP III supervision
missions, and dialogue on the preparation of CSP I.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The principal factor affecting implementation of CSP I was the April 2006 crisis. Sparked
by the dismissal of nearly half the soldiers of Timor-Leste's army, the crisis was
accompanied by fighting between army and police, widespread communal violence in the
capital city, and the displacement of over 100,000 people. This situation created a
difficult environment for policy implementation. International troops were called in to
help restore order, and Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri was forced to resign. Most
government institutions suffered from pervasive absenteeism and weak performance, and
the delivery of critical services was disrupted. No major policy decisions were made, as
the focus was on maintaining stability and security.

As the security environment improved, the interim Government's attention turned to
presidential and parliamentary elections held in April/May and June 2007. A new
coalition Government took office in August 2007, and quickly set about defining a vision
for stabilization, recovery, and development. The Program for the Fourth Constitutional
Government, presented in September 2007, emphasized economic growth and poverty
reduction, administrative reform, human resource development, and consolidation of
national unity over a five-year period.

Beyond the immediate effects of the crisis, slow budget execution and weak



                                                   6

administrative and implementation capacity continue to impede effective service
delivery, public investment, and progress toward the national development goals reflected
in the CSP results matrix. In FY2006, out of a budget of US$ 142 million, only
US$ 88.5 million (62 percent) was spent on a cash basis--though this still marks an
increase over the US$ 65.9 million disbursed through the previous year's budget.
Execution of the capital budget remained particularly poor, with only US$ 15.9 million
(35 percent) disbursed out of US$ 45.2 million. In FY2007, total cash spending increased
to US$ 160 million, but this represented only 49 percent of a larger budget of
US$ 329 million. Capital spending remained low at US$ 21 million (16 percent) of
US$ 129 million budgeted.

As with the budget, weak administrative capacity posed an important constraint to full
implementation of CSP actions. The program design was ambitious, reflecting the
Government's strong interest in using the CSP to move forward on a broad front to
address the varied and pressing development needs of a young nation. Building on the
experience of the TSP and the Government's policy and planning initiatives, CSP I
sought to strike a balance between the achievement of tangible results and the
development of institutional and policy processes needed to lay the basis for progress in
the medium term. Government and donors endeavored to select specific activities on the
basis of four criteria: (i) clear link to the achievement of tangible results on the ground or
to the development of critical institutions and policy processes; (ii) ownership by
Government and other relevant State institutions; (iii) administrative and technical
feasibility; and (iv) potential for multiplicative effects and sustainability.

Recognizing the need for stronger capacity in budget planning, preparation, execution,
and monitoring, the CSP was twinned with a comprehensive program of capacity
building in public financial management. Implementation of the PFMCBP experienced
some initial setbacks, however, and planned technical assistance was not mobilized
before the 2006 crisis.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The Government and donors have expressed their appreciation for the role of the CSP
results matrix--and the TSP matrices before it--as a tool for strategic planning,
consistent monitoring of action plans, and improved orientation toward results. The
experience of TSP/CSP implementation in Timor-Leste demonstrated the crucial
importance of laying out a critical path for the achievement of major objectives, with
quarterly benchmarks to facilitate sequencing, recognize areas of good progress, and
highlight areas where progress was lagging. The Ministry of Planning and Finance
particularly appreciated the assistance it received through the CSP in monitoring progress
on its program as described in the Results Matrix.

Deepening the results orientation was one of four principles of engagement in the CSP I
program, and monitoring and evaluation was given special attention as a cross-cutting
issue. As in TSP III, CSP I made greater use of quantitative performance indicators,
shifting away from tracking milestones such as the passage of legislation toward
managing for service delivery results on the ground. The medium-term perspective


                                                7

introduced in TSP III was maintained, setting out three-year objectives and outcomes to
guide the design and monitoring of subsequent programs. Government and development
partners jointly established output and outcome targets in the various sectors, and the
development of monitoring systems and capacity was supported through the CSP itself
and through parallel technical assistance. In sectors where reliable quantitative indicators
were lacking, an effort was made to define alternative indicators of service delivery
outcomes.

Progress was monitored through the Government's Quarterly Reporting Matrix (QRM)
and through biannual multi-donor supervision missions. In March 2006, the CSP I
progress mission noted that the quality of quarterly reporting had improved significantly,
and that monitoring information was better linked to the annual planning process. These
improvements were set back following the crisis, however, and the quality and utilization
of QRMs seem to have subsequently declined. Budget execution reports are still
produced, though in a less timely manner. The new Government is currently revising the
planning and monitoring system.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Despite lagging progress in the wake of the crisis, the Government has requested that the
Bank resume implementation of the CSP. Though the full CSP model has become
unwieldy and thus less appropriate to the current context, it retains its value as a
mechanism for policy formulation, prioritization, and reform management, and for
dialogue and coordination between the Government and development partners. The CSP
approach has become embedded in the Government's strategic planning and management
processes, and offers a robust and appropriate model for developing a more focused
instrument of action-oriented dialogue on the "priorities of priorities."

Though the CSP was originally envisioned as a three-year series, preparation of CSP II
has been halted. Triggers for CSP II have not been met. At the same time, given faster-
than-expected growth in petroleum revenues, the financial justification for budget support
has lapsed.5

Instead, it is envisaged that development partner support for the Government's new
National Priorities (NPs) will replace the CSP. As a result of the 2006 crisis, the
Government is acutely aware of the need to deliver visible results and has placed priority
focus on stabilization and recovery. In an effort to define critical goals and to measure
progress toward those goals through an agreed set of monitorable benchmarks, the
Government has defined a set of NPs for 2008.

Development partner support for this new modality would likely involve the creation of a

about US$ 80 million to sustainably financing a budget of over US$ 300 million using the interest from the
Petroleum Fund.




                                                   8

Government-donor working group for each of the six priority areas,6 and monitoring
would take the form of independent peer review, delivered through at least biannual
supervision missions led by the World Bank and supported by donor partners.
Development partner financing7 and technical assistance could be directed toward one or
more of the NPs, with particular focus on areas that are not yet fully budgeted (e.g.
national workforce program, conditional cash transfers in education). This approach
would thus maintain the CSP's basic principle of bridging financing gaps until such
priority programs are fully budgeted in the following year(s).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The overall program objective of supporting poverty reduction and sound governance
remains highly relevant to Timor-Leste. In 2001, one in five people lived on less than on
dollar per day and two in five lived below the national poverty line. Though updated
poverty measurements are not currently available,8 real non-petroleum per-capita income
has decreased from US$ 318 in 2002 to US$ 305 in 2007 as a result of sluggish non-oil
growth and a rapidly growing population, and it is likely that poverty has increased. As
petroleum revenues continue to increase and the nation's new institutions are
consolidated, strengthening governance remains an important goal.

The three policy areas, or pillars, of the CSP also continue to be highly relevant to Timor-
Leste. Strengthening basic service delivery is integral to demonstrating tangible results
and improving the living standards of citizens across the country. Creating jobs and
income-earning opportunities will be critical to maintaining stability, stimulating
economic growth, and reducing poverty. As mentioned above, good governance is an
important element of restoring public confidence and ensuring efficient delivery of
services.

The objectives and pillars of CSP I were drawn from the Government's five-year
National Development Plan and related strategic planning instruments, and developed
jointly by the Government and development partners. These focus areas were also
adopted as the pillars of the CAS, with the CSP as the principal vehicle for whole-of-
Government budget support.

6 The Government's national priorities have been grouped into six areas: (i) Public Safety and Security;
(ii) Social Protection and Solidarity; (ii) Addressing the Needs of Youth; (iv) Employment and Income
Generation; (v) Improving Social Service Delivery; and (vi) Clean and Effective Government. Within these
priority areas, goals are identified for the particular attention and action of Government, and support from
development partners.

7Including leftover funds originally contributed by development partners for CSP II-III.

8 A first draft of the 2007/08 Poverty Assessment, based on the recently completed Living Standards
Measurement Survey, will be available in early August 2008.




                                                        9

In the current context, however, the relevance of the program's broad-based design has
been called into question. Having faced the lessons of the 2006 crisis, the current
Government has placed a greater emphasis on promoting stabilization and recovery,
including by ensuring security and justice; strengthening social protection and solidarity;
addressing the needs of youth; creating jobs; delivering tangible social and economic
benefits to citizens; and promoting clean and effective government. In the context of the
NPs, Government and development partners are now working toward a more focused
instrument for policy dialogue on, and implementation and monitoring of national
priorities.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

Service Delivery

Implementation of the service delivery agenda progressed relatively well, though
continued problems with slow budget execution and particularly procurement bottlenecks
undermined this progress. What progress had been achieved was stalled or even reversed
by the April 2006 crisis. Timor-Leste continues to face the challenges of low life
expectancy, high illiteracy, widespread food insecurity, and limited access to basic
services. Some social indicators, such as primary education enrollment and access to
infrastructure, have not improved, posing even greater challenges for the achievement of
the MDGs.

In the health sector, programmed actions focused on performance improvements on the
ground through the implementation of new sector policies and the efficient management
of hospitals. Immunization targets were exceeded. Targets for supervised delivery and
outpatient visits were not met, though it is important to note that these were
overestimated originally in response to inaccurate baseline data. These data quality issues
were resolved following a major effort, and sector and census statistics were effectively
used for management and monitoring of performance. District and hospital plans were
prepared, and hospital budgets were kept below the 40% ceiling. The health sector
responded well to the April 2006 crisis, swiftly re-establishing minimal service provision
and assisting those who were internally displaced. In line with CSP objectives, bilateral
projects have recently helped the Government to rehabilitate hospital infrastructure and
import critical medical equipment.

Progress on education sector actions--which aimed to promote increased access,
efficiency, and quality of basic education--was mixed. Evidence suggests that school
enrollments have decreased or are stagnant, though it is not yet clear whether this is a
result of the crisis or a longer-term trend. The finalization of the Strategic Plan for
Universal Primary Education by 2015 was a major achievement. However, progress on
legislative and policy steps was slow, and budget execution targets were not met. Given
the late approval of planned procurement decentralization, followed by the crisis, the
school construction and rehabilitation program and development of a teacher competency


                                                10

framework were not implemented in FY2006. Voluntary school fees were abolished in
November 2005, though the planned school finance policy was eventually replaced by a
school grants scheme implemented after the completion of CSP I. Following the April
2006 crisis, the education sector reacted quickly to reopen schools.

Infrastructure objectives centered on developing strategies to improve access to power,
transport, and water and sanitation services, especially in rural areas. Progress was slow
in many of these areas, however, and over the course of supervision it became clear that
some of the initial targets were not realistic, owing perhaps to the fact that this was a new
area for the CSP. The power sector saw important steps toward increasing supply through
importation of new generators and improving revenue through the establishment of a loss
monitoring system. Installation of pre-payment meters was completed, though many
meters were subsequently damaged during the crisis and an increase in illegal bypasses
has reversed revenue collection improvements. Progress on rural electrification was
delayed. In the transport sector, there were some improvements in the preparation of
work plans to facilitate procurement and contract management, and development of a
road maintenance and management system was initiated. Implementation of water and
sanitation activities was delayed, largely due to the restructuring in early FY2006 of the
national water supply and sanitation agency into the Ministry of Natural Resources,
Minerals and Energy Policy.

With regard to veterans, programmed actions focused on developing the policy and
legislative framework to recognize veterans of the resistance, and these objectives were
largely achieved. The veterans law was approved by Parliament, and registration of
veterans of the civilian resistance was completed. Progress on the development of
specific policies and hosting of recognition ceremonies was delayed until just after the
closing of CSP I. Since then, some 12,000 veterans have been recognized and decorated.

Job Creation

Outcomes of the employment generation pillar were limited, particularly with regard to
direct job creation and streamlining of the business environment. Unemployment remains
high, and business registration procedures cumbersome. The agriculture sector witnessed
good progress on legislation, monitoring, and food security, though there is a continuing
need for capacity and productivity.

Private sector development objectives centered on generating employment, developing
an enabling legislative and regulatory environment, and strengthening dialogue between
the Government and private sector. Job creation results were disappointing, with very few
jobs created through the emigrant workers program (20) and routine road maintenance
initiatives (128 annualized jobs in the first half of FY2006). Challenges included the
complicated nature of negotiations with emigrant worker recipient countries, slow
execution of road maintenance budgets, and limited capacity for works supervision.
Entrepreneurship training objectives were met, and it is estimated that training graduates
created at least 300 entrepreneurial jobs during FY2006. Business-Government dialogue
improved slightly, with two joint fora held during the fiscal year. Limited progress was



                                              11

seen in attracting foreign direct investment, and business registration procedures
remained cumbersome--exacerbated by the continued split of business registration
functions between the Ministries of Development and Justice. There have been important
de facto improvements in business registration procedures since CSP I completion,
leading to a slight improvement in Timor-Leste's Doing Business indicators, but these
changes still need to be formalized. Legal and regulatory measures on land rights were
not achieved.

In the agriculture sector, programmed actions focused on finalizing the legislative
framework, enhancing food security, and improving sustainable resource management.
Several key pieces of legislation were passed, and a Community Forestry Strategy and
Forestry Policy were prepared. A vessel licensing and reporting system was established
for all commercial fishing activities, with over 300 in-shore licenses issued and plans in
place to issue four off-shore licenses. New food crop varieties have been introduced and
tested, and capacity for food production and food security monitoring has increased--
though the rice shortages following the 2006 crisis demonstrated the continuing need for
capacity strengthening in the sector.

Governance

Implementation of the governance agenda progressed well. Notable achievements include
the opening of the Office of the Provedor, combining the functions of human rights
commissioner, ombudsman, and anti-corruption agency; and the establishment of
management arrangements for the country's Petroleum Fund. Budget execution
performance lagged, however, posing difficulties for achieving broader service delivery
objectives.

The main objective with regard to the establishment of oversight institutions was the
establishment and operation of the Office of the Provedor. The office opened its doors in
March 2006 after a successful drive to recruit qualified staff, engage in high-quality
training, and raise awareness across the country on the Provedor's role.

The component on core government functions focused on establishing institutional
arrangements for an effective and transparent legislative process, improved opportunities
for public consultation, and enhanced integrity in the State. The Office of the Inspector
General met targets for the conduct of investigations and online publication of summary
reports. The Investment Advisory Board for the Petroleum Fund was appointed and
operational by January 2006. Several appointments were made to the Consultative
Council, though that body did not become operational until after the closing of CSP I. A
capacity-building program for petroleum taxation was designed under the auspices of the
PFMCBP. The Government produced a legislative program setting out a timetable for
passage of legislation, but the harmonization of Organic Laws was not completed. There
was little progress in facilitating the staged transfer of external audit functions to the
Court of Appeals, and implementation of the Media Law and Freedom of Information
policy was slowed by the transfer of responsibilities between Ministers. Some
improvements in information dissemination were registered.



                                            12

The objective of public sector management activities was to improve human resource
management, strengthen capacity to manage for results, and explore options for local
governance. Implementation was partial. A decentralization options study was conducted,
but related proposals were deferred in the interest of taking a cautious and measured
approach. Limited progress was made in defining a revised pay and grading structure for
the civil service, and plans to develop a manual on disciplinary procedures were delayed.
Data entry into the Personnel Management Information System (PMIS) began, but was
not completed due to lack of funding. A Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS)
was launched, but implementation was delayed until after the crisis subsided; results are
now being analyzed and an updated Poverty Assessment is under preparation. The
majority of gender-related objectives were achieved, with gender considerations
integrated into the SIPs, planning staff equipped with gender monitoring tools, and
analysis of sex-disaggregated data underway.

The justice sector component aimed to improve access to justice by strengthening human
resource planning and case management, reducing backlogs, and improving
administrative, financial, and procurement systems.9 Training of national court actors
proceeded apace; the first group of 27 candidate judges completed the theoretical phase
of their training in May 2006 and entered into a one-year probation period. The
promulgation of the Criminal and Civil Codes paved the way for improvements in justice
delivery through timely and standardized processes and strengthened case management.
Access to justice in rural areas remains constrained, however, by the lack of a clear plan
for the functioning of district courts in Oecussi and Suai following the departure of
UNOTIL. Some progress was made in reducing the backlog of court cases, though these
gains were nearly reversed following the April 2006 crisis and the resulting wave of
litigation.

On planning and public expenditure management, programmed actions focused on
strengthening the Government's ability to use its financial resources to deliver the best
development results for its population. At 62 percent on a cash basis, overall budget
execution did not reach the target of 70 percent in FY2006, though actual spending did
increase significantly over the amount disbursed through the FY2005 budget. The State
Annual Accounts for FY2005 were finalized with a clean audit opinion within three
months of the end of the fiscal year, and budget execution reports were produced, albeit
with some delay. To promote dissemination of budget information, the FY2006 budget
was published in Portuguese, English, and Tetum along with a 45-minute video guide to
the budget. The video guide has since been discontinued, but the new Government is
preparing brochures and dissemination events for the FY2009 budget. A new
Procurement Decree Law delegated responsibility for procurement contracts of up to
US$ 100,000 for key line ministries, and consideration is currently being given to
increasing this threshold to US$ 250,000. The PFMCBP was finalized by Government, in


9 Activities to strengthen the police services were also included in the multi-donor CSP I matrix. These
actions were supported and monitored by bilateral CSP partners, and not by the International Development
Association. As a result, these activities are not reported on in this ICR.

   collaboration with donors, and the operation was presented to the World Bank's
   Executive Board in March 2006. The Customs Directorate submitted an implementation
   plan for an automated customs data system, but actual implementation was delayed by
   lack of funding.

   Triggers for CSP II

   The above review details progress on the Government's overall program, as included in
   the Results Matrix annexed to the CSP I Program Document. Within this broad program,
   however, the Bank focused particularly on supporting and monitoring a much smaller set
   of outcomes as triggers for the follow-on operation, CSP II. Progress on these triggers is
   detailed in Table 3.

   3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
   (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

   Building on the experience of its predecessor operations, the CSP I process made an
   important contribution to Government-owned prioritization within this new nation's
   overarching policy agenda. The program cultivated Government ownership by taking
   guidance from the NDP and other broad planning instruments, and by engaging in
   intensive dialogue with a wide range of Government stakeholders on the key policy
   actions to be undertaken in the year ahead. Implementation of CSP I promoted capacity
   building by using the Government's own systems and processes for budget preparation
   and execution, and by including mid-level managers in planning, program design, and
   monitoring. The preparation of a time-bound matrix of expected results--and the critical
   path toward their achievement--strengthened medium-term planning and results
   orientation, and brought Timor-Leste's development partners together around a
   coordinated program to support Government's main objectives.

   The design of CSP I offered a flexible approach to strengthening ownership and
   responding to the Government's desire for a comprehensive program, on the one hand,
   while recognizing the need for a more focused set of priorities, on the other hand. These
   competing priorities were balanced by including a Results Matrix encompassing the
   broader Government program as an annex, while the Bank focused more narrowly on a
   set of key outcomes and triggers for CSP II. Despite attempts at further prioritization,
   however, the CSP I continued the TSP's trend toward larger, less focused programs.
   There was some success in reducing the focus on policy and legislative development, and
   in better defining results and targets within a given sector. However, the addition of three
   infrastructure sectors on top of the sectors addressed under TSP yielded a weighty
   program spread across the Government-wide agenda.

   In a context of low capacity, slow budget execution, and the disruption caused by the
   crisis, achievement of program objectives was incomplete. Though some progress was
   made in most program areas, many results were not achieved during FY2006.
   Performance on budget execution, job creation, and private sector development was
   particularly weak, while the slow but steady progress toward improved delivery of
   education, infrastructure, and justice services was tested, if not reversed, during the crisis.
   Without the results-oriented road map provided by the CSP matrix, however, the negative
   impact of the crisis could have been worse. Since the closure of CSP I, a number of



                                                 15

program objectives have been or are expected to be achieved. Moreover, there has been
considerable progress toward achieving the priority outcomes set out in CSP I as triggers
for CSP II. Still, the interruptions experienced in early 2006 present an opportunity to
design a new, more focused and prioritized program based on the Government's National
Priorities.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Support for poverty reduction was one of the overarching objectives of CSP I. It is
difficult to assess the operation's direct impact on poverty given the lack of recent
poverty data. However, given the decrease in per capita income and the effects of the
recent crisis, it is likely that overall poverty has increased over the life of the program.
The CSP I contributed to poverty reduction through support for improved planning and
service delivery in education (school financing), health (immunizations), infrastructure
(power and roads), and agriculture (seed testing and distribution, fishing licenses).
However, the program's disappointing impact on job creation and broader private sector
development has likely constrained its potential poverty reduction benefits. As mentioned
above, it can be argued that the results-oriented CSP may have helped smooth or reduce
the negative impact of the crisis on poverty by providing the Government with a road
map for continued program management.

Promotion of gender equality was mainstreamed throughout the CSP I program, which
made steady progress on building capacity for gender-sensitive planning and on
improving coordination between planning and gender focal points in key line ministries.
The aim of these activities has been to strengthen the utilization of gender-disaggregated
data in management, and stimulate greater focus on gender-specific concerns in health,
education, justice, and agriculture.

CSP I made a substantial impact on social development outcomes through its support for
recognition of veterans of the resistance. During the CSP I progress mission in December
2005, development partners presented an Issues Paper on "Public Interventions for
Poverty Reduction" to launch a productive dialogue on options for creating an effective
and relevant publicly funded social safety net in Timor-Leste. The events of 2006
demonstrated the need for a more sustained and systematic approach to addressing the
social and economic needs of youth. Since the closure of CSP I and with support from
development partners, the Government has begun to implement a national workforce
program and initiatives on youth development and social safety nets.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The program's impact on institutional development was significant. Key governance
institutions were established, including the Office of the Provedor and the Investment
Advisory Board for the Petroleum Fund. Important pieces of legislation were


                                               16

promulgated, including on procurement and veterans. Elections for village (suco) leaders
concluded successfully in October 2005, paving the way for the country's first
independently conducted Parliamentary and Presidential elections in mid-2007. Despite
the nation's relative youth, the integrity of its basic institutional structures was
maintained during the April 2006 crisis, and in the orderly transfer of power to a newly
elected coalition Government. Still, the crisis laid bare the critical weaknesses in Timor-
Leste's security institutions, and increased the pressure on nascent justice sector
institutions.

None.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

There are important reasons to consider that the benefits and expected outcomes of CSP I
will be sustained over the longer term. The program's robust approach to program
planning, coordination, and monitoring was internalized in the Government's mode of
doing business--including through a change in administrations. Efforts are underway to
further improve the model in the context of the NPs.

However, the achievement and sustainability of program development outcomes face
substantial risks. The combination of low implementation capacity and slow budget
execution may limit the Government's ability to achieve and sustain program objectives.
It is hoped that implementation of the PFMCBP and other technical assistance activities
will help strengthen capacity for delivery of results. In a fragile political environment,
however, elite political rivalries could stall progress on policy development and
achievement of outcomes. There is a concern that public pressure for tangible results
could spur the dismantling of petroleum revenue management arrangements, leaving the
economy vulnerable to the "resource curse," unsustainable spending, and increased
corruption. Though fiduciary accountability in Timor-Leste compares favorably with
those of other low-income countries, they remain fragile and somewhat dependent on the
role of international technical assistance. In the face of continued slow budget execution,
donors may adopt aid modalities that work outside public planning and financial
management systems, reversing previous gains in aid harmonization and support for
country systems.

Rising global food and fuel prices are placing increasing pressure on stagnant incomes;
coupled with the use of the US dollar, which eliminates the scope for currency
appreciation, this growing pressure could spur popular dissatisfaction and unrest. Finally,
a serious deterioration in security conditions could lead to widespread conflict, halting


                                                17

service delivery, compounding food insecurity, and preventing the Bank and other
development partners from implementing development assistance on the ground.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The CSP I approach to program preparation and appraisal provided several important
benefits: (i) consistency between program objectives and Government development
priorities, as expressed in the NDP and other planning documents; (ii) cultivation of
Government ownership and support for capacity building through use of Government
systems and processes; (iii) regular consultation with Parliament and civil society during
program appraisal; (iv) flexible program design to promote responsiveness to a unique
client; (v) close links with the Bank's CAS, informed by analytical and advisory work
and twinned with the PFMCBP and other targeted technical assistance to strengthen
implementation capacity; (vi) presentation of analytical issues notes during multi-donor
missions to promote dialogue on relevant topics; and (vii) strong donor coordination.

The process behind the development of the CSP I program was critically important as a
mechanism for structured discussions around the broader national development agenda.
As such, the task team and most other stakeholders considered the preparation and
monitoring experience to be as, if not more, important than the implementation of any
given action along the results continuum. Priority was given to ownership across a wide
range of government agencies and recognition of the broader government program, rather
than to the size of the program per se. A smaller number of high-priority actions were
monitored as key CSP I outcomes and triggers for the follow-on operation.

It is likely, however, that greater focus on a smaller number of results would have
enhanced the potential for achievement of program outcomes. Based on the established
ICR rating criteria, which refer to a Bank's role in enhancing the likelihood of achieving
planned development outcomes through program design, the Bank's performance in
ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
Rating: Satisfactory

The dialogue around the TSP/CSP has provided the main forum for Government and
donors to discuss Government-wide policy issues and jointly monitor results. Much of
this dialogue and monitoring took place during intensive twice-yearly supervision
missions comprised of Bank and donor staff, sector experts financed by CSP financing
partners and coordinated with various Government agencies, development partners,
Parliament, and civil society. Mission communications were translated into Tetum and


                                              18

Portuguese to ensure maximum participation in debate and decision making. Though the
intensity of supervision could be taxing in light of Government counterparts' other
priorities, an effort was made to minimize disruptions by scheduling missions according
to the Government's budget preparation cycle. Results monitoring and policy dialogue
thus served as an input to the review of the current year's budget and development of
programs for the following year.

In between missions, the Bank effectively supported the Government's program through
continued dialogue with the authorities, review and assessment of QRMs, timely
responses to Government requests for technical and implementation assistance, and close
collaboration with CSP donor partners. Comprehensive aide-mémoires were produced
laying out progress across the constellation of CSP I actions, and pointing out emerging
issues and areas of concern.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The TSP/CSP is relatively unique in pursuing a results-based model in a post-conflict,
low-capacity country. Both Government and development partners have praised the
process of CSP preparation and supervision for its focus on building capacity, providing
oversight in an environment where local oversight institutions are weak, and bringing
development partners to the table around a common agenda. Given the intensive and
rewarding dialogue around preparation and supervision, balanced by the highly ambitious
design of CSP I, the Bank's overall performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall, the Government showed serious commitment to the achievement of CSP I
objectives. The Prime Minister was a strong supporter of the program as an effective tool
for high-level monitoring. Having requested the CSP to support consolidation of gains
made through the TSP, the Government took the lead in preparing and implementing the
program in the context of the NDP. In many cases, the Government strongly favored
ambitious objectives and outputs as a source of momentum toward development
priorities. There was a growing recognition that including an action in the CSP results
matrix would give it a higher profile, more monitoring attention, and possibly more
budget resources; as a result, more agencies wanted their own priorities reflected in the
broader program, and the matrix expanded. (The same can be said about the various
donor partners who contributed to the CSP.)

In areas of the program that required ownership and commitment across ministries,
across different departments within ministries, and between central and local government,
implementation was at times held back by a lack of communication and varying
perceptions of the urgency of each task with relation to other entities. This effect was
particularly pronounced in the slow rates of budget execution across the board, and
particularly with regard to capital development projects requiring collaboration among


                                             19

various agencies. The Government performed relatively well in program monitoring,
producing quarterly reports on program implementation and regular updates on budget
execution, albeit with some delays.

The Government's performance on transparency and information sharing was
comparatively weak, particularly in communicating with Parliament, civil society, and
the private sector and in achieving program actions that focused on encouraging
transparency and communications. A notable exception is the swift creation of Petroleum
Fund oversight bodies and the availability of information on the fund's receipts and
balances.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The CSP was managed by the Ministry of Planning and Finance, which took an
increasingly assertive and effective role in coordinating program development,
implementation, and monitoring. However, successful achievement of broader CSP I
objectives would depend on a wide array of Government agencies and departments, as
well as independent oversight institutions and Parliament.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Given the Borrower's dedication and ownership in preparing and implementing the CSP,
balanced by concerns about ambitious design, slow budget execution, and restrained
transparency and communications, the Borrower's overall performance is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

Finding the right balance between ownership and prioritization

Throughout the TSP and into the CSP, there has been a tension between fostering country
ownership and focusing attention on a few key priorities. Both goals have merits. In
Timor-Leste, a country which had just regained sovereignty after hundreds of years of
subjugation, the Government's ownership of its programs was paramount. Leaders were
faced with an overwhelming agenda, essentially having to build a new country from
scratch, and they wanted to define and monitor their program as a whole. At the same
time, the Government had limited capacity to bring to bear and there was a concern that
overloading the program would diffuse scarce human resources and dampen
achievements.

Close linkages between the CSP and the NDP, SIPs, and AAPs strengthened sovereignty
and ownership over the program objectives, but it also opened up a wide array of
program activities for inclusion by those with a particular interest in seeing their
individual responsibilities given precedence in a high-profile results matrix. This


                                              20

tendency was compounded by a desire on the part of central government stakeholders
(including the Prime Minister and Minster of Planning and Finance) to develop a high-
level monitoring tool that covered a subset of the even more unwieldy AAPs. Donors,
too, wanted to see a program that responded to their priorities and institutional
imperatives.

This tension has been shown to be quite common in fragile state environments.10
Attempts to prioritize are complicated by the wide number of actors who would like to
see their priorities included in a national program. Suggested approaches include
launching a wide-ranging dialogue, then prioritizing with a smaller group of key national
counterparts.

Given the Government's already strong tendencies toward centralization in Timor-Leste,
the CSP team decided to maintain the broad approach undertaken in the TSP with
consultation across Government and among civil society and Parliament. The process of
debate and dialogue was an important result in itself, helping the Government to define
and defend its own priorities, while providing the opportunity to build capacity in
planning, program development, and monitoring and, over time, to strengthen
implementation across a broad program. The Government's broader priorities were
recognized in the Results Matrix annexed to the CSP I Program Document, which
constituted a strong instrument for program and results management. Progress was
monitored through the Government's regular monitoring systems and in biannual multi-
donor supervision missions. At the same time, the Bank focused its operational attention
on a subset of high-priority outcomes that served as triggers for CSP II.

Finding the right balance between institutional development and tangible results

Eager to establish the institutions of a new state, the Government looked to the TSP/CSP
as a vehicle to maintain momentum behind complicated institution-building initiatives
such as the establishment of a Petroleum Fund, creation of the Constitutionally-mandated
Provedor, and various laws and regulations. This perspective makes some sense in the
context of a legal system rooted largely in a civil law system that emphasizes the primacy
of law as a basis for decision making. Moreover, in a new country, there was a strong
sense that the foundations needed to be put in place. However, there was some concern
among donors that an overzealous focus on institutional development at the expense of
"quick wins" and tangible results in service delivery would risk letting down the raised
expectations of the population.

In the CSP, the team began to make some progress in steering focus away from policy
and legislative development toward service delivery outcomes in the context of a
medium-term outlook. Progress was slow, however, owing in large part to severe
capacity constraints and slow budget execution. The unrest of April 2006 demonstrated

Frameworks in Fragile States.




                                             21

the need for more creative approaches to achieving tangible results in parallel with
institutional development approaches.

Avoiding the temptation to focus on "best practice" to the detriment of "good enough"

Following the restoration of independence in Timor-Leste, donors flooded into this new
country with high hopes of getting the institutions right the first time around. Faced with
serious deficiencies in even the most basic areas of government, development partners
helped establish a comprehensive set of institutions and processes for planning,
budgeting, spending, control, monitoring, and oversight. The Government itself placed a
high priority on establishing the constitutionally mandated institutions of their newly
sovereign nation.

Indeed, progress was impressive during the first five years. Sophisticated institutions
were being established, and a comprehensive planning and budgeting system was being
put in place. However, capacity constraints, tight internal control, and slow budget
execution have prevented these systems from reaching their full potential. Though
institutions were importantly maintained during the 2006 crisis, it has become clear that
they remain fragile. The priority placed by Government and donors on establishing "best
practice" systems may have come at the expense of "good enough" basic processes suited
to a new Government with low administrative capacity.

Creating jobs requires creative, comprehensive approaches

The TSP/CSP experience has shown that nation-wide job creation cannot be
accomplished through piecemeal approaches. In retrospect, the tentative piloting under
TSP/CSP of an Emigrant Worker Program, community-based road maintenance, and
entrepreneurial job creation initiatives, did not devote sufficient focus to the urgent need
for job creation on a national scale. Nor did these approaches take into account the
critical role of Government budget implementation in creating short-term employment
while much longer-term private sector development initiatives were underway. With this
lesson in mind, the Government of Timor-Leste and its development partners are now
developing a comprehensive National Workforce Program to create short-term,
temporary employment in the near term. Meanwhile, with support from the PFMCBP and
other technical assistance initiatives, the Government has renewed its focus on fully
implementing its capital development budget, and efforts to stimulate private sector
investment continue.
