   substantial institutional development impact, and\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            The main objective of the project was to alleviate power\n            shortages in Hunan by providing efficient, reliable and\n            environmentally sound power supply.  Lessons learned\n            include: more practical and realistic cost estimates should\n            be used so as to optimize the Borrower's financing\n            cost; when the sector is undergoing major changes and the\n            borrower's capacity is building up quickly, flexibility\n            should be built into the design of the technical assistance\n            (TA) component; in the face of changes in circumstances,\n            both the Bank and the Borrower should pay closer attention\n            to the relevance of the financial covenants, and seek to\n            make modifications proactively; when the environmental units\n            had the full support of management at the highest level, and\n            there was a culture of professionalism and understanding of\n            the environmental aspects, it was easy to build upon this\n            and implement the Environmental Management Program (EMP);\n            strong commitment by the various levels of government and\n            the project owner, timely dissemination of information and\n            early involvement of media and communities; comprehensive\n            resettlement policies supported by consistent and\n            transparent principles; adequate planning with regular\n            updates based on feedbacks; and effective implementation\n            arrangements all contributed to the smooth and successful\n            implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
