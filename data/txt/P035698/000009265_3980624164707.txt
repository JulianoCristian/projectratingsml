HUNAN POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
ADDENDUM TO
PART A-Leiyang Power Plant Phase 2 Extension Project
Emissions of Nitrogen Oxides
Background
The proposed project will utilize a locally available anthracite coal which, as is typical of this fuel, contains
a low fraction of volatile material. To burn this fuel efficiently boilers must be designed to provide the coal
an environment of relatively high temperatures for relatively long exposure times. Unfortunately, high
temperature-long combustion times are also conditions which favor formation of nitrogen oxides (primarily
nitrogen oxide, NO).
As a result, emission levels of nitrogen oxides from well designed anthracite fired boilers will most likely
exceed emission levels of nitrogen oxides obtained by utilizing more conventional coals.
Both Chinese environmental standards (650 mg/Nm3) and World Bank Environmental Guidelines (300
ng/joule) for nitrogen oxides emissions from power boilers were developed for conventional coals.
Therefore, the proposed design for the Leiyang Power Plant-Phase 2 will exceed both Chinese and World
Bank environmental requirements/guidelines.
Discussion
The World Bank project team informed the Borrower (Hunan Electric Power Corporation) about the above
standard excessive emission levels of NO, and recommended that they use state-of-the-art boilers and
discuss the matter with Chinese environmental authorities. The World Bank also provided the Borrower
with what is considered to be "best international practice" for NO, emissions from modem anthracite
boilers.
Information presented to the Borrower is based on discussions between power sector industry
representatives and the World Bank in a consultation process on the new draft environmental guidelines for
thermal power stations. Representatives of power sector industry and other stake holders recognized that
the value of 1500 mg/Nm3 proposed for boilers using low volatility (e.g. anthracite) coals is realistic and
achievable. This figure has been incorporated in the updated World Bank environmental guidelines which
have not yet been officially adopted.
With this information, the Borrower engaged in discussions with the National Environmental Protection
Agency (NEPA) and the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP). Both these organizations agreed to allow an
emission level of 1300 mg/Nm3 (see attachment). Chinese officials are currently in the process of revisiting
their environmental regulations to accommodate anthracite fuels and ensure their full enforcement in the
future.
This Environmental Assessment examines modifications to air quality likely to occur relative to Chinese
air quality standards and any subsequent impacts on the human and natural environment from the proposed
power station. Although some violation may occur to the short term (hourly) Chinese standard for ambient
levels of NO., it was considered to be insignificant, because: (a) daily and annual standards are met, (b)
violations would be extremely infrequent, and, most important, (c) resultant ambient air quality will be in
compliance with all ambient standards of the World Bank, WHO and western countries (e.g. Great
Britain, USA etc.). Thus the EA concluded that this slight exceedance of the Chinese short term standard
(not enforced in practice), will not result in any measurable environmental impact.



Conclusion
NEPA has officially approved the EA prepared for the project, with full recognition of the exceedances to
current Chinese regulations for NO, emissions and air quality as discussed above. The World Bank
supports this position, believing that: (a) the analysis presented in the EA clearly indicates that
environmental impacts of NO, emissions are very limited and acceptable and (b) achievable standards
based on international best practices are preferable to higher but not enforceable standards.
The Borrower has agreed to maintain an environmental monitoring program which will, inter alia, include
continuous and automatic monitoring of both ambient and emission levels of NO,. The Borrower has
further agreed to adopt additional mitigating measures for NO, emission control should the monitoring
program, and/or environmental authorities deem it necessary.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The following summarises the environmental assessment for the Leiyang Power
Plant phase 2 extension project.  The transmission system  development
requirements associated with the Hunan Power Development Project are considered
in a separate report (Part B of this report)
General Description
1 Located in the centre of China, Hunan Province has good communications and
abundant resources. It is therefore an area for economic development and has
developed rapidly in recent years. At the end of 1995, the total installed electricity
generating capacity in Hunan Province was 8055.5MW, of which hydropower was
4211.3MW (52.3% of the total) and thermal power 3844.2MW (47.7%). In 1995,
the whole province generated and purchased 33.94TW.h of electrical energy, of
which 1.359TW.h was imported from neighbouring provinces. Hunan province
can not maintain a balance between electricity generation and consumption.
Moreover, hydropower, which constitutes 52.3% of the total-capacity, has a low
guaranteed output, with utilisation as low as 2000 hours. This results in serious
power shortages during dry seasons.  According to predictions by Hunan
Provincial Electric Power Bureau, by the year 2000, the whole Province will
require 55.0TW.h electricity and capacity of 10,000MW. By 2005, electricity
demand is predicted to be 81.2TW.h, requiring a capacity of 14800MW.
Therefore, it is imperative to expedite further power construction in Hunan
province.
2 Leiyang Power Plant is a pitmouth power plant located in central Hunan, close to
a coal mining area,. The 1st phase project (2x200MW) was commissioned during
1988 and 1989. The original programmed capacity of the site was approved to be
1200MW. Common facilities, such as water supply, coal transportation, chemical
water treatment plant and railway, were constructed and completed according to
this programmed design capacity. As a result of the existing facilities, the
construction of the 2nd phase extension project is characterised by economical
investment and reduced construction period. This would help to alleviate power
shortages in the southem part of Hunan, support the supplies in the central area
and promote regional economic development. The security of supply and
economic operation of the Hunan grid system would also be improved.
3 The construction of Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project conforms with the
national strategy of expediting the development of central and westem parts of
$
ES-i



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
China. It also accords with the energy policy of linking coal production with
electricity generation to reduce transportation requirements. It is also in line with
the plan of Leiyang municipality to develop into a "brand new industrial city with
electric power as an emphasised industry and communication and trade as
leading factors".
4 The proposed feasibility report on Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase extension
project has been approved by the Ministry of Electric Power and State Planning
Commission and has been confirmed by the State Council in applying for over
300 million US$ World Bank loan, to be utilised to purchase major electricity
generating and control equipment.
5 According to the requirements of relevant regulations in China and World Bank
Operational Directive 4:01 (Environmental Assessment), the Leiyang Power Plant
2nd phase extension project should carry out a thorough environmental impact
assessment.  The Leiyang Power Plant entrusted this task to Nanjing
Environmental Protection Research Institute .(NEPRI), which has a class A
certificate of environmental assessment. NEPRI prepared an EIA for this project
in May 1997 based on 2x35OMW units, revised in October 1997 to reflect 2 x
300MW unit size.
6 The Environmental Protection office of the Ministry of Electric Power chaired a
meeting in Beijing on 17 May 1997 to pre-examine the EIA. Those participating in
the meeting were NEPA, Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau,
Hengyang Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Leiyang Municipal
Environmental Protection Bureau, Electric Power Programming General Institute,
Central China Electric Power Group and Hunan Provincial Electric Power
Company etc. amounting to 26 representatives from 15 institutions. The experts
and representatives reviewed the EIA report and organised an assessment /
examination working group of 9 experts. Following this review, the Ministry of
Electric Power submitted document No 354 (1997) to the National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA) in June 1997. NEPA granted approval for the project
on July 28, 1997 based upon this document.
7 Following a review by the World Bank, it was also determined to supplement the
environmental assessment studies with the assistance of a consultancy contract
to Power Consult to aid with the production of an environmental assessment
report to fully comply with World Bank requirements.
Project Description
8 Leiyang Power Plant is in the south-eastern part of Hunan province, located in
ES-2



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
Xinhe and Luqi villages, on the right bank of a meandering section of Leishui
River. Surrounded by waters on its south, north and west sides, and with farms,
hills and mountains at its east, the site is in a zone of gentle hills. The natural
ground elevation (Yellow Sea elevation) is 82-11Om.
9 The Leiyang phase 2 development would occupy a site immediately adjacent to
the phase 1 plant. The site is currently disused, having been used as a
construction laydown area for the phase 1 development. There will be no
requirement for land acquisition, resettlement or compensation.
10 The original plans for the Leiyang site considered its potential for up to 1200MW
of capacity. Investment was made during the original construction for certain
common facilities such as the cooling water intake structure, water treatment
plant, auxiliary boiler etc. The phase 2 plant would also use the existing ash
disposal lagoon. This may require an increase in the dam height to accommodate
the increased disposal requirements, assuming that utilisation rates of ash are not
increased in future. However, the site is well constructed, has adequate potential
capacity and has no requirements for relocation or compensation of existing
tenants.
11 Zhujitan marshalling station of Yonglei railway is 2km south of the plant site. The
dedicated railway for the plant joins the Beijing-Guangzhou line at Zhujitan
marshalling station. About 4km south of this is Baisha Mine Administrative
Bureau.
12 The Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase project (2x200MW) and 2nd phase project
(2x300MW) will only use local anthracite. The coal supplied to the 1st phase
project contains, on average, 0.39% sulphur and 25.19%, ash. The 2nd phase
project is designed for 0.31%-0.46% sulphur (average 0.36%) and 24.63% ash on
average.  The 1st phase project consumes 1.368 million tons coal per year
resulting in 0.32 million tons ash.  The design for the 2nd phase project is to
consume 1.65 million tons coal and produce 0.435 million tons of ash.
13 The coal will be supplied by three state owned coal mines which are well
managed and have no particular safety issues associated with them. They are
believed to operate in full compliance with all health and safety regulations of
Hunan Province and PRC.
14 In Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase project, the two boilers share a common 210m
high stack. For the 2nd phase project, two boilers are also to share another
common 210m  high stack.  The 1st phase project uses an electrostatic
precipitator with four electric fields, with precipitating efficiency of 99%. The
ES-3



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
intention is that the 2nd phase project is to adopt a more efficient electrostatic
precipitator, with precipitating efficiency of 99.68%, to meet the World Bank
emissions guideline of 100 mg Nm 3 particulate emissions.
15 The Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase and 2nd phase projects both adopt direct
cooling water systems. The water used in the power plant is taken from Leishui
River. The 1st phase project abstracts 15.6 m3s ' water in summer and
11.2 m3 s in winter. The 2nd phase project is designed to abstract 21.44 m3s' in
summer and 15.97 m3s1 in winter.
16 In the 2nd phase project the waste water from the plant area, after being treated
to attain suitable quality criteria, will be used as make-up water in the ash sluicing
system. After the completion of 2nd phase project the ash water in the ash lagoon
is entirely reclaimed for re-use, without any drainage of ash water. The warm
water discharge, mechanical cooling water and uncontaminated surface drainage
from the plant area (except for the coal yard) are all discharged directly into
Leishui River.
Climate Characteristics
17 Leiyang municipality is in a subtropical humid monsoon climatic region. The
annual average wind speed is 1.6m/s. The prevailing wind direction in the whole
year is NNW, that in summer SSE, in winter NNW.
Baseline Atmospheric Quality
18 Leiyang is mainly an agricultural area, with industry located in a few well defined
urban areas. There are 11 major sources of air emissions, of which Leiyang
Power Plant phase 1 is the largest. However, because the power plant chimney
is much higher than those of the other 10 sources, it is not necessarily the largest
contributor to ambient concentrations.
19 The daily average concentrations of PM10, SO2 and NO2 are all well below the
relevant air quality standards, typically not exceeding 40 to 60% of the standard.
Very occasional NOx 1 hour average concentrations were measured that are
comparable to the Chinese air quality standard. However, NO2 concentrations
measured at the time were about 20% of the NO2 standard. TSP ambient
concentrations at some sites were also comparable to the relevant standards, but
are primarily due to local sources such as dust blow from roads and not from
Leiyang Power Plant. The results are summarised in Table 1.
20 The monitoring data available at the time of the assessment was limited in extent
ES-4



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
and a supplementary programme of continuous monitoring at two points, one
upwind of the site and one downwind, was initiated because of this. Such data as
was available from the additional programme was used in the analysis where
appropriate.
Mitigation Measures for Atmospheric Pollutants
21 Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase and 2nd phase projects will both use low sulphur
content coal as fuel (<0.46%S).
22 The 1st phase project has a 210m high stack and 'double room', four electric
field, ESP with precipitating efficiency of 99.0%.
23 Leiyang power plant 2nd phase project is also to adopt a 210m high stack and
highly efficient ESP, with a designed precipitating efficiency of 99.68% as is
required to meet World Bank particulate emission standards of 100 mg Nm 3.
24 It is proposed that Leiyang power plant 2nd phase project is to adopt a W flame
downshot boiler with low NOx bumers.
Environment Atmospheric Impact Prediction
25 After completion of Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase extension project, the whole
plant SO2 discharge concentration and the smoke dust emission concentrations
will satisfy the requirements of the appropriate Chinese national standard -
GB13223-1996 and also the World Bank guidelines.
26 The maximum predicted ground level concentrations of SO2, NOx and PMi0 for
phases 1, 2 ( and 3 ) are presented in Tables 5.2.3a,b,c. Also included are the
cumulative maximum concentrations as each additional phase comes into
operation, with the current background also included. The annual average and
daily average concentrations of PM10, SO2 and NO2 are below the Chinese and
World Bank air quality standards, typically not exceeding 40 to 60% of the
standards. The NOx daily average, however, exceeds the Chinese standard by
up to 12% when phase 2 is in operation. Maximum hourly ground level
concentrations of SO2 and PM10 did not exceed the Chinese or World Bank
standards. Maximum hourly concentrations of NOx exceeded the Chinese
standard by up to 67% (phase I and 2 combined ).
27 For NOx emissions from the existing plant, there are no national emission
standards to be applied to existing plant of this age. For the 2nd phase project,
NOx discharge concentrations are extremely unlikely to attain the required
ES-5



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
standards contained in GB13223-1996 or the World Bank guidelines. This is a
consequence of the emission standards having been developed based on power
generating plant buming bituminous or other coals with high volatile content.
Anthracite, such as will be used at Leiyang, has an extremely low volatile matter
content (5.97%). This results in it being difficult to maintain stable combustion
without operating at relatively high flame temperatures. High flame temperatures
result in generation of NOx from atmospheric nitrogen. Consequently, it is
believed that best available technology will result in flue gas NOx levels (1000-
1500 mg Nm-3) in excess of those required by the Chinese standard
(650 mg Nm-3). The potential control measures to prevent this would require
recourse to expensive altemative combustion technologies or to post-combustion
flue gas treatment. The World Bank will require maximum NOx emissions of 1500
mg Nm-3 for coal fired power plant buming low volatility fuel as at Leiyang.
28 The NOx Chinese maximum hourly average standard is predicted to be
exceeded for a small percentage of the year. However, other International hourly
average standards for NOx or NO2 will not be exceeded. It is therefore concluded
that such small exceedances of the Chinese standard are acceptable on human
health grounds.
29 Since the aim of emissions control is primarily to protect the environment at
ground level, the project has been assessed in terms of the potential impacts on
ambient NOx levels.  It is believed that the actual impacts from the proposed
plant on ambient concentrations will be acceptable. Consequently additional
expenditure (both capital and recurrent) on additional NOx control measures is
considered not to represent the 'Best Available Techniques Not Entailing
Excessive Cost' (BATNEEC).
Alternative Schemes
30 The altemative of adopting flue gas desulphurisation technology has been
rejected. Leiyang Power Plant 1st and 2nd phase projects will both bum low
sulphur coal. SO2 mass emissions, emission concentrations and the resulting
ground level concentrations, all satisfy the requirements of Chinese standards
and World Bank criteria.
31 The Leiyang power plant phase 1 plant uses comer fired (quadri-angle injection)
boilers as opposed to the proposal for the 2nd phase project to adopt W flame
(downshot) boilers with additional low nitrogen combustion technology. These W
flame boilers offer considerable advantages in terms of higher combustion
efficiency and flexibility.
ES-6



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
32 More advanced combustion technologies, such as fluidised bed combustion,
would be more expensive and have limited world-wide operational experience for
units of this size, and China has no operating experience. As such it is not
proposed to adopt such technologies in this case.
33 Similarly, flue gas treatment to control NOx emissions, by Selective Catalytic
Reduction or Selective Non Catalytic Reduction, would also increase capital and
operating costs and have no Chinese operating experience. Given the predicted
adequacy of the ambient air quality following the proposed emissions these
alternatives are not to be adopted.
34 Fabric filters to control particulate emissions have been rarely used in China.
There is therefore a lack of operational and management experience and
operation costs would also be higher. Therefore, the 2nd phase project is to
adopt ESPs with high precipitating efficiency for which there is considerable
operational and management experience.
Closure of Existing Boilers
35 The construction of new, efficient power plant at Leiyang will alleviate power
shortages and hence facilitate the closure of some existing, inefficient and
polluting power capacity. It is planned to close 10 existing boilers in Hunan
province by the year 2000. These total 300 MW of generating capacity.
36 In comparison with these the operation of Leiyang Power Plant phase 2 will
result in a 100% increase in capacity, but only a 7.9% increase in coal
consumption and 65.5%  increase in NOx emissions.   SO2 emissions will
decrease by 47%, ash and slag by 20% and particulates emissions by as much
as 95%.
37 These high emissions from the old boilers are also exacerbated by the fact that
all except two of the units emit flue gases via stacks of only 75-100m as opposed
to the 210m stack proposed for Leiyang. As a consequence their impact at
ground level on the environment and human health is proportionately greater than
pro-rata based on emission concentrations alone.
38 Thus overall the ability to replace existing inefficient boilers in Hunan province
will result in an overall improvement in environmental and human health
conditions.

Aquatic Environment
39 The water source for Leiyang Power Plant is the Leishui River. Within the range
of 1 km upstream of the power plant water intake to 15 km downstream, the
various indices of water quality of Leishui River all satisfy the required Chinese
quality standards of GB3838-88 "Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard".
40 There is a requirement in the standard that weekly average temperatures should
not be raised by more than 10C in summer or 20C in winter. The temperatures in
the Leishui River have been considerably reduced on average by the construction
of the Dongjiang Reservoir upstream of the site which provides adequate scope
for the cooling water discharge from Leiyang Power Station within the range of
natural temperatures.
41 Leiyang Power Plant ash lagoon is located at Yanpengchong, 3.5km from the
power plant. In the vicinity of the ash lagoon, the underground water quality
indices all satisfy the requirements of the "Ground Water Quality Standard"
(GBIT 14848-93).
42 The impacts possibly incurred to water environment are:
*  Impacts to Leishui River incurred by power plant abstraction.
* Impacts to Leishui River incurred by warm discharge and waste water
discharges.
* Impacts to underground water from the ash lagoon
Mitigation Measures And Impact Prediction - Aquatic Environment
43 The aim is to enhance water re-utilisation rate in order to reduce power plant
abstraction. The 2nd phase project will treat boiler feedwater treatment plant
waste water, oil contaminated waste water, coal transportation system drainage
and domestic sewage to adequate water quality and then utilise these as make up
water in the ash / slag sluicing system. The ash water in the ash lagoon will then
be reclaimed for re-use. Thus, the whole plant can save some 1000 t/h in water
abstraction requirement.
44 The Lelyang Power Plant has optimised the water intake structure to ensure no
impact on navigation.
45 By means of physical and mathematical models, Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase
project has established an optimised warm water discharge scheme. The axis of
E
ES-B



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
the discharge channel will intersect the river bank at angle of 47°. Upstream of
the discharge, a flow-guiding dam of circular arc will be constructed. This scheme
can not only eliminate any impact on ship navigation, but also reduce the extent of
the high temperature plume.
46 Owing to the operation of Dongjiang Reservoir upstream of Leiyang Power Plant,
the water temperature in summer in the vicinity of power plant is lower than
natural conditions (because of discharge from deep within a large water body
which has large thermal inertia).
47 By means of regulating the operation of the Dongjiang hydropower stations, the
flow of Leishui River in the vicinity of the power plant can be regulated to be not
less than 116m3s-'. This operating regime has been confirmed by Hunan
Provincial Electric Power Controlling and Communication Bureau. Under this
condition, the discharge from Leiyang Power Plant will result in water
temperatures downstream being approximately the same as that before the
construction of the reservoir.
48 This should prove not to be unfavourable to the ecology of the river. The existing
evidence indicates an impoverished fauna and flora in the waters immediately
below the Dongjiang Dam which becomes more diverse by the Leiyang reach,
where temperatures have changed to be closer to natural levels. The proposed
discharge would generally return the river to a regime similar to the natural
condition, apart from a small area immediately adjacent to the discharge. As such
it is considered that a cooling tower is unnecessary for the Phase II development.
49 Following the construction of the 2nd phase project, the power plant (including
that from phase 1) is to have the water treatment plant waste water, oil
contaminated waste water, coal transportation system drainage and domestic
sewage used in ash sluicing. The ash water will then be reclaimed and reused.
Therefore in the 2nd phase project, the power plant is to have only cooling water,
ventilation and air conditioning water, and plant area rainwater outside the coal
yard discharged into Leishui River.
50 This recycling of water within the power plant and ash system will result in a
reduction of polluted aquatic discharges from the power plant site to a level less
than currently exists with the phase I plant operating. Currently the phase I
aquatic discharges comply with national discharge standards, with the exception
that the overflow from the ash lagoon is sometimes at a pH higher than required
by the standard (pH9). Recycling of this water to the power plant will eliminate
this effluent.
ES-9



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                     PowerConsult
51 The bottom of the ash lagoon is clay with low permeability, average permeability
coefficient of 2.39x10 -7 cm s-1. The resulting seepage discharge is estimated not
to exceed 8.4 t h-1. Water seeping through the ash dam will be reclaimed and
reused. The monitoring results from the area indicate that there is no adverse
impact to underground water from the already existing ash lagoon and so no
additional problems are envisaged from the continued use of this facility.
Alternative Aquatic and Solid Waste Controls
52 Various altemative waste water treatment options have been discounted in
favour of recycling of the water within the system to eliminate waste water
discharges, other than cooling water and some surface water drainage.
53 A wet type ash removal system was discounted, because it would inhibit the
utilisation of fly ash.
54 A dry ash storage yard was not considered, because of the adequacy of the
existing system, the increased investment required and potential for additional
fugitive dust emission problems.
Acoustic Environment
55 Currently in Leiyang Power Plant, the plant boundary noise and surroundings
noise all satisfy Chinese and World Bank relevant noise criteria.
56 The major noise sources would be required to adopt silencers, sound insulation
and other measures and to be centralised at the main plant hall. Therefore, after
the completion of the 2nd phase, the power plant boundary-noise would still
satisfy relevant noise criteria.
Ecological Environment
57 The extension of the ash lagoon would encroach on a certain amount of
vegetation, comprising mainly secondary woodland and plantations. The site of
the phase 2 development is within the existing plant boundary and would incur no
significant loss of habitat of any ecological value.
58 The thermal regime, following mixing of the discharge, would closely resemble
the natural temperature conditions prior to installation of the hydropower schemes
on Leishui River. As such no significant adverse effect on the ecology of the river
would be predicted.

Construction Period
59 The major environmental impacts during construction period are noise and
fugitive dust. Necessary measures will be adopted to minimise adverse effects
and to carry out construction supervision in mitigating environmental impacts
during the construction period.
60 No particular problems are envisaged during the construction period that would
not be encountered on any major construction project of this scale.
Social Economic and Living Quality Standards
61 Within the power plant area, there is one important archaeological site: Cailun
Tomb, 1.5km north-west of the power plant. No possible impact will result from
the development other than a slight deterioration in air quality, but air quality (for
S02, NO, and TSP) would remain well within acceptable limits and so no adverse
impact is predicted for Cailun Tomb.
62 The Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase extension project will play an important role
in alleviating Hunan province power shortages, encouraging local coal industry,
increasing employment opportunities and improving people's living standards.
63 The Leiyang Power Plant called and chaired "The Hunan Province Leiyang
Power Plant 2nd Phase Project Environmental Protection Consultation
Symposium" on March 21, 1997. Also they distributed, on various occasions, the
uForm Of Public Consultation On Environmental Impact For Leiyang Power Plant
2nd Phase Project Construction". Local residents have thus been provided with
opportunities to express their opinions.
64 It is widely acknowledged that there is a severe shortage of electricity power
supply in this region and that the abundant coal resource in the locality should be
utilised to alleviate this problem. The village residents therefore all hope that the
project will start up and be completed as soon as possible so that anticipated
benefits can be realised as soon as possible. It was acknowledged that there
would be some environmental impacts from the project, but that with suitable
mitigation measures, as proposed for this project, these impacts would be small
and would not outweigh the local benefits of the development.
Environmental Management and Monitoring
65 The phase 2 project at Leiyang has the advantage of being a' development of an
existing power station site which has a well established Environmental Management
Department. This has 10 staff, an office and laboratory facilities. These will form the
ES-1 I



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                       Power Consult
basis of the environmental management facilities for the proposed development. The
existing laboratories are large enough to accommodate the requirements of the
extension project and only a very few additional staff would need to be trained I
recruited.
66 The phase 2 plant would be provided with better emission control equipment (such
as ESPs) than the existing plant and will also have a comprehensive monitoring
system (including continuous monitoring of stack gas emissions, continuous ambient
air quality monitoring, monitoring of waste waters, noise monitoring etc.)
67 Initially monitoring will be used to ensure compliance with required environmental
performance standards. This will include construction and commissioning phase to
ensure the plant is built in such a manner that it can operate in conformance with
manufacturers guarantees and requirements of National and World Bank standards.
Ongoing operational performance will then also be subject to ongoing monitorin-, to
ensure continued high levels of environmental performance.
Potential Phase 3 Development
68 Currently there are no firm proposals for further development of this site. However,
the site is clearly well located, with suitable land in the vicinity, fuel and water
supplies.  Some preliminary assessment has been given to the potential for
development of two further 600MW units at this location.
69 A further development would require an indirect (cooling tower) system to secure a
sufficient water supply during low river flow conditions. Indirect cooling would also
avoid significant additional thermal pollution impacts on the Leishui River.
70 The ash lagoon theoretically has sufficient expansion capacity to take up to 40 years
of ash produced from a further 1200 MW of plant together with all of the ash from
phases 1 and 2.
71 The stack gas emissions would require careful assessment in the light of actual
detailed proposals. It is thought that SO2 emission would not present any problem
given the good air quality in the area and use of very low sulphur coal. Similarly
particulate emissions would have little impact at ground level, considering the height
of the stack and likely emission concentrations.
72 NOx emissions may be the most problematical consideration. Impacts from the
power station extension would be low, but would need to be reassessed in the light of
more monitoring data than exist at present and the technologies available at the time
the phase 3 extension project is considered. The predictions for the impact of phase 3
are set out in table 5.2.3b. These show that the maximum NOx daily average,
exceeds the Chinese standard by up to 94% when phase 2 and 3 are both in
ES-12



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                      Power Consult
operation. The hourly average air quality standard for NOx may be also exceeded -
by up to 173% for phases 1,2 and 3 combined. This would, however, only occur for
about 0.4% of the year.
73 The predicted impacts of a phase 3 development on short term ground level NOx
concentrations would require careful evaluation in the light of the best technologies
available at the time of the development. In addition, measures such as combining
the stack with that of the existing plant, (to maximise plume buoyancy), or selecting a
site a few kilometers away (to avoid superimposing the stack gas plumes) could be
considered.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Hunan Electricai Power Company (HEPC) proposes to construct a 600 MW (two
300 MW boilers) anthracite fired power station on the outskirts of Leiyang City, on
the bank of the Leishui River. This is a phase 2 development, adjacent to an
existing 400 MW (two 200 MW boilers) power station.
1.2 Associated with this project there will be a requirement to upgrade the electricity
grid infrastructure. This will entail construction of two 220 kV transmission lines
and associated substations, a 335 km line to connect the privately developed
Changsha Build Operate Transfer (BOT) Project to the Hunan Power Grid and a
415 km line to connect the Leiyang Project to the Hunan Power Grid. The
transmission system developments have also been subjected to an environmental
assessment reported as 'Part B' of this report.
1.3 HEPC will also retire 10 small inefficient polluting boilers (8 x 25 MW and 2 x 50
MVW) at several other locations in Hunan Province during the period up to the year
2000.
1.4 In accordance with Chinese environmental regulations, an Environmental
Assessment (EA) was prepared for the power generation facility by Nanjing
Environmental Protection Research Institute of Ministry of Electric Power
(NEPRI).  HEPC requested World Bank financing for this project and in
accordance with World Bank policies and procedures (OD 4.01, Environmental
Assessment) the project was rated 'Category A' and an EA must be prepared to
World Bank specifications.
1.5 World Bank environmental specialists reviewed the draft EA prepared by NEPRI
and, for a number of reasons, concluded that the document required
strengthening to meet World Bank EA standards. They also requested an
independent evaluation of the ecological impacts to be anticipated from the
discharges of the heated cooling water, and the occupational health and safety
status of the mines supplying the anthracite fuel.
1.6 Chinese officials agreed to the recommendation that an international consultant
with substantial relevant experience be engaged to prepare an English text EA
document incorporating all project components (generation, transmission, coal
mine safety, and boiler retirement) that will meet World Bank technical
requirements.
1.7 The main objective of this work program is to produce an EA report for the
1-



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
Hunan Power Development Project in accordance with World Bank requirements.
This EA report is based on the draft EA report already prepared by NEPRI and
the considerable amount of analysis that has been undertaken in support of the
project.
1.8 Power Consult were engaged to undertake this work, in close collaboration with
HEPC and NEPRI. In addition Intemational Mining Consultants Ltd (IMCL) were
engaged to advise on safety issues relating to the coal mines that will be used to
supply the phase 2 development.

ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM

Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                              Power Consult
'. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION POLICY, REGULATION AND
ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
2.1  The Environmental Protection Administration And Organisation In China
2.1.1 Environmental protection in China is mainly led and supervised by the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and its subordinate provincial, municipal and
county Environmental Protection Bureaux.  The environmental monitoring is by the
corresponding Environmental Monitoring Stations. In the electric power industry, the
Ministry of Electric Power and regional and provincial Electric Power Companies all include
Environmental Protection Offices. The power plants each have Environmental Protection
Sections. The overall environmental management framework is shown in Fig. 2.1-1. The
local monitoring stations provide reports seasonally or annually for the monitoring station at
regional, provincial and national levels. The Environment Protection Bureaux are also
responsible for the supervision of the Environmental Monitoring Stations at the same level.
2.2 Environmental Protection Regulation And Policy In China
2.2.1 The principal Chinese laws and regulations conceming power plant environmental impacts
are the following:
- PRC Environmental Protection Law (Dec. 26,1989)
- PRC Ambient Air Pollution Prevention and Mitigation Law (Revised on Aug. 29, 1995)
- PRC Solid Waste Environmental Pollution Prevention And Mitigation Law (Oct. 30, 1995)
* PRC Water Pollution Prevention and Mitigation Law (Revised on May 15, 1996)
* PRC Environmental Noise Prevention And Mitigation Law (Oct. 29, 1996)
. Construction Project Environmental Protection Administration Regulation (1986)
* Construction Project Environmental Protection Design Stipulation (1987)
* Construction Project Environmental Protection Administration Procedure (1990)
* Electric Power Industry Environmental Protection Administration Regulation (1996)
2.2.2 According to the environmental protection regulations in China, it is necessary for a
project, in its feasibility study stage, to carry out an environmental impact assessment. For
the Leiyang Power Plant, the project supervisory unit in Hunan Electric Power Company
2-1



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                              Power Consult
submitted an environmental assessment report to the Ministry of Electric Power for pre-
examination. The Ministry of Electric Power then submitted the environmental assessment
report to the National Environmental Protection Agency for approval, which was granted on
July 28 1997.
2.3 Environmental Protection Requirements Of The World Bank
2.3.1 The World Bank has established guidelines to ensure that borrowers can appropriately
express the environmental impact incurred by their proposed actions. They must consider
various altemative schemes of the project to be constructed, develop control measures to
alleviate the unavoidable impacts and ensure the implementation of these measures.
2.3.2 The World Bank Operational Directive (OD 4:01, 1991) provides general guidelines for the
compilation of an environmental assessment report.
2.3.3 During the appraisal process, the World Bank screens projects, according to their potential
adverse environmental impacts. Projects are designated to one of three categories 'A', 'B',
or 'C'. The Leiyang Power Plant project, as for all new thermal power projects, is
designated as category 'A', meaning that there is a possibility of adverse environmental
effects. A full environmental assessment should therefore be carried out.
2.4 Environmental Standards In China, World Bank and World Health Organisation
2.4.1 The Leiyang Power Plant phase 2 extension project (2x300MW) will implement Chinese
environmental standards shown in table 2.4-1.
2.4.2 The World Bank has issued special industrial pollutants emission and environmental
quality criteria which can be used for power plant.
* Table 2.4-2 shows World Bank general environmental protection guidelines for electric
power projects.
* Table 2.4-3 and 2.4-4 shows World Bank and World Health Organisation ambient air
quality guidelines.
* Shown in table 2.4-5 are the World Bank noise guidelines.
2.4.3 One issue of particular concem for the Leiyang Power Project is that relating to the NOx
emission standards. Both the World Bank and the Chinese regulations are based on
power plant buming soft coals with relatively high volatility. Hard, anthracite coals have low
volatility. This results, amongst other factors, in a requirement for high flame temperatures
to achieve stable and efficient combustion, which in tum tends to produce high NOx
emissions. This is compounded by a relative lack of experience in buming anthracite in the
2-2



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                                 Power Consult
developed countries and hence the technology for cost-effective NOx control is not as well
developed as for soft coals.
2.4.4 Advice from major boiler manufacturers is that practical emissions of NOx are likely to be
in the range 1000-1500 mg Nm-3 : considerably in excess of the Chinese standards. New
draft World Bank Guidelines will adopt 1500 mg Nm-3 for NOx emissions from anthracite
fired boilers. Given that the reason to control emissions is to protect the environment, this
EA places greater emphasis on assessing the potential impact of the emissions from the
proposed plant, rather than in comparing the emissions against standards that were framed
without reference to the particular fuel to be utilised. More discussion of this is provided in
Chapter 5.
2.5 Pollutant Discharge Fees
2.5.1 Hunan Province has introduced a system of pollution discharge fees: MAdministrative
Provision for Levy Fees on Discharge of Pollutants in Hunan Province, Decree 26 January
12 1994'. This sets a fee system payable on discharges and noise in excess of the
appropriate standards, with the exception that there is also a small volume related fee
payable on industrial wastewater discharges which do comply with standards.
2.5.2 Cooling water discharges are not included in the category of wastewater discharge.
Similarly, ash and slag disposed of to a specially designed ash yard 'will not levy fees
temporarily'. Table 2.5-1 summarises the fee system.

3. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
3.1 Project Name, Size And Primary Composition
(1) Project name: Leiyang Power Plant Phase 2 Extension Project
(2) Construction unit: Leiyang Power Plant
(3) Size and composition
* existing 'phase1' plant, 2 x200MW units, total capacity 400MW
* extension 'phase 2' project, 2 x 300MW units, total capacity 600MW
In addition, consideration is given in this report to a potential Phase 3 development
of 2 x 600MW, although there are no firm proposals for further development of this site
at present
3.2 Geographical Position And Justification
3.2.1 Geographical Position
3.2.1.1 Leiyang city is situated in south-eastem Hunan Province, (Fig 3.2-1) at the
side of the Leishui River. The topography is generally hilly with rivers crossing
the terrain. It is part of the of Wuling escarpment and the catchment of Xing
River. Leiyang Power Plant is located in Xinghe village and Luqi village at the
east side of a meander in Leishui River, 3 km south of the Leiyang urban area.
According to the Leiyang urban expansion plan, the urban area will develop
southward to the west side of Leishui river on the opposite side to the power
plant. There is a road bridge to connect them.
3.2.1.2 The plant site is surrounded with water to the south, north and west. To the
east of it lies farmland and hills. The plant site is higher in the south and lower
in the north, gently sloping with small hills. The natural ground level is 82 to
11 Om (related to yellow sea datum). It is composed of class 11 terrace and class
IV terrace. The majority of the plant site is wasteland.
3.2.1.3 The plant site is 2 km from Zhujitan Marshalling Station of Yonglei railway to
the south, on the opposite bank of Leishui River. The station is 4 km from
Baisha Mine Bureau to the south, 4 km from Zaoshi Township to the north-west,
where Leiyang station is located. The state highway runs through Leiyang city
(see Fig.3.2-2).

Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
3.2.2 Justification
(1) Electric power system
3.2.2.1 Hunan provincial electricity grid is one element of the central China electric
network. To the end of 1995, the installed total capacity in Hunan province is
8055.5MW, of which hydropower is 52.3% and thermal power is the remaining
47.7%. The import of electricity from other provinces was 1.359TW.h. Hunan
provincial hydropower stations are mainly medium and small in size and have
low guaranteed output. This results in a serious lack of electricity in the dry
season.
3.2.2.2 Hunan provincial electric grid is connected with the central China electric
network via two transmission lines. One of them is a 500kV line which is
connected into Gezhouba Hydropower Station. The another is a 220kV line,
connected into the Fenghuangshan substation in Wuhan Municipality.
3.2.2.3 Leiyang Power Plant, following the phase 2 extension, will become one of
the main power sources in Hunan provincial electric grid. It will supply electricity
mainly to the southem Hunan province (Hengyang, Chengzhou, Lingling,
Youcha) and the rest will be transmitted to the central province.
(2) The project benefits
3.2.2.4 Leiyang Power Plant Phase 1 was constructed with an original planned
expansion capability to 1200MW. The water supply, coal transportation, water
treatment capacity, highway and railway infrastructure etc. were all constructed
in accordance with that planning size. As a result, when compared with a new
project of the same size, the extension of Leiyang Power Plant has several
advantages:
*  The investment can be reduced by 200-300million Yuan (RMB). Table 3.2-1
provides an approximate breakdown of cost savings that can be anticipated.
*  The construction period can be shortened by more than 6 months. The existing
infrastructure and shared common plant items will clearly reduce construction
times.
3.2.2.5 Leiyang Power Plant is a pit-mouth power plant, to bum the anthracite from
local coal mines. This has the following advantages:
* To avoid traffic and environmental problems arising from coal transportation for
long distances.
*  To widen the scope of local employment in an area which is targeted for
3-2



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
increased development.
* To develop the Hunan provincial coal industry and increase the prosperity of the
local economy.
3.3 Layout In The Plant Site
3.3.1 The main Leiyang Power Plant specifications and environmental protection
facilities are shown in Table 3.3-1.
3.3.2 The main block of the phase 2 project will be located in parallel immediately to
the east of the phase 1 project main block, the distance between them is 46m.
The floor elevation is 86.0m. The switchyard is north of turbine house and is
parallel with the phase 1 project switchyard. The eastem yard of the main block
can be used as the construction laydown area. The layout of the plant site is
shown on Fig3.3-1. Photograph 3-1 shows the current appearance of the
proposed development site.
3.4 Fuel And Air Pollution Mitigation
3.4.1  Fuel
3.4.1.1 Both phase 1 and phase 2 projects of the Leiyang Power Plant fire mainly
local anthracite coal. Baisha coal mine is the biggest supplier. For phase 2,
only three coal mines will be used for fuel supply:- Baisha, Jiahe and Xifangdu
coal mines. These are all State owned and operated mines. The coal
composition used at Leiyang is given in Table 3.4-1.
3.4.1.2 The phase 1 project bums 1.368 million tons coal per annum, of which 0.988
million tons is transferred by rail and 0.38 million tons transferred by road. The
annual coal consumption for the phase 2 project would be 1.65 million tons,
giving a total requirement for the whole power plant of 3.18 million tons. All of
the coal for phase 2 will be transferred by rail.
3.4.2 Ambient Air Pollution Mitigation
3.4.2.1 Low sulphur coal is fired for both phase 1 and phase 2 of the Leiyang Power
Plant.
3.4.2.2 The phase 1 project of the Leiyang Power Plant has a 210m stack and
'double size' electrostatic precipitator (ESP) with four fields, giving an efficiency
of 99% particulate emissions control.

3.4.2.3 The Leiyang Power Plant phase 2 project is also going to have a 210m stack
and higher performance ESP designed to achieve e; -ions below 100
mg Nm3.
3.4.2.4 It is proposed that the Leiyang Power Plant phase 2 project is going to use a
'W flame' boiler with low NO, combustion technology. This will attain as good a
control of NOx emissions as is practical without compromising boiler efficiency
or incurring excessive costs. As noted in Chapter 2, anthracite gives particular
problems with regard to NOx emission control because its low volatile content
results in a requirement for high flame temperatures to achieve stable, efficient
combustion conditions. Advice from boiler plant manufacturers suggests that
operating plant, burning anthracite with low NOx bumers, produce NOx
emissions in the range 1,350-1,720 mg Nm-3. An estimated value for phase 2 is
1,500 mg Nm-3, as is consistent with new draft guidelines from the World Bank
for anthracite fired boilers. The best performance available will not be known
until detailed boiler design is undertaken, with reference to the particular coal
quality available, during the tender process for the project, but 1500 mg Nm 3 is
to be specified as a guarantee maximum NOx emission level in the bidding
documents for this project.
3.5 Water Supply And Water Treatment
3.5.1 Water Source And Makeup Water System
3.5.1.1 The make up water of the Leiyang Power Plant phase 1 and phase 2
projects is obtained from Leisui River. The phase 2 project water pump house
was constructed together with that for the phase 1 project. The inlet position is
seen Fig 3.2-2 and Photograph 3-2
3.5.1.2 The Leiyang Power Plant phase I project (2x200MW) units has a direct
cooling water system; the makeup water requirement in summer is 15.6 m3s-1
and 11.2 m3s-1 in winter.
3.5.1.3 It is proposed that the 2nd phase project (2x300MVl) will also adopt a direct
cooling water system, with designed maximum abstraction of 21.44 M33s- in
summer and 15.97 m3s1  in winter.  The proposed discharge would be
immediately downstream from the current Phase 1 discharge position,
(Photograph 3-3)
3.5.1.4 The 2nd phase project water balance diagram is given in Fig. 3.5-1.

3.5.2 Feed Water Treatment
Industrial water treatment
3.5.2.1 The industrial water for the phase 2 project will be treated by settling. New
facilities required are:
*  Industrial water treatment station, within the station, to build a pump house
located at north side of 2nd phase project transformer station.
*  Two 430 m3h-1 settlement ponds.
*  Two 1500 m3 clean water ponds
Boiler feed water treatment
3.5.2.2 The phase 2 development will utilise the facilities already installed for the
phase 1 power station
3.5.2.3 The 1st phase project boiler feed water treatment system comprises:
agglutinating, settling and 1st grade demineralising system using mixed bed ion
exchange resins.
3.5.2.4 The water quality of output of the above mentioned system can satisfy the
criteria of demineralised water quality required for the 2nd phase project.
3.5.2.5 For the 2nd phase project, it is only necessary to refurbish some of the water
treatment equipment to ensure that it can reliably meet the increased water
demand for the whole power plant.
3.6.3 Waste Water Treatment
3.5.3.1 Table 3.5-1 summarises the water treatment system proposed for Leiyang
phase 2 development.
3.5.3.2 Machinery cooling water, including exposed circulating cooling water and
other cooling water for oil-cooler and other purposes:- Having only a 2-3 C
temperature rise and no new pollutants added, the water will be mixed with
cooling water to be discharged into the Leishui River.
3.5.3.3 Drainage from air conditioning, including that from forced and induced fans,
hydrogen generating stations and air conditioners:- With little temperature rise
and no new pollutant added, this water will be discharged through rainfall
collection system into Leishui River.
3-5



Hunan Power Development Prject (Part A)                        Power Consult
3.5.3.4 Acid and alkaline waste water, including the drainage from boiler make-up
water treatment plant, and the chemical waster water from the laboratory:- The
main problem is pH value, which is treated by neutralisation prior to discharge.
The treated water in the 2nd phase will be used to sluice ash.
3.5.3.5 Domestic sewage from the plant area, in which the main polluting items are
BOD and COD: The water is treated in the 1st phase by the process of
"precipitating-oxidising pond" and treated water, when within the permitted
standard, is discharged. In the 2nd phase, the treatment process will be the
same as in the 1st phase, but the treated water will be used to sluice ash.
3.5.3.6 Oil contaminated waste water, mainly the drainage from oil storage sites:-
The waste water in both the 1 st and 2nd phase will be treated by a 'filthy oil drain
sump', a cyclone oil water separator, a specific filter for oil contaminated waste
water and then will be used to sluice ash. The oil recovered from the separators
will be recycled.
3.5.3.7 Washing water from the main workshops:- This does not contain detergent
but only solids and so will be directly used to sluice ash.
3.5.3.8 Waste water from boiler acid-cleaning:--Mainly contains low pH, SS & Fe
and will be treated before being used to sluice ash. See Fig. 7.1-1 for the
treatment techniques.
3.5.3.9 Washing water for air pre-heater:- This also contains pH, SS & Fe and will
be treated before being used to sluice ash, (Fig.7.1-1).
3.5.3.10 Drainage from coal transport system:- Mainly contains suspended solids
and will be treated by settling and then used to sluice ash. The reclaimed coal
can be bumed.                                                                   -
3.5.3.11 Rainfall drainage in plant area:- The rain water flowing through coal field
will be precipitated for coal collection and the water be used to sluice ash. The
rain water from other areas is discharged directly into the Leishui River through
the rainfall collection system.
3.5.3.12 All the above methods of mitigating pollution in waste water streams are
those successfully used in the Phase I project. However, the project in the 2nd
phase is designed to minimise discharge of waste water as far as possible. Most
of the waste water will be used to sluice ash and the ash water will be recycled
so minimising both water supply and discharge requirements.

3.6 Solid Waste Treatment
3.6.1 Ash (PFA & FBA) Treatment Type and Amount
3.6.1.1 In the 1st phase project, the Leiyang Power Plant adopted a mixed
pulverised fuel ash (PFA) and furnace bottom ash (FBA) removal system, with
hydraulic ash conveying and a wet ash lagoon. The rate of utilisation of the ash
as a by-product has been very low.
3.6.1.2 For the 2nd phase project, the power plant is to have the PFA and FBA
removed separately, to facilitate utilisation of the ash as a useful by-product.
PFA will be conveyed hydraulically, and stored in the existing wet lagoon
(Photographs 3-4 to 3-8). It is expected that all the FBA will be utilised for the
construction industry. The power plant will also preserve the option to produce
dry PFA for the convenience of fly ash utilisation.
3.6.1.3 Fig. 3.6-1 and Fig. 3.6-2. show the ash treatment system for 1st and 2nd
phase projects respectively. The Leiyang Power Plant ash production rates are
given in table 3.6-1 and analyses of ash from the Phase I plant are given in
Table 3.6-2.
3.6.2 Ash Lagoon
3.6.2.1 The Leiyang Power Plant ash lagoon is a mountain valley lagoon with a
permeable ash dam. The surroundings of the ash lagoon are mainly bushes and
secondary forest without rare and precious species. The surrounding land has
no housing or farmland. The 1st phase project ash lagoon water, apart from
evaporation and seepage, drains into the Leishui River via a ditch.
3.6.2.2 The 2nd phase project is to share the same ash lagoon with the 1st phase
project. The 2nd project needs only to raise the dam height and there are no
residents to relocate.
3.6.2.3 It is proposed to build a surface water drainage intercepting ditch at an
elevation of 173-175 m around the ash lagoon to redirect the majority of rain
water directly into Leishui River via an open drainage ditch. The flood-
intercepting-ditch is designed to accommodate the P=2% 24 hours torrent flow
and has been checked at the p=0.2% frequency (but for which there is some risk
of some overflow). With this facility it will be possible to recirculate all ash water
and ash dam seepage within the power station ash sluicing system and so end
the requirement to discharge ash water to Leishui River.

3.7 Total Pollutant Emissions
3.7.1 Estimates of pollutant emissions, after completion of the Leiyang Power Plant
2nd phase extension project, are given in Table 3.7-1.
3.7.2 After extension, the total installed capacity will increase by 600 MW, an
increase of 150%, while the coal consumption will increase by only 121%,
demonstrating that the energy utilisation efficiency is greatly enhanced. SO2
emissions will increase by 114% (146% for worst case coal), smoke dust
emissions increase only by 37%, the ash lagoon no longer discharges waste
water and plant area drainage increases only by 143%. Therefore, compared
with the 1st phase project, the 2nd phase project is provided with significant
environmental benefits.
3.7.3 Only NOx emissions will increase more than pro-rata to the increased power
output. This is unavoidable if higher efficiency combustion is to be achieved,
without resorting to excessively costly altemative technologies (see Chapter 6).
3.8 Transportation Engineering Outside The Plant
3.8.1 Railway For Coal Transportation
3.8.1.1 The Leiyang Power Plant uses a dedicated railway line, 2400m long,
connected to the Zhujitan marshalling station (see Fig.3.2-2). Originally
constructed with seven tracks, 870 m long, Zhujitan marshalling station was
expanded for the power plant 1st phase project by two special lines and
corresponding equipment.
3.8.1.2 The power plant now has two locomotives: type Dongfanghong 5. The plant
railway working station now has 8 tracks: 2 for loaded wagons, 2 for empty
wagons, 1 for locomotive running, 1 for unusual coal-wagon unloading, 1 for
locomotive reorganising and 1 for occasional use(for oil unloading, acid / alkali
unloading and empty wagon rearranging). Some additional provision and
renovation of existing facilities will be needed to meet the additional
requirements of Phase 2:
* Increasing the effective length of loaded and empty car lines to more than 850m
(from 700m at present).
*  Moving the rail-weighing-apparatus to outside the plant.
*  Adding an oil unloading and acid/alkali unloading line.
*  Adding production and welfare buildings.

*  Adding 1 locomotive: Model 7 Dongfeng
*  Improving the rail loading and points systems.
3.8.2 Water Supply And Ash Water Pipe Line
3.8.2.1 Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project is to adopt a direct cooling water
system. The civil construction part of the waterside pump-house has already
been completed with the 1 st phase project.
3.8.2.2 The 2nd phase project requires a water supply steel pipe line 02440x10 -
830m long. It also needs double culvert 2x2.0x3.Om - 570m long and a single
culvert 2.0x3.0m - 100m long.
3.8.2.3 The 2nd phase project requires two 0325x7 ash pipes, 4450m long to
Yanpengcheng ash lagoon, to be laid alongside the existing 1st phase ash pipe.
3.8.3 Power Transmission System
3.8.3.1 Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project is to construct 220KV lines to
connect into grid systems, and additional work will be undertaken to reinforce
the grid elsewhere in Hunan Province. A separate environmental assessment
report ('Part B') considers the impacts of these proposals.
3.9 Construction Schedule
3.9.1 The outline implementation schedule for Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase
extension project is shown in Fig 3.9-1.
3.10 Phase 3 Development
3.10.1 There are currently no firm proposals for further development of the Leiyang
site. However, there is additional flat land adjacent to the site, and there could
be additional capacity at the ash yard for future use, beyond the requirements of
Phase 1 and 2. The World Bank therefore requested some preliminary
assessment to consider the feasibility of the site for potential future expansion.
Given the tendency to select larger, more efficient units for new developments in
China, a hypothetical 2 x 600 MW plant is considered.
3.11 Replacement Of Existing Boilers
3.11.1 Although not directly part of this development project, it should be recognised
that increasing the power generating capacity in Hunan Province will facilitate the
T
3-9



Hunan Power Development Prnject (Part A)                     Power Consult
closure of some old, inefficient boilers. In the '9th Five-years Plan' (1996-2000) it
is proposed to close 10 boilers at 5 power plants in Hunan Province, with a total
capacity of 300MW. Table 3.11-1 gives some details of the units scheduled for
closure and Figure 3.11-1 shows their locations.
3.11.2 The coal consumption and air emissions from the boilers to be closed are
shown in Table 3.11-2.  This data is base upon knowledge of the coal
consumption and quality of each of the boilers and TSP emissions from periodic
monitoring. NOx emissions were not measured, but are based on information
from Xian Thermal Institute, who tested 50 boilers in China for their NOx
emissions between 1995 and 1990. From this information approximate NOx
emission rates have been estimated from the data relating to similar types of
plant.
3.11.3 These boilers are not in close proximity of the Leiyang Power Plant, and so
there will be no direct interaction in terms of combined effects of their emissions
on local conditions. However, closure of each one will have a beneficial impact on
its local environment and the scale of these benefits is considered in Chapter 5.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE
4.1 Basis Of Assessment
4.1.1 Environmental Impact Assessment Class
4.1.1.1 The World Bank classifies power plant projects into 'Category A' on the basis
that they may have significant adverse environmental impacts.
4.1.1.2 According to Chinese regulations: "Technical Guidelines for Environmental
Impact Assessment" HJIT2.1-2.4-93, issued by NEPA in 1993, atmospheric
environmental impact assessments are divided into three classes according to
the pollutant discharge amount, complexity of surrounding topography and
implemented air quality standard etc. The first class work is complicated, the
second is moderate and the third is simple. The assessment of Leiyang power
plant environment atmospheric impact is considered as being of first class.
4.1.1.3 Surface water environmental impact: In the light of "Technical Guidelines for
Environmental Impact Assessment" HJ/T2.3-93 issues by NEPA in 1993. The
surface water environmental impact assessment work are divided into 3 class
according to wastewater discharge amount and water quality, surface waters
scale and quality requirement. The first class surface water environmental
impact assessment work is complicated, the second class is moderate, the third
class is simple. No need to implement surface water EIA if project has less than
third class surface water environment impact assessment condition. and that of
surface water environmental impact is of 2nd class.
4.1.2 Assessment Area
4.1.2.1 The atmospheric impact assessment area, as defined in the Technical
Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment (HJ/T2.3-93), is a 32 km
square with the power plant stack as its centre (see Fig. 4.1-1).
4.1.2.2 The water body assessment area considered (based on HJIT2.3-93) is from
8km upstream to 36km downstream of the power plant discharges (see Fig. 4.1-
2). In addition, the effects of hydropower schemes 135 & 147 km upstream of
Leiyang and 36 km downstream have been considered in relation to the cooling
water system impacts.

4.2 Topography, Geology And Geomorphology
4.2.1 Leiyang Municipality is located at the southern margin of Hengyang basin and
foothills of Wuling mountain range, at 112'37'-113 13' E, 26 07'-2643' N. The
assessment area rises progressively to the east of the site - from 70m elevation
to 478.5m (Yellow Sea datum level), south to 301m; south-east to 623m. To the
north the land falls gently to around 66m. Thus the area consists of an
undulating inclined surface from south-east towards north-west and includes
mountains, hills, ridges and plains, but mainly dominated with ridges and hills.
4.2.2 Leiyang power plant is located in a low hilly region in the mid section of Leishui
River, with hill heights generally up to 200-300m. There is only one mountain,
533m high, 16 km south-east of the power plant. Agricultural activities occur in
the valley bottoms and low hills, with highest terrace elevation at 130 -140m.
4.2.3 The plant area has no major geological faults, and the rock strata are relatively
intact.
4.2.4 The characteristics of tectonic activity of the region are of a. huge area which is
rising slowly.  Owing to the erosion of the river course, meandering is
pronounced. In the Pleistocene epoch, the terraces accumulated along both
sides of Leishui River, to 3-7km wide. During the late period of Pleistocene
epoch, the Leishui River ran via Yikoudu, Wangjiaaoshang, Yushiwan and
Dukou to form an ancient river bed terrace which now forms the plant area.
4.2.5 The ash lagoon is located in a long and narrow valley running south-north,
approximately 1.5km long, and 1.1km across at the widest point. The average
width of the valley bottom is less than 100m. The terrain of the valley bottom is
inclining 12.5% towards south. The elevation of mountains on the east, west,
and north sides are between 180-240m.
4.2.6 The hill and mountain bodies are composed of sandstone and shales,
intermingled in layers, with fissures and with strongly weathered surface layers.
Mountain slopes and valley bottoms have a 1.15-2.0 m layer of silt and loam.
4.2.7 Various types of soil occur, such as paddy soil, red soil, aqualt, red limestone
soil, black limestone soil, and yellow soil etc. Among these, the red soil is
dominant. It is, distributed on medium and low mountains, hills and ridges at an
elevation 100-750m, occupying some 76.1% of the land area of Leiyang
municipality. It is formed from slaty shale, limestone, granite and quatemary red
soil under conditions of high temperature and humidity and is characteristically
acidic, sticky and with poor fertility.

4.3 Water Resource
4.3.1 Precipitation
4.3.1.1 According to the Leiyang Municipal Annals, the long term annual average
precipitation is 1319.6mm; the maximum (in 1961) 1863.5mm; the minimum (in
1971) 960.9mm. Rainfall is more than 1100mm in 80% of the years. The annual
average number of rainy days is 166, 45.5% of days in a whole year.
4.3.1.2 The annual average evaporative loss is 1452.4 mm.
4.3.2 Leishui River
Flows
4.3.2.1 The Leishui River flows from south to north throughout Leiyang Municipality.
It discharges into Xiang River at Leishui River mouth in Hengyang Municipality.
The Leishui River is 453km long, has an average surface width of 300m, and its
river bed average slope is 0.2%. The average flow is 258m3 s', average annual
runoff of 8,154 billion m3. The maximum recorded daily total flood occurred on
13th June, 1961 of 460.5 billion m3. The Leishui River valley area is 11,783km2,
with 1975.3km2 in Leiyang Municipality, 16.7% of the whole.
4.3.2.2 In Leiyang section, in the dry season, the river has a width of approximately
240m, and average water depth of only 1.5m. The Leishui has an abundant flow
which is favourable for irrigation, power generation and navigation. In the region
of the power plant, the river has been officially classified for use for industrial
water supply, power generation, irrigation and navigation.
4.3.2.3 The large and small Dongjiang hydropower stations were built 147km and
138km upstream of Leiyang power plant section respectively. These were put in
commission from 1987-1994. At 36km downstream of Leiyang Power Plant,
there is Yaotian hydropower station, built in 1988-93, and also one at Baiyutan
at 50km. The flow of Leishui River, at the power plant, is mainly regulated by the
water drawn off the Dongjiang Reservoir. The resulting flow is at its minimum in
July, August and September. Figure 4.3-1 shows a schematic diagram of the
hydropower stations in Leishui River.
4.3.2.4 The Dongjiang reservoir has a catchment area 4713km2, that is 47.6% of the
9902km2 catchment upstream of Leiyang. The features of the reservoir are a
large capacity of 8.22 billion m3 and a high carryover storage for regulation
performance, with reservoir capacity capable to be varied by 5.67 billion m3.
4-3



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
4.3.2.5 The large Dongjiang hydropower station has an installed capacity of 500MW
and is a power plant controlled by the electricity grid. According to runoff
analysis and research by Central and Southem Hydropower Survey and Design
Institute, the Leiyang river section has. on average, a flow less than 116 m3 s-
for 58.3 days in each year, mainly during June, August and September. To
regulate the Leiyang river section to have its minimum average daily flow in July,
August and September to be more than 116 m3s, the large Dongjiang
hydropower station should have the daily average output increased from 45MW
to 103MW in these three months. This would utilise 600 million m3 of Dongjiang
reservoir capacity. This is feasible from point of grid operation and reservoir
management and has been agreed by HEPCB as the future operating
requirement following Phase 2 development.
4.3.2.6 Figure 4.3-2 shows the flow regimes of the Leishui River before construction
of the dam (monitoring from 1941) at both Dongjiang and Leiyang sections,
together with the design flow regime that would occur following construction of
the phase 2 development.
4.3.2.7 An additional complicating factor is that there is a proposal to construct the
Shatou 32MW run-of-river hydroscheme immediately upstream of the Leiyang
Power Plant. This would abstract the whole flow of the river approximately 7km
upstream, divert the water across the meander of the river and discharge back
to the existing river bed 1150 m upstream of the Leiyang Power Plant intake
4.3.2.8 HEPC commissioned Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute (NHRI) to
investigate whether this scheme would have any influence on the intake or
discharge of cooling water by the power station.
4.3.2.9 The scheme would have no effect on river flow rates to the power station as
it has no effect on regulating river flow rates.
4.3.2.10 NHRI constructed a physical model of the system:- 1:100 horizontal scale
and 1:75 vertical scale, the model being 35m long by 20m wide. The
conclusions are that, by the power station intake and discharge positions, the
flow patterns in the river will have re-established to the existing pattems. This
conclusion is obviously dependent on the Shatou scheme implementing a
design of discharge that does not induce large lateral momentum in the
discharge that could cause the river to meander from its present course. It is
understood that this will be a design consideration for the discharge such that
interactions with the Leiyang Power Plant will be negligible.

Temperatures
4.3.2.11 The construction of the Dongjiang Dams, at approximately the same time
as the Phase I of Leiyang Power Plant, has had a marked effect on the
temperature regime in Leishui River.
4.3.2.12 Figure 4.3-3 shows temperature data relating to the Dongjiang and Leiyang
river sections before and after dam construction.  There is a continuous
monitoring station in the downstream vicinity of the Dongjiang Dam. Data is
shown for 1983-1985 representing conditions before the construction of the dam
in 1987. Comparable data is also given for 1990-1992 to represent existing
temperature conditions in the water discharged from the dam. There is no
continuous monitoring in the Leiyang river section. However, before construction
of the dams, it would be expected that river temperatures would have been fairly
uniform  downstream  to Leiyang.  For existing conditions, a survey was
conducted throughout 1993 to gather baseline data for this project.  The
monitoring was carried out in a cross section 800m downstream of the existing
discharge, with sampling at the surface and also at depth (approx. 1-1.5m) at 20
m from each bank and also from mid stream (6 positions in total). Average data
across all points is presented in the figure.
4.3.2.13 The Dongjiang Dams have had a marked effect on river temperature. The
reservoir discharges water from deep in a large water body. Temperatures in
the discharge are now relatively uniform throughout the year, at slightly higher
temperatures than the natural winter temperatures, but at markedly lower
temperatures in summer.
4.3.2.14 By the time the water has travelled to Leiyang, these effects are less
marked, as a result of water entering the system from the rest of the catchment,
and also equilibration with ambient temperatures.
4.3.2.15 Figure 4.3-4 illustrates the differences from the pre-dam construction
conditions more clearly. At Dongjiang, the summer discharge temperatures are
on average some 160C lower now than they were. By the Leiyang section, even
with the influence from Phase 1 development, temperatures are still 2-3 OC lower
than they were from March to July. In August and September conditions are
approximately the same as before, but from October to December temperatures
are again lower than the natural regime. Only in February is there an apparent
warming effect from the combined effects of the dam and power station
discharges.

4.3.2.16 A detailed survey of the temperatures around the discharge of Leiyang
Power Station was also conducted on 31 May 1993 by the Hunan Provincial
Environment Monitoring Central Station. This covered an area 100m upstream
of the discharge to 1300m downstream, with surface temperatures recorded on
a grid every 25m across the river at intervals of 50m downstream.
4.3.2.17 The results are illustrated in Figure 4.3-5. It is apparent that the thermal
discharge tends to follow the shoreline on the side of the discharge
4.3.2.18 The +3° C temperature rise zone extends approximately 750m downstream
and up to approximately 30m across. The total area enclosed is approximately
900Dm2. The +10C zone extends more than 1700m downstream, with maximum
width of about 60m. The extent of this area downstream is uncertain, but up to
1700m encloses an area of approximately 64,000m2.
4.3.2.19 In addition to the surface temperature monitoring, temperatures were also
recorded at 1.5m depth 25 and 50m offshore from the discharge point to 700m
downstream. Variation in temperature, from that at the surface, did not exceed
approximately 0.1-0.2°C, indicating that the thermal plurne is well mixed
vertically in the water column.
Water Quality
4.3.2.20 The major polluting sources, in the vicinity Leiyang, are Zaoshi steel and
iron works and Cailun paper factory, Leiyang Power Plant, a nitrogen fertiliser
factory and a titanium white powder plant. The principal pollutants are SS, COD,
Cd and As as shown in Table 4.3.2-1. The locations are shown in Fig.4.1-2.
4.3.2.21 Hengyang Municipal Environmental Monitoring Station has collected
information on the water quality in July 1996 and Oct. 1996. The methods used
are summarised in Table 4.3.2-2 and the sampling cross sections used are
indicated in Fig. 4.1-2. Each cross section was monitored mid-river and at 30m
from each bank on 3 days each in July 1996 (wet season) and October 1996
(dry season), one sample each day.
4.3.2.22 The results are shown in Tables 4.3.2-3 and 4.3.24. The data are all fully
compliant with the relevant ambient water quality standards.
4.3.3 Underground Water
4.3.3.1 Within the Leiyang area, the shallow aquifer is abundant, with approximately
2700 natural springs, most distributed on low lying land within hilly areas. The
4-6



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
dynamic storage of underground water is estimated as 503 million m3. The
subterranean drainage, formed by flowing from watersheds to low lying valleys
zone, is distributed mainly within the region of Renyi, Gongping and Donghu.
However, In the region of the power plant and ash lagoon, there is no large
movement of underground water.
4.3.3.2 Two monitoring wells were used for monitoring near the ash lagoon, at the
municipal horticulture farm and at Liangjiacong (see Fig.4.1-2). Sampling was
on the same frequency as for the surface water monitoring and the sampling
methods and limits of detection shown in Table 4.3.3-1.
4.3.3.3 The underground water quality monitoring data during dry and wet seasons
are shown in Tables 4.3.3-2 and 4.3.3-3. The data all conform with the relevant
standards for groundwater, with the exception that pH values at Liangjiacong
appear rather low in July. Given that the pH of water in the ash yard is high
(see following section) these results indicate no significant pollution arising from
the ash yard.
4.3.4 Discharges
4.3.4.1 Hengyang Area Environmental Protection Bureau monitors the discharges
from Leiyang Power Plant 4 times per year to provide the certified monitoring
results. Table 4.3.4-1 summarises the monitoring data for 1994-6. In addition,
Hunan Electric Test and Research Institute determined the averaged quality of
ash water discharged and permeated through dam during Sept. 12-14 of 1996,
as shown on Table 4.3.4-2.
4.3.4.2 The discharges generally comply well with the requirements of the
wastewater discharge standard. An exception is that the pH of the discharge
from the ash yard are frequently in excess of pH 9, as required by the standard,
and can reach values of pHl 0. This is one reason for the proposal to recycle
water from the ash yard as part of the Phase 2 scheme. The breaches of the
discharge standard have resulted in Leiyang Phase 1 Power Plant being charged
pollutant discharge fees of 200,000 yuan per annum. No other discharge fees
have been levied under the requirements of Hunan Province Decree No 26 (see
section 2.5).

4.4 Atmospheric Resources
4.4.1 Climate of the Region
4.4.1.1 Leiyang Municipality has a typical subtropical, humid monsoon climate. In
Winter, the circulation is controlled by cold continental high atmospheric pressure,
generating a prevailing wind from the north. In summer, southerly winds dominate
under the controlling influence of subtropical high atmospheric pressure systems.
spring and autumn, are characterised by altemate periods of predominantly northerly
and southerly winds, marking the transition period between the summer and winter
seasons. Overall the climate is mild with four seasons. Typically there are sunny
periods with short spells of fairly intense precipitation. Spring temperature are quite
variable, with the summer and autumn being the driest seasons. Temperatures are
typically sub-zero during the winter and the long summer is normally dry.
4.4.1.2 The Leiyang Municipal meteorological observatory is located 1km north of
the plant site. Averages of the major meteorological parameters for the period 1958
to 1992, are shown in Table 4.4.1-1:
4.4.1.3 Figure 4.4-1 shows the distribution of winds speeds at 10m as a function of
wind direction. These data are based on the five year period from 1990 to 1994. As
explained above, the predominant wind directions are approximately northerly or
southerly.
4.4.1.4 In addition to wind data, the stability of the atmosphere has been
categorised over the 1990 to 1994 period using the Pasquill method. This data is
required in the calculation of the rate of dispersion of stack gases in the atmosphere
using the Chinese model. The data are presented in Appendix E.
w
4.4.1.5 Air temperatures have also been collated for the 1990 to 1994 period.
Average temperatures for each month are shown in Table 4.4.1-2.
4.4.1.6 A detailed study of the vertical properties of the boundary layer was
undertaken between 5th and 20th of January 1995 using an ADAS (SOADAR)
remote sensing system. Data on the vertical temperature and wind profiles were
obtained at 2-hourly intervals during this period. Measurements were also made of
the depth of the boundary layer and the intensity of noctumal and daytime
inversions. This data is presented in detail in Appendix E.

Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
4.4.2.1 The industrial enterprises in Leiyang are mainly situated in the urban areas
of the  municipality; in the town of Zhaoshi; and the Baisha (coal) Mineral
Administration Bureau. The discharging height of atmospheric polluting sources,
except that of Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase (210m) and that of the Baisha mine
power plant (60m), are all between 35m and 45m. Atmospheric emissions,
according to 1994 statistics of Leiyang municipal environment monitoring station, are
listed in Table 4.4.2-1. The major gaseous polluting sources are shown in Fig. 4.1-2.
4.4.2.2 As shown from Table 4.4.2-1, Leiyang power plant (1st phase) is the
principal source of emissions to air in the Leiyang municipality. The annual
discharged amounts of S02, smoke dust, NO. are respectively 8700Uta, 3420t1a and
81 60Ua.  This is respectively 83.0%, 31.0%  and 90.3%  of the total amount
discharged. The total emissions of air pollutants in Leiyang Municipality for SO2,
smoke (suspended) dust and NOx, are respectively 10486tVa, 11016t/a and 9032t/a.
* Measurements of Ambient Air Quality in the Lelyang Area
4.4.2.3 Routine monitoring of S02, NOx and TSP was undertaken during 1995 and
1996 at three locations. This was carried out by the Leiyang Municipal Environment
Monitoring Station and daily average concentrations based on 8 of hourly/half hourly
measurements made at 3 hour intervals over periods of about 1 week during each
season. In addition, at a series of locations, two 5 day periods of air quality
measurements were made by the Hunan Provincial Environment Monitoring Control
Station. SO2, NOx, and PM10 were measured during the period 30th May to 3rd June
1993 and just PM10 measurements were made during the period 25th May to 31st
May.
4.4.2.4 In addition to this monitoring, a new programme of measurements has been
initiated at the request of the World Bank. A description of this programme and
results available to date are also included in this section.
4.4.2.5 The most important factors influencing the air quality as measured at the
various locations are the prevailing winds relative to the urban areas such as
Zhaoshi town and the residential quarter of Baisha mine. The locations of the
various monitoring sites and the periods for which they operated are shown in Figure
4.1-1. The locations of the sites were chosen so as to be representative of the
various industrial and residential areas in the Leiyang region (Table 4.4.2-2).
4.4.2.6 The air quality monitoring was carried out to the relevant environmental
monitoring technical standards as promulgated by National Environmental Protection
Agency of China.

4.4.2.7 The ambient air quality monitoring results for SO2, NO,, TSP in 30th May to
3rd June 1993 are listed in Table 4.4.2-3 and that of the PM10 daily average
concentration measured during the period 25th May to 31st May in 1995, are listed in
table 4.4.2-4. The statistics of the air quality results measured by the Leiyang
Municipality Environment Monitoring Station in 1995 and 1996 are listed in table
4.4.2-5(a), (b) and (c) (based on 7 days monitoring in January, April, July and
October each year, with 8 x 0.5 hour samples each day)
* Monitoring results analysis.
* Sulphur Dioxide
4.4.2.8 The SO2 monitoring data as described above are shown in Tables 4.4.2-3-
Tables 4.4.2-5c. The routine monitoring results indicate that the S02 annual average
concentration, maximum daily average concentration and maximum hourly
concentration are all less than the National Air Quality Standards. SO2 max. daily
average concentrations at the various monitoring points occurred in the range 0.025-
0.061mg m-3, which is only 16.7-40.7% of the daily standard. Table 4.4.2-5c sets out
the annual concentrations based on the seasonal measurement campaigns
undertaken in 1995 and 1996. In 1995, the annual daily average concentration at
the 3 monitoring locations were in the range 0.027-0.043mg m-3:- 45.0-71.7% of the
relevant National Air Quality Standard.  In 1996, the annual daily average
concentration at the 3 monitoring locations were in the range 0.022-0.040mg m-3,
which is 36.7-66.7% of the National standard. Comparison with the World Bank
annual average SO2 standard shows that the maximum concentrations measured
are about 60% or less of the standard.
* Nitrogen Oxides
4.4.2.9 As can be seen from Table 4.4.2-3 to Table 4.4.2-5c the NOx annual daily
average concentration, daily average concentration and short-term concentration are
all less than the relevant air quality standards. The NO, maximum daily average
concentration at the various monitoring points occurred in the range 0.018-0.039mg
m-3 which is only 18-39% of the relevant National Air Quality Standards. In 1995, the
annual daily average concentration at the 3 monitoring locations were in the range
0.026-0.031mg m-3, which is 52-62% of the National Air Quality Standard. In 1996,
the annual daily average concentration at the 3 monitoring locations were in the
range 0.021-0.030mg m3, which is 42-60% of the National Air Quality Standard.
Comparison with the World Bank annual average NOx standard shows that the
maximum concentrations measured are about 40% or less of the standard

4.4.2.10 The TSP monitoring data as described above are shown in Tables 4.4.2-3
to Table 4.4.2-5b. The concentrations measured are all within the relevant National
Air Quality Standards. The TSP maximum daily average concentration measured
was in the range 0.066-0.282mg m3, which is 22-94.0% of the relevant standard.
4.4.2.11 Comparing the monitoring results in 1996 with those made in 1995, the
TSP daily average concentration at various points dropped from 0.212-0.282mg m 3
in 1995 (70.7-94.0% of National standard) to 0.204-0.254mg m-3 in 1996 (68.0-
84.7% of National Standard). The TSP annual daily average concentration
0.127-0.191mg m 3 at various monitoring points (63.5-95.5% of National Standard)
in 1995 dropped to 0.122-0.159mg m 3 (61.0-79.5% of National Standard) in 1996.
4.4.2.12 The highest ambient TSP concentrations measured were mainly due to
fugitive dust emissions from the ground.
* PM10
4.4.2.13 PM10 daily average concentrations measured during the 2nd short term
campaign ( Table 4.4.2-4) at various monitoring locations are all less than the PM1O
National Air Quality Standard. The PM,0 max. daily average concentrations at
various monitoring points fall in the range 0.021-0.082mg m3, which is 14.0-54.7% of
the standard.
* Continuous Monitoring
4.4.2.14 On the advice from the World Bank, Leiyang Power Plant has recently
begun a continuous monitoring programme at two sites in the vicinity of the power
station. One site is at Mei Kuang about 3km from the power plant, downwind of the
prevailing wind direction This is in the area of Baisha coal mine which is in a rural
area. The other is in the town of Shi Qu about 3 km upwind of the power plant.
4.4.2.15 Initially samples were collected according to standard Chinese wet-
chemistry methods, with 8 samples a day (0.5 hr each for SO2 and NOx and lhr for
PM,0 and TSP) every 3 hrs. Sampling began on 16 July 1997. In addition,
continuous monitoring equipment (Thermo Environmental Instruments Inc) have
been imported from the USA. This equipment was put into service in mid October
1997, although there has been a delay on import of PM,0 monitoring equipment.
4.4.2.16 It is intended to conduct monitoring by both methods simultaneously for a
period to allow cross checking and possible correction for any bias in the data.
However the data currently available for analysis comprises daily averages from the
frequent sampling data from July to mid October and then continuous monitoring for
4-11



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
9-11 days (providing some data on hourly average concentrations). There is
insufficient overlap with the monitoring data described above to allow a comparison
to be made.
4.4.2.17 Table 4.4.2-6 summarises the results of the 'upwind-downwind' monitoring
to-date. S02 concentrations are in the region of 20% of the relevant air quality
standards. NO2 concentrations are about 25% of the relevant standards. Maximum
1-hour NOx concentrations reach the air quality standard at the 'upwind' site.
However, 73% of the NOx measured during this hour was in the form of NO which is
not considered to have any effect on human health. Also the Chinese 1 hour NOx
standard is particularly onerous. World Health Organisation guidelines set a
standard of 200 jig m-3 for NO2 compared to the Chinese standard of 150 pg m 3
NOx and 120 p9g m-3 NO2. Notwithstanding the occasional high NOx 1 hour
concentration, NOx 24 hour averages are typically only 50% of the air quality
standard ('upwind') and about 20% of the standard ('downwind'). PMl0 24 hour
average concentrations do not exceed the relevant air quality standard. Insufficient
data has been collected to make a meaningful comparison with the annual average
air quality standards. It is interesting to note that the 'upwind' concentrations are
higher in general than the 'downwind' measurements. Although the meteorological
data for the period of measurements has not been made available, this probably
implies that the 'upwind' concentrations are influenced to a greater extent by local
industriallurban sources and rather than measuring a significant contribution from the
existing Leiyang phase I power plant.
, Conclusion
4.4.2.18 The region where the power plant is located is mainly agricultural in nature
with industry located in a few well defined urban areas. 11 major sources of air
emissions have been identified. The Leiyang power plant (1st phase) is the largest
emitter of air pollution in the area. However, because the power plant chimney is
much higher than those of the other 10 sources, it is not necessarily the largest
contributor to measured air pollutants.
4.4.2.19 Ambient air quality monitoring of TSP, PM10, SO2, NO2 and NOx was
undertaken in the area during several years and for periods varying from about a
week up to two years. The daily average concentrations of S02, NO2 and PM10 are
all less than the relevant air quality standards - typically not exceeding 40 to 60% Of
the standard. Very occasional NOx 1 hour average concentrations were measured
which were comparable to the air quality standard. However, NO2 concentrations
measured at the same time were about 20% of the NO2 standard. TSP ambient
concentrations at some sites were also comparable to the relevant standards but are
4-12

primarily due to local sources such as dust blow from roads and not form the Leiyang
Power Plant.
4.4.2.20 The results indicate that additional sources such as the proposed Leiyang
2nd phase development is unlikely to have any significant impact on air quality.
4.5 Acoustical Environment
4.5.1 Hunan Provincial Environment Monitoring Central Station carried out a plant
boundary noise monitoring survey on 2nd June, 1993. No additional noise
generating plant has been commissioned since then. In order to survey the
impact incurred by plant area noise to the residential quarter, the central station
also deployed two monitoring points in that area in May, 1995.
4.5.2 In total, 9 monitoring points have been used for the noise baseline studies - at
locations shown in Fig.4.5-1. The noise surveys were carried out in June 1993
and May 1995, during day time (15:30-17:30) and at night (21:00-22:30).
4.5.3 A sound level meter (HY-140 digital sound level meter) was used, satisfying
the state measurement stipulations and monitored according to GBJT14623-93
"Measurement Method of Environmental Noise in Urban Area", GB12349-90
'Measurement Method of Noise at Boundary of Industrial Enterprises" and other
relevant standards. The results of the baseline noise survey are shown in Table
4.5-1.
4.5.4 Plant boundary noise: The daytime noise range was 44.0-53.8 dB(A). The
night time noise range was 40.0-50.0 dB(A). The noise at the plant boundary are
all within class 11 standard in GB12348-90 "standard of Noise at Boundary of
Industrial Enterprises".
4.5.5 Regional noise: The daytime noise range was 46.0-48.3 dB(A), the night time
noise range was 44.2-45.0 dB(A). They satisfy class 2 standard in GB3096-93
"Standard of Environmental Noise In Urban Area".
4.6 Ecological Environment
4.6.1 Terrestrial Ecology
Flora
4.6.1.1 Records of the natural resources are maintained in the Leiyang Municipal
Annals, which is maintained by a recording office for the Municipality. General
4-13



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                       Power Consult
observations support this information, but liftle detailed site survey / habitat
mapping work has been undertaken concerning the terrestrial ecology.
4.6.1.2 No original natural habitats remain in the vicinity of the power plant or ash
yard. Other than cultivated land, there is extensive forest, particularly on the
higher hill and mountain slopes. This is entirely secondary forest and artificial
forest with various wild shrubs, herbs and vines etc.
4.6.1.3 At elevations below 150m in the central and north-west part, the semi-
natural vegetation is relatively sparse with fewer trees or shrubs. The oil-tea
camellia, jujube tree, locust tree and cypress are sparsely distributed.
4.6.1.4 At 200-300m, in hilly areas, the vegetation cover is mainly of oil-tea camellia
forest, and also with artificial forest of China fir. There are also herbs and vines,
growing relatively luxuriantly.
4.6.1.5 At elevations above 300m, in the south-eastem mountainous region, the
dominant vegetation is subtropical coniferous forestmasson pine and China fir.
There are also Phyllostachys pubescens, oil-tea camellia, sweetgum, oriental
white oak and other trees and also vines such as kiwi berry. There are bushes
and grass clearings on mountain tops.
4.6.1.6 Currently, no rare and precious plants have been recorded in the area.
4.6.1.7 The afforestation and management of the vegetation in Leiyang power plant
is carried out very well. In the residential quarter and production area, trees
provide pleasant shade and grass make extensive lawns leaving no exposed
ground surface. There are also tree screens planted around features such as
the coal stockyard area to reduce dust blow and improve the visual appearance
of the area.  The site manages a small nursery to provide stock for the
omamental planting around the site and other planting schemes.
4.6.1.8 At the ash lagoon site, the vegetation on the surrounding hill slopes is
dense, comprising mainly secondary woodland and plantations. A list of species
from a survey of the area is provided in Table 4.6-1.
Fauna
4.6.1.9 There are few records of rare animals in the Leiyang area, the fauna
consists of species typical of southem China and of the south-west region.
4-14



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
4.6.1.10 There are only a few eagles, hawks, golden pheasant, cuckoo, crows,
woodpeckers, boar and otters. Sparrow, tortoise, turtle and mud frog also occur.
Abundant species are hare and rat.
4.6.2 Aquatic Ecology
4.6.2.1 The ecology of the Leishui River has been strongly influenced by the
construction of hydropower schemes on the river. This understanding was
confirmed during consultations with Leiyang Municipal Govemment and
Municipal Animal Husbandry and Aquatic Products General Station.
4.6.2.2 There is some information available conceming the ecology of the Leishui
River prior to the construction of the dams. Eleven positions were monitored
prior to dam construction, in September of 1984 and March of 1985. All of these
sites were upstream of the Dongjiang dam apart from one site immediately
downstream. Data were collected on bacteria, algae, vascular plants protozoa,
rotifers, cladocera and copepoda, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish.
4.6.2.3 Following construction of the hydropower schemes, field. investigations were
also carried out in July 1993 to April 1994 on the 170 km of river from the
Dongjiang Reservoir down to Hengyang City. Table 4.6-2 summarises the
overall change in planktonic fauna and flora observed between this survey and
the information from prior to dam construction. For all taxonomic groups of
plankton, species numbers, biomass and numbers have increased following dam
construction. This is probably mainly a result in the regulation of river flows such
that peak flows are no longer as high as previously. Also there has been an
increase in nutrient levels in the river over the period, resulting from some
additional sewage discharges to the river.
4.6.2.4 For benthic invertebrates there was little overall change, with 17 species
identified prior to dam construction and 20 after. There has been a reduction in
numbers of malaria mosquitoes since the dam construction.
4.6.2.5 There were 54 species of fish present in the river prior to dam construction,
belonging to 8 families:- predominantly 36 species of Cypinidae, 5 Cobitidae and
4 Bagridae. Following the reservoir construction, there are 50 species recorded,
belonging to 13 families. However, there have been marked changes in fish
population composition. 17 species have disappeared from the river (including
Squalio barbus, Siniperca meric, Amysa sinensis, Cirrhina molitorella). The
species composition now includes 13 species not previously recorded (including
Cophiocephalus argus, Monopterus albus etc.). In general the species now
4-15



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                       Power Consult
recorded are adapted to slower flow conditions than previously and semi-
migratory species, such as Squalio barbus have disappeared.
4.6.2.6 The number of commercially important fish species is also very low.
Relatively few individuals of species such as grass and silver carp are caught,
and these are probably artificial introductions or escapes from aquaculture as
conditions are not suitable for breeding of these species. From statistics in
1992, the commercial value of the fishery is very small - only 2.7% of agricultural
production. Within the fishery, artificial breeding dominates, with natural fishing
accounting for only 4.76% of production.
4.6.2.7 Currently, no rare and precious fish are recorded from Leishui River.
4.6.2.8 As noted in Section 4.3.2, there are now considerable variations in
temperature conditions down the length of Leishui River. The effect of the
Dongjiang Dam is to release water at a nearly constant temperature throughout
the year.  This is considerably colder than the natural summer river
temperatures. As the water travels downstream, the water tends to equilibrate
with ambient temperatures, and also tributaries contribute water at ambient
temperatures. This variation in thermal regime might be expected to have a
significant influence on the ecological conditions in the river.
4.6.2.9 Table 4.6.-3 shows the diversity of planktonic organisms in the river at
sampling locations at Mugengqiao, immediately below the dam, Yongxing,
(approximately 70 km downstream), at Leiyang (146 km) and Hengyang (approx.
170km).  In general the diversity of planktonic organisms was lower at
Mugengqiao than at locations further downstream.
4.6.2.10 This pattem is even more pronounced if fish species are considered (Table
4.6-4). In the whole river there is a total of 50 species recorded belonging to 13
families. Of these 48 species were recorded in the Leiyang river section,
whereas only 13 species are recorded immediately below the reservoir, at
Mugengqiao.
4.6.2.11 It should be noted that the Leiyang section of the river includes the zone
which receives the cooling water discharge from Leiyang Phase 1 Power Plant.
There is no information available as to the distribution of fish species in relation
to the thermal discharge. Such information would be difficult to obtain, given that
Margelef Diversity Index d=(S-1)/ln(N) where d=index, S= number of species in sample, N=
number of individuals in sample.
4,16



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
fish are mobile and can move into and out of water at different temperature
conditions quite rapidly, and may actively select preferred temperature
conditions or avoid adverse ones. It is likely therefore that, if the discharge did
have an effect on fish distributions, this would be variable depending on the
ambient conditions at the time.
4.6.2.12 Benthic invertebrates are not so mobile and so a study was undertaken on
4 November 1997 to look at the distribution of invertebrates in relation to the
Leiyang cooling water discharge. Professor Yu Zhitang (Institute of
Hydrobiology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences) arranged 9 sampling points,
in which 1-3 were 1500m, 1000m and 500m upstream of heat discharge, 4-9
were 100m, 300m, 600m, 1000m, 1500m and 2000m downstream of heated
discharge. Sampling was carried out using a 1/60 m2 Peterson grab 6 times for
each point at 25 from the Leiyang power plant bank of the river. Samples were
washed through a 40 os riffle sieve and fixed in alcohol.
4.6.2.13 Table 4.6-5 shows the data obtained. Figure 4.6-1 summarises this
information to show the number of species, number of individuals and diversity
index plotted against the recorded temperatures. There is no clear pattem to the
data, and certainly the sample from the most thermally impacted location does
not appear to have a reduced benthic invertebrate fauna.
4.6.2.14 In summary, the ecology of the Leishui River appears to have been
markedly changed by the construction of the hydropower schemes along the
river. In particular, water temperatures below Dongjiang Dam are much more
stable than would be natural and are considerably lower in summer than they
would otherwise be. By the Leiyang reach, this effect has reduced to some
extent and, as a consequence, ecological diversity, particularly of fish species, is
greater than is found immediately below the dam. There is no evidence of an
adverse impact arising from the current discharge from Leiyang Power Plant.

4.7.7.3 Leiyang municipality sits at the foot of Wulin mountain range. It has a
topography of rolling hills, unfolding as a circular screen of magnificent scenery,
with fertile soil, luxuriant vegetation and interweaving plains and ridges.
4.8 Health and Safety
4.8.1 Occupational Health And Safety In Coal Mines
4.8.1.1 It is a concem of the World Bank that the fuel supplies for the phase 2
development should not be associated with any unacceptable risks to workers in
the mining industry that the project will depend upon.
4.8.1.2 A report on the Health and Safety standards in the mines associated with
this project is attached as Appendix D.
4.8.1.3 There will be three state-owned deep coal mines that will be used to supply
the Phase 2 project, namely Xifengdu, Jiaha, and Baisha mines. Based upon
underground visits, and meetings with the mine directors, the mine's
Occupational Health and Safety Status were ascertained. The Consultants
overall conclusions and impressions gained were:
* Management are well organised and informed;
 Coal Mine Regulations are fully understood and implemented;
* Underground housekeeping is good;
* Fire-fighting systems are in place and maintained in good working order;
* Mines Rescue teams and specialist rescue equipment are available at all
mines;
* There are no major methane gas (CH4) or carbon monoxide (CO)
problems;
* Ventilation in the mines is adequate, but there is a need to direct more air
to the working areas;
* Spontaneous combustion does not constitute a high risk;
* Water is only a nuisance issue and is not a major problem;
* Face and roadway conditions are good;
* Coal dust was well controlled, and the mines had no problems with
Methane/Coal dust inrushes;
4.8.1.4 In summary, there will be three state-owned deep coal mines that will be
4-22



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                      Power Consult
used to supply the Phase 2 project.  These comply with national safety
standards and effectively present few health and safety problems for the project.
The poor record of mining safety in China is mainly associated with the large
number of small, privately owned, mining operations, but these sources will not
be used to supply this project.
4.8.2 Occupational Health And Safety In The Power Plant
4.8.2.1 The generation of electrical power involves the buming of coal, which
produces steam. The steam is then used to drive turbines to produce electricity.
Although process hazards involved in the production of the electricity exist,
numerous support functions subject workers to hazards which result in the
majority industrial accidents.
4.8.2.2 The safety and health issues found in a coal-fired power plants are grouped
into two categories. These categories are process related and those incidental to
the generation of electricity.
Process Hazards
4.8.2.3 The principle hazards of boiler fumaces and their associated fuel supplies,
pipes, ducts and fans are fires and explosions.
4.8.2.4 Variations in the size distribution of raw coal may cause erratic or
uncontrolled feeding of coal into mills. Coal may contain debris such as metal,
wood, or rock which may cause coal feeding interruptions or become a source of
ignition. Since coal can form an explosive mixture when airbome, an explosive
mixture will likely develop if a momentary flameout occurs.
4.8.2.5 Coal mills themselves are potential sources for fires and explosions. Fires
may occur from spontaneous combustion or the feeding of buming coal directly
into the mills. Airborne coal dust will explode if the mixture exceeds 12.7 grams
per cubic meter (g m-3). A special hazard is the presence of methane gas that
may be released from recently pulverised coal and may accumulate in confined
spaces.
4.8.2.6 Hydrogen will be used as a cooling agent for the turbines. Hydrogen is
extremely explosive.
4.8.2.7 Installation and maintenance of safety devices to prevent over-pressurisation
of boiler tubing is critical for the protection of employees and equipment.
4.8.2.8 Electrical power generation and transmission poses hazards to workers.
4-23

ASSESSMENT

5. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
5.1 Environmental Impact Identification And Pollution Factor Screening
5.1.1 The principal environmental impacts predicted during Leiyang Power Plant
construction and operation are shown in Table 5.1-1.
5.1.2 The principal pollution factors to be considered during Leiyang Power Plant
construction, operation and transfer project are shown on Table 5.1-2.
5.2 Operation Period
5.2.1 Atmospheric Impact
Emissions
5.2.1.1 Table 5.2.1-1 shows the stack gas emissions from the phase 1 & 2 Leiyang
Power Plant in comparison with the Chinese and World Bank standards.
5.2.1.2 Sulphur content in the coal for the existing Leiyang Power Plant (phase 1) is
0.39%, that designed for phase 2 project would be 0.36% with range 0.31-
0.46%.
5.2.1.3 With this quality of low sulphur content coal, the SO2 emissions from the
Leiyang Power Plant will easily comply with the relevant standards.
5.2.1.4 Particulate emissions are essentially dependent on the specification of the
dust arresting equipment (ESPs). It is assumed that these will be designed to
attain the World Bank standard which is more stringent than the Chinese national
standard.
5.2.1.5 As noted previously, both the World Bank and Chinese NOx standards have
been formulated with reference to soft coals with high volatile contents. The
Leiyang Power Plant will burn anthracite with very low volatility. This constrains
the plant from achieving the low NOx emissions as set out in the standards,
without resorting to costly emission controls (see chapter 6) rather than simple
optimisation of boiler design. It is proposed that, providing that attainment of
ambient air quality standards for NOx are not compromised, additional costs for
NOx control should be considered excessive when applying the 'Best Available
Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost' (BATNEEC) principle.

Prediction Of Ground Concentration Of Atmospheric Pollutants
5.2.1.6 Table 5.2.1-2 shows the emission parameters applicable to the Leiyang
Power Plant, as used in the modelling predictions of impacts on ground level
concentrations.
5.2.1.7 Computer dispersion modelling has been used to predict the contribution of
phase 2 to local air quality and to determine whether or not the proposed
development will cause any ambient air quality standard to be exceeded when in
full operation.
5.2.1.8 Two different computer models were used in the assessment: i) a Chinese
model which uses a standard Gaussian treatment of dispersion from a point
source, and ii) a 'new generation' dispersion model called ADMS (Atmospheric
Dispersion Model System) which uses advances made in the understanding of
dispersion made over the past 2 decades.
5.2.1.9 A detailed description of the models and of their output is included in
Appendix E.
5.2.1.10 ADMS is an intemationally recognised dispersion model and its role in this
assessment is to provide support to the more comprehensive predictions made
using the Chinese model and to establish an appropriate level of confidence in
the conclusions reached.
5.2.1.11 Meteorological data for a complete year (1993), as measured by the
Leiyang Meteorological Observatory, were used to predict SO2, NOx and
particulate hourly average; daily average; and annual daily average ground level
concentrations. Due to the use of the ESPs, the particulate discharge from the
chimneys of the phase 1 and 2 power plants was taken to be entirely as PM10.  _
5.2.1.12 The meteorological data used in the assessment included measurements
at Leiyang of the vertical wind profile, mixing layer height and stability using an
ADAS acoustic sounder system.
5.2.1.13 A correction for local topography was also made using a simple algorithm
(see Appendix E). This is likely to lead to some over-prediction of ground level
concentrations.
5.2.1.14 Model calculations were performed over an area of side 32km centred on
Leiyang phase I power plant. The grid resolution used by the Chinese model
was 500m whilst ADMS used a 1 000m resolution.
5.2.1.15 For each day of the year, average ground level concentrations were     if
5-2



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
calculated based on the 8 measurements taken at 3-hourly intervals during the
day. These were then ordered by maximum ground level concentration. This
established the worst 10 days and the 97th percentile. Maximum hourly average
ground level concentrations were calculated for each stability class based on the
whole year's data.
5.2.1.16 Predictions were also made at locations coinciding with the sensitive
locations listed in Table 4.4.2-2.
SO2 ground level concentrations predicted by the Chinese Model
5.2.1.17 In reporting the predictions set out below, concentrations in brackets refer
to the impacts from buming coal with the maximum design sulphur content of
0.46%. Predictions of ground level concentrations were undertaken for phase 1
(existing 2x200 MW) ,phase 2 (proposed 2x300 MW) and phase 3 (possible
future 2x600 MW).
5.2.1.18 More detail of the results of the modelling study results are contained in
Appendix E. The following text briefly summarises these findings, with cross
references to tables and figures in the appendix.
5.2.1.19 The annual average, daily average and maximum hourly average
concentrations of SO2, NOx (expressed as NO2), and PM10 at ground level due
to phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 were predicted using the Chinese model for
each hour of the year, using the 1993 meteorological dataset. The results are
summarised Tables 5.2.1-3a,b,c which show the cumulative maximum ground
level concentrations as each phase is completed compared with the Chinese
and World Bank air quality standards.
5.2.1.20 The results for phase 1 and phase 2 combined are discussed in more detail
below, whereas the discussion of phase 3 is in section 5.8.3:
- SO2 hourly average concentration
5.2.1.21 Predicted S02 maximum hourly average ground level concentrations at the
monitoring points are listed in Table E3.2.3.
5.2.1.22 The maximum hourly average concentrations at these points range from
0.051 to 0.095 mg m3 (0.057-0.108 mg m3) which is 10.2 to 19.0% (11.4-
21.6%) of the relevant standard.
5.2.1.23 The results are presented in Table E3.2.2 in terms of the maximum
concentration predicted in each stability category. The maximum hourly average
concentration occurs under stability class A, at 0.154 (0.173) mg m-3 which is
5-3



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                   Power Consult
30.8% (34.6%) of the Chinese air quality standard. It occurs at a distance of
1.59 km from the source.
- SO2 Daily average concentration
5.2.1.24 Predicted daily average ground level concentrations for the 10 days which
had the highest concentrations are shown in Table E3.2.4 together with the
locations of the maxima. The 10 worst days were calculated by ranking the daily
averages for each day of the year. The 10th worst day is the 97 percentile daily
average concentration for which there is a national standard. The SO2 97th
percentile maximum daily average is 0.037 mg m-3 (0.043 mg m3) which is
24.7% (28.7%) of the relevant standard. The worst daily average is 0.057
(0.065) mg mn3. Figures E3.2-1 to Fig.E3.2-10 show contour plots of SO2
concentration for each of the 10 worst days (assuming a sulphur content of
0.36%).
5.2.1.25 Table E3.2.5 shows the maximum daily average concentrations at the
various monitoring points.
5.2.1.26 The S02 maximum daily average concentrations at the various monitoring
points range from 0.011 to 0.028 mg m3 (0.012-0.032 mg m3) which is 7.3-
18.7% (8.0-21.3%) of the air quality standard.
- SO2 Annual average concentration
5.2.1.27 Table E3.2.6 gives the SO2 maximum annual average concentration values
predicted by the Chinese model, compass bearing and distances from Leiyang
power plant. Fig.E3.2-11 gives the distribution of S02 annual daily average
concentration.
5.2.1.28 The SO2 maximum predicted annual average concentration is very small,
only 7.8% (8.8%) of the relevant Chinese standard. It occurs SSE of Leiyang
Power Plant and at a distance 7.5km from the source.
5.2.1.29 Table E3.2.7 shows the predicted annual average concentrations at the
various monitoring points.
NO. ground level concentrations Predicted by the Chinese Model
5.2.1.30 Figures showing contours of NOx ground level concentrations are not
shown in Appendix E, but have the same appearance as those shown for SO2.
The SO2 contour values should be multiplied by 1.47 to obtain the equivalent
values for NOx.

- NO, hourly average concentrations
5.2.1.31 Predicted NOx maximum hourly average ground level concentrations at
various monitoring points are listed in Table E3.2.9.
5.2.1.32 The maximum hourly average concentrations at these points range from
0.076 to 0.142 mg m-3 which is 51 to 95% of the relevant standard.
5.2.1.33 The hourly average concentration of NOx at ground level for phase 1 and
phase 2 combined was predicted using the Chinese model for each hour of the
year, using the 1993 meteorological dataset. The results are presented in Table
E3.2.8 in terms of the maximum concentration predicted in each stability
category. The maximum hourly average concentration occurs under stability A,
at 0.233 mg m 3 which is 155% of the Chinese air quality standard. It occurs at
a distance of 1.59 km form the source.
- NO. daily average concentrations
5.2.1.34 Predicted daily average ground level concentrations for the 10 days which
had the highest concentrations are shown in Table E3.2.10 together with the
locations of the maxima. The 10 ten worst days were calculated by ranking the
daily averages for each day of the year. The 10th worst day is the 97 percentile
daily average concentration for which there is a national standard. The NOx
97th percentile maximum daily average is 0.056 mg m-3 which is 56% of the
relevant standard. The worst daily average is 0.085 mg m3.
5.2.1.35 Table E3.2.11 shows the predicted NOx maximum daily average
concentrations at the various monitoring points.
5.2.1.36 The NOx maximum daily average concentrations at the monitoring points
range from 0.015 to 0.042mg mi3 which is 15 to 42% of the air quality standard.
- NO,, annual average concentration
5.2.1.37 Table E3.2.12 shows the NOx maximum annual average concentration and
its location relative the Leiyang Power Plant.
5.2.1.38 The NOx maximum annual average concentration is 17% of the relevant
Chinese air quality standard. It is located 7.5 km SSE of the power plant.
5.2.1.39 Table E3.2.13 shows the maximum annual concentrations predicted by the
Chinese model at the monitoring sites.

PMio ground level concentration model predictions
5.2.1.40 Figures showing contours of PM10 ground level concentrations are not
shown in Appendix E but have the same appearance as those shown for SO2.
The SO2 contour values should be multiplied by 0.25 to obtain the equivalent
values for NOx.
- PM10 daily average concentration
5.2.1.41 Table E3.2.14 shows the PM10 maximum daily average concentrations
corresponding to the 10 worst days. The 97th percentile maximum daily
average is 0.09 mg m-3 which is 6% of the relevant Chinese air quality standard.
5.2.1.42 Listed in Table E3.2.15 are maximum of predicted PM10 daily average
concentrations at the monitoring sites. They range from 0.004 to 0.007 mg m-3
which is 2% to 5% air quality standard.
- PM10 Annual average concentration
5.2.1.43 Table E3.2.16 shows the PM10 maximum annual average concentration and
its location relative the Leiyang Power Plant.
5.2.1.44 The PM10 maximum annual average concentration is only 1% of the relevant
Chinese air quality standard. It is located 7.5 km SSE of the power plant.
5.2.1.45 Table E3..2.17 shows the PM10 annual average concentrations at the
monitoring points. The power plant is predicted to make a negligible contribution
of PM10 annual average concentrations.
Comparison Of The Environmental Impact Due To The 2nd Phase With That
Due To The 1st Phase
5.2.1.46 Tables E3.3-2(a), (b) & (c) show respectively the predicted S02, NOx and
PM10 maximum daily average concentrations predicted by the Chinese model
due to phase 1, phase 2 and for both phases combined. The concentrations
from the worst 10 days are listed with highest values first.
5.2.1.47 The 97th percentile of the SO2 maximum daily average concentrations due
to the Leiyang 1st phase, the 2nd phase and whole plant after phase 2 are
respectively less than 12.0%, 12.7% (16.7%), and 24.7% (28.7%) of the relevant
air quality standard. The highest daily ground level concentrations from the
combined phase 1 and phase 2 is 38.0% (43.3%) of the standard.
5.2.1.48 For NOx, Table E3.3-2b, the predicted 10th worst daily average for Leiyang
5-6



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
1st phase, Leiyang 2nd phase and the whole plant are respectively 17%, 37%
and 57% of the air quality standard. The worst day is respectively 27%, 58% and
84% of the standard.
5.2.1.49 For PM,0, the predicted 10th worst daily average for the two phases
combined (Table E3.3-2c) is 5.8% of the air quality standard and the highest
daily average is predicted to be 8.7% of the standard.
Comparison of ADMS Predictions with Chinese Model Predictions
5.2.1.50 ADMS was configured to predict daily average ground level concentrations
of SO2, NOx, and PM1O due to Leiyang phase 2 power plant. The model used
wind speed, wind direction, cloud cover, temperature, boundary layer height, as
measured or determined from the meteorological data recorded by the Leiyang
Municipal Observatory every 3 hours during each day. The 10 worst days
identified by the Chinese model were used in the ADMS analysis. The
maximum daily average ground level concentrations predicted to occur during
each of these days are presented in Table 5.2.1-4 for SO2. The positiors of the
maxima are also indicated. The same table includes the predictions from the
Chinese model.
5.2.1.51 It can be seen that ADMS predicts maximum daily average concentrations
of SO2 on average about 20% of those predicted by the Chinese model. There
are several reasons for ADMS to consistently predict lower daily concentrations.
One likely contributing reason will be that ADMS allows for some or all of the
plume to penetrate the boundary layer under some conditions and hence allows
the plume to contribute little or nothing to the ground level concentrations during
these periods. Plume penetration occurs most often when the boundary layer is
low, such as at night or during early moming/evening. The Chinese model
assumes that the plume is reflected back downwards upon reaching the top of
the boundary layer leading to higher concentrations.  Other reasons for
differences between the models may relate to the different formulations used to
calculate the dispersion parameters and the inclusion of an adjustment due to
topography that has been applied to the Chinese model but not to the ADMS
model.. The effect of topography is not considered to be important in ADMS
unless there are major slopes greater than 1 in 10.
5.2.1.52 It is concluded that the Chinese model is likely to over-estimate daily
average, and annual average ground level concentrations (although a suitable
meteorological dataset was not available to use in ADMS in order to calculate
annual averages).
5-7



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                   Power Consuft
5.2.1.53 Also included in Table 5.2.1-4 are the ADMS predictions of the maximum
hourly concentrations generated during each day. The highest hourly average
S02 concentration during these 10 particular days is 104(133) pg m4. This is not
necessarily the worst hourly concentration since that may occur on a day other
than those with the highest daily values.
5.2.1.54 In order to obtain a reasonable estimate of the highest hourly average
ground level concentrations that might occur as a result of the Leiyang power
plant, ADMS was run with a series of extreme weather conditions. In order to
compare the predictions with those from the Chinese model a weather condition
was selected from the range of conditions associated with each Pasquill stability
category.
5.2.1.55 Table 5.2.1-5 shows the results of the analysis for SO2, NOx undertaken for
Leiyang phase 1 and 2 and the combination of both. The Chinese model results
for each stability class (taken to be the maximum ground level concentrations
predicted in each class) are compared to those predicted by ADMS. ADMS
predicted zero ground level concentrations for the category E condition chosen.
5.2.1.56 ADMS has predicted higher ground level concentrations for categories A
and B than the Chinese model. Since these categories correspond to unstable
conditions and ADMS treats dispersion in unstable conditions in a more
advanced manner than the Chinese model, it is likely that ADMS is providing a
better estimate of the maximum hourly concentrations.
Inclusion of Background Component in Assessment of Effect on Air Quality of
Leiyang Phase 2
5.2.1.57 Referring to Tables 5.2.1-3a,b,c: In the case of S02, the total concentration
predicted by the Chinese model due to the phases I and 2 combined is less  _
than the relevant standards when added on to the background component.
However, in the case of NOx, the combined maximum hourly average ground
level concentrations due to the two power plants are greater than the Chinese
standard for NOx (150 pg me). Such exceedances of the standard will be rare.
The maximum daily NOx concentration predicted by the Chinese model also
exceeds the standard if account is taken of the background concentration.
However, the Chinese model probably over-estimates the daily concentration.
5.2.1.58 As discussed further in Appendix E, at ground level, the proportion of the
NOx in a power station plume present as NO2 is typically 30% or less and only
occasionally reaches 50% when levels of ambient ozone are high. It is generally
considered that it is the NO2 that is harmful to health rather than total NOx. The
5-8



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                    Power Consult
Chinese hourly average standard for NO2 is 120 pgmn and is likely not to be
exceeded even under the extreme conditions of class A atmospheric stability.
5.2.1.59 Other standards for NO2 such as the UK (300 pg m4) or WHO (200 pg m3)
standards will also not be exceeded. The World Bank guidelines only provide a
NOx standard for annual mean concentrations. No levels are set for hourly or
daily mean values.
5.2.1.60 It has also been assumed that the flue gas NOx concentrations will be 1500
mg m-3 which may possibly be bettered by plant that will be tendered for this
project.
5.2.1.61 It is therefore considered that, not withstanding the possibility of the
Chinese NOx standard being exceeded infrequently due to the combined
operation of Leiyang phases 1 and 2, the contribution of the Leiyang plant to
ambient NOx concentrations is considered acceptable.
5.2.1.62 ADMS predictions of PM10 daily average and annual ground level
concentrations are less than those predicted by the Chinese model which
therefore may be considered to be pessimistic. The contribution of the plant to
PM10 concentrations is small and the standards will not be exceeded even when
account is taken of the background component.
5.2.1.63 A discussion of the effect of a phase 3 on air quality may be found in
section 5.8.3.
Conclusions On Atmospheric Impacts
5.2.1.64 The majority of the predictions of ground level concentrations of SO2, NOx,
and PM,0 were produced using the Chinese dispersion computer model. A
'worst' case conditions study was also undertaken using the Atmospheric
Dispersion Model System (ADMS) in order to provide support to the Chinese
modelling and to test the robustness of the conclusions reached.
5.2.1.65 Predictions of ground level concentrations were compared to the relevant
Chinese and Intemational air quality standards.
5.2.1.66 It was found that the World Bank or Chinese SO2 and PM1O air quality
standards were very unlikely to be exceeded by phase 2 on its own or together
with phase 1.
5.2.1.67 Some differences between the Chinese model and ADMS predictions were
evident. These could be explained in terms of the model formulation - the
Chinese model tending to predict higher daily and annual ground level
5-9



Hunan Power Development Piject (Part A)                     Power Consult
concentrations.
5.2.1.68 The NOx Chinese maximum hourly average standard is predicted to be
exceeded for a small percentage of the year. However, the World Bank does
not apply guidelines for 1hr NOx concentrations and other Intemational hourly
average standards for NOx or NO2 will not be exceeded.  It is therefore
concluded that such small exceedances of the Chinese standard are acceptable
on human health grounds.
5.2.2 Water Environment Impact Assessment
Reliability Of Water Supply
5.2.2.1 The water resource for the 1st and 2nd phase of the Leiyang Power Plant
project is Leishui River. The flows in the Leishui are now controlled by the large
and small Dongjang hydro-power stations. According to flow monitoring, the
minimum 24 hr averaged water flow in the intake river section is 41.7m3s1 at
97% insurance rate This is just sufficient for the Leiyang Power Plant supply,
which requires up to 37.04 m3s- for phases 1 and 2.
5.2.2.2 However, in future, according to the No.13 document issued by Hunan
Electric Power Controlling and Communicate Bureau (HEPCB,1997), an
assurance has been given for Lelyang Power Plant water supply that, by
controlling Dongjiang Reservoir, the minimum daily flow will be ensured to be
1           3S-1.

Cooling Water System Impacts
5.2.2.3 The water intake and outlet of Leiyang Power Plant will bring two possible
kinds of impact. One is that it could change the flow velocity field of Leishui
River and so affect river shipping. The other is that the cooling water will
increase river water temperatures.
5.2.2.4 The department of cooling water, Institute of Water Resources and
Hydropower Research (IWHR) was commissioned to compare four possible
cooling water intake / ouffall designs by physical and mathematical modelling.
5.2.2.5 The physical model was constructed on a 1:150 horizontal scale and 1:75
vertical scale and covered a 3.8 km reach of the river in a model 26m x 3m. This
was primarily used to investigate the detailed near field impacts of the potential
discharge designs, including stratification of the thermal plume and recirculation
to the intake.
5-10



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consuft
5.2.2.6 2-Dimensional (depth averaged) mathematical models were also used to
predict the extent of the thermal plume at greater distances downstream than
was feasible to investigate in a physical model.
5.2.2.7 The possible designs differed in the angle that the discharge entered the
river and the presence and size of a flow guiding dam upstream of the discharge.
The intention was to find a design that would i) not cause cross flows that could
affect shipping, ii) prevent warm water being entrained at the intake and iii) as far
as possible maintain a cold water channel for fish to pass freely past the
immediate vicinity of the discharge.
5.2.2.8 The configuration of the river and intake structure is such that when water is
being abstracted for the 2nd phase of the project, a "cool water wedge' will form
in front of the intake, which be helpful to obtain cooler in-flow water. Hence, the
water temperature rise at the intake in all trial designs for the 2nd phase, even
during the dry season, is small at only 0.0°C-0.3°C.
5.2.2.9 A recommended outfall design consists of setting the phase 2 discharge at
an angle of 470 to the river bank, outlet width of 12.7m at a bottom elevation of
72.00m, and adding a flow guiding dam upstream of the outlets at an elevation of
73.5m. With this design, no detectable increase in intake water temperature
through recirculation was detected in the physical model.
5.2.2.10 IWHR considered a few different flow conditions in their models. River
flows were modelled based primarily on concerns about worst case dry river flow
conditions, over the range 43.6 m3s-1 to 120 m3s-1. Outlet flows were also
considered for both a phase 2 development at 2 x 350 MW as well as the 2 x
300MW scale now proposed. All of the modelling included the impact from the
phase 1 discharge, on the basis that the combined heat field from both project
would be the impact on the river until closure of the phase 1 plant, which is not
yet planned. The additional impact from a possible phase 3 development is
considered in section 5.8. The following discussion abstracts the principle
findings that are relevant to the proposed 2 x 300MW scheme discharging
alongside the existing 2x200MW discharge..
5.2.2.11 Not surprisingly at the very low flows considered, although recirculation
could be avoided, thermal impacts on the river were predicted to be large. For
example, for 41.7 m3s-1 the cooling water flow represents nearly 89% of the river
flow so very little dilution of the thermal plume can occur. Temperature would
then slowly be lost by heat exchange at the surface, but essentially, the full
temperature increment would travel several tens of km downstream.
5-11



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
5.2.2.12 However, minimum river flows will in future be regulated at a minimum of
116 m3s1 . The following results presented are therefore a selection from the
runs undertaken at 105 m3s, which will be more nearly representative of dry
flow conditions for Phase 2.
5.2.2.13 During dry season, the water intake and outlet of the 2nd phase of the plant
project would only have a small impact on the water head and cross flow in the
river, with cross river velocity predicted to be below 0.3ms1 and the longitudinal
flow velocity out of the drainage exit below 1.5ms'. This would have no adverse
impact on navigation. Flow pattems in the river, as estimated from the physical
model are shown in Fig 5.2.2-1
5.2.2.14 For summer outfall conditions, the surface temperature pattern, and some
depth profiles are shown in Figure 5.2.2-2. Temperature depth profiles for two
cross sections are shown in Fig 5.2.2-3. This shows that the hottest water tends
to follow the bank downstream on the side of the discharge for over 1 km
downstream. There is quite strong thermal stratification, with temperatures at
the river bed remaining at near to ambient until nearly the edge of the model. By
point 'e' in Fig 5.2.2-2, approximately 1.7 km downstream, this thermal
stratification had largely broken down, possibly as a result of turbulence around
the islands in the river.
5.2.2.15 It therefore appears that the fully mixed condition would give rise to a
temperature increase of approximately 3-3.1°C. Prior to full mixing, there would
remain a zone at near ambient temperatures near the river bottom and along the
far bank. This will help protect organisms in the river from adverse impact since
free swimming fish will be able to select their preferred temperature tolerance
zones and less mobile organisms living at or in the river bottom will not be
exposed to the more extreme conditions.
5.2.2.16 Fig 5.2.2-4 shows the pattem that would arise from discharge under winter
conditions. The higher incremental temperatures in the discharge would result in
a slightly larger extension of the surface temperature impacts. However, in
winter, river flows would be expected to be 2-4 times higher than those modelled
resulting in much more rapid dilution.
5.2.2.17 For further distances downstream the severity of the thermal plume was
estimated by 2-D mathematical modelling. This approach is reasonable where
stratification of the plume has broken down. Figure 5.2.2-5 shows the cross
sections used in the mathematical model - extending down to Yaotian Dam 36
km downstream.
5-12



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                     Power Consult
5.2.2.18 Table 5.2.2-1 Shows the predicted temperatures at the locations shown in
Figure 5.2.2-5. From this it is clear that temperature will only decrease slowly
following complete mixing, such that by Yaotian Dam, some 36 km downstream,
river temperatures would still be 1.80C higher than otherwise in summer, and
2.30C higher in winter, assuming a low river flow of only 105 m3s1.
5.2.2.19 As previously noted in Chapter 4 (Fig 4.3-4) summer water temperatures in
Leishui River are now lower than the natural condition as a result of the
operation of the Dongjiang Dams. It is possible to approximately estimate the
temperatures that would occur at a position at the point of +30C impact, at 105
m3s1 river flow. The +3C increment can be added to the 1993 temperature
survey data from Leiyang, but flow weighted to reflect the monthly average
'design' river flow rate as a proportion of the 105 m3s-1 modelled flow. This gives
an approximation of additional dilution that would occur during the wet season.
Although, only approximate, since the changed flows could alter the shape of the
plume to some extent, this gives some indication of the expected scale of the
impact over natural temperature conditions. It should also be noted that this
approach is pessimistic, in that the 1993 temperature monitoring data included
the impact of the phase 1 scheme, at a point 800m downstream of the power
plant discharge, and the modelling also includes the phase 1 impact. This
monthly temperature pattem is shown in Figure 5.2.2-6.
5.2.2.20 It appears that the area impacted by +30C at low flows would be subject to
temperatures very close to the natural temperature regime. There is a tendency
for slightly higher temperatures than natural to occur later in the summer (August
and September), at a time when natural temperatures begin to fall. Annual
maximum temperature is not significantly altered. This close correspondence
between the temperatures (predicted temperature vs. natural temperatures) is
illustrated in Figure 5.2.2-7 which shows that the regression line is almost
identical to a 1:1 relationship, with a very high correlation coefficient (r2=0.93).
5.2.2.21 It follows that the 'true' +30C impact zone, usually considered in
environmental assessments, should perhaps be considered to be the +60C zone
as estimated in the modelling studies of summer conditions (Figures 5.2.2-2 &
5.2.2-3). For the 105 m3s-1 flow rate, at the surface this zone extends for
approximately 0.9 km downstream x 50 m wide, but is very restricted in the
depth that is affected. At higher river flows it would be expected that the extent
of this zone would be smaller than this.
Other Waste Water Discharges
5.2.2.22 Waste water will be treated to attain the required standards by standard
5-13



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
technologies appropriate to power station operations. These include settlement
of suspended solids, neutralisation tanks to control pH, oil interceptors to treat
water contaminated with oil, sewage treatment oxidation ponds etc.
5.2.2.23 Following the phase 2 development, waste waters (including ash water,
acid/alkaline waste water, oil contaminated water, sluicing water from coal
handling plant, domestic sewage) will be directed to the ash sluicing system,
rather than being discharged to Leishui River. This will ensure negligible
environmental impacts from waste water discharges.
Ash Water
5.2.2.24 There is one ash site for both the 1st and 2nd phase, only the dam height
needs to be increased in the 2nd phase. This ash site is built in a valley and the
dam bottom is water permeable. In the 1st phase, most of ash water, except
that part permeating through the dam, leaking through the bottom or lost by
evaporation, is discharged through a dedicated drainage channel into Leishui
River.
5.2.2.25 As noted in the baseline data (Tables 4.3.4-1 & 4.3.4-2y the discharge from
the ash yard is often non-compliant with the discharge standard. It is unlikely
that this would have a highly significant effect on a river as large as the Leishui,
as dilution rates of the discharge will be very large. However, opportunity will be
taken of the phase 2 development to intercept surface run-off entering the ash
yard and direct this to the river. Water within the yard will be recycled to the
power plant. Following this, the ash yard will have no impact on surface waters
and so will have eliminated the polluting effects of the existing discharge.
5.2.2.26 According to 3The geology report for Leiyang power plant ash disposal" by
Hunan Electric Power Design Institute, the ash site bottom has an upper layer of
subclay crust with a thickness of 0.5-0.8m and a lower layer of dark-brown puddly
subclay. The total thickness is 1-3.3m. Because this tight clay layer covers this
area, the groundwater supply is limited. The permeation coefficient of the subclay
is between 3.33 x10 -2.06 x 10-7 cm/s and the average is 2.39 x 10-7 cm/s.
5.2.2.27 The bedrock mainly consists of carbonic shale, mud shale and compact
texture limestone with poor permeability. The groundwater level can be measured
only in a few bore holes on the east side of the valley. The groundwater is from
the bedrock crevice water. The conditions for groundwater collection are very
poor.
5.2.2.28 The leakage through ash site bottom can be approximately estimated by
Darcy law:                                                                    K

Q=KJA
where,
Q = amount of the leaking water
J = Hydraulic gradient, taken as 1 (representing the maximum possible);
A =Ash site area, 98 x 104 m;
K = Permeation coefficient, 2.39 x 10- cm/s.
The calculated maximum groundwater leakage rate from the above equation is
8.4 tUh.
5.2.2.29 Because the dam was built on compact limestone and carbonic shale
through which the water permeation is difficult, ash water will mainly leak through
the dam, not the site boKtom. The ash water that leaks through the dam will be
collected, returned to the ash yard and then reused.
5.2.2.30 The ash water leaking into groundwater is extremely small, at only 8.4tVh
and so the impact of ash water to groundwater is small. Monitoring data indicate
that the "Groundwater Quality Standard" (Class IlIl in GB/T14848-93) is not
exceeded (see Tables 4.3.3-2 & 4.3.3-3). There is no reason'to suppose that the
storage of additional ash from the phase 2 project will add significantly to the rate
of discharge to groundwater from the existing ash yard.
5.2.3 Noise Impact Prediction And Assessment
Source Strength Of Noise Source
5.2.3.1 The noise generated by equipment in the power plant is mainly of medium
and low frequency. The major noise sources are generators, ball mills, forced
and induced fans and pumps. These are mainly located in the main plant hall.
The power plant noise source parameters in the 1st phase project are shown in
Table 5.2.3-1. For the 2nd phase project noise source parameters are
determined by analogy to similar power stations - their noise levels are shown in
Table 5.2.3-2.
Prediction Model
5.2.3.2 After generation from the source, the noise radiates outwards and reaches
the sound receptor point through distance attenuation, screening and reflecting
by the ground surface and attenuation by meteorological conditions etc. With
respect to the common impact at one sound receiving point from multiple
sources, the resulting noise level is a result of energy super imposition.
5-15



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                      Power Consult
5.2.3.3 The sound levels in Tables 5.2.3-1 and 5.2.3-2 were the source parameters
for the sound model. On the power plant general layout diagram, model points
were set out as a 25x25m grid, with plant hall as centre. From this is calculated
the anticipated noise distribution, taking into account super imposition of multiple
sources, shown in Fig. 5.2.3-1.
5.2.3.4 From this diagram, the noise at the power plant boundary noise would not
exceed criteria of GB 12348-90, GB3096-93 or those of the World Bank.
6.2.4 Solid Waste And Coal Dust
5.2.4.1 The ash removal system is shown in Fig. 3.6-2.
5.2.4.2 Ash (PFA) and slag (FBA) utilisation is the effective way to tum waste into a
resource. Power plant ash and slag can be used widely in the construction
industry.  Phase 1 has had a low rate of ash utilisation - typically only
approximately 1% is used in pit-filling and road-paving. The use is possibly
increasing, with a privately owned local manufacturer using ash from the site to
make heat insulating building blocks.
5.2.4.3 PFA and FBA in the phase 2 project will be removed separately. FBA is an
excellent construction material, which is likely to be entirely utilised.
5.2.4.4 The ash removal system will be designed with hydraulic transport to the ash
yard. However, to facilitate the comprehensive utilisation of ash, the power plant
is to reserve an interface and field for dry ash output. Dry ash removal conserves
the physical and chemical properties of the ash, making utilisation easier.
5.2.4.5 Fly ash has many potential uses: in brick fabrication, road foundations, and
as cement admixture and can also used in filling ditch to reclaim land, in earth
banking to farm fields.
5.2.4.6 Cement mixed with fly ash and mortar mixed with fly ash used in highway
foundations are energy saving measures strongly recommended by the National
Economy Commission and Ministry of Communication. Various provinces have
widely adopted these projects with good results. A highway six meters wide,
could use 1 000t fly ash every kilometre. With the construction of a state highway
and expressway in the vicinity of power plant, the utilisation of ash slag has a
huge potential.
5.2.4.7 The ash lagoon is in a mountain valley with relatively steep slopes and
luxuriant vegetation and is always to be operated with a water surface until
completion of the scheme. The surface water effectively prevents dust blow
5-16



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
problems arising from the ash yard. Currently there is a small proportion of
floating ash, that may become stranded at the shoreline and cause some
dustblow. This is an excellent material for thermal insulating blocks and some is
currently recovered for that purpose. Encouraging this use will further minimise
the potential for dust problems at the ash site.
Coal Yard & Coal Dust
5.2.4.8 Leiyang Power Plant, currently has had one dry coal shed with a span of
72m and length of 120m. The 2nd phase project is to build another similar dry
coal shed.
5.2.4.9 The coal yard has a maximum width of 70m and pile height of 12m. The
maximum capacity of coal is 171 thousand tons - enough fuel for 14.3 days
operation. The maximum capacity of the dry coal shed is 97 thousand tons,
that is enough fuel for 8.4 days.
5.2.4.10 The special items for controlling fugitive dust in coal transportation system
and coal yard are primarly:
* to add tightly sealed damper on coal conveyors,
* to add functional dust precipitation system at transfer post,
* to add vacuum dust precipitation in coal bunker etc. to effectively prevent coal
dust from affecting the environment.
* To spray the coal stock with water during dry winter months.
5.3 Impacts Outside Plant Area
5.3.1 Transmission Engineering
5.3.1.1 The environmental assessment of the transmission system impacts are the
subject of a separate report : "Environmental Assessments of Leiyang Power
Plant Phase 2 Extension Project (2x300 MW) Hunan Province, PRC. Part B -
Transmission System"
5.3.2 Water Supply And Ash Pipe Lines
5.3.2.1 In 2nd phase project, the power plant is to construct one water supply pipe
line (2440 mm diameter, 830 m long), a double drainage ditch (2x2.0x3.0 m, 570
m long) and single drainage ditch (2.0x3.0 m, 100 m long) and another two ash
pipelines (325mm diameter, 4450 m long). The routes of the water supply and
draining pipes and ditches and the ash pipelines are mainly across hills and a
5-17



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consuft
few farm fields. These pipelines and ditches are to be laid or constructed next to
those of the 1st phase project. They will bring very little additional impact to the
environment.
5.4 Ecology
5.4.1   Terrestrial Ecology
5.4.1.1 The potential major impacts to terrestrial ecology associated with Leiyang
power plant 2nd phase extension project are impacts to terrestrial plants incurred
by ash lagoon extension, and by flue gas discharged by 2nd phase project. The
proposed power plant site itself, is situated on land adjacent to the existing plant
and is largely on land previously used for works associated with the construction
of phase 1. There is therefore no significant ecological impact arising from
development on this site.
Ash Yard
5.4.1.2 Aiming at the requirement of storing ash for 20 years production from the for
1st and 2nd phase projects, the power plant has had the ash yard land
requisition elevation increased from 174 m to 200m. The newly requisitioned
area is 0.47 kM2, which represents the area of vegetation that will be lost from 20
years operation of phase 2 plant assuming no utilisation of ash as a useful by-
product.
5.4.1.3 The plant species surrounding the ash lagoon have been surveyed and
identified (Table 4.6.1-1). It was found that the plants surrounding the ash
lagoon are composed of 16 families 23 genera and 28 species. There are no
rare or precious species to be found, the species present being widely distributed
in this part of China.
5.4.1.4 On completion, the ash lagoon will be covered by earth and revegetated.
5.4.1.5 Based upon predictions of ground level concentrations of atmospheric
pollutants and viewing from the angle of influencing the plant growth, the SO2
daily average ground concentrations all are relatively small, satisfying the
requirements of GB9137-88 'The max. permissible discharge concentration of
atmospheric pollutants for protection of crops", implying no impact to plant
growth.
Afforestation In Power Plant
5.4.1.6 With many trees providing shade and shelter from winds, cultivated flowers
5-18



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
blossoming in profusion and grass carpeting more open areas, the soft
landscaping of Leiyang Power Plant area and residential quarter is excellent. It
provides a pleasant environment and co-ordinates well with the surrounding
vegetation. After the completion of 2nd phase extension project, the power plant
will be further afforested in a similar way.
5.4.2 Aquatic Ecology
5.4.2.1 After the completion of the phase 2 extension project, the Leiyang Power
Plant is to have the oil contaminated waste water, domestic sewage, acidic
alkaline waste water and coal yard drainage water all treated and then re-
utilised. The ash lagoon ash water will be recirculated for reuse. Therefore, the
water draining to Leishui River will mainly be cooling water and uncontaminated
surface water drainage.
5.4.2.2 The data from the baseline studies suggest that the fauna below the
Dongjiang Dam is impoverished as a result of the cold summer temperature
regime that occurs there. By the Leiyang Section, thermal conditions have
improved to more natural levels and consequently the- diversity of fish
populations has also improved. This finding includes the existing impact arising
from the phase 1 Leiyang Power Plant, for which there is no evidence of marked
adverse impacts.
5.4.2.3 Benthic invertebrate sampling, in the vicinity of the Leiyang Power Plant
discharge also did not indicate any adverse effects on invertebrate abundance or
diversity in the area affected by the thermal discharge by up to 2.90C above
ambient temperatures.
5.4.2.4 The combined effects of the phase I & 2 Leiyang Power Plants will be to
return water temperatures to approximately natural conditions (Figures 5.2.2-6
and 5.2.2-7), after full mixing with even the minimum river flows (see section
5.2.2.19).
5.4.2.5 In the near-field the heated plume tends to be buoyant and leave a cold
water channel to the side and below the thermal plume. This will allow mobile
organisms such as fish to avoid any areas that are unfavourable, and will also
minimise impacts on sedentary benthic organisms.
5.4.2.6 As a result of the existing abnormally low summer water temperatures, and
the buoyancy of the thermal discharge in the near field, adverse impacts from
the proposed direct cooling water system will be much less than might normally
be anticipated. It is considered that no significant adverse impacts will arise from
5-19



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
this proposed discharge. Any potential detectable impact would be restricted to
the immediate vicinity of the discharge area before significant dilution occurs with
river water.
5.5 Social Economy And Living Standards
5.5.1   Electricity Supply And Economy
5.5.1.1 Beginning in the late 1970s, power deficiencies are getting progressively
worse, as the general economy in Hunan develops. The annual shortage of
power was estimated as 3.OTW.h during the 8th five-years plan (1990-1995).
During the next decade, the power demand will still exceed generating capacity
within the province, despite of a number of large scale power plants being
scheduled for construction, including the 2nd phase project of Leiyang Power
Plant. The construction of large scale electric power sources, such as the 2nd
project of Leiyang power plant, is considered essential if power deficiencies are
not to become a key factor restricting economic development.
5.5.1.2 Hydroelectric power accounts for 52.3% of generating capacity in Hunan
(1995). 78% of the hydropower stations are used to regulate river flows or are
run-of-river power stations, all with poor demand following ability. Also there is a
big difference of power output availability between dry and wet seasons. During
the dry season, there will always be a seasonal power deficiency and the
operation of the power grid becomes very difficult. Moreover, all of the large and
medium-size hydropower stations under construction or planned in Hunan are
seasonally adjusting stations. When these stations become operational, the load
following ability of hydropower in Hunan power grid will reduce further. It is
anticipated that the gap of power generation capacity between the dry and the
wet season will increase to over 2000MW by the year of 2000, from 1 OOOMW at
present. To counteract this, it is necessary to further develop thermal power to
improve the power source structure.
5.5.1.3 The main power sources of Hunan power grid are centralised in north-east
and north Hunan, while the main power load is in central and southem Hunan
(with over the 50% of power load of whole province compared with 37.6% of the
generating capacity). This requires a large quantity of electric power to be
transmitted for a long distances, presenting difficulties for the operation of Hunan
power grid. To mitigate these problems, it is necessary to construct large
capacity power sources in the area of central and southem Hunan. The 2nd
phase project of Leiyang Power Plant is the sole large scale project scheduled in
southem  Hunan.  With its operation as scheduled, the power generating
E
5-2O



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
capability will nearly keep a balance in southem Hunan. Otherwise, it will be
inevitable to transmit a large amount of power to south Hunan (the end of the
power grid), which will compromise the safe and stable operation of the grid. The
improvement of the power grid structure will improve security of supply which will
assist economic and industrial developments that require a reliable source of
power.
5.5.1.4 There is a large proportion of uneconomic small thermo-generation sets in
Hunan power grid. In 1995, the power amount generated by medium and low
pressure units was about 4.2 TWh requiring an additional 106-207 x 104 tons of
coal compared with more modem units. Considerable economic and
environmental benefits would follow closure of 300MW of medium and low
pressure thermo-generating sets if replaced by 2x300 MW units of the Leiyang
project. The environmental benefits are discussed further in section 5.7
5.5.1.5 With approximately 20x109 tons of potential reserves of hard coal in Hunan,
this represents a valuable resource for exploitation for power generation. After
operation of the 2nd phase project of Leiyang Power Plant, the money spent in
purchasing coal by the power plant will exceed 0.4 billion RMB yuan. This will be
of significance for enhancing job opportunities and developing the local coal
industry and the local economies.
5.5.1.6 The existent power station site and its associated infrastructure offer
considerable benefits with regard to the potential of this site for further
development. Thus there is an existing railroad, highway, cooling water pump
house, ash lagoon and other auxiliary installations, together with well established
living quarters for operating staff and their families.
5.5.1.7 Compared with a project on a new site with equal capacity, the investment
will be reduced by 0.2-0.3 billion RMB yuan (see Table 3.2-1) and the
construction period shortened by at least six months. With such favourable
economic benefits, this project should be constructed as early as possible.
5.5.1.8 The electric power generated by the project will satisfy the power demand of
society in south Hunan, and alleviate strained power supply for local industrial
and agricultural production. This improvement to the local energy structure will
ensure secure power supplies and so boost the local economy. Assuming each
kilowatt-hour, will produce a value of 6.5 yuan in increased local production, then
the 3.102 billion kWh annually generated by the project, will produce 20.16 billion
yuan of benefits to local society each year.

5.5.2 Traffic And Public Facilities
5.5.2.1 Local hard coal will be used as the fuel for the 2nd phase project of Leiyang
Power Plant. This will help to minimise coal transport requirements
5.5.2.2 The extension of the power plant will produce financial and taxation income
to the local govemment (Table 5.5.2-1). This will allow the local govemment to
invest in infrastructure such as roads and highways, telecommunication and
such social systems as the fire services , public order and security, and also
medical and health care institutions, schools and culture and recreation facilities.
This investment will help to raise local living standards.
5.5.3 Employment And Women's Status
5.5.3.1 At present, a majority of labour in Leiyang prefecture are engaged in
agricultural production with low income and poor living standards. The
construction of project will not only assist local coal industries and create job
opportunities there, but also a certain amount of labour will be needed for the
construction and operation of the power plant. Some local labour, after being
trained to meet the requirements of construction and operation, will be directly
employed by the power plant.
5.5.3.2 It is estimated that the average workforce during construction will be
approximately 4000, with a maximum of 7000 persons. Approximately 550
people will be employed during operation of the power station, although a
substantial number of these jobs will be from personnel currently employed on
phase 1 and who will be made available by manpower efficiency improvements.
5.5.3.3 The project will promote the development of local construction and building
materials industries with the creation of some employment opportunities.
5.5.3.4 During construction, the project will also increase demands on social
commodities and services, which will promote the development of local trades
and create indirect employment.
5.5.3.5 In China, both men and women have equality in rights and duties. The role
of women as contributors and beneficiaries of the project will be fully considered
during construction and operation. The project will create direct and indirect job
opportunities for women which will increase their income and enhance their
social status.

5.5.4   Impacts From Recruitrnent Of Non-Local Workers
5.5.4.1 The construction of all power plants in China is undertaken by a professional
workforce with many skilled technical workers. They undertake the main
technical tasks of power plant construction. At the same time, some local
workers will be employed to undertake auxiliary tasks.
5.5.4.2 Various services for the construction workers, such as food supply, culture
and recreation facilities, will be provided by the local population.
5.5.4.3 No conflict in economic and cultural aspect has occurred in other places in
China with this arrangement.
5.5.4.4 Because they undertake tasks which the locals are untrained for and bring
technical assistance, the construction workers coming from outside the area are
generally welcomed by the local populace.
5.5.4.5 Experience suggests that the local workers generally play a supporting role
in co-operation with outside technical workers. Generally, the entry of technical
workers from outside will tend to raise the technical level of local inhabitants,
widen their field of vision and enhance their life quality.
5.5.4.6 By undertaking auxiliary jobs during construction, the income of local
inhabitants will be uplifted. Also, the entry of outsiders with bring a large number
of consumers for local service trades.
5.5.4.7 A majority of the construction workers would come from the local province,
and only in a rare cases would come from other regions. In general, there are
no significant differences in culture and custom between the outsiders and the
locals and so no conflicts should arise.
5.5.5   Benefit Analysis For Local Inhabitants
5.5.5.1 On completion of the project, Leiyang Power Plant will supply more electric
power to local inhabitants, improve the energy structure and mitigate
environmental pollution. The increase of the electricity consumption of some
industries and inhabitants will reduce the consumption of crude energy (coal and
oil) and consequently will help to reduce other pollution sources.
5.5.5.2 With the electricity consumption per capita increasing, the local economy will
expand rapidly and the income per capita will rise accordingly. The adoption of
domestic electronic apparatus and a modem life style will enhance living
standards and the quality of cultural activities.
5-23



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
5.5.5.3 With an increased power supply in rural areas, the level of mechanisation in
agricultural production and processing of farming products will be raised to some
extent. As a result, productivity should rise and improve the rural economy.
5.5.5.4 Increased security of power supply will promote the development of village
and town ship enterprises, and speed the development of rural areas so as to
help narrow the gap between city and rural areas.
5.5.5.5 Traditional concepts of a small scale peasant economy will change with the
enhancement of living standards and increased communications with the
outside. At the same time, knowledge and information about the market
economy, needed in developing local production, will also increase.
5.5.6 Land Requisition And Reseftlement
5.5.6.1 Having been agreed with the World Bank, these issues will be discussed in
another specific report.
5.6 Construction Period
5.6.1 Ambient Air Impact
5.6.1.1 Fugitive dust pollution may arise during construction from:
- excavating and exploring of land;
- extension of the ash lagoon dam;
- Fugitive dust pollution raised by transportation of construction materials and
other equipment.
5.6.1.2 The above mentioned dust pollution would last for a short time, with low
intensity. The potential impacts are those associated with any large scale
construction project. Impact to the surrounding can be minimised if appropriate
mitigation measures are applied, as discussed in chapter 6.
5.6.2 Water Pollution
5.6.2.1 Water pollution can be avoided if the small amount of muddy wastewater,
produced during construction can be discharged after settling.
5.6.2.2 Domestic sewage produced from the construction workers will be drained
into the phase 1 project sewage treatment system and discharged after it is
within the required standards.
5-24



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                     Power Consult
5.6.2.3 The small amount of oil-contaminated wastewater, produced from the
installation of equipment, can be also drained into the phase 1 project treatment
system and discharged only after satisfying the appropriate standards.
5.6.2.4 With appropriate construction and mitigation measures, the impact on
surface waters during the construction period should be low.
5.6.3 Noise Impact
5.6.3.1 Plant noise during construction period mainly comes from the operation of
construction machines and traffic, etc. for which noise levels are shown in Table
5.6.3-1.
5.6.3.2 Predictions have been made of expected noise intensities at distances from
the construction site, assuming the site is a point source with an approximate
constant noise intensity of 105 dB(A) (Table 5.6.3-2)
5.6.3.3 Table 5.6.3-2 shows that the day and night noise level at 400m far from the
construction yard can meet with class 2 standard in GB3096-93 'Standard of
Environmental Noise in Urban Area' (see Table 2.4.1-c). The nearest residential
or other sensitive areas are approximately 500m from the outside the plant
boundary.
5.6.3.4 In addition the construction activities will have to meet the requirements of
the regulations conceming "Construction Site Boundary Noise" of GB12523-90
as set out in Table 2.4.1-c.
5.6.3.5 The World Bank noise guidelines (Table 2.4-5) should also not be violated
by the proposed construction activities.
5.7 Replacement Of Existing Boilers
5.7.1 The boilers scheduled for closure and their emissions are listed in Tables
3.11-1 and 3.11-2. These may be compared with the emissions from Leiyang
Power Plant as shown in Table 5.7-1. This shows that the phase 2 plant has 2x
the capacity of the plant to be closed, but would only use an additional 7.9% coal
and emit 65.5% more NOx. Moreover, despite the increased capacity it would
emit considerably lower amounts of S02, particulates, ash and slag. Clearly it
represents a considerable environmental benefit to Hunan Province to replace
these relatively polluting boilers with the much more efficient and higher capacity
phase 2 development.
5.7.2 The effect on local air quality of closing down these boilers is summarised in
5-25



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
Table 5.7.2. Although the areas affected by these boilers do not overlap
significantly with the area affected by the Leiyang plant, it is clear that there will
be a significant improvement in air quality in various parts of Hunan Province
once the plants are closed.
6.8 Possible Phase 3 Development
5.8.1 Water Supply
5.8.1.1 The water requirements of Phases 1 and 2 (at 2x200MW + 2x300MVV)
amount to 37.04 m3s-1. However, the phase 2 project originally received
environmental approval for 2x35OMW, with a 39.9 m3s4 water requirement.
Thus the new scheme represents a saving of 2.86 m3s-1 over a demand
previously considered feasible and approved.
5.8.1.2 Phase 3 would have to be constructed with an indirect cooling water system
with cooling towers. This is because the additional 2 x 600 MW would more than
double the water demand if direct cooling were employed such that almost all of
the dry river flow would be required. This would clearly have detrimental effects
on thermal and ecological conditions downstream of the discharge.
5.8.1.3 The water demand for 2x600MW indirect cooling system would only be
approximately 1.2 m3s-1, with a discharge of approximately 0.8 m3 s' after loss of
water through evaporation. This is within the difference in scale of water
demand between the phase 2 development using 350MW units compared to
300MW  ones.    As such, there should be no particular problem  in
accommodating the additional requirements of a further, indirect cooled, power
station.
5.8.2 Ash Disposal
5.8.2.1 It would be feasible to increase the size of the ash yard in stages to
accommodate the increased ash disposal requirements from an extension to a
phase 3 development. Table 5.8.2-1 shows the area covered and capacity of
the ash yard following raising the ash dam to various level, the maximum of
230m (Yellow Sea Datum) is still considered feasible. This would provide a
capacity of some 54.7 million i3.
5.8.2.2 The potential ash disposal amounts from all three phases of development is
indicated in Table 5.8.2-2. This assumes that phase 2 is complete by mid 2001
and that phase 3 is commissioned in 2010. 30 years disposal from phase 3 is
then considered, together with the assumption that both phase 1 and phase 2
5-26



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
also continue to produce ash throughout this period. Clearly this is a worst case
assumption in that phase I plant would then be over 40 years old, but still
assumed to be operating at full capacity.
5.8.2.3 Another pessimism is that the figures assume that there will be no utilisation
of ash or slag as a by-product.
5.8.2.4 Even with these pessimisms it appears that it would be feasible to dispose of
ash to the existing ash yard, subject to increasing the dam height.
5.8.2.5 There would of course be additional loss of vegetation on the mountain
slopes above the ash yard. This is generally similar to the vegetation that would
be lost during phase 2. There is also little or no farming activity on these high
mountain slopes, so loss of farming land and resettlement issues should be
relatively minor in scale.
5.8.3 Air Quality
5.8.3.1 Tables 5.2.3a,b,c present estimates of the contribution of a third phase
development, consisting of 2x600 MW units with an additional 210m stack, to
ground level concentrations of SO2, NOx and PM1O. It can be seen that
maximum hourly concentrations of NOx are likely to exceed the Chinese
standards by a considerable margin.
5.8.3.2 The effect of phase 3 could be reduced by combining the phase 2 stack with
the phase 3 stack, thereby greatly increasing the buoyancy of the combined
plume.
5.8.3.3 There may also be some scope for limiting the NOx emissions from the
phase 3 plant by adoption of the latest low NOx bumer technologies, that may be
available by the time of the phase 3 development, and possibly by using coals
other than anthracite. It may be possible to transport coal to the site with a
higher volatile content that would enable current low NOx bumer technologies to
achieve lower emission rates. However, this would negate the benefits of
building and operating pit-mouth power stations.
5.8.3.4 it is concluded that NOx air quality is at risk from a 2 x 600 MW phase 3
development at the same location. More detailed studies would be required to
determine whether it is possible to improve the dispersion (e.g. by combining the
stacks of phase 2 with the phase 3 stack) or whether altemative technologies
would be required in order to protect the environment. Another altemative may
be to locate the phase 3 development a few kilometers from the existing Leiyang
5-27



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                       Power Consult
site, such that the impacts from the stack emissions are not entirely
superimposed. It may then be possible to minimise peak short term ground level
concentrations of air pollutants, whilst still sharing the ash disposal facility and
utilising local coal and water resources.
5.8.4 Noise
5.8.4.1 Noise issues for Phase 3 are really a matter for detailed engineering design
and plant layout. There are no reasons to anticipate any particular problems for
a phase 3 development relating to noise issues.
5.8.4.2 The requirements of the national noise standards and World Bank
requirements will form part of the specification of the plant which must be
complied with as part of the supply contracts.

6. ANALYSIS OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
6.1 No Action
* Without Increased Generating Capacity, Social And Economic Development
Will Stagnate
6.1.1 To the end of 1995, the installed capacity in Hunan Province totalled up to
8055.5MW, of which hydropower was 52.3% and thermal power 47.7%. In 1995,
the electricity generated and purchased by the whole province was 33.94 TW.h,
that by the Hunan grid was 30.92 TW.h, and that sent into Hunan Province from
other provinces was 1.359 TW.h. Moreover, the hydropower stations are mainly
medium and small ones, of low guaranteed output with only approximately 2000
operating hours, leading to serious power shortages in the dry season.
6.1.2 One of the targets for Hunan Province Grid Development is to try to improve
its capability to follow peak demand during the wet season and to ease power
shortages in the dry season. However, because of the constraint of financial and
material resources, it is difficult to resolve all the problems simultaneously within
a short period of time. Consequently, Hunan Grid has put a priority on the
resolution of power shortages in the dry season so as to guarantee reliable
power supply to power consumers.
6.1.3 To achieve this aim, it is necessary to rapidly construct large thermal power
plants, together with further development of hydropower resources. According to
the power planning, by the year 2005, the utilisation rate of hydropower
resources of Hunan (inclusive of those under construction at that time) will reach
beyond 50% with large hydropower resources mainly fully developed.
6.1.4 The existing hydropower plants in Hunan have insufficient compensatory
capacity. For the hydropower projects which are not yet implemented, few have
adequate regulation performance. Therefore the further development of those
hydropower projects can not resolve the sharp conflicts of energy output and use
and wet and dry season demands.
* Leiyang Power Plant Phase 2 Project Will Improve Grid System Operation
6.1.5 Resulting from the large variability in output between wet and dry season, as
well as the unfavourable layout of power sources, there is a requirement to
transmit a large amount of power between different regions of the Central China
Power Grid. At present, the maximum power exchange between Central China
6-1



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consuft
Power Grid and Hunan Grid reaches 700MW. By 2005, with the service of the
Three-Gorge Project and a large batch of other power stations, the power
exchange volume within the Central China Power Grid will become even greater.
If few thermal power sources are built in Hunan Province, the tidal current
exchange volume between Central China Power Grid and Hunan Grid will
increase greatly, resulting in difficulties for grid management
6.1.6 Similar problems exist within the Hunan Power Grid because the recently
planned large hydropower projects are mostly situated in central and northem
Hunan. Leiyang Power Plant Phase 2 Extension Project is the only large power
project planned to be constructed in the South of Hunan Province. If this project
can not be constructed, there will be a large requirement for power transmission
to the South of Hunan, which is both at the end of the Hunan Power Grid and at
the end of the Central China Power Grid. If the end of the power supply system
is short of generating support, it will be unfavourable for the safe and reliable
operation of the power grid.
* Construction Of Lelyang Phase 2 Will Improve Power Supply And Promote
Economic Development In The Local Area
6.1.7 Leiyang Phase 2 project is to be located in the central part of south Hunan.
This is an area where economic development is relatively slow and is identified
in state govemment economic policy as a key area for support and development.
However, the south of Hunan, although of backward economic development, is
rich in natural resources, has good communications and has become the new
focal point in Hunan for economic development.
6.1.8 Most of the local coals are anthracites of very low volatile matter with relatively
little market demand and hence limited income to the mines. This has
constrained the local economic development in south of Hunan as a whole.
6.1.9 Leiyang Phase 2 development is the only new, large, mine-mouth power plant
planned in Hunan and is proposed to utilise the local fuel, with an annual local
coal consumption of 1.872 million tons. Therefore the construction of phase 2
will play an important role in the promotion of the local coal industry and increase
employment opportunities and living standards for the coal workers in the south
of Hunan. At the same time, the plant construction can also give an impetus to
the development of other related industries.
6.2 Plant Site Alternatives
6.2.1 If the same size new project were to be built at another site within Hunan
6-2



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                      Power Consult
province, this would miss the opportunity to take full advantage of the existing
infrastructure and investment already made for the phase I Leiyang plant.
These include the following considerations:
- The investment will increase by 200-300 million yuan (RMB). A breakdown of
cost savings possible by adoption of the Leiyang site is shown in Table 3.2-1.
- The construction period will be prolonged by more than 6 months due to
additional construction activities required to establish a new site.
- The land was occupied in accordance with plans for 1200MW final capacity
when Leiyang Power Plant phase 1 (2x200MW) was constructed. The water
supply, coal transportation, water treatment plant, highway and railway
infrastructure, were all constructed in accordance with that planning size.
- There is an existing, experienced and well-trained work force running the
phase I plant. There are 1500 staff for phase 1, but it is envisaged that
approximately the same number could operate the phase 2 plant as well.
Similarly there is an existing infrastructure (accommodation, services,
schools, police, fire department, entertainment, etc.) to provide for the needs
of this staff and their families.  These facilities will also serve the
requirements of the phase 2 staff, albeit with some improvements over time.
6.2.2 The Leiyang Power Plant extension project is a unique, large, pit-mouth
electric power project, which can fire local coal. There are the following
advantages from buming local anthracite:
- To avoid traffic and environmental problems arsing from transporting coal
long distances to other markets.
- It is not necessary to build a new railway and so the construction costs can
be reduced.
6.3 Boiler Alternatives
6.3.1 The Leiyang power plant phase 2 project is designed to bum the local
anthracite with low volatile maKter (Vdat=5.97%), heating value approximately
21150KJ/kg) and very high stickiness, which is prone to bring about coal
blockages. The project design is proposed to bum pulverised fuel in a 'W flame'
boiler.
6.3.2 The technology of pulverised fuel firing is aimed at mixing fuel and air to heat
the fuel quickly to ensure stable combustion and rapid bumout as well as
6-3



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                      Power Consult
ensuring maximum thermal efficiency. The high flame temperatures results in
formation of thermal NOx by oxidation of nitrogen in the air, as well as from
nitrogen inherent in the fuel.  The boiler configuration and bumer design
therefore has a substantial effect on the final NOx emission concentrations.
Three basic design configurations are available for commercial pulversed coal
boilers:- wall firing, comer firing (tangential or quadri-angle) and downshot firing
(arch firing or W flame'). The optimum choice of design varies depending on the
type and quality of coal.
6.3.3 Wall firing is used by several manufacturers, and uses an array of swirl-
stabilised bumers arranged either as front wall or opposed wall firing. The
comer firing design is mainly used by ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) Combustion
Engineering. In this design the bumers are arranged in a vertical distribution in
the comers of the boiler and directed to induce a rotating fireball inside the
fumace. The downshot firing design (Foster Wheeler and Riley Stoker etc.) uses
bumers on the venturi throat directed vertically down or at an angle into the
fumace.
6.3.4 Circular bumers were typically used in wall firing boilers and were designed to
achieve maximum flame stability and carbon bumout in a minimum combustion
volume. However, the high flame temperatures generated produced relatively
high NOx emissions. Usually, non-swirling bumers are used in comer and
downshot boiler designs and produce lower NOx emission levels due to a more
fuel rich combustion zone.
6.3.5 China has had many years of experience in buming anthracite in power plant
boilers, with accumulated knowledge of direct flow bumer and comer fired
tangential combustion technology. The power plants with single turbine-set
capacity of 200MW at Jiaozuo (buming Jiaozuo anthracite Vdae=7.2%),
Shaoguang, Baima and Congqing power plants (buming Sichuan Songzao
anthracite Vdaf=9.31%) and Leiyang (buming local anthracite Vdaf=6.6%) etc.
have been in operation for many years. The 300MW turbine-boiler sets, adopting
tangential combustion technology to bum anthracite, have also been in operation
in recent years.
6.3.6 The inherent problems in comer firing technology are:
- With anthracite fuel it is difficult to achieve high combustion efficiencies. This
results in a large waste of fuel reflected in high carbon in ash and ash ignition
loss values (see Table 3.5-2).
- Poor flame stabilities limit load regulation capability requiring operation at
6-4



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
relatively high load to achieve acceptable combustion conditions. Therefore
the power plants with corner fired boilers, buming low volatile fuel, can hardly
satisfy the technical and economical performance requirements of a modem
power plant.
6.3.7 In the practical experience of intemational power plant boiler manufacturers,
downshot 'W flame' combustion boilers have unique advantages in buming low
volatile anthracite under low load:
- Relatively stable and complete coal combustion.
- Reduced combustion chamber height.
- Reduced segregation of flue gas temperature.
- Based upon operating experience abroad and in China, for buming anthracite
coal, the stable combustion load without assistance of oil will be 20-30%
lower than that for a quadri-angle injected combustion boiler.
- Have good performance in economic aspects matching high efficiency with
relatively low cost.
6.3.8 When the 1180 t/h downshot boiler (362MW) in Huaneng Yueyang power
plant bums mixed coal (Vdarf10 ± 1.5%), the designed minimum stable
combustion load without oil assistance is 55 ± 3% BMCR. The elevation of the
steam drum centre line is 52m, almost the same as that of a comer fired boiler
equipped with the 125MW turbine set manufactured in China and more than 1 Om
lower than that of the Chinese comer fired boiler equipped with 300MW turbine.
6.3.9 Capital costs of downshot boilers are approximately 10% higher than
conventional wall fired designs, but the advantages for combustion of low
volatility coals is considered to offset this additional cost.
6.3.10 An altemative to the above boiler designs is to adopt Fluidised Bed
Combustion (FBC) boiler system. FBC boilers are a much more advanced
technology of clean coal combustion. There are two basic kinds: Atmospheric
Fluidised Bed Combustion (AFBC) and Pressurised Fluidised Bed Combustion
(PFBC). The advantages of FBC boilers are:
- Suitable coal quality range is wide.
- Not only can it limit NO, production, but it can also limit SO2 emission during
the combustion process. It is particularly suitable for power plant buming
high sulphur coal.
r
6-5



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                      Power Consult
- The disadvantages of FBC boiler are:
- Greater investment: Recent experience in China of a PFBC plant (Jiawang
Power Plant in Jiangsu Province) cost 1550.2 million yuan for 159 MW plant.
This represents an investment of 9.81 million yuan per MW compared to only
5.16 million yuan per MW for the proposed phase 2 project. (However, it is
understood that AFBC boilers may possibly be slightly more cost effective at
present)
- Little operating experience on large capacity units:- there is no current
experience of anthracite firing in a FBC boiler of 300MW or larger. There is
also no Chinese operating experience which would add to project risks of
having to establish a new technology in China.
6.3.11 Leiyang power plant is to bum anthracite with low sulphur content. The S02
emission from the plant can already meet the PRC and World Bank standards,
so it is unnecessary for Leiyang power plant to adopt a FBC boiler to control S02
emissions.
6.3.12 The proposed boiler would result in relatively high NOx ermissions because of
the requirement to bum anthracite as a fuel. However, air dispersion modelling
has established that this would not adversely affect ambient conditions
sufficiently to cause any problems in attaining ambient air quality standards. As
such, the additional costs can be judged to be excessive, in that the
environmental benefits would be limited. However, under circumstances where
ambient NOx levels are marginal or poor, FBC technology, perhaps with smaller
sized units, may be a technology to be considered for anthracite firing.
6.4 Fuel Options
6.4.1 The main purposes of extension phase 2 project of Leiyang power plant is to
resolve the problem of shortage of electricity supply. The consideration on
selection of the fuel for the extension project is on the basis of the practical
conditions in Leiyang and the economic affordable capability. On the selection
of fuel the following possibilities have been considered:
- No suitable conditions exist to construct large hydropower plant and nuclear
power plant in the area. These two types of power plant need tremendous
investment and a long construction period. It is obvious that both of these
two types of power station are not reasonable for this area.
- Although LNG and LPG are clean fuels, there is no source of this type of fuel
in the vicinity of Leiyang. Moreover, Govemment policy does not allow the
6-6



Hunan Power Development Pmiect (PartA)                      Power Consult
use of that kind of clean energy resource in an area with little industry or
population like Leiyang. Selection of gas fuel is also impossible.
- Oil fuel is very expensive. At present the oil-fired power plant in China uses
imported fuel. Buming oil will not only require transportation, but will also
dramatically increases the cost of electricity generation. The electricity tariff
would be higher than 666 yuan/MW.h.
6.4.2 Leiyang power plant phase 2 extension project is to bum local anthracite
which is a reliable coal resource, has convenient transportation, low cost and is
in accordance with PRC national energy policy. The electricity cost per unit will
be 244.0 yuan/MW.h.
6.4.3 In conclusion, the selection of local anthracite coal for Leiyang power plant is
reasonable after the consideration of all altemative fuels for this project.
6.5 Particulate Emissions
6.5.1 Particulate Control Efficiency
6.5.1.1 The original design for Leiyang power plant phase 2 project was for
precipitators with an efriciency of 99.5%. In this condition, particulate emission
quantity is 0.335tlh and emission concentration 157 mg Nm . Under this design
the particulate emission concentrations for Leiyang Power Plant phase 2 project
could meet with the permitted emission concentration stipulated in GB13223-
1996 (period ll), of 200 mg Nm 3, see Table 5.2-1.
6.5.1.2 If the particulate emission concentration is 100 mg Nm3 dry flue gas (excess
air factor, a=1.4) or 50 mg Nm-3 dry flue gas (a=1.4), the corresponding required
precipitating efficiencies are 99.68% and 99.84%.
6.5.1.3 The World Bank requirement is that emissions should achieve 100 mg Nm 3
in the stack emissions. This is a moderately onerous target to achieve with
electrostatic precipitators when buming anthracite fuel with a very low sulphur
content. It is believed that 50 mg Nm 3 would be extremely difficult to achieve
with this type of fuel.
6.5.2 Smoke Dust Emission Impacts On Ambient Air Quality
6.5.2.1 The modelling predictions of ground level impacts of particulate emissions
from Leiyang Power Plant indicate that the plant has little effect on local air
quality (see section 5.2.1). Maximum predicted impacts from phase 2 were
6-7



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                      Power Consult
approximately 4.3% of the daily average standard and only 0.6% of the annual
average standard. This implies that there is little environmental benefit to be
gained from striving to achieve extremely low dust emission levels. Even the
original proposal of 99.5% efficiency ESPs would have little effect. However, it is
believed that the World Bank standard of 100 mg Nm-3 (99.68% efficiency) is
achievable at moderate cost.
6.5.2.2 Little additional benefit would result from pushing performance down to try to
attain 50 mg Nm-3 since ground level dust levels are dominated by sources other
than the power station.  Achieving this level of control would present
considerable technical difficulties with this low sulphur content fuel. There is no
Chinese operating experience of maintaining performance at such low levels. As
such it is suggested that the current World Bank standard of 100 mg Nm-3
should be adopted for this project.
6.5.3 Precipitator Options
6.5.3.1 Several different types of particulate matter control equipment have been
employed at power plants. These include wet scrubbers, multicyclones, electric-
static-precipitators (ESP) and fabric (bag) filters. Of these, high particulate
removal efficiencies are only achievable by ESPs and by fabric filters which both
can give removal efficiencies well in excess of 90%.
6.5.3.2 In an ESP a high voltage electric field is generated to impart an electric
charge to particles in the gas stream. These are then removed by attraction to
oppositely charged collectors. Efficiency of collection is highly dependent on the
electrical characteristics or resistivity of the ash to be collected, particle size
distribution and loading. As these factors may vary during normal operations,
ESP performance may also be expected to vary. A thorough maintenance
programme is required to ensure that optimal ESP performance can be
maintained.
6.5.3.3 It is possible to assist the efficiency of ESPs, when working on fly ash with
poor resistivity characteristics, by injecting S03 and / or ammonia to condition
the ash particles. Although relatively simple technology, there is no current
operating experience in China. Also, there can be adverse consequences in
terms of residual chemicals present on the ash which may cause problems in
utilisation of the ash as a by-product.
6.5.3.4 An alternative for ESPs with high precipitation efficiency is the fabric filter
dust collector. This employs a nylon or fibreglass fabric, normally arranged as a
6-8



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
number of bags through which the flue gas is directed. Particle collection relies
on gravitational settling, direct impaction, inertial impaction, diffusion and
electrostatic attraction. The particulate matter, as it collects, forms a filter cake
that further improves collection efficiency, but at a cost of reducing ability to pass
the required gas flow. When the pressure drop across the bags reaches a pre-
determined level the bag is taken off-line for cleaning. Cleaning may be by
shaking, pulse jet cleaning or reverse air cleaning.
6.5.3.5 The bag dust collector has been rarely used in Chinese power plants, so
there is a lack of experience in its operation and management. Moreover,
operating costs are relatively high. With electric-static-precipitators widely used
in Chinese power plants, there is much experience and ability to achieve higher
precipitating efficiency under condifions of different coal quality.
6.5.4 Brief Economic Comparison
6.5.4.1 Adopting ESP with four fields for 300MW units (precipitating efficiency is up
to 99.5%), the domestic cost of its ESP main body, steel supports and ESP
electric resource etc. is about 15 million Yuan (RMB).  If the precipitating
efficiency is designed for 99.68%, it would be necessary to adopt ESP with 5
fields. The domestic cost of ESP main body, steel supports and ESP electric
resource etc. is about 18 million Yuan (RMB).
6.5.4.2 At present, there is no precedent in China for the operation of ESPs to
achieve a precipitating efficiency of 99.84% or 50 mg Nm`3 particulate emission
concentration. This lack of practical operating experience would present a risk
that it would prove difficult to operate steadily under such a tight emission
control. The very low sulphur content of the coal also results in ash with
relatively poor characteristics for ESPs to work at very high efficiencies. To
obtain emissions significantly below 100 mg Nm-3 would probably either require
some fly ash conditioning system, by addition of SO3 and / or ammonia, or would
favour adoption of a fabric filter system.
6.6 SO2 Discharge Control
6.6.1 Leiyang Power Plant SO2 Discharge Control
6.6.1.1 The oxidation of sulphur in coal generates SO2 and a small amount of S03.
Complete oxidation of sulphur is generally before that of carbon and therefore
the amount of SO2 produced is entirely determined by the fuel composition and
is not dependent on the combustion technology. For boilers buming pulverised
6-9



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
coal, the major measures to reduce S02 discharges are (a) to bum coal of low
sulphur content, and (b) to carry out flue gas desulphurisation;
6.6.1.2 In the USA, between 1975 and 1985, the Department of Energy invested
more than 60 billion US dollars to cut S02 discharges. Within this investment;
17.0 billion US dollars were used to install and run flue gas desulphurisation;
11.0 billion US dollar, to dress by washing 35% of the coal to be used in power
generation; and about 34 billion US dollars, to change to buming more
expensive low sulphur coal at power plants originally buming high sulphur coal.
Using low sulphur coal as a fuel in power plants was the most common measure
for reducing S02 discharges.
6.6.1.3 There are many possible technologies in flue gas desulphurisation, all with
expensive investment and operating cost. Even in developed countries, to use
low sulphur coal in power plants is still one of the most cost effective measures
in controlling SO2 emissions. In China, flue gas desulphurisation in power plants
is a recent development and there is a shortage of successful operating
experience.
6.6.1.4 Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase and 2nd phase projects will bum local low
sulphur anthracite. (St,ar in 2nd phase being 0.36% average, maximum 0.46%)
6.6.1.5 The S02 discharge mass emissions and concentrations are well within both
Chinese national standards and also World Bank guidelines (see Table 5.2-1).
6.6.1.6 In addition, the predicted impacts on ground level SO2 concentrations are
very low and the resulting conditions would be well within the relevant ambient
air quality standards.
6.6.1.7 Therefore, it is not necessary to utilise flue gas desulphurisation technology
in controlling Leiyang Power Plant S02 discharges.
6.6.2 SO2 Discharge Mitigation Scheme
6.6.2.1 The Hunan Provincial Electric Power Company is to reduce regional S02
discharge amounts, mainly by means of the retirement of subordinate old and
small generating units. The retirement programme in the "ninth five year" (1996-
2000) has been discussed in Chapter 3.11 and the resulting reductions in
emissions are given in Table 5.7-1.
6.6.2.2 Leiyang Power Plant, with a 2x300MW increase in capacity of the newly-
installed units and a decrease by retirement of 300MW in 10 small units,
6-10



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
considerably reduces SO2, smoke dust and ash slag emissions compared with
the existing emissions.
6.7 NOx Emission Control
6.7.1 The importance of boiler design in relation to NOx emissions has been
discussed briefly in section 6.3.
6.7.2 Much can be achieved in controlling NOx emissions by attention to boiler
design and combustion technology. Techniques include bumer staging, in which
a primary bumer zone is operated in fuel rich conditions and then combustion is
completed in a secondary bumer zone with more air.
6.7.3 Most of this development work on low NOx bumer design has been conducted
in developed countries and primarily in relation to bituminous coals. The
development of technologies appropriate to anthracite firing are currently less
well developed, but this is an area where developments are currently being
made. As a result, it is important that NOx emission performance is a major
criterion in selecting the final boiler design chosen for the Leiyang Phase 2
development.   This will ensure that the best possible environmental
performance, available from international tenders of commercially proven plant,
is selected for the project. Weighting of the NOx performance criterion against
other performance factors must be assessed on the basis of achieving Best
Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC).
6.7.4 There are a number of post-combustion treatments for flue gas designed to
reduce NOx emissions. These include non-catalytic and catalytic processes,
both of which react with NOx to produce nitrogen gas and water.
6.7.5 Selective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) reduces emissions through a
reaction of ammonia or urea at high temperatures (>8100C).
6.7.6 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) reduces emissions through a reaction
between ammonia and NOx on the surface of a catalyst operating at a
temperature of 315-4000C. These temperatures are achieved in the economiser
to pre-heater sections of the boiler.  However, operating outside of this
temperature range can result in catastrophic damage to the catalyst. Chemical
poisoning occurs at lower temperatures, whereas thermal degradation occurs at
higher temperatures. Reactivity can only be achieved by replacement of the
catalyst.
6.7.7 Two types of catalyst are available: base metal oxides and zeolite. Base
6-11



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                      Power Consuft
metal catalysts consist of vanadium or titanium embedded into a ceramic matrix.
Zeolite catalysts are ceramic molecular sieves extruded into a honeycomb
structure. Zeolyte catalysts are more durable than are the base metal ones.
6.7.8 There is experience in operating SCR in coal fired boilers in Japan and
Europe, whereas SNCR has had more limited application in Germany. SCR
offers the potentially best NOx control, but at higher cost. There is a general
lack of experience of either technology utilising low sulphur low volatility coals, as
are available in China and would be used at Leiyang.
6.7.9 SCR costs depend on the required NOx removal, the reagent used and,
critically, on the cost of catalyst. The cost of catalyst is a major uncertainty.
6.7.10 As a guide, annual operation and maintenance costs for a notional 500 MW
supercritical PF plant with tight NOx standards are approximately:
* Catalyst replacement 1.4 million $
- Ammonia reagent    0.4 million $
* General Maintenance 0.4 million $
* TOTAL           2.2 million
6.8 Waste Water Discharge
6.8.1 Phase 1 Project Waste Water Discharge
6.8.1.1 The waste water produced by power plant are: A. acidic and alkaline waste
water, B. drainage from coal transportation system and coal yard, C. oil-
contaminated sewage, D. drainage from ash yard, E. Living sewage.
6.8.1.2 Leiyang 1st phase project has installed waste water treatment facilities for
various waste waters (except drainage from the ash lagoon) so as to attain the
required standards prior to discharge to Leishui River.
6.8.1.3 The drainage from the ash lagoon, without treatment goes to the Leishui
River, 0.5km downstream of the power plant, via a drainage ditch. The water
quality of ash yard drainage can sometimes have a pH value greater than 9 -
exceeding the required standard of pH6-9.
6.8.1.4 The once-through condenser cooling water and other machine cooling
waters, without increase of pollutants other than temperature, are discharged to
the Leishui River without treatment.

Hunan Power Development Project (Pad A)                     Power Consult
6.8.2 Phase 2 Project Waste Water Treatnent
6.8.2.1 Although the waste waters produced in the power plant are discharged into
waters only after being treated, they would still bring about some impacts to
waters.
6.8.2.2 In the design of Leiyang power plant 2nd phase project, the various waste
waters, after being treated sufficiently, are to be used as make-up water in the
ash sluicing system.
6.8.2.3 To use various wastewaters in ash sluicing will not only reduce the water
demand for ash sluicing, but will also prevent any environmental impacts from
their discharge.
6.8.2.4 The ash yard sluicing water, after being treated by adding antiscaling agent
if needed, will be recirculated back to the plant for re-use.  Thus, after
completion of 2nd phase project, the ash yard will no longer discharge to the
Leishui River.
6.8.2.5 The condenser cooling water and other machine cooling waters, without
increase of pollutants other than temperature, are still to be discharged to the
Leishui River.
6.8.2.6 A comparison between the 2nd phase project waste water treatment
proposals and those for traditional waste water treatment offers several
advantages:
6.8.2.7 addition of an ash-sluicing water retrieval system.
6.8.2.8 reduction of the water abstraction requirement for the power plant.
6.8.2.9 prevention of waste water impacts to the environment.
6.8.2.10 An alternative to the direct cooling system proposed would be to use an
indirect cooling water system using cooling towers to reduce the temperature of
the water circulating through the power plant. Such a scheme considerably
reduces the water demand. Approximately 1% of the water would be lost by
evaporation and would need to be replaced. An additional 1-2% would be
required as a 'purge flow' to prevent build up of dissolved solids in the system
and potential scaling problems.
6.8.2.11 Such a system typically reduces water demand to approximately 3% of that
of a direct cooled system and discharges only 2%. Moreover that discharge,
having been through cooling towers will generally also be at lower temperatures
6-13



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consuft
than from a direct cooling discharge.
6.8.2.12 However, in the case of the Leiyang Power Plant, the influence of the
hydropower schemes upstream has been to reduce summer water temperatures
below their natural levels.  The increased temperature from the Leiyang
discharge will tend, after mixing, to bring river temperatures to levels more
generally similar to natural ones.
6.8.2.13 A cooling tower system is estimated to cost 30 million yuan. In this
particular instance this additional cost would seem to be unwarranted, given the
limited, if any, environmental benefit that would be expected to result.
6.9 Ash Treatment Scheme
6.9.1 Ash Removal System
6.9.1.1 Ash removal systems can be categorised into dry (pneumatic) and wet
(hydraulic) treatment systems. The Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project is to
treat fly ash by means of dry pneumatic method and reserves a dry ash
interface. The alternate scheme is to treat fly ash by means of wet hydraulic
method. The advantage of the wet-type ash removal system is its small initial
investment. However it is then difficult to re-utilise the fly ash. For this reason,
the Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project would adopt a dry ash removal
system.
6.9.2 Ash Transportation System
6.9.2.1 The power plant fly ash can be conveyed to the ash yard by means of dry
type (belt conveyor, truck transportation) or hydraulic method (pipe line). The dry
ash transportation system, together with dry ash storage, are linked systems. Its
advantages lie in the fact that water resources can be minimised and potential
pollution of underground water, due to ash water leakage, can be prevented.
However, Leiyang 2nd phase project shares the same ash storage lagoon with
the 1st phase project. Moreover, the ash lagoon is in a mountain valley. The
bottom of the lagoon and foundations of the dam have low permeability,
preventing significant impact to underground water.
6.9.2.2 Leiyang 1st project has adopted a hydraulic ash transportation system and
wet ash storage. If the 2nd phase project were to adopt a dry ash transportation
system, then the ash removal and ash transportation system in the 1st phase
project would also need to be changed, or the ash yard would need to be located
6-14



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                       Power Consult
elsewhere. This would not only require additional investment, but also would
raise resettlement and compensation issues and also increase dust emissions.
6.9.2.3 The ash yard is about 4.5km distant to the power plant and located in a hilly
region. Adopting dry ash transportation would be relatively difficult, whether by
transportation by truck or by belt conveyor. Moreover, it is prone to fugitive dust
emissions, incurring additional potential impact to the environment.
6.9.2.4 Adopting hydraulic ash transportation and wet ash storage lagoon the 2nd
phase project only requires the height of ash dam at ash lagoon to be raised,
economising the investment.
6.9.2.5 The 2nd phase project will have the water in ash lagoon re-circulated for re-
use. Additional supplies, to replace evaporative losses, will be made up by
wastewater from the plant area.
6.9.2.6 For these reasons it is preferable for Leiyang power plant to adopt wet ash
storage based on the existing ash yard.

PROGRAMME
L



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
7. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME
7.1 Environmental Mitigation
A summary of principal mitigation measures and their associated capital and
running costs is given as Table 7.1-1.
7.1.1 Operating Period
Environmental Management
7.1.1.1 One of the main mitigating measures against adverse impacts from power
station developments is the application of strong environmental management
techniques.
7.1.1.2 Leiyang Power Plant Phase 1 already has an Environmental Management
Department, including a staff of 2 managers and 8 technical staff. Their
responsibilities include environmental protection management, monitoring,
operation and supervision of environmental protection installations,
environmental education, tracking social economic benefit of power plant
construction. They have requirements for environmental reporting to relevant
departments and establishing various environmental protection files and
systematic records.
7.1.1.3 The phase 2 development will utilise the existing environmental
management structure. It is thought that approximately 5 new staff may be
required in the department, including 1-2 at managerial level and the remainder
as technical staff. The existing laboratories are sufficiently large (600 m2) to
accommodate the additional staff and work load.
* Atmospheric Pollution
7.1.1.4 Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase project uses coal with a sulphur content of
0.39%, while the coal designed for 2nd phase project will be anthracite, also
with particularly low sulphur content, average to be 0.36%.
7.1.1.5 Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project is to have a 210m high single tube stack
with inner diameter 7m. Under this condition:
The whole plant SO2 total mass emissions and concentrations from each
stack all will satisfy the requirements Chinese national and World Bank
standards.
7-1



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                       Power Consult
- The maximum ground level concentrations brought about by the whole plant
SO2 discharge in the assessed area will all easily meet Chinese and World
Bank air quality standards.
7.1.1.6 No further mitigation of SO2 is considered necessary, other than the use of low
sulphur coal as specified.
7.1.1.7 Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase project has adopted an ESP with four electric
fields and an efficiency of 99% particulate removal. In order to meet World Bank
particulate emissions standards (100 mg Nm-3), the 2nd phase project will adopt
highly efficient ESPs, with designed dust removal efficiency of 99.68%:
-  The smoke dust discharge concentration of each boiler after passing through
ESP will also satisfy the requirements of GBI 3223-1996 (200 mg Nm3);
-  The maximum ground level PM10 concentrations incurred by the whole plant
particulate discharge are only a small fraction of the permitted ambient air
quality standards.
7.1.1.8 The power plant should strengthen the management and -maintenance of the
ESPs to guarantee that the precipitating efficiency will be kept stable at a high
level.
7.1.1.9 The stack should be fitted with continuous monitoring of particulate emissions.
The results should be relayed to the control room, with alarms set to alert unit
operators when the 100 mg Nm3 particulate emission value is approached or
exceeded. In addition, operational procedures should be adopted such that unit
operators adopt appropriate measures to bring performance back within
specification in the event of high particulate emissions occurring.
7.1.1.10 The fact that the emission standard required by the World Bank is half the
Chinese national standard implies that the World Bank will need to follow up with
surveillance of compliance to ensure continued operations to their own
requirements. The Chinese environmental agencies can not be expected to
enforce standards more onerous than their own regulations permit.
7.1.1.11 Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project will adopt 'W flame' boilers equipped
with coal bumers suitable for anthracite. It is unlikely that the performance of this
system will meet the Chinese emission standard, or that of the World Bank, due to
difficulties inherent with buming anthracite coal with very low volatile content. The
respective standards have been formulated with reference to anticipated
performance of power plant using soft, bituminous coals with high volatile contents.
7.1.1.12 Leiyang is in an area with extremely low ambient NOx concentrations. Air
7-2



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                       Power Consu/t
quality modelling indicates that, even with the anticipated NOx emissions, the
ambient air quality will remain broadly within the required standards. As such, it is
not proposed that any additional control measures should be implemented.
7.1.1.13 In order to minimise the NOx emissions, it is important that this is a major
factor that will be incorporated into the tender assessment process for purchasing
the boilers for phase 2. By this means it should be possible to ensure that boilers
are selected with the best available emission control characteristics, together with
other key performance characteristics, available as proven technologies from latest
international experience. The principle to be adopted in selection of preferred
design should be one of Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive
Cost (BATNEEC).
* Water Environment
7.1.1.14 The aim of the phase 2 project is to reduce the amount of water being
abstracted by power plant and enhancing the reutilisation rate of water, the
Leiyang power plant 2nd phase project will retrieve the following wastewater
after being treated:
- Ash water at ash lagoon.
-  Acidic and alkaline wastewater.
-  Oil contaminated water.
-  Drainage of sluicing water in coal transportation system.
-  Domestic sewage etc.
7.1.1.15 After retrieving this wastewater, the plant will reduce abstraction
requirements by approximately 1 OOOt/h water.
7.1.1.16 The water intake structure for Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project has
already been built as part of the 1st phase project. The design is already
sufficient to ensure no impact on navigation, and will be provided with band
screens to avoid entrainment of organisms and debris into the cooling water
system.
7.1.1.17 The possible effects of the discharge from Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase
project are impacts to navigation, incurred by the outfall structure and currents,
and impacts to the aquatic ecosystem incurred by heat pollution of temperature
field.
7.1.1.18 The department of cooling water, Institute of Water resources and
Hydropower Research (IWHR) had four designs of cooling water outfall for the
7-3



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                       Power Consult
2nd phase project compared and optimised by means of physical and
mathematical models.
7.1.1.19 The optimised discharge design is such that the axis line of the drainage
exit intersects the bank at an angle 470. An arc shaped flow-guiding dyke
should be built before the drainage exit. This will not only avoid impacts to
navigation, but also retain a cool water channel past the discharge plume to
minimise adverse effects.
7.1.1.20 There should be a grille and moving screen at the intake to prevent fish
from being entrained with the cooling water and killed within the system.
7.1.1.21 For all wastewater discharges, the criteria of environmental protection
promulgated by people's Republic of China will be strictly implemented.
7.1.1.22 Under the prerequisite of being economical and practical, the Leiyang
Power Plant has endeavoured to reduce wastewater discharges as much as
possible. By optimising the discharge schemes, the power plant design has
maximised re-utilisation of wastewater.
7.1.1.23 Waste water from the boiler feed water treatment system, condensate
treatment system, boiler acid-washing waste water and air-preheater flushing
water drainage are of similar water quality, will be treated in a unified treatment
system, as shown in Fig.7.1-1.
7.1.1.24 When the water quality, after being treated, attains a suitable standard, the
water will be used in hydraulic ash sluicing.
7.1.1.25 The 2nd phase project is to use appropriate oily water sumps, cyclone oil-
water separators, and nutshell filters, to treat oil contaminated wastewater in
both the It and 2nd phase projects. (Fig.7.1-2).
7.1.1.26 After being treated, with the oil concentration <=10 mg 1.1, this water is also
to be used in ash sluicing. Recovered oil will be retumed to the oil stores and
reused.
7.1.1.27 In the 2nd phase project, the power plant is still to apply a 'sand
settlement-oxidation pond" treatment system for treatment of domestic
sewage, as is used effectively in the 1st phase project (see Fig 7.1-3);
7.1.1.28 Again, after being treated, the water attaining a standard of COD<100
mg 1- and BOD<30 mg 1-' will be used in ash sluicing. Sludge from the
treatment ponds will be disposed with municipal watse. So far there has been
7-4



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part A)                      Power Consult
no requirement to dispode of sludge from the phase 1 plant as the oxidation
ponds have a large capacity.
7.1.1.29 The drainage from coal transportation system and coal yard are to be
treated in a settling pond;
7.1.1.30 After being treated, the upper layer of clarified water will be used as make-
up water in the ash sluicing system. Coal that is settled out will be used as
fuel.
7.1.1.31 Table 7.1-2 shows the water quality to be achieved in the above
wastewater processing scheme.
* Ash Disposal
7.1.1.32 After completion of the 2nd phase project, the ash water for the whole plant
will be retrieved for reuse.
7.1.1.33 Around the ash yard periphery, a trench is to be constructed, at an
elevation of 173m-175m, to intercept the majority of surface water run-off that
would otherwise enter the ash yard. This will drain, via an open draining canal,
directly into the Leishui River. This will guarantee the safe operation of the ash
yard even in flood periods and reduce the amount of water to be recycled in
the system.  By diverting water around the ash yard, the potential for
environmental pollution will be significantly reduced.
7.1.1.34 The ash dam is a water permeable one. The 2nd phase project will retrieve
the water permeating through the ash dam to use it in ash sluicing. This will be
achieved by pumping water collected at the base of the dam back into the ash
yard. The recycling of water back to the station can then be by gravity,
because of the difference in elavation between the ash yard and the power
station site.
7.1.1.35 The bottom of the ash yard is clay with a low permeability coefficient,
(average of 2.39x10-7 cm s-1). The dam foundations are on shale, mud shale
and a thick layer of compact lime stone, also with low permeability. This
ensures that little contamination of groundwater systems will occur from
leachates from the ash yard.
* Noise
7.1.1.36 To alleviate noise impacts to the environment, the plant is to control the
noise emissions from equipment and workshops. The major noise sources,
7-5



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
noise limiting value and mitigation measures in the power plant are shown in
Table 7.1-3.
7.1.1.37 For power plant equipment, the suppliers will be required to provide
products that will achieve the attainment of the required noise standards within
the plant buildings and also at the plant boundary.
7.1.1.38 For any equipment with high noise levels, the plant should install suitable
control measures such as fitting silencers or noise enclosures etc. These will
include the measures outlined in Table 7.1-3
7.1.1.39 Noise should be a consideration in detailed design and plant layout to
minimise combined effects of noisy equipment, to minimise noise exposure to
workers in the power station and to guarantee compliance with the noise
limitations at the site boundary. Some tree planting and construction of
landscaping measures may also be used to help mitigate noise levels at the
plant boundary and beyond.
7.1.1.40 Suitable limitations on the number and location of open windows in the
plant and workshop areas should be considered.
* Solid Waste And Coal Yard
7.1.1.41 Currently, Leiyang power plant has a coal shed with 72m span and 120m
long. The 2nd phase project will build another coal shed of the same size.
The maximum width of the coal yard is 70m and the coal pile height is up to
12m.
7.1.1.42 One  mitigation  measure, to  minimise  impacts arising  from  the
transportation of fuel to the power plant, is to adopt rail transport for all of the
coal for the phase 2 development. Rail transport is also used for transport of
bulk fuel oil.
7.1.1.43 Coal handling is by means of a bucket-wheel loader and dump truck to pile
and reclaim coal.
7.1.1.44 In order to prevent and control environmental impacts arising from coal
dust, the power plant is to adopt the following measures:
-  To add tightly sealed baffles to coal conveyors.
-  To have efficient dust brushing systems at transfer posts.
-  To install a vacuum dust precipitator at the coal bunker.
7-6



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
- To build wind shield bank at the west and north sides of the coal yard and
to plant tree screens.
7.1.1.45 Leiyang power plant 2nd phase project will share the ash lagoon with the
1st phase project. This is in a densely vegetated valley and the ash lagoon is
always operated with a cover of water. From several years of operating
experience, the ash lagoon has had no significant problem with fugitive dust
emissions.
7.1.1.46 In the ash removal system design for Leiyang Power Plant phase 2
extension project, provision will be made for dry ash output. This will help to
facilitate favourable conditions for comprehensive utilisation of ash as a by-
product.
7.1.1.47 Leiyang power plant has established a Fly Ash Comprehensive Utilisation
Company to actively promote use of ash as a by-product resource.
7.1.1.48 Marketing of ash as a resource will extend the potential life of the ash
lagoon, and delay requirements to construct new stages of the ash dam and
also could have considerable commercial benefits. Use of the floating ash
'cenospheres' would also be of benefit as these cause particular problems for
fugitive dust emissions where floating ash may become stranded at the
margins of the lagoon, dry out and then become wind-blown.  These
cenospheres have particularly good insulating properties and so are valuable
for making thermal insulating building blocks. Some use is already made of
ash for this purpose from Phase 1 and further utilisation should be encouraged.
7.1.1.49 When finally complete, the ash lagoon should quickly be covered with earth
and tumed into farm fields or forested.
Contingency Measures
7.1.1.50 The operation of a power plant presents some potential risks to the
environment, such as oil spills, fires or chemical spills. To minimise these risks
it is necessary to provide a management system that will identify and minimise
risks, and provide systems and facilities to handle any occurrences.
7.1.1.51 One measure that could improve on the status of the Phase 1 plant is the
bunding of oil (both fuel oil and areas storing lubricating oils) and bulk chemical
storage. This would be intended to contain any significant accidental release
from bulk storage tanks. It is standard practice to provide bulk storage tanks
with an impermeable bund of sufficient capacity to contain the whole contents
7-7



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consuft
of the tank, (or of the largest tank if several tanks are enclosed), plus a margin
for rainwater and fire fighting water. Typically bunds are designed for 110% of
the capacity of the largest tank, but some variation may be considered in areas
of either very high or low rainfall. Guidelines are available from Construction
Industry Research and Information Association on the 'Construction of Bunds
for Oil Storage Tanks' (Report 163, 1997). This sets out a basis of calculating
required bund sizes, taking into account the storage capacity together with
additional freeboard required to accommodate rainwater and fire fighting foam,
etc.
7.1.1.52 Where practicable, pumps, valves, couplings, delivery nozzles and
overspill pipes should also be contained within the bunded area. It is also
recommended that pipework leading to or from the bund should be routed over
the top of the bund in order to avoid the need to pierce the walls
7.1.1.53 Where it is required to remove an accumulation of rainwater, this should be
by means of a system requiring manual supervision, rather than simply to allow
drainage through the bund in an uncontrolled manner. Typically this may be by
means of a pumped system. Simple drainage points with a control valve are
generally not considered suitable, since experience indicates that valves may
often be left in the open position.
7.1.1.54 Materials should be maintained on site to deal with any minor spills. This
may include oil absorbent booms, to be employed on drainage ditches or the
river and absorbent granules to mop up spills on land.
7.1.1.55 In order to minimise the potential risks to the environment, it is also
recommended that the Leiyang Power Plant phase 2 should develop and
maintain a risk management plan. This should include a management system
and allocation of responsibilities, process safety information, hazard analysis,
assessment  of  environmental  consequences,  incident  investigation
procedures, emergency response planning, training requirements and audit
system.
* Offsite
7.1.1.56 The engineering outside the plant include water supply and drainage pipe
lines and ash water pipe lines, transmission power lines and railway lines. The
majority of these have been completed in 1st phase project.
7.1.1.57 The possible environmental, impacts incurred by engineering outside the
power plant are on communication, landscape etc.
7-8



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
7.1.1.58 By consideration during design, the engineering outside the power plant
should, as far as possible, keep clear of vital communication lines, villages,
and densely populated areas. Routes should pass mainly through hills and
farm fields.
7.1.1.59 The occupiers of the small amount of cultivated land occupied should be
compensated. In general the requirements for ash and water pipelines should
have little effect, as the routes will follow closely the existing pipelines for the
phase 1 project and so the additional impacts will be extremely limited. The
impacts of the transmission line and substation works associated with this
project are the subject of Part B of this report and are not considered further
here.
7.1.1.60 The main impacts incurred by Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase extension
project to terrestrial ecology are that the extension of ash lagoon will ultimately
destroy the vegetation in an area of 0.47 km2.
7.1.1.61 The survey made for the ecological situation of the plants to be destroyed,
showed that the flora is typical of the region to surrounding vegetation, without
any rare or precious flora.  The vegetation is dominated by secondary
woodland and plantations.
7.1.1.62 The power plant vegetation plan requires the front of the plant (all around
the principal plant buildings, coal yard periphery and living quarters) to be
planted in a co-ordinated way, to integrate with the general arrangement and
building style.
-  At the sides of roads in plant area, planting mainly with evergreen trees
and hedges, with inter-planting with some omamental trees.
-  Around the principal plant buildings, with a lot of underground pipelines
and outgoing cables, planting should be restricted to low growing and
shallow rooted hedges and oleander etc.
-  The ground surface in the plant area should be paved and integrated with
a wide covering of strong growing turf.
-  Increasing the density of trees planted around the plant boundary, which
are favourable for providing shelter from wind and heat and reducing dust,
so as to maintain a good living environment.
7.1.1.63 The entire plant area should be at least 15% vegetated.
7.1.1.64 The extension of power plant will incur negligible impact to terrestrial
7-9



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
animals and to protect terrestrial plants is also to protect terrestrial animal.
* Visual Impact
7.1.1.65 The plant area layout and the colour scheme of structures should co-
ordinate with the surroundings as much as possible.
7.1.1.66 The power plant should consider planting and adding to existing, evergreen
woods, not only for the plant area and surroundings, but also for the ash dam
and lagoon. The dam revetment should be planted with turf, as is the case
with the existing dam (see photograph 3-6).
7.1.1.67 The power plant and ash lagoon extension and pipeline outside the plant
area, should minimise destruction of woodland and semi-natural vegetation.
Soil and water conservation measures should be taken to prevent erosion.
7.1.2 Construction Period
7.1.2.1 Environmental management during construction will be the responsibility of
the Environmental Department, based on the existing phase 1 system. As
discussed in section 7.1.1, this department will only require a small increase in
staff numbers to provide an adequate environmental monitoring and
management system.
* Atmospheric Pollution
7.1.2.2 Timely removal of construction rubbish and refuse will help prevent dust
emissions and generation of smell during construction.
7.1.2.3 In addition, provisions should be made to minimise the amount of soil and
dirt tracked onto roads by construction vehicles. This should include the
provision of a wheel wash for vehicles leaving the site. Also provision should
be made for cleaning of roadways used by construction traffic and also routing
vehicles to minimise nuisance to residential areas.
* Water Pollution
7.1.2.4 The surface water drainage produced during construction should be treated
by settlement. Both this and the domestic sewage from construction workers
is to be put into the treatment system of Leiyang Power Plant 1st phase
project.
* Noise
7-10



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
7.1.2.5 The major sound sources during power plant construction are from
construction machines and communication and transportation with noise level
generally approximately 90-130dB(A).
7.1.2.6 Prevention and control measures are:
-   Adopting construction equipment and technologies of low noise generation.
-    Controlling the operating time, to have high noise equipment avoid as much as
possible night operation so satisfying the requirement of relevant criteria and
regulation.
7.2  Environmental Monitoring
7.2.1 The proposed environmental monitoring to be conducted for the phase 2
development is summarised in Table 7.2-1.
7.2.2 There is an existing system of environmental management and monitoring in
place for the phase 1 development. The only monitoring requirement is to
ensure that personnel continue to be sufficiently well resourced and trained to
carry out their role efficiently. Thus the environmental performance of the
power station in general should be the subject of regular management review.
7.2.3 A number of mitigation features, including stack height, provision of bunds for
oil and bulk chemical storage, and design of cooling water and ash disposal
systems, are a simple matter of ensuring that the design and construction are
in accordance with the mitigation requirements. Essentially this is a quality
assurance matter for the design and construction process.
7.2.4 In order to guarantee the average sulphur content in 2nd phase project coal to
be 0.36% and that in 1st phase project coal to be 0.39%, the Leiyang power
plant should:
-  Carry out coal quality analysis (mainly of basic sulphur content and low
heating value) for every batch of coal entering plant.
-  Install continuous stack gas monitoring for S02. This is a requirement of
the Chinese regulations relating to new power plant (GB13223-1996).
This will not permit any operational control of S02 emissions, these being
entirely dependent on coal quality. However, the data will provide a cross
check that the coal supplied is consistently of the correct quality.
7.2.5 As well as continuous monitoring of stack emissions of S02, particulate and
NOx emissions should also be monitored continuously. These should all have
7-11



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
readings in the control room, with alarms set at levels to give waming that
required emission standards are being approached or exceeded.  Unit
operators should then be provided with procedures to rectify any emissions
outside of the required standards, for example by rectifying faults on ESPs or
in last resort by shedding load.
7.2.6 On-line stack gas monitoring of particulate emissions is based on an optical
density methodology.  This needs to be calibrated against actual TSP
measurements across a range of emission values. The calibration will depend
on coal quality and particle size distribution. Therefore, instruments should be
calibrated when installed and checked periodically.
7.2.7 It is also anticipated that the Environmental Agency will continue with its
routine checks on emission levels using its own standard methodologies.
7.2.8 In addition to the emissions monitoring, it is proposed to continue
measurements of ambient SO2, NO, N02, TSP and PM10 levels at two
monitoring sites - upwind and downwind of the prevailing wind direction. This
will provide long term evidence as to the impacts arising from operation of the
power plant on the local environment.
7.2.9 Wastewater streams should be monitored on a regular basis to ensure correct
operation of the pollution control measures. Table 7.2-2 lists the parameters to
be measured and Table 7.2-3 gives the monitoring positions. Methods to be
used and limits of detection for waste water monitoring are given in Table
4.3.2-2.
7.2.10 Two monitoring wells are to be established near the ash yard periphery, at
Lianjiachong and the Municipal gardening farm, with monitoring 4 times
annually (once a season). Methods to be used and limits of detection are
given in Table 4.3.3-1.
7.2.11 Noise monitoring is mainly a concem for the plant area and residential
quarter. The monitoring frequency is one a year. Monitoring should be when
approaching the annual average load, monitoring both in day time and at night
(with day time monitoring generally at 08:00-12:00, night time at 22:00-05:00).
7.2.12 The arrangement of monitoring points is to have the plant area and residential
quarter divided into a 100mxlOOm grid. In measuring, for continuous noise,
one measurement to be taken at each monitoring point. For intermittent noise,
readings to be taken every five seconds, for 100 readings, levels then to be
averaged. In the residential quarter and sensitive areas outside plant, fixed
7-12



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                     Power Consult
monitoring points should be established.
7.2.13 Some mitigation measures require monitoring by means of simple
management review of progress. This includes such aspects as planting of
tree screens, ensuring that rail is used for fuel deliveries, progress with ash
utilisation, environmental emergency response provisions / systems and
general site housekeeping standards.
7.2.14 The effectiveness of the various measures to control fugitive dust (tree
screens, wheel wash facilities, coal handling plant etc.) should be monitored.
Monitoring points should be installed in the oid plant area, extension plant area
and residential quarter. The locations selected should be typical in reflecting
the average quality of the atmospheric environment in the plant area and
residential quarter. The immediate surroundings should be open terrain, with
distance from buildings not lower than twice the building height and steering
clear of low stacks, construction sites, coal yard and highway etc.
7.2.15 TSP at the ash lagoon and vicinity of coal yard should also be monitored.
7.2.16 The environmental monitoring and supervising items during construction
include TSP, water discharges, mud and construction rubbish etc. noise and
conservation of soil and water.
7.2.17 The principal instruments and monitoring equipment to be provided are shown
in Table 7.2-4
7.2.18 The contract for construction of the power plant project should include clauses
concerning relevant environmental protection and about situations to be
supervised implemented by local environmental protection department and
power plant. This should ensure that the daily life of residents in the vicinity of
construction site not to be seriously disturbed.
7.3 Responsibilities For Mitigation and Monitoring
7.3.1 During the initial operational period, the National Environmental Protection
Agency is responsible for checking all mitigation measures and monitoring
systems.   This  includes  all equipment, instruments  and  institutional
arrangements. This comprises a completion check for the acceptance of the
environmental protection and control equipment.
7.3.2 Following the completion check, the power station is responsible for operation
and supervision of all mitigation measures and environmental monitoring. The
7-13



Hunan Power Development Project (Part A)                    Power Consult
plant is required to set up its own Environmental Management Department to
carry out these responsibilities. Day to day management of the various pollution
abatement systems will be undertaken by the relevant operational departments,
but overall environmental performance will be monitored by the Environmental
Management Department.
7.3.3 The local Environmental Protection Bureau then has the responsibility of
enforcing the relevant discharge and emission standards. To this end they will
institute their own periodic monitoring and audit arrangements.
7.4 Training Programme
7.4.1 Located in the central and westem part of China, Leiyang Power Plant has less
experience of environmental management and monitoring compared with its
counterparts in eastem and coastal areas.
7.4.2 HEPC are already carrying out training in Environmental Management Systems
(e.g. the ISO 14001 environmental management standard). This will include
staff from Leiyang.
7.4.3 One area where expertise will need to be further developed is in the operation
of continuous ambient and stack gas monitoring of TSP, S02 and NOx.
7.4.4 Following consultation with the World Bank, it is proposed to carry out training
in continuous monitoring.  This will include training of two environmental
managers - for two man months at a cost of $14,000. In addition, four
environmental technical engineers will be trained, again for two man months at a
cost of $14000. An outline of the proposed training programme is given in Table
7.4-1

APPENDIX C: CONSULTATION PROCESS
C.1 EA Preparation - Power Consult
C. 1.1 PowerConsult, a part of PowerGen PLC, was asked to collaborate with Hunan
Electric Power Company (HEPC), Hunan Electric Power Design Institute
(HEPDI) and Nanjing Environmental Protection Research Institute (NEPRI) in
the production of an Environmental Assessment of the Leiyang Phase II Power
Plant Project. Power Consult assembled a team, consisting of Dr Keith Sadler,
Dr Tim Hill and Mr Colin Stocks to undertake this work. Dr Sadler and Mr
Stocks undertook a field visit to China, during the period October 14 1997 to
November 6 1997. The purpose of this visit was to obtain background
information, resolve outstanding questions and liase with NEPRI and HEPC
and local coal mining personnel in collating the required information to
complete the EA. report.
C.1.2 The resulting EA report relies very heavily on the substantial amount of work
assembled by NEPRI in collaboration with various other Chinese institutions
who have worked on the project.  The role of Power Consult has been to
collate this information into World Bank required format and to 'peer review' the
available information, particularly with emphasis on aquatic ecology, stack gas
emission impacts and mining safety issues.
C.1.3 In addition, Dr Sadler visited the China Institute of Water Resources and
Hydropower Research (IWHR) in Beijing. IWHR were primarily responsible for
undertaking the modelling studies of the cooling water intake and discharge
and their potential impacts on Leishui River.
C.1.4 The following lists the main participants in this process:
*    Power Consult
Dr Keith Sadler: Project leader with specialism in ecological impacts.
Dr Tim Hill: Air dispersion modelling I stack gas emission impact.
Mr Colin Stocks (from International Mining Consultants Ltd): Coal mining
safety.
*    HEPC
Mr. Xiao Qibiao: Chief World Bank Loan Office Director Senior Engineer
responsible for Phase 2 Project

C.2 Site Visits
C.2. 1 The existing Leiyang Power Plant, Phase 1 development (2 x 200 MW) was
visited. This enabled inspection of the facilities, many of which will be shared
with the Phase 2 development, and the collection of additional information
relating to monitoring data and other matters. This visit included inspection of
the ash disposal area and also two of the proposed substation sites (Hengen
and Changsha) and an existing operational substation (Motang)
C.2.2 Mr. Stocks, visited two of the three coal mines that will supply the Leiyang
Phase 2 development. These mines were the Baisha and Xifengdu mines and
the visits included inspection of the underground workings.  In addition
consultations were held with responsible engineers from these and also the
Jiahe mine.
C.3 EA Consultations
C.3.1 During the preparation of the EA and development of the project as a whole,
great importance has been attached to gathering the opinions of all circles in
society about social economic development and environmental impacts etc. A
range of public participation programmes was arranged and opinions fed back
into the development proposals.  The principle environmental specialists
consulted are indicated in Table C.3-1.
C.3.2 The Leiyang Power Plant firstly solicited the opinions on 2nd phase extension
project from the State, Hunan province and Leiyang municipal govemment
departments at all levels. This particularly included those from environmental
protection departments. Following this, views were solicited from all circles in
society on environmental impacts incurred by power plant construction. To do
this, a consultation symposium was called for Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase
project on environmental protection issues. Public opinion was also surveyed
by questionnaire.
C.3.3 The National Environmental Protection Agency invited environmental
protection experts of wide range specialities to examine the outline
environmental impact assessment for Leiyang power plant 2nd phase
extension project in detail. Following that, the Environmental Protection Office
of the Ministry of Electric Power sponsored a pre-examination meeting for the
project (2 x 300MW class) Environmental Impact Report.
C.3.4 A 'Consultation symposium on Hunan Province Leiyang power plant 2nd
phase project environmental protection issues" was held on the 21st March,
C-3



Hunan Power Development Project   APPENDIX C                  Power Consult
1997 at Leiyang Power Plant. The symposium was chaired by Leiyang Power
Plant. Participants were from Hengyang Municipal Environmental Protection
Bureau, Leiyang Municipal govemment, People's Congress, People's Political
Consultative Commission, Women's Federation, Environmental Protection
Bureau, Planning Commission, Economic Commission, and relevant
representatives from surrounding villages and towns around power plants,
totalling 45 persons (See Table C.3-2).
C.3.5 Hearing a report on the 2nd phase project construction proposals and detailed
presentations conceming predicted environmental impacts, the participants
discussed thoroughly the necessity of the project, the issues of pollution
prevention and control, ash yard, water sources and environmental impact etc.
The contents of the symposium were recorded as follows:
C.3.6 All the participants acknowledged unanimously that there is a severe supply
shortage of electric power in Hunan province, especially in central and
southern Hunan. The coal resource in Leiyang municipality is abundant.
Leiyang Power Plant, burning local coal, is a pit mouth one and hence
minimises transportation requirements. The site has excellent potential for
expansion. The extension project is well positioned to exploit local coal
sources. By alleviating the imbalance between electricity supply and demand
and hence facilitating local industrial and agricultural production, living
standards in the area will be enhanced. The general benefits were recognised
by all participants. A wish was expressed, for the project to be started and
completed early and hence to produce expected results as soon as possible.
C.3.7 The participants also acknowledged that the extension project would inevitably
bring some adverse environmental impacts. However, it was considered that
the project would adopt necessary and reliable mitigation and control
measures to minimise pollution. It was believed that, under the supervision
and management of the local environmental protection department, the power
plant extension will not only play a role in generating economic benefit, but
would also promote local and regional environmental protection work by acting
as an example of a large industrial plant adopting high standards of
environmental management.
C.3.8 Aiming at soliciting a wider cross section of opinion, a questionnaire has been
distributed on various occasions during the public consultation process. The
questionnaire comprises 10 questions, designed to solicit opinions relevant to
the local economy, the necessity of project construction and those of
environmental and personal impact etc. The questions used are given in Table  Et

C.3.9 Of 36 surveying forms distributed, 33 were returned. The statistics of the
returned forms were:
-  33.8% thought the local economy to be very good, 36.4% relatively good
and 33.3% ordinary;
-  97.0%  of those surveyed alleged the main problem  affecting the
development of local economy is electric power supply, 3% though other
problems;
-  All of those surveyed thought the construction of Leiyang Power Plant 2nd
phase project to be very necessary and would promote development of the
local economy.
-  After the completion of the project, 73.7% of those surveyed were most
concemed by economic development; 27.3%, employment opportunities
and income increase; and 34.2%, environmental improvement.
-  With respect to the status quo of local regional environment, 36.4%
thought it very good; 33.3% relatively good, 24.2% ordinary; 6.1%
relatively bad.
-  Among  the  environmental issues, main  concems were, 57.6%
atmosphere, 30% water, 36.4% suspended particles, and 24.2% noise.
-   After the completion of the project, 51.5% thought the environment to be
improved and 48.5% to remain the same,
-  100% of those surveyed held that the construction of Leiyang power plant
will be very favourable or relatively favourable for the reasonable
exploitation and utilisation of local coal resources.
-  78.8% of those surveyed held that the project construction will enhance
the employment opportunities and social status of women; only 21.2%
thought it would bring little change.
-  97.0%  of those surveyed held that its construction will promote the
improvement of communications; only 3.0% thought it will have no effect.

1.0   INTRODUCTION
The People's Republic of China (PRC) is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal.
In 1996 the main coal statistics were:
Total Production   1.350 Mt
Total Exports      28.58 Mt
Total Imports        2.1 Mt
Approximately 300 Mt/a is produced by surface mining operations, the remainder 473 Mt/a is
produced by 600 State owned underground rnines and 577 Mt/a is produced by 80,000 small
Provincial and County operated underground mines. About 35% of coal consumption
(472 Mt/a) is for power -generation (UK 75%: USA 85%) whereas 45% (608 Mt/a) is for
industrial heating boilers, 10%  (135 Mt/a) for households and 10%  (135 Mt/a) for
metallurgical industries.
The State owned mines are operated under licence from the Ministry of Coal Industry (MOCI)
in 29 regions by 103 Coal Bureaux.
This report ascertains the Occupational Health and Safety Status of the State Owned mines
Xifengdu, Jiaha, and Baisha which will be supplying anthracite coal to the Leiyang Power
Station Project situated in the Hunan Province of China
1.1   [nternational Mining Consultants Limited

In this regard they have carried out major feasibility studies and prepared bankable documents,
due diligence and stock market flotation reviews (technical advice or reports), mine
development, planning and management, technical and financial audits.
IMCL operate through a number of divisions which relate generally to the type of service
provided.
1.2    Hunan Electrical Power Company Project
Hunan Electrical Power Company (HEPC) proposes to construct a 600 MW (two 300 MW
boilers) anthracite fired power station on the outskirts of Leiyang City, along the edge of the
Leishui River and adjacent to an existing 400 MW (two 200 MW boilers) power station.
HEPC will also close ten small inefficient polluting boilers (8 x 25 MW and 2 x 50 MW) at
several other locations in Hunan Province. In addition HEPC will construct two 220 kV
transmission lines and associated substations. One 300 km line to connect the privately
developed Changsha Build Operate Transfer (BOT) Project to the Hunan Power Grid and the
other 200 km line to connect the Leiyang Project to the Hunan Power Grid.
The project is in the second phase of what is likely to be a three phase programme as there
may be an additional thermnal power station utilising imported coal. -Anthracite fuel for the
project will be supplied by Xifengdu, Jiahe, and Baisha coal mines. Fuel delivery is mainly by
rail although some fuel is currently delivered by truck.
In accordance with Chinese environmental regulations, an Environmental Assessment (EA)
was prepared for the power generation facility by Nanjing Environmental Protection Research
Institute (NEPRI). HEPC requested World Bank financing for this project and in accordance
with World Bank policies and procedures (OD 4.01, Environmental Assessment) the project
was rated "Category A" and an EA must be prepared to World Bank specifications.
1.3   Scope of Work
World Bank environmental specialists reviewed the draft EA prepared by NEPRI and for a
number of reasons concluded that the document required strengthening to meet World Bank
EA standards together with an independent evaluation of the ecological impacts to be
anticipated from the discharges of the heated cooling water, and the occupational health and
safety status of the mines supplying the anthracite fuel. Chinese officials agreed to the
recommendation that an international consultant with substantial relevant experience be
engaged to prepare a well written English text EA document incorporating all project
components (generation, transmission, coal mine safety, and boiler retirement) that will meet
World Bank technical requirements.
The main objective of this work program is to produce an EA report for the Hunan Power
Development Project of outstanding quality in strict accordance with World Bank
requirements. The EA report is to be based on the draft EA report already prepared by
Powergen Power Consult                           International Mining Consultants Limited
004011                                                               November 1997

NEPRI and thus should be completed to an acceptable final draft, in approximately three
months, by December 1997.
IMCL's objective was to visit the three mines supplying anthracite fuel to Leiyang Power
Station and investigate on behalf of the World Bank, their status with regard to Health and
Safety.
1.4    Overall Conclusions of the Consultants
Underground visits, and meetings with the mine directors where held at Xifengdu, Jiahg, and
Baisha mnines, which are the three mines that will supply the proposed Leiyang Power Station
Project. The objective of the visits and meetings was to ascertain the mine's Occupational
Health and Safety Status.. The Consultants overall conclusions and impressions gained were:
 Management are well organised and informed.
* Coal Mine Regulations are fully understood and implemented.
* Underground housekeeping is good.
- Fire-fighting systems are in place and maintained in good working order.
* Mines Rescue teams and specialist rescue equipment are available at all mines.
 There are no major methane gas (C-4) or carbon monoxide (CO) problems.
 Ventilation in the mines is adequate but there is a need to direct more air to the working
areas.
* Spontaneous combustion does not constitute a high risk.
* Water is only a nuisance issue and is no major problem.
* Face and roadway conditions are good.
. Coal dust was well controlled, and the mines had no problems with methane/coal dust
outbursts.

2.0 MINING OPERATIONS
The geological structure of a coal seam normally dictates the mining method best suited for
coal extraction. Anthracite coal is a hard coal with the highest fixed-carbon content and the
lowest amount of volatile matter of all types of coal. Anthracite was formed primarily at the
end of the Carboniferous Period by earth movements that generated heat and pressure which
transformed the carbonaceous material then present in the earth. The Hunan Anthracite
Coalfield has undergone geological disturbances during the transformation of the coal seams,
so much so that the coal measures strata is steeply inclined. Seams dip range is 22° to 370
which is not suitable for mechanised mining, so coal is worked using drilling, blasting and
handfilling mining methods. The mining methods employed at all three mines were very
similar, and are:
2.1    Main Level Roadways
The main levels are driven between seams in solid rock strata, approximately 50 m apart
vertically, dependant upon the dip angle of the coal seam. They rise  at gradients suitable
for the use of battery powered locomotives, and allowing for the natural drainage of any mine
water to the pit bottom pumps. The roadways are supported by roof bolts which are
interlaced with a matrix of steel wire then systematically sprayed with- concrete to provide a
smooth lined roadway. Longwall roadways are accessed from the main levels by cross
measure drifts which may be graded up or down, depending upon the circumstances.
Longwall roadways are driven in the coal seam and are supported by either arch or square
profile steel girders. Having been subjected to very little strata loading the roadways have
maintained a good profile throughout their length.
2.2   Principal Production
Principal production is from handfilled longwall faces, with an average face length of 60-80 m
dependant upon the dip angle of the coal seam. The mining method used, is to drive the main
and return roadways in seam anproximately 300 m in length, the return gate being the higher
of the two. A longwall face is then established by heading in the coal seam to connect the
main and return gates. The longwall face is supported by link-bars and hydraulic props.
During mining operations the iongwall face is systematically advanced in 1 metre increments,
starting at the tail gate end. First by drilling and blasting the coal, then hand loading the coal
down the longwall face delivering it onto a series of short, flexible chain conveyors installed in
the main gate. Roof supports are advanced as the cycle of operations progresses down the
longwall towards the main gate. When a I metre increment has been extracted throughout the
whole length of the longwall face, then the cycle starts again.

2.3    Coal Transport
The main coal transport system underground is by mine cars of I t capacity. Coal is delivered
from the longwall face chain conveyors into the mine cars, which are hauled by battery
powered locomotives to the pit bottom. The mine cars are then wound out of the mine and
the coal emptied by a tippler on the surface. The empty mine cars are then wound back
underground.
At Jiaha mine the I t capacity mine cars are emptied into an underground bunker in the pit
bottom, coal from the bunker is then loaded into 6 t mine cars for winding out of the mine.
2.4    Coal Delivered to Leiyang Power Plant
1.67 Mt/a of anthracite coal is supplied by rail to Leiyang Power Station from the three mines,
in the following quantities:-
Mine                      t/a
Baisha                 1,200,000

3.0    SAFETY AUDIT
Five kinds of disasters are associated to the Chinese mining industry: flood, fire, explosion,
roof collapse and methane/coal-dust outbursts. The national guidelines emphasis Safety First,
encouraging mine owners and directors to consider all aspects of safety during their daily
mining operations, with the prevention of accidents being a very high profile activity. The
principal prevention measures currently exercised are for explosion, fire and methane/coal-dust
outburst. Ventilation requirements are being up-rated especially as the mine workings get
deeper. Methane monitoring is now common practice with automatic cut off of electrical
equipment as pre-set limits are reached.
Enquiries into accidents are jointly carried out by the Departments of Labour, and Public
Security and Prosecutions. Corporate and personnel liability may result in fines or punitive
measures.
From the figures given in Section 1, for each individual State Owned Underground Mine there
are 133 other underground mines. The poor mining accident statistics associated with PRC
mining operations are mainly attributed to the latter sector of mining.
To ascertain the Health and Safety Status of the three State Owned mines, Baisha, Xifengdu,
and Jiahc, the Consultants investigated the mines management's, organisation and control with
regard to flood, fire, explosion, roof collapse and methane/coal-dust outburst.
3.1   Flood
The sudden inrush of water or material that will flow when wet has always been a potential
hazard during mining operations. Prevention of such inrushes is the duty imposed by PRC
mining regulations on owners and directors. Each of the mines visited had an Operations
Technology Department responsible for the management and control of water within the mines
working area. There are four possible ways that underground mine workings can become
flooded, and the Consultants investigated the mines organisation in respect of these, namely
water from aquifers, large accumulations of water within the rnining area, the sudden rupture
of water pipe lines or associated equipment and insufficient pumping capacity.
3.1.1 Aquifers
There are no major water aquifers associated with the current rmine workings.
3.1.2 Large Accumulations of Water
The Local Coal Bureaux is responsible for supplying to the mines Operational Technology
Department the location and size of all abandoned and operational mining activities, and any
large surface accumulations of water within the mines working area.

3176/3                                                                November 1997



Safety Audit                                                               Page 3-2
Mining plans showing all possible sources of water accumulations are kept at the mines,
updated as new information becomes available. Mining operations are planned to protect the
mine from any dangers associated with such water accumulations.
Large surface water accumulations are not underworked, a pillar of support being left to
protect them.
A barrier of strata not to be mined is left between current mine workings and any abandoned
mine workings. The size of the barrier is calculated using a formula laid down in the PRC
mining regulations.
At the mines visited the depth of the mine workings below the surface was between 300 and
400 m, with private mines operating at a much shallower depth. The mine plans inspected
showed the location of all possible water accumulations and the protective barriers. The size
of protective barriers between current mine workings and abandoned mine workings varied in
size. The size of the barrier is calculated according to the following criteria:-
* If the abandoned mine workings cannot be accessed in any way, then calculations would be
made taking into account the type of strata between the abandoned mine workings and
current mine workings, and water pressure within the abandoned mine workings assuming
the workings to be full of water.
* If the abandoned mine workings are in close proximity to the current mine workings, then a
bore-hole would be drilled to access the abandoned mnine workings at their lowest point to
drain any water present. Any water drainage is strictly controlled by the Operational
Technology Department.
. If ready access is available into the abandoned mine workings and the workings are
physically examined.
3.1.3 Water Pipes or Tanks
The sudden rupture of water pipes or storage tanks can flood areas of the mine, cutting ofF
access and ventilation. Preventative measures to minimise this risk are laid down in the PRC
mine regulations, these requirements are:
A surface tank of sufficient size to supply water for both dust suppression and fire fighting
shall be installed. The tank shall be of sound construction and situated away from the entrance
of the mine, so as to prevent an inrush of water into the mine should the tank rupture.
Water pipes used to supply water to the workinz areas of the mine shall be capable of
withstanding any pressure head developed within the pipeline. The size of the pipes installed
shall be capable of delivering a set amount of water to all parts of the mine, in the quantities as
stated in the PRC mnining regulations.

A water meter shall be fitted to monitor the amount of water entering the mine at all times.
Any sudden increase in the amount of water entering to be investigated and rectified.
At the mines visited a concrete water tank situated away from the mines entrance was in use.
Around the perimeter of the tank was a drainage ditch connected to the mines surface drainage
system designed to control overflow water or water from a sudden rupture of the tank. A
water meter measuring the flow of water from the tank into the mine was in place fitted with
an alarm, which would operate if the water entering the mine expected a pre-set amount. An
emergency shut off valve was located near to the water flow meter, closure of this valve
would stop the flow of water into the mine. All water pipe lines, and associated valves and
joints observed at the mines were well supported throughout their length with no visual signs
of leaks. They were normally of 120 mm diameter which is quite adequate to deliver the
quantities of water required for fire-fighting and dust suppression.
3.1.4 Pumping Capacity
During the bore-hole exploration of any intended mining area, water content within that
proposed working area is analysed. The mine design engineers use this information to
calculate the anticipated amount of water likely to be encountered during mining operations.
Tanks, pumps and pipes will be purchased and installed during the construction of the mine, to
handle all calculated water flows, providing also for any spare capacity that may be required.
PRC mining regulations state that the mines shall have pumping equipment installed to operate
in the sequence of-one pump running, one pump standby and one pump spare. The tanks and
pipes installed shall be capable of handling water flows consistent with all three pumps running
simultaneously. Pumping equipment and normal water extraction's for the three mnines are as
follows:-
Mine           Normal Water         Single Pump        Total Pumping
Flow M3IH         Capacity M3/H       Capacity M3/H
Baisha                     370                  850                2550
Jiahe                      430                  900                2700
Xifengdu                    190                 500                1500
At the mines visited underground water flows seen were quite normal, created by surface run-
off or water draining out of abandoned mine workings. The water source into the mine
workings was along natural fissures, mainly associated with fault planes.
3.2   Fire
Prevention is the best means of dealing with fire, but if a fire does occur, the equipment to
extinguish the fire and people trained in its use are an essential part of a mines organisation.

During the mine visits and discussions with mine management the Consultants looked for
verification that emergency organisation and equipment for the imnmediate response to
underground fires was available and that the following structures were in place for the
elimination of potential fire risks.
3.2.1 Fire Prevention
At all three mines an engineer was statutorily appointed under PRC mining regulations, who's
duties and responsibilities included the monitoring and control of Ventilation and Methane, (a
potential fire hazard), fire-fighting training and the supply and maintenance of fire-fighting
equipment.
3.2.2 Fire-fighting Training
All workmen are initially trained in fire fighting, with refresher training given annually.
3.2.3 Flammable Material
All flammable materials are stored separately to other materials, and flammable materials used
underground are strictly controlled.
3.2.4 Fire Fighting Equipment
A large water tank is situated on the mine surface. The size of the tank and the water storage
capability is as specified by PRC mining regulations. A water pipe-line connected to the tank,
capable of delivering water to all parts of the mine was installed. Along the length of the
pipeline at distances not exceeding 250 m there were hose connections.
Supplies of hoses, extinguishers and sand are kept in emergency stores at the mines surface,
underground at pit bottom and in all major electrical substations.
3.2.5 Early Warning Systems
Oxygen, methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are monitored at the mine main fan.
Any fluctuations from the established normal readings for the mine are fully investigated and
any necessary actions taken.
3.2.6 Mines Rescue
Each mine has two fully trained rescue teams available on the surface at all times, with access
to teams from other mines should an emergency occur.
Each mine has specialist emergency equipment stores, and all rescue men are fully trained in
the use of that equipment.                                                                 E

All people entering the mine are issued with a self-rescuer. A self-rescuer is a personal piece
of equipment normally carried attached to the belt used for carrying an electrical cap lamp. In
the event of an underground fire, the self-rescuer allows workmen to breath in mine
atmosphere contaminated by the products of combustion. The life of a self-rescuer is up to
one hour, enabling workmen to get to a part of the mine which has clean air.
3.3   Methane Gas
Methane is an inflammable mine gas given off from coal during mining operations, it will
readily burn when exposed to an open flame. If the percentage of methane in the mine air
reaches 5% to 15% it will explode violently.   The engineer in charge of ventilation is
responsible for the monitoring and control of methane within the mine workings.  The
Consultants investigated the mines organisation and control of methane in respect of
ventilation, automatic monitoring and methane outbursts.
3.3.1 Ventilation
PRC mining regulations state that it is the duty of the Mine Director to secure that there is
adequate ventilation in all parts of the mine to dilute gases that are inflammable or noxious so
as to render them harmless. At the mines visited ventilation plans and records are kept
showing the quantities of air flow throughout the mine. Monthly air samples are taken at
specific points around the mine and their analysis recorded in a book. Air samples monitor
Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Methane.
Mine officials were appointed to be in charge of sections of the mnines. Their duties included
the monitoring of ventilation and the detection of any accumulations of methane.
Examinations were carried out at intervals not exceeding four hours at all places were men
regularly work.
3.3.1 Automatic Monitoring
Automatic monitoring for methane was installed throughout the mines visited, specifically at
places were coal is worked. If the percentage of methane reaches 1 % then all electrical
power is switched off. If the percentage of methane reaches 1.5 % then all workmen are
withdrawn. In both cases the ventilation quantity is increased to dilute the methane gas in the
effected area.
During the formation of anthracite coal methane is given off therefore methane content within
the anthracite coal measures normaly is low. At Xifengdu and Jiaha mines the nornal
methane content within the general body of the mine air were less than 0.5 %, but at Baisha
mine the normal methane levels were found to be much higher. The current mine workings at
Baisha mine are overlain by a mudstone 0.05 to 4 m thick, which prevented some of the
methane from being driven off during the formation of the coal, it was quite normal after
shotfiring operations for methane levels to reach over I %. To control and reduce the amount

of methane present within the general body of the mine air more ventilation is passed through
working longwall faces. To assist mine management in the control of methane content within
the mine air, methane levels at certain points in the mine are electrically transmitted to the
main control room on the mines surface. During discussions with directors of Baisha mine it
was established that increased ventilation through longwall faces, was their main means of
ensuring methane content within the mine air was maintained within the permitted limits. In
some cases if the amount of methane being given off during longwall face operations was high,
then methane drainage techniques would be used, achieved by drilling holes up to 10 m in
length in the coal seam ahead of the working face.
3.3.2 Methane Outburst
During the formation of anthracite coal, earth movements generated heat and pressure, and
sometimes reservoirs of methane gas under great pressure are locked into the coal measures
strata. When mining operations breach these reservoirs then methane gas, normally together
with large amounts of very fine coal dust can suddenly flow into the mine workings
(methane/coal-dust outburst). It was established through discussions that the mines had not
been subjected to any such outbursts, and the bore-hole information deemed the mines to be
low risk with regard to methane/coal dust outbursts.
3.4   Roof Collapse
The Mine Director is responsible for ensuring that the mine workings are systematically
supported as mining operations are carried out. PRC mining regulations provide a formula for
calculating the density of support dependent upon depth and strata. The Mine Director is also
responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate supply of equipment and materials necessary
to provide that support.
3.4.1 Roadway Support
Roadway supports at all mines were of a similar nature. The main level roadways were all
driven in solid strata and concrete lined, all other roadways being supported by steel girders.
The roadways observed were very well constructed and showed no signs of deterioration.
Support rules stating the type and structure of support to be used, the distance between those
supports, the maximum distance that can be advanced beyond the last permanent support set,
and signed by the director of the mine, where displayed at all drivage sites.
3.4.2 Longwall Support
Longwall supports were link bars and hydraulic props. The seam section being extracted at all
mines visited was 2.2 m. Props and bars were systematically advanced as the coal was
removed to provide support to the newly exposed roof of the coal seam. As the prop and bar
supports were advanced the roof behind the working face was allowed to collapse, maintaining
the width of the working face at approximately 3 m. Support rules stating the type of prop

and bar to be used, the distance between rows of bars and props, and the maximum distance
that they can be advanced beyond the last permanent support set, and signed by the director of
the rnine were displayed at the entrance to the longwall face visited.
3.5    Coal Dust
Coal dust explosions, normally initiated by methane explosions are the most violent type of
underground explosion known. In the past whole mines have been destroyed by coal dust
explosions. Coal dust inhaled be miners can cause pneumoconiosis and other respiratory
problems. To minimise the risk of coal dust explosions, and also to protect workmen strict
controls are exercised to minimise the amount of coal dust in the mine air. The ventilation
engineer is responsible for the monitoring and controlling of coal dust.
The Consultants discussed these controls with mine directors and the ventilation engineer
responsible for the monitoring and controlling of coal dust, paying particular attention to dust
suppression, dust samples and the protection provided for mineworkers.
3.5.1 Dust Suppression
Coal dust suppression is achieved by wetting the coal during mining operations and then
ensuring that it remains damp during transportation out of the mine.
After shotfiring the coal is sprayed with water to minimise the amount of dust which may be
given off whilst the coal is transported along the coal face.
Coal from the coal face is transported along the flexible chain conveyors to the loading point.
During loading operations any coal dust is suppressed by the use of fine mist water sprays.
During transport the coal is damp and therefore very little dust is raised.
The coal transport roads seen had regular cross-sections throughout their length, therefore
there were no areas of high air velocity resulting from the sudden reduction in cross-section of
the roadways, which would in turn give vulnerability for coal dust to be raised into the air as
coal carrying vehicles pass through.
3.5.2 Dust Samples
Dust samples are taken each month and analysed for the amount of coal dust in the mine air.
These samples are taken on the return side of coal mining operations, and also along roadways
used for the transport of coal. PRC mining regulations state the permitted limits, if the
samples exceed those iimits then action must be taken by the management to comply with the
permitted limits.

4.0 MINING AUTHORISATIONS
The coal industry is governed principally by the Law of the People's Republic of China. The
Coal Law which was promulgated on 29 August 1996, came into effect on the 1" December
1996. Every coal mine in the PRC is required to obtain a mining permit and a processing
permit in order to entitle them to carry out mining operations. The Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources (MGMR) and the Ministry of Coal Industry (MOCI) are responsibly for
the granting of mining permits and processing permits. The Coal Law has stipulated among
other things, the qualifications required for carrying on coal mining business, the safety
requirements for coal mines and the protection of coal mining areas.
Each of the three mines have obtained valid mining and processing permnits entitling it to carry
on mining and associated operations. Details are summarised in the table below

Observaions and Recommendations                                          Page 6-1
6.0 OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The following observations and recommendations relate to all mines visited by the
Consultants.
Underground infrastructure is outdated but adequate for current operations. If in the fature
mechanised operation were considered, then larger roadways will be required for the
transportation and installation of equipment required for mechanised mining operations.
Ventilation quantities in some parts of the mine were quite sluggish. The whole ventilation
system should be analysed with a view to directing more ventilation through parts of the mine
where men regularly work, to provide a better working environment.
During mine visits it was observed that women and children not employed at the mine were
allowed ready access to buildings and equipment on the mine surface. A rmines surface has
many potential hazards and non-authorised personnel should not be allowed within the
working areas.
Steps provided on inclined roadways were found to be slippery underfoot and in places parts
of the steps had broken away. The steps should be maintained in good repair and handrails
need to be provided to prevent people from stumbling and falling whilst travelling along the
roadway.
Underground roadways where men regularly pass were found to be very dark and it was
difficult to see whilst travelling, such areas should be whitened to improve visibility and the
mining enviromnent.
Underground areas where vehicles are regularly shunted, and the coupling and uncoupling of
trains takes place were again found to be very dark limniting visibility. This area should be
whitened and illuminated by the provision of permanent electrical lighting.
Protective clothing and safety equipment should be improved. At the moment workmen are
provided with wellington boots, jacket and trousers, helmet, gloves, disposable dust mask,
self-rescuer. The wellington boots are inadequate as they do not have steel toe caps to protect
the miners toes. Neither eye nor ear protective equipment is issued.
Open drainage channels could became blocked with debris creating an area where water
overflows onto the regular walkway. Where this frequently occurs the open channel should be
replacing by a piped system, to provide a continuous dry walkway.

E.1 Details Of Local Meteorology
E.1.1 Routine Meteorological Data Analysis
* Climate Characteristics
E.1.1.1 Leiyang Municipality has a typical subtropical, humid monsoon climate. In
winter, the circulation is controlled by a cold continental high atmospheric
pressure, generating a prevailing wind from the north. In summer, southerly
winds dominate under the controlling influence of subtropical high atmospheric
pressure systems. Spring and autumn, are characterised by alternating periods
of northerly and southerly winds, marking the transition between the summer
and winter seasons. Overall the climate is mild with distinct seasonal variations.
The climate is typified by sunny periods with short spells of fairly intense
precipitation. Spring temperatures are quite variable, with the summer and
autumn being the driest seasons. Temperatures during the winter can be sub-
zero.
E.1.1.2 Leiyang Municipal Meteorological Observatory is located about 1km to the
north of the plant site. Measurements have been made at this observatory for
approximately 35 years. The following is a summary of the findings averaged
over this period: annual average air temperature 17.90C, max. air temperature
40.00C, min. air temperature -7.7oC; annual average relative humidity 81.0%,
annual average evaporative loss 1457.4mm; annual average precipitation
1319.6 mm, max. precipitation recorded during any one year is 1863.5mm; min.
precipitation during any one year is 960.9mm; annual average barometric
pressure 1005.6 mb; annual average wind speed at 10m is 2.2 m/s; prevailing
wind direction is NNW; summer prevailing wind direction is SSE,and during
winter it is NNW.
* Wind Data Analysis
E.1.1.3 Table E1.1.1 shows the monthly and annual average wind speed data in the
Leiyang area as recorded by the municipal meteorological observatory over the
period 1990 to 1994. Wind data were recorded at 10m. As can be seen from
the table, the monthly average wind speed in the area does not vary very much.
The annual average wind speed is 1.6 m s-1.

E.1.1.4 Table E1.1.2 lists the frequency with which the wind blows from each
direction as a function of the wind speed. This data is for the year 1993. The
frequency of the occurrence of various wind speed categories are 19.63% for
0.5-0.9 m s-1, 30.14% for 1.0-1.9 m s , 21.75% for 2.0-2.9 m s-, 19.25% for
3.0-3.9 m s-1, 5.0% for 4.0-5.9 m s-1 and 0.67% for >6.Om s1'.
E.1.1.5 Data for the period 1990 to 1994 have been analysed in terms of the
frequency with which the wind blows from a certain direction as a function of
season. The results are presented in Table E1.1.3 and also as a set of wind
roses in Figure E1.1.1.
E.1.1.6 The influence of the monsoon is evident in Figure E1.1.1. Winter is
dominated by a NNW to N wind which blows for nearly two thirds of the season.
During the summer the situation is nearly reversed with prevailing southerly
winds dominating. The other seasons mark the transition between these two
dominating weather pattems.
-  Atmospheric Stability
E.1.1.7 Table E1.1.4 shows the result of a Pasquill stability analysis based on the
statistics of five years of data recorded by the Leiyang Municipal Meteorological
Observatory from 1990 to 1994. This type of analysis classifies the atmosphere
into 6 categories defined as strongly unstable, unstable, weakly unstable,
neutral, relatively stable and stable (known by the letters A, B, C, D, E, F
respectively). As can be seen in Table E1.1.4, neutral stratification (D) occurs
the most frequently, with a frequency of 62.0%. Stable stratification (E & F)
tends to occur at night and occurs in this case for 20.2% of the year. Unstable
stratification, which tends to produce the highest ground level concentrations
from elevated point sources, occurs at a slightly lower frequency of 17.8%.
Comparing the stability in various seasons, unstable conditions occur most often
in summer as is to be expected, since instability is dominated by solar energy
warming the ground.
Air Temperature
E.1.1.8 Table E1.1.5 records the monthly and annual average temperatures for the
period 1990 to 1994.
E.1.1.9 The average temperature in whole year is 180C. Winter temperatures
typically remain above 0°C and temperatures reach an average of 28°C in July.

* Characteristics Of The Boundary Layer In The Leiyang Region
E.1.1.10 In order to understand the characteristics of the boundary, which are
important in determining the dispersion of pollution form elevated sources, a
detailed study was undertaken between 5 and 20 Jan. 1995. An acoustic
doppler system, ADAS, was used to obtain vertical profiles of the wind and
temperature at the plant site. Monitoring was undertaken each day at 01, 03,
05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 o'clock, resulting in more than 150 wind
profiles and more than 120 temperature profiles.
Variation of wind direction with height
E.1.1.11 Based on the profiles measured between 5 and 20 Jan., 1995, Table
E1.1.6 presents the variation of the wind direction with height. It was found that
the wind direction tended to rotate clockwise with height as is to be expected
from the Coriolis force. Note that the dispersion of the Leiyang Power Station
plumes will predominantly respond to the wind properties above 200 m.
Variation of wind speed with heights
E.1.1.12 The wind profiles obtained were used to derive an algorithm for the
variation of wind speed with height. The data fitted an exponential function well
for heights less than 300m (where wind speed varies greatest with height). The
data fits the standard algorithm function
in which: u, - average wind speed at Z height, m/s;
u10 ----average wind speed at 1 Om height, m/s;
Zl,---    1 Om height;
p ------- power index.
E.1.1.13 Table E1.1.7 shows the values of p which gave the best fit for the stability
classes which occurred during the measurement period. Since not all stability
categories occurred, missing values of p were obtained from data sets from
similar regions to Leiyang and using the recommendations set out in HJ/T22-93.
E.1.1.14 Table El.1.9 shows the variation of wind speed with height. It can be seen
that above 100m the are no occurrences of zero wind speed.

Boundary Layer Temperature Characteristics
E.1.1.15 The variation of temperature with height is used to determine the stability
of the boundary layer and the presence and strength of inversion layers which
may affect the dispersion of the plume.
E.1.1.16 Table E1.1.10 sets out the average temperatures measured by ADAS as a
function of height and time of day. The lapse rate during the day tends to be
less than at night due to the change in the ground from a heat source to a heat
sink. Some indications of boundary layer inversions can be seen in the daytime
data as the lapse rate decreases and changes sign. At night the temperature
becomes more constant with height and even reverses, indicating a stable
atmosphere. The development of strong inversions in the lowest layer at night is
evident.
E.1.1.17 Table E1.1.11 sets out the frequencies with which inversions developed
during the night-time. A distinction is made between inversions which occur
close to the ground and those which occur higher in the boundary layer as a
result of the collapsed inversion at the top of the boundary layer.
E.1.1.18 The characteristics of the inversion layers as measured at 01, 07, 19, 23
o'clock are given in Table E 1.1.12. As can be seen the average strength of the
ground-level inversion is 1.19°C/100m with a the maximum strength of
3.40C/100m. For the low-level inversion it is 0.37°C/100m, max. strength with a
maximum of 1.40°C/100m. As expected, the ground-level inversion is stronger
because of its direct contact with the ground.
E.1.1.19 Table E1.1.12 sets out the thickness of the ground-level inversion layer
and its average strength. Since the thickness is less than 200m, the power
station plume will be above the inversion at night and consequently will not
normally make any contribution to ground level concentrations during the night.
The height of the low-level inversion, also shown in the table suggests that the
plume will be trapped below this layer at night.
Mixing Layer Height
E.1.1.20 Adopting the method recommended by HJ/T2.2-93, the annual average
mixing layer height for each stability category was calculated (Table E1.1.13).
The values are compared to those measured during the 5 to 20 Jan 1993
campaign.   As is to be expected from a study undertaken in winter, the
measured boundary layer heights under unstable conditions are less than the
average heights estimated for the year.

E.2 Assessing The Impact Of The Proposed Development By Computer
Modelling
E.2.1 Methodology
E.2.1.1 Two different computer models have been used in the assessment: a model
developed by the Chinese, which uses a standard gaussian treatment of
dispersion from a point source and a 'new generation' dispersion model called
ADMS (Atmospheric Dispersion Model System), which uses advances made in
the understanding of dispersion in the atmosphere made over the past 2
decades. ADMS is used to provide additional credence to the predictions
obtained by the Chinese model.
E.2.1.2 Meteorological data for a complete year (1993), as measured by the
Leiyang Meteorological Observatory, was used to predict SO2, NOx and
particulate hourly average; daily average; and annual daily average ground level
concentrations. Due to the use of very efficient ESPs, the particulate discharge
from the chimneys of the phase 1 ,2 and 3 power plants was taken to consist
solely of particles less than 10 microns in diameter (PM,0). Particles of this size
are dispersed in the same manner as a gas and deposition under gravity is
insignificant over a few tens of kilometres.
E.2.1.3 The effects of topography were taken into account in modelling the
dispersion of the power plant plume by the Chinese model. Topographical
influences were not considered important when the ADMS model was used.
Details Of The Chinese Model

* Revisions for topography
E.2.1.4 The Egan method was adopted to allow for topography by having the
effective source height He in model replaced by THe, where T is the
topographical coefficient, taken as the following
2HcF h<Hc
where hr - topography height, m;
T - topography coefficient.
* Daily average concentration
E.2.1.5 The calculation of the daily average concentration was achieved by
calculating the arithmetic mean of hourly average concentrations in each day
(calculating 8 hourly concentrations daily at the times 02, 05, 08, 11, 14, 17, 20,
23 o'clock):
Cd(x,y,O)= iEC,(x,y,O)
in which
Cd(x,y,0) --daily average concentration mg/m3 at ground point (x,y);
Ci(x,y,0) -hourly average concentration mg/m3 at ground point (x,y).

are shown in Table E2-1.1
* Dispersion parameters
E.2.1.7 Tables E2.1.2a-b present the lateral and vertical dispersion parameters
used by the Chinese model when the wind speed is greater than 0.5 m/s.

those set out in Table E2.1.3.

parameter is kept the same, but in the y-direction it is changed to the following:

for air pollutants for thermal power plant ' .The maximum permissible emission

in which:
Qso2- Maximum permitted S02 emission in t/h;
N - total number of plant stacks;

u -average wind speed at the various stack exit heights;

E.2.2.2 In order to compare the results of the above formula with the predicted or
actual emissions from the power plant, the flue gas concentrations from Leiyang
1 and 2 chimneys are to converted to that with excess air coefficient a=1.4 by
the following formula:

in which, a -  id the excess air coefficient at stack or duct actually measured
(or designed)
Cs02 - S02 emission concentration at stack or duct actually measured (or

CS02 -  S02 emission concentration converted to a=1.4 mg/Nm3 (dry flue gas).

E.2.2.3 The flue gas dust emission concentration of each boiler after ESP, is
converted to the reference conditions required by the standard by means of the
following formula:
Csmoke dust = C smoke dust a /a
in which,
a'- excess air coefficient actually measured (or designed) at ESP exit;
C'smoke dust -  smoke dust concentration, mg/Nm3 dry actually measured (or
designed) at ESP exit;
Csmoke dust - smoke dust emission concentration, mg/Nm3 dry when a converted
to 1.4 (or 1.7).
E.2.2.4 Listed in Table E2.2.1 are the total plant SO2 actual emission amount, the
total plant S02 permitted amount, the S02 emission concentration, and the
permitted emission concentration from the two stacks. It can be seen that the
total SO2 emission and the SO2 flue gas concentrations of the two stacks in
Leiyang Power Plant complex are lower than the permitted SO2 emission
amount and permitted emission concentration.
E.2.2.5 The dust flue concentration of Leiyang Power Plant existing boilers 1 & 2and
the proposed boilers 3 & 4 after the ESPs are compared with the maximum
permissible flue gas concentrations stipulated by GB13223-1996 in Table
E3.1.2. The actual and designed concentrations are all less that the maximum
permitted.
E.2.2.6 Leiyang Power Plant 2nd phase project boiler 3 & 4 will be designed to give
a NO, flue gas concentration of between 1000 and 1500mg/m3 dry (a=1 .4). All
modelling calculations are based on a worst case NOx concentration of
1500mg/m3 dry (a=1.4).
E.2.3 Description of Dispersion Model, ADMS
E.2.3.1 The ADMS model (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System) is a model
for calculating short-range atmospheric dispersion from point sources
(developed by Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants and described
in CERC 1995).  The model adopts a modern approach to boundary layer
scaling based on the Monin-Obukhov length and boundary layer depth rather
than on Pasquill-Gifford stability classes.  The concentration profiles are
E-Il



Hunan Power Development Project  APPEANDIXE                     Power Consull
assumed to be Gaussian in neutral and stable conditions, but non-Gaussian
profiles are adopted in convective conditions to allow for the skewness of the
vertical velocity distribution. The system includes modules for plume rise and
dispersion of particulates, and for the effects of buildings, hill roughness
variations and coastlines, as well as modules for predicting deposition,
fluctuations in concentration, radioactive decay and doses from gamma
radiation. The model calculates mean concentrations and deposition over short
time periods (1 to 24 hours) and statistics over many short time periods, e.g. an
average or 98-percentile of hourly means. The model can describe the
dispersion of pollutants from multiple point, area, volume and line sources.
E.2.3.2 ADMS has a number of key scientific features which distinguish it from the
US Environment Protection Agency model, Industrial Source complex (ISC) and
similar models such as the Chinese model discussed above. These are:
i) The use of self-similar vertical profiles of wind speed and turbulence which
depend on the key boundary layer parameters, namely the Monin-Obukhov
length and boundary layer height. These supersede the use of the Pasquill
Stability Categories (PSC). However they can be calculated from the same
basic meteorological data. Atmospheric stability is therefore treated as a
continuum rather than classified. This is illustrated in Figure 2.3.1 which shows
the variation of atmospheric stability using non-dimensionalised parameters
based on Monin-Obukhov length and boundary layer height. The ranges
represented by the Pasquill Stability Classes ( PSC ) are also shown. It can be
seen that dispersion characteristics of the atmosphere vary considerably within
a PSC.
ii) A non-Gaussian vertical concentration distribution in unstable conditions
which arises as a result of the observed skewness in the vertical velocity
fluctuations. For elevated sources this brings the maximum concentration
down towards the surface.
iii) The rate of change of a, and cy depend on the mean flow and turbulence at
the local mean plume height.
iv) An integral plume rise model in which the rate of plume rise and associated
plume spread depend on the local mean flow, turbulence and temperature
within the boundary layer. It is not necessary to define a final plume rise. If
the plume rises to near the top of the boundary layer, allowance is made for
plume penetration of the inversion and the inhibiting effect of any overlying
stable air on further vertical motion. If the plume is initially above the inversion,
E-12



Hunan Power Development Project  APPENDIX E                   Power Consult
it remains above the inversion unless there is deposition.
v) A model to calculate the variance and probability distrbution of
concentration for a given averaging time (all averaging times less than or equal
to one hour).
vi) Complex effects (not considered relevant to the current study) which allow
for buildings and complex terrain.
Extensive validation of the model has already been undertaken ( for example
HMIP 1995).
E.2.3.3 The ADMS model requires data in either of two forms. It will accept
data in statistical form i.e. data classified by e.g. wind direction, wind speed,
boundary layer height and heat flux, with frequencies of occurrence
associated with each class. It will also accept data as a set of sequential
hourly values of meteorological parameters as specified by the user from a
larger list of possible parameters that the model can deal with. The model
uses this data to calculate parameters describing the state of the
atmosphere such as heat flux and boundary layer height for subsequent
intemal use by the model.
E.2.3.4 Supplying ADMS with a statistical dataset has the advantage of allowing
large time series of data to be made use of in an assessment - the use of
sequential series longer than about 1 year taking a prohibitive amount of
time to run - but has the disadvantage of not allowing the use of certain
modules such as the coastal effects or complex terrain modules. For this
project these modules are not required. A sequential data set is, however,
required in order to calculate 24 hourly averages. In this case 8 sets of
meteorological data were used per 24 hour period. Daily average
concentrations were calculated as the mean of the concentrations calculated
for each of the 8 ( 1 hour ) periods during each day.
E.2.3.5 The basic meteorological quantities that ADMS needs for dispersion
calculations are: the wind speed U (or friction velocity u. ), the wind direction
0, the surface heat flux Feo (or the Monin-Obukhov length L) and the
boundary layer depth h.  If Feo and h are not available, the ADMS
meteorological input module will estimate them from routinely available data,
such as cloud cover, time of day and time of year. Other parameters can be
input to override defaults (e.g. the stability above the boundary layer or
surface albedo).

E.3 Predictions Of Ground Level Concentrations Of Pollutants
E.3.1 NOx Conversion Rates In Power Plant Plumes
E.3.1.1 Approximately 95% of NO. is released from chimneys as nitric oxide, NO,
with nitrogen dioxide, NO2 contributing only about 5%. Once released, however,
NO can be converted into NO2 by reaction with low-level ozone in the
atmosphere. The process is reversible in sunlight and the net rate of conversion
of NO to NO2 in the plume is therefore a complicated function of the rate of
dilution of the plume by ambient air, trace gas concentrations in the air and
meteorology.
E.3.1.2 The chemical reactions involving combustion products from power stations
and low-level ozone have been studied in detail and measurements have been
made of the rates of production/destruction of ozone and NO2 formation in
power station plumes (e.g. White, 1977; Melo and Stevens, 1981 and Hegg,
1977). It is found in these studies that NO2 formation is limited firstly by the rate
at which ambient ozone can be mixed into the plume and secondly by the
decomposition of NO2 in sunlight. On average only about 30% of NOx in plumes
during sunlight hours is in the form of NO2. At night when all the available ozone
could be used to form NO2, a power station plume will not disperse down to the
ground anyway. An upper limit to the amount of NO2 that can be formed is
therefore the concentration of ozone in the surrounding air at the time.
E.3.1.3 It is assumed in the following analyses that all the NO, is emitted into the
environment as NO2 despite the fact that, in reality, only a fraction of it may be
contributing to ambient concentrations of NO2.
E.3.2 Predictions Of The Combined Impact Of The Phase I And
Proposed Phase 2 On Air Quality
E.3.2.1 The area of assessment is a 32x32km square area centred on the Leiyang
Power Plant (see Fig.E3.2.1). Within this the area there is the Leiyang municipal
urban area, Zhaoshi town and the Baisha mine residential quarter. A grid
spacing of 500m was used for the Chinese model predictions. ADMS used a grid
spacing of 1000m.
E.3.2.2 In addition to the receptors on these grid points, various other receptors
were included. These corresponded to the locations of the air quality monitoring
sites. The distances of these monitoring points from the Leiyang Power Plant
emission sources and their compass bearing position are shown in Table E3.2.1.

A. S02 hourly average concentration
E.3.2.5 The hourly average concentration of SO2 at ground level was predicted
using the Chinese model for each hour of year, using the 1993 meteorological
dataset. The results are presented in Table E3.2.2 in terms of the maximum
concentration predicted in each stability category. The maximum hourly average
concentration occurs under stability A, at 0.154 (0.173) mgfm3 which is
30.8%(34.6%) of the Chinese air quality standard. It occurs at a distance of
1.59 km from the source.
E.3.2.6 Predicted SO2 maximum hourly average ground level concentrations at
various monitoring points are listed in Table E3.2.3.
E.3.2.7 The maximum hourly average concentrations at these points range from
0.051 to 0.095 mg/m3 (0.057-0.108 mg/M3) which is 10.2 to 19.0% (11.4-21.6%)
of the relevant standard.
B. SO2 Daily average concentration
E.3.2.8 Predicted daily average ground level concentrations for the 10 days which
had the highest concentrations are shown in Table E3.2.4 together with the
locations of the maxima. The 10 ten worst days were calculated by ranking the
daily averages for each day of the year. The 10th worst day is the 97 percentile
daily average concentration for which there is a national standard. The S02
97th percentile maximum daily average is 0.037 mg/m3 (0.043 mg/m3) which is
24.7%(28.7%) of the relevant standard. The worst daily average is 0.057(0.065)
mg/m3. Figures E3.2.1 to Figure E3.2.10 show contour plots of SO2
concentration for each of the 10 worst days (assuming a sulphur content of
0.36%).

C. SO2 Annual average concentration
E.3.2.11 Table E3.2.6 gives the S02 maximum annual average concentration
values predicted by the Chinese model compass bearing and distances from
Leiyang Power Plant. Fig.E3.2.11 gives the distribution of SO2 annual daily
average concentrations.
E.3.2.12 The S02 maximum predicted annual average concentration is very small,
only 7.8% (8.8%) of the relevant Chinese standard. It occurs SSE of Leiyang
power plant and at a distance 7.5km from the source.
E.3.2.13 Table E3.2.7 shows the predicted annual average concentrations at the
various monitoring points.
NO. ground level concentrations
E.3.2.14 NOx concentrations were originally calculated on the basis that the flue
gas concentration would be 650 mg/M3. In order to be consistent with the
Environmental Assessment main document which assumes a flue gas NOx
concentration of 1500 mg/m3, these are converted in the text and tables of this
Appendix to reflect this revised concentration(estimated by portioning the
predicted concentration between Leiyang 1 and Leiyang 2 in proportion to their
respective NOx emissions and multiplying the phase 2 emission rate by
1500/650). Figures of NOx concentration distributions have not been presented,
as these essentially follow the same pattem as do the SO2 concentrations.
Conversion from the S02 figures requires multiplication by 1.466 to obtain NOx
concentrations
A. NO. hourly average concentrations
E.3.2.15 The hourly average concentration of NOx at ground level was predicted
using the Chinese model for each hour of the year, using the 1993
meteorological dataset. The results are presented in Table E3.2.8 in terms of
the maximum concentration predicted in each stability category. The maximum
hourly average concentration occurs under stability A, at 0.233 mg/im3. This is
155% of the Chinese air quality standard. It occurs at a distance of 1.59 km
form the source. The NOx maximum hourly concentration during the 10th worst
day in the year (the day with the 97th percentile daily mean concentration) is
predicted to be 138 mg/m3 (again estimated from the emission rates of the two
plants and assuming 1500 mg/m3 NOx in phase 2 flue gas). This is 92% of the

relevant air quality standard.
E.3.2.16 Predicted NOx maximum hourly average ground level concentrations at
various monitoring points are listed in Table E3.2.9.
E.3.2.17 The maximum hourly average concentrations at these points range from
0.076 to 0.142 mg/m3. This is 51% to 95% of the relevant standard.
B. NO. daily average concentrations
E.3.2.18 Predicted daily average ground level concentrations for the 10 days which
had the highest concentrations are shown in Table E3.2.10 together with the
locations of the maxima. The 10 ten worst days were calculated by ranking the
daily averages for each day of the year. The 10th worst day is the 97 percentile
daily average concentration for which there is a national standard. The NOx
97th percentile maximum daily average is 0.056 mgIM3 which is 56% of the
relevant standard. The worst daily average is 0.85 mg/m3. Figures showing
contours of NOx ground level concentrations are not shown but have the same
appearance as those shown for SO2. The SO2 contour values should be
multiplied by 1.5 to obtain the equivalent values for NOx ( based on the relative
total NOx and total SO2 emission rates ).
E.3.2.19 Table E3.2.11 shows the NOx maximum daily average concentrations at
the monitoring points.
E.3.2.20 The NOx maximum daily average concentrations at various monitoring
points range from 0.015 to 0.042 mg/m3 which is 15% to 42% of the air quality
standard.
C. NO,, annual average concentration
E.3.2.21 Table E3.2.12 shows the NOx maximum annual average concentration
and its location relative the Leiyang Power Plant.
E.3.2.22 The NOx maximum annual average concentration is 17% of the relevant
Chinese air quality standard. It is located 7.5 km SSE of the power plant.
E.3.2.23 Table E3.2.13 shows the maximum annual concentrations predicted by the
Chinese model at the monitoring sites.

* PMi0 ground level concentration model predictions
A. PM10 daily average concentration
E.3.2.24 Figures for contours of PM10 ground level concentrations are not shown as
they are similar in pattem to those for SO2. Plots of S02 should be multiplied by
0.25 to obtain the equivalent values for PM10.
E.3.2.25 Table E3.2.14 shows the PM10 maximum daily average concentrations
corresponding to the 10 worst days. The 97th percentile maximum daily
average is 0.09 mg/m3 which is 6% of the relevant Chinese air quality standard.
E.3.2.26 Listed in Table E3.2.15 are maximum of predicted PM,0 daily average
concentrations at the monitoring sites . They range from 0.004 to 0.007 mg/ m3
which is 2% to 5% air quality standard.
B. PM1O Annual average concentration
E.3.2.27 Table E3.2.16 shows the PM,o maximum annual average concentration
and its location relative the Leiyang Power Plant.
E.3.2.28 The PM10  maximum annual average concentration is only 0.9% of the
relevant Chinese air quality standard. It is located 7.5 km SSE of the power
plant.
E.3.2.29 Table E3.2.17 shows the PM10 annual average concentrations at the
monitoring points. The power plant is predicted to make a negligible contribution
to PM10 annual average concentrations.
E.3.3 Comparison Of The Environmental Impact Due To The 2nd Phase
With That Due To The 1st Phase
E.3.3.1 Tables E3.3-1(a), (b), (c) show respectively the predicted S02, NOx and
PM,0 maximum daily average concentrations predicted by the Chinese model
due to phase 1, phase 2 and for both phases combined. These were predicted
at the locations of the various monitoring sites.
E.3.3.2 In addition, Tables E3.3-2a-c show the daily maximum predictions for the 10
worst days. The days are ranked with the worst first.
E.3.3.3 The 97th percentile of the S02 maximum daily average concentrations due
to by the Leiyang 1st phase, the 2nd phase and whole plant after phase 2 are
respectively less than 12.0%, 12.7% (16.7%), and 24.7% (28.7%) of the relevant
E-18

air quality standard. The worst day is respectively 19.3%, 20.0(25.3), 38.0(43.3)
of the standard.
E.3.3.4 For NOx, Table E3.3-2b, the predicted 10th worst daily average for Leiyang
1st phase, Leiyang 2nd phase and the whole plant are respectively 17%, 37%
and 57% of the air quality standard. The worst day is respectively 27%, 58%
and 84% of the standard.
E.3.3.5 For PM10, Table E3.3-2c, shows that the contributions from each plant are
6% or less of the daily average air quality standard.
E.3.4 Results Of ADMS Modelling Of Leiyang Development And
Comparison With Chinese Model Results
E.3.4.1 ADMS was configured to predict daily average ground level concentrations
of SO2, NOx, and PM10 due to Leiyang phases 1 and 2 power plants. The model
used wind speed, wind direction, cloud cover, temperature, boundary layer
height, as measured or determined from the meteorological data recorded by
the Leiyang Municipal Observatory every 3 hours during each day. The 10
worst days identified by the Chinese model were used in the ADMS analysis.
The maximum daily average ground level concentrations predicted to occur
during each of these days are presented in Table 3.4-1 for SO2. The positions
of the maxima are also indicated. The same table includes the predictions from
the Chinese model.
E.3.4.2 It can be seen that ADMS predicts maximum daily average concentrations
of SO2 to be between about 15 and 50% of those predicted by the Chinese
model. There are likely to be several reasons for ADMS consistently predicting
lower daily concentrations. One likely contributing reason will be that ADMS
allows for some or all of the plume to penetrate the boundary layer under some
conditions and hence allows the plume to contribute little or nothing to the
ground level concentrations during these periods. Plume penetration occurs
most often when the boundary layer is low, such as at night or during early
morning/evening. The Chinese model assumes that the plume is reflected back
downwards upon reaching the top of the boundary layer leading to higher
concentrations. Other reasons for differences between the models may relate
to the different formulations used to calculate the dispersion parameters and the
inclusion of an adjustment due to topography that has been applied to the
Chinese model but not to the ADMS model.. The effect of topography is not
considered to be important in ADMS unless there are major slopes greater than
1 in 10.
E-19



Hunan Power Development Project  APPENDIXE                    Power Conult
E.3.4.3 It is concluded that the Chinese model is likely to over-estimate daily
average, and annual average ground level concentrations (although a suitable
meteorological dataset was not available to use in ADMS in order to calculate
annual averages).
E.3.4.4 Also included in Table 3.4-1 are the ADMS predictions of the maximum
hourly concentrations generated during each day. The highest hourly average
S02 concentration during these 10 particular days is 104(133) pg m-3. These
concentrations are not likely to be the highest hourly ground level concentrations
that would occur during the year since the highest individual hourly
concentrations do not have to occur during the days with the highest daily
averages. It does, however, provide an indication of a typical maximum hourly
value that might occur on these days.
E.3.4.5 In order to obtain a reasonable estimate of the highest hourly average
ground level concentrations that might occur as a result of the Leiyang power
plant, ADMS was run with a series of extreme weather conditions. In order to
compare the predictions with those from the Chinese model a weather condition
was selected from the range of conditions associated with each Pasquill stability
category.
E.3.4.6 Table 3.4-2 shows the results of the analysis for SO2, NOx undertaken for
Leiyang phase 1 and 2 and the combination of both. The Chinese model results
for each stability class (taken to be the maximum ground level concentrations
predicted in each class) are compared to those predicted by ADMS. ADMS
predicted zero ground level concentrations for the category E condition chosen.
E.3.4.7 ADMS has predicted higher ground level concentrations for categories A
and B than the Chinese model. Since these categories correspond to unstable
conditions and ADMS treats dispersion in unstable conditions in a more
advanced manner than the Chinese model, it is likely that ADMS is providing a
better estimate of the maximum hourly concentrations.
E.3.5 Comparison With General Background Air Quality
E.3.5.1 Table 3.5-1 compares the predictions of ADMS for the Leiyang 1 and 2
plants combined with the expected background concentrations. It is assumed
that it is unlikely that peak background concentrations would coincide with the
peaks due to the plant.
E.3.5.2 Referring to Tables 3.4-2 and 3.5-1: In the case of SO2, the total
concentration predicted by either model due to both phases combined is less
E-20



Hunan Power Development Projecr  APPENDLXE                    Power Consult
than the relevant standards when added on to the background component.
However, in the case of NOx, the combined ground level concentrations due to
the two power plants are greater than the Chinese standard for NOx
(150 pg m-3) in both cases. Such exceedances of the standard will be rare.
E.3.5.3 As discussed in Section E3.1, the proportion of NO2 in a power station
plume at ground level is typically 30% or less and only occasionally reaches
50% when levels of ambient ozone are high. The Chinese hourly average
standard for NO2 is 120 pgm4 and is likely not to be exceeded even under the
extreme conditions of class A atmospheric stability.
E.3.5.4 Other standards for NO2 such as the UK (300 pg m3) or WHO (200 pg i4)
standards will not be exceeded. The World Bank does not set guidelines for
short term NOx concentrations, with only an annual average guideline
(of 100 gg m-3 ) being set.
E.3.5.5 It has also been assumed that the flue gas NOx concentrations will be 1500
mg m3 which may possibly be bettered by plant that will be tendered for this
project.
E.3.5.6 It is therefore considered that, not withstanding the possibility of the Chinese
NOx standard being exceeded infrequently due to the combined operation of
Leiyang phases 1 and 2, the contribution of the Leiyang plant to ambient NOx
concentrations are considered acceptable.
E.3.5.7 ADMS predictions of PM10 daily average and annual ground level
concentrations are less than those predicted by the Chinese model which
therefore may be considered to be pessimistic. The contribution of the plant to
PM,0 concentrations is small and the standards will not be exceeded even when
account is taken of the background component.
E.3.6 Conclusions
E.3.6.1 The majority of the predictions of ground level concentrations of SO2, NOx,
and PM,0 were produced using the Chinese dispersion computer model. A
.worst' case conditions study was also undertaken using the Atmospheric
Dispersion Model System (ADMS) in order to provide support to the Chinese
modelling and to test the robustness of the conclusions reached.
E.3.6.2 Predictions of ground level concentrations were compared to the relevant
Chinese and International air quality standards.
E-21



Hunan Power Development Project  APPENDIX E                   Power Consult
E.3.6.3 It was found that in the majority of cases air quality standards would not be
exceeded by phase 2 on its own or together with phase 1.
E.3.6.4 Some differences between the Chinese model and ADMS predictions were
evident. These could be explained in terms of the mode! formulation - the
Chinese model tending to predict higher daily and annual ground level
concentrations.
E.3.6.5 The NOx Chinese maximum hourly average standard is predicted to be
exceeded for a small percentage of the year. However, other Intemational
hourly average standards for NOx or NO2 will not be exceeded. It is therefore
concluded that such small exceedances of the Chinese standard are acceptable
on human health grounds.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The following summarises the environmental assessment for the transmission
system development requirements associated with the Hunan Power Development
Project. The assessment conceming the Leiyang Power Plant phase 2 extension
project is reported as 'Part A' of this report.
General Description
1  Located in the centre of China, Hunan Province has good communications and
abundant resources. It is therefore an area for economic development and has
developed rapidly in recent years. At the end of 1995, the total installed
electricity generating capacity in Hunan Province was 8055.5MW, of which
hydropower was 4211.3MW (52.3% of the total) and thermal power 3844.2MW
(47.7%). In 1995, the whole province, generated and purchased 33.94TW.h of
electrical energy, of which 1.359TW.h was imported from neighbouring
provinces Hunan province can not maintain a balance between electricity
generation and consumption. Moreover, hydropower, which constitutes 52.3% of
the total capacity, has a low guaranteed output. This results in serious power
shortages during dry seasons. According to predictions by Hunan Provincial
Electric Power Bureau, by the year 2000, the whole Province will require
55.OTW.h electricity and capacity of 10,000MW. By 2005, electricity demand is
predicted to be 81.2TW.h, requiring a capacity of 14800MW. Therefore, it is
imperative to expedite further power construction in Hunan province.
2  The Hunan Power Development Project includes an extension of the Leiyang
Power Plant, to increase its capacity by 600 MW. Another major component
part of the project are the associated transmission projects of the Leiyang Power
Plant phase 2 extension (2x300MW) and Changsha BOT Power Plant
(2x300MW).  These projects include constructing 572 km of new 220kv
transmission lines, reforming 178 km of 220kV transmission lines; constructing
nine 220kv substations, extending two 220kv substations, and increasing
transmission capacity by 1920 mVA.
3  The project is to be financed with the help of a 300 million US$ World Bank loan.
The World Bank deems that environmental hazards of power transmission
projects are extensive, depending on the engineering scale and location. Lines
of small capacity, short distance or not passing through sensitive regions will not
be required to carry out comprehensive environmental impact assessments,
whereas those of large capacity and longer distance will be required to do so.
4  The transmission projects to be constructed by Hunan Provincial Electric Power
Company will pass through parts of ten municipalities in Hunan Province.
Because the transmission lines are long and will pass through some densely
populated areas, the project is required to carry out an EIA according to World
Bank operation directive (OD 4.01).
5  Chinese officials agreed to a recommendation that an intemational consultant
with substantial relevant experience be engaged to prepare an English text EA
document incorporating all project components (generation, transmission, coal
mine safety, and boiler retirement) that will meet World Bank technical
requirements. This EA report is based on the draft EA provided for Hunan
ES-1



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                    Power Consult
Provincial Electric Power Company and the considerable amount of analysis that
has been undertaken in support of the project. Power Consult were engaged to
undertake the task of assisting with the preparation of the English text. In the
case of this report, on the transmission system, this was predominately an
editorial role rather than having significant technical input.
Project Description
6 The power transmission engineering of Hunan Power Development Project will
include the following:
- The associated transmission requirements of the Leiyang Power Plant phase 2
extension.
Four 220kV substations to be built, one 220kV substation to be extended and
increased transmission capacity of 720MVA.
415km of 220kV transmission lines to be constructed.
- The associated transmission project of the Changsha BOT Power Plant
Five 220kV substations to be built, one 220kV substation to be extended and
increased transmission capacity of 1200MVA.
157km of 220kV transmission lines to be constructed.
178km of 220 kV transmission lines to be improved
7 The main schedule as follows:
- In 1998, engineering design, public bidding, examination of the purchase
equipment bid with foreign funds and publishing.
- In 1999, engineering construction.
- In 2000, procurement of equipment from China and abroad.
- In 2001, system regulating and project competition
8 The transmission development has been designed to minimise environmental
impacts and relocation requirements. Substation developments will require
removal of one small brick factory (1000m2) and 994 people in 174 households,
transmission lines developments will require relocation of 286 people in 72
families. Specific resettlement plans have been developed by Hehai University
and HEPC. Relocation arrangements and compensation will be in accordance
with all relevant laws and regulations.
9 There are total 15 kinds of tower structures to be used, 5 for single circuit self-
standing towers, 5 for double circuit self-standing towers and 5 for single circuit
concrete towers.
10 Self-standing towers are used in farmland and densely populated areas. If the
turning angle is greater than 300 or the height of the conductor is greater than
27m, self-standing towers will be used. Self-standing towers are used in all
double circuits.

Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
11 Concrete towers occupy less land, cost less money and need relatively few
trees to be cut. They will be used in scattered populated areas, hills and
forested land.
12 The transmission corridor is 50m wide for both single and double circuits.
Environmental background
13 The transmission line routes pass through 10 prefectures and municipalities in
Hunan Province.
14 The majority of the transmission line route comprises land which has been
exploited for more than a thousand years. The terrain consists mainly of hills,
farm land, artificial forest and shrubbery. No ancient vegetation remains.
15 A 1km segment of the Huaneng Yueyang Power Plant to Dongfenghu line
crosses Dongfenghu (lake) which is 100ha in area. Fish are cultured in the lake.
In every winter, water in the lake is pumped out, and the lake is dried in the sun
which allows the fish to be caught. In April the next year, the lake is filled with
water and fishes reared again. Four transmission tower foundations will be built
in the lake, Construction will be arranged in February and March, when the lake
is dry. The segment has been approved by Yueyang Municipal People's
Govemment in document Yuebanji (1997) No.22.
16 There are 19 nature reserves in Hunan Province, of which, Badagongshan
mountain Nature Reserve is a national reserve. and others are provincial
reserves.
17 The transmission line routes are generally more than 30km away from the
boundaries of the nature reserves. The segment of Huaneng Yueyang power
plant to Dongfenghu is 10km from the closest of boundary of Dongtinghu Lake
Nature Reserve and the segment of Matang to Chayuan to Hengbei substation
is 15km from the closest of boundary of Hengshan N. R. No adverse impact is
predicted on these nature reserves.
18 No species of endangered or protected terrestrial fauna or flora have been
-             recorded within 10 km of the proposed developments.
19 The nearest historic relic is Yueyang Building 4km from the nearest transmission
line. No impact is predicted on this.
20 The transmission lines routes have been carefully chosen to avoid significant
population centres (villages, towns, cities, planning areas), schools, hospitals,
factories, commercial properties and public entertainment centres etc.
21 There are no mineral reserves present along the route of the proposed
transmission lines and so there will be no impact on production.
Environmental Impacts
22 Both construction and operational phases of the development will incur some
environmental impacts:

Hunan Power Development Project (Part 8)                       Power Consult
23 During substation and transmission line construction, there will be some land
used temporarily, for routes for equipment transportation, personnel access,
pylon foundation construction sites etc. These areas should be retumed to
agriculture immediately after completion of construction.
24 Farm crops and trees on the 33.66ha occupied by substations will be destroyed.
25 The construction of the transmission lines and tower foundations will result in
loss of another 12.28 ha of farm crops and plants.
26 There may be some emissions of dust from construction activities. However,
this will be a transient problem, as areas affected by construction will either
quickly be retumed to their original use or be permanently incorporated into the
operational sites. The permanent sites will not have any areas of bare soil
remaining that could give rise to dust emissions.
27 There will be some impact of noise emissions. During construction this will arise
from construction machinery. Such effects will be temporary, will occur mainly
during daytime and will be conducted to meet the relevant Chinese standards in
'Construction Site Boundary Noise Limit'.
28 Noise measurements at substations and below transmission lines in Hunan
Province, designed and operated in a similar manner to the proposed
development, indicate that noise levels are up to approximately 42dB(A) under
the power line and up to 44 dB(A) at the boundary of a 220 kV substation.
Noise levels during operation are therefore predicted to comply with the relevant
limits (6QdB(A) by day and 50 dB(A) at night) in 'Industrial enterprises plant
boundary noise standard' and also the World Bank standards of 55-7OdB(A) for
various typex of location (see Table 2.4-5 of Part A report) .
29 Impacts on the aquatic environment are predicted to be small. River crossings
will be by single direct spans, without a requirement for transmission towers in
mid-river. Only a temporary disruption to navigation, for a few hours, will be
required to erect the overhead lines, following which navigation will be
unimpeded. Domestic sewage will require disposal from construction workers
and operating workers. At substation sites sewage disposal will via septic tanks.
Transmission workers will be concentrated near existing towns and not at the
construction sites and will use the existing sewage disposal systems.
30 No natural vegetation will be affected by the development. It is estimated that
17,500 trees will need to be felled during construction and to ensure sufficient
clearance for the lines. These are mostly pine and tea-oil camelia and consist of
artificial forest and plantations.
31 Adequate clearance will be provided at crossings of other transmission lines,
communications lines, highways and railways to ensure that these facilities are
not adversely affected.
32 Construction'and operating workers will need to be skilled and will mainly be
non-local workers. It is not anticipated that this will cause any impacts on local
job opportunities, other than some generation of additional demand for service
industries.

33 The electric field strengths were measured under an existing 220 kV
transmission line in Hunan, of the same construction as proposed in this
development. The results show maximum intensities of less than 3 kV/m. Field
strengths were also measured at Changsha Tianding and Shumuling
substations and, again, field strengths were less than 3 kV/m under the outgoing
lines and 5.8kV/m elsewhere in the substations. These are well within Chinese
standards and recommended levels:

enclosure wall
The World Bank does not set any standards for electric field strengths from
transmission lines. However, at these levels, no adverse impacts are predicted
on human health or ecology.
Mitigation Measures
34 During construction, water sprays will be used to suppress fugitive dust
emissions when required.
35 Water runoff during construction will be collected, and settled, prior to discharge
to control suspended solids emissions. Domestic sewage will be collected in
septic tanks, where it is not possible to utilise existing sewers. In substations, oil
contaminated water will be collected and the oil separated and reclaimed prior to
discharge. Oil containing equipment will be bunded to contain any spillages.
36 Construction machinery and methods of working will be selected to ensure that
noise emissions are within permitted levels, particularly in the vicinity of
residential properties.
37 Vehicles will have metal grounding wires.
38 Routing should minimise relocation requirements, avoid urban areas and
townships and a facilities such as schools and hospitals
39 Residential properties must have a minimum clearance of 5m from the
conductors and not be exposed to an electric field intensity greater than 3 kV/m.
40 Clearances, as stipulated in various relevant regulations, shall be maintained
over trees, other power lines, roads, railways etc., to ensure safe operations.
41 Land temporarily occupied during construction shall immediately be reinstated
upon completion. Loss of crops and other relocation issues shall be subject to
appropriate compensation measures in accordance with govemment
prescriptions.

42 Where large areas of trees are to be crossed, pylon height should be increased
to minimise the requirement to fell trees. Suitable species should be planted to
replace trees that have been felled and to re-vegetate other areas where
appropriate. Substation sites should have a minimum of 10% cover with
vegetation.
Alternative schemes
43 The transmission scheme is intimately associated with the Leiyang Power Plant
Phase 2 development and Changsha BOT Power Plant. Without the associated
transmission works, these projects can not be completed and power shortages
in Hunan Province will continue to develop.
44 The 220 kV voltage has been chosen as satisfying the engineering requirements
to reinforce the existing grid system in an economical and practical manner.
45 Considerable consultation has taken place with local administrative departments
and representatives over route selection. The selected route avoids ecologically
sensitive locations, minimises relocation requirements, avoids impacts on
roadways, communications etc. and has minimum impact on residential areas.
Environmental Management and Monitoring
46 The effectiveness of the control of all mitigation measures shall be monitored
during construction and operational phases of the development. Particular
aspects include fugitive dust, noise, aquatic discharges (sewage, surface water
runoff and oil contaminated water) and electric field strengths.
47 This monitoring will be used to ensure compliance with all relevant national
environmental standards.
48 A number of organisations will be involved with monitoring the environmental
performance of the project including HEPC, Environmental Protection Bureau,
Environmental Monitoring Stations, State Land Administration, Forestry Bureau
and Cultural Relic Bureau

Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                    Power Consult
I INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
1.1.1 Hunan Electrical Power Company (HEPC) proposes to construct a 600 MW
(two 300 MW boilers) anthracite fired power station on the outskirts of Leiyang
City, on the bank of the Leishui River. This is a phase 2 development, adjacent
to an existing 400 MW (two 200 MW boilers) power station. The Environmental
Assessment of this development is contained in 'Part A' of this report.
1.1.2 Another major component part of Hunan Power Development Project are the
associated transmission projects of the Leiyang Power Plant phase 2 extension
(2x300MW) and Changsha BOT Power Plant (2x300MW). These projects
include constructing 572 km of new 220kv transmission lines, reforming 178 km
of 220kV transmission lines; constructing nine 220kv substations, extending two
220kv substations, and increasing transmission capacity by 1920 mvA.
1.1.3 In accordance with Chinese environmental regulations, -an Environmental
Assessment (EA) was prepared for the power generation facility by Nanjing
Environmental Protection Research Institute of Ministry of Electric Power
(NEPRI).  HEPC requested World Bank financing for this project and in
accordance with World Bank policies and procedures (OD 4.01, Environmental
Assessment) the project was rated "Category A" and an EA must be prepared to
World Bank specifications.
1.1.4 World Bank environmental specialists reviewed the draft EA prepared by
NEPRI and, for a number of reasons, concluded that the document required
strengthening to meet World Bank EA standards. They also requested an
independent evaluation of the ecological impacts to be anticipated from the
discharges of the heated cooling water, and the occupational health and safety
status of the mines supplying the anthracite fuel.
1.1.5 Chinese officials agreed to the recommendation that an intemational
consultant with substantial relevant experience be engaged to prepare an
English text EA document incorporating all project components (generation,
transmission, coal mine safety, and boiler retirement) that will meet World Bank
technical requirements.
1.1.6 The main objective of this work program is to produce an EA report for the
-            Hunan  Power Development Project in accordance  with World  Bank
requirements. This EA report is largely based on the draft EA report already
1-1



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
prepared for HEPC and the considerable amount of analysis that has been
undertaken in support of the project..
1.1.7 Power Consult were engaged to undertake the task of producing the English
text of the EA in close collaboration with HEPC and NEPRI. In the case of this
transmission system report, this was primarily an editorial role rather than
providing significant technical input.
1.2 The Necessity of 220kV Power Transmission Construction
1.2.1   Because of the rapid economic development in Hunan Province, there are
serious power supply shortages. For this reason, HEPC has decided to expand
Leiyang Power Plant, build Changsha BOT Power Plant and undertake
associated transmission engineering. The transmission project will reinforce the
existing 22QkV transmission systems, and enable the Hunan provincial grid to
supply the increasing demand in a reliable, economic and efficient manner.
1.3 The Approval Procedure of this Project
1.3.1 This Project Suggestion Report was submitted by Hunan Provincial Electric
Power Company to the Central China Electric Power Group Co., which in tuM
submits it to the Ministry of Electric Power and Electric Power Planning and
Design General Institute. When approved by the Ministry of Electric Power, the
feasibility study can be carried out.
1.3.2 Hunan Provincial Electric Power Company instructed the Hunan Provincial
Electric Power Design Institute to carry out the feasibility study and hand in the
feasibility study report.
1.3.3 The Feasibility Study Report is checked by relevant departments and experts
organised by Electric Power Planning and Design General Institute, which is
authorised by the Ministry of Electric Power. Following this, the Ministry of
Electric Power can approve the Feasibility Study Report.
1.3.4 During the project feasibility study, the design department must solicit opinions
from   planning,  land,  forestry,  navigation,  agriculture,  post  and
telecommunication, traffic, environmental protection, railway, highway and other
departments in relevant locations. During examination of the feasibility study
report by th'e Electric Power Planning and Design General Institute, the
departments mentioned above were invited to participate in the examination
meeting.

1.3.5 After approval of the feasibility study report, the Ministry of Electric Power
delegated the design responsibility to the Central China Electric Power Group
Co., and hence to Hunan Provincial Electric Power Company. Hunan Provincial
Electric Power Company commissioned the Hunan Provincial Electric Power
Design Institute to carry out the preliminary design. During the process of
preliminary design, Hunan Provincial Electric Power Company invited the
departments mentioned above to participate in the examination meeting and
continues to listen to their opinions. The examination of preliminary design was
organised by Hunan Provincial Electric Power Company, which then can grant
approval.
1.3.6 Hunan Provincial Electric Power Company has approved the construction of
this project.

1.5 Engineering Design
1.5.1 The EIA work will make reference to the transmission line routing and
substation site-selection and design document (see Appendix F, reference 1)
provided by Hunan Provincial Electric Power Company and Hunan Electric
Design Institute.
1.5.2 The transmission line routes were initially selected on operational
requirements and then detailed site surveying was undertaken. During site
surveys, discussions were held with the functional departments of local
govemment at 14 places. The surveys and discussions included consideration
of the natural environment, ecological environment, social environment, people's
living quality environment and the situation of the city and town planning (more
detail provided in Appendix A).
1.5.3 To understand the impact of the ground surface electric field and magnetic
field intensity, the ground surface electric field intensity of the existing Shumuling
220kv substation, Tianding 220kv substation and 220kv transmission lines were
measured. Noise levels were measured at the same time.  -
1.6 Treatment for Power Transmission Line and Substation Projects by
the World Bank
1.6.1 The World Bank considers that environmental hazards of power transmission
projects are extensive, depending on the engineering scale and location. Major
impacts are mainly relevant to risks of establishment and maintenance of the line
corridor, establishment of towers, construction of power substations and electro-
magnetic fields. Lines of small capacity, short distance or not passing through
sensitive regions will not be required to carry. out comprehensive environmental
impact assessments, while those of large capacity and longer distance will be
required to do so.
1.6.2 The associated transmission project to be constructed by Hunan Provincial
Electric Power Company will pass through parts of ten municipalities in Hunan
Province. Because the transmission lines are long and will pass through some
densely populated areas, the project is required to carry out EIA according to
World Bank operation directive (OD 4.01).

2.3.1 415km of transmission lines are associated with the Leiyang Power Plant
phase 2 project.
2.3.2 157km new construction and upgrading of 178km transmission lines are
associated with the Changsha BOT Power Plant. The reform is changing LGJ-
2x300/40 from LGJ-400/50.
2.3.3 There are total 15 kinds of tower structures, 5 for single circuit self-standing
towers, 5 for double circuit self-standing towers and 5 for single circuit concrete
towers.
2.3.4 Self-standing towers are used in farmland and densely populated areas. If the
tuming angle is greater than 300 or the height of the conductor is greater than
27m, self-standing towers will be used. Self-standing towers are used in all
double circuits. Self-standing towers do not require guy lines which could
interfere with operation of farm machinery etc. There are few impacts on farm
land or populated areas.
2.3.5 Concrete towers occupy less land, cost less money and need relatively few
trees to be cut. They will be used in scattered populated areas, hills and
forested land.
2.3.6 The transmission corridor is 5Gm wide for both single and double circuits.

3 ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
3.1 General Environment
3.1.1 The transmission line routes pass through 10 prefectures and municipalities in
Hunan Province. Along the line routes, the general conditions of the principal
regions are shown in Table 3.1-1.
3.1.2 The natural environment in the project construction regions are shown in Table
3.1-2 and Table 3.1-3.
3.2 Ecology
3.2.1 The majority of the regions passed by the transmission line route comprise
cultivated land and regulated river networks which have been exploited for more
than a thousand years. The terrain consists mainly of hills, farm land, artificial
forest and shrubbery.  No ancient vegetation exists.  In order to further
comprehend the ecological environment along the transmission line route, it has
been thoroughly surveyed as shown in detail in appendix B.
* Wetland
3.2.2 Along the transmission line route, there are mostly hills. A few rivers will be
crossed. There is 400m2 of wetland to be occupied in Yueyang city.
3.2.3 A 1km segment of the Huaneng Yueyang Power Plant to Dongfenghu line
crosses Dongfenghu (lake).
3.2.4 The Dongfenghu is an inland lake, 1km in length, 800m in width and 100ha in
area Fishes are cultured in the lake. In every winter, water in the lake is
pumped out, and the lake is dried in the sun which allows the fish to be caught.
In April the next year, the lake is filled with water and fishes reared again. Four
transmission tower foundations will be built in the lake, Construction will be
undertaken in February and March, when the lake is dry. This is approved by
Yueyang Municipal People's Govemment in document Yuebanji (1997) No.22.

*  Water
4.2.3 When transmission lines cross water, such as rivers or lakes, tower
foundations must be constructed and access must be paved. There is potential
for the water quality to be affected by suspended solids arising from the
construction works. Building towers in a river will affect the flood carrying ability
and navigation of the river.
4.2.4 In this project, where transmission lines are to cross the Xiangjiang River,
Yuanjiang River, Zhishui River etc., a single direct span will be adopted to avoid
erecting towers in the river. This will mitigate this potential impact such that
there will be no residual impact on flood discharge and navigation. This will also
eliminate the potential for pollution caused by the suspended solids.
4.2.5 The length of transmission line crossings are all less then 1000m.
4.2.6 The segment of Huaneng Yueyang Power Plant to Dongfenghu 220kV
transmission line crosses Dongfenghu lake This crossing is 1km in length, and
requires, 4 transmission towers to be built. Construction will be arranged in
February and March, while the lake is dry (see Para. 3.2.4), and has little affect
on the lake.
4.2.7 During construction, there will be a small amount of domestic sewage due to
the construction workers water use.  This will mainly be concentrated at
temporary living accommodation locations. The construction of the substation
will need 40-50 workers for 10-12 months.  They will discharge 10-20m3 of
sewage per day after treatment by septic tank, and will give little impact on the
surrounding waters.
4.2.8 In general, the accommodation for transmission line construction workers will
be concentrated near existing towns and not at the constructing sites. The
domestic sewage produced by the builders can then be discharged in the
r
4-5



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                       Power Consult
sewage treatment system of the town.
* Dust
4.2.9 The fugitive dust produced by construction of substations and transmission
lines will cause a limited increase in the TSP levels in the atmosphere within a
small distance from the construction sites. Dust particles will generally be
relatively large (>30 gLm) and so will settle from the atmosphere rapidly. Such
impacts are those to be expected on any construction site, will be temporary and
will recover immediately following the construction period.
* Noise
4.2.10 The environmental impacts during construction are mainly those incurred by
construction noise in the substations, while the noise incurred by transmission
line construction is very small.
4.2.11 The principal construction machinery in substation construction are mixers,
bulldozers, excavators and trucks etc., with their sound emission power roughly
of 90-130dB.
4.2.12 Each 220kV substation site will occupy a land area of approximately 4ha.
Based on the substation buildings arrangement and predicted utilisation of
construction machinery, the noise level are predicted as:
Table 4.2-5 Construction Site Boundary Noise Prediction
Distance (m)      1         10        20        50        100
Noise  level  Leq 67        65        64        61        57
dB(A)
4.2.13 Building construction will mainly be carried out during the day time.
Consequently, substation construction noise levels will satisfy the requirement
7OdB(A) in the 'Construction Site Boundary Noise Limit "(GB12523-90)
* Mineral Resources
4.2.14 The site of substations and tower foundations will not be built over any known
mineral resources and so will not affect the development of minerals.
* Impact orn Land Utilisation
4.3.15 During substation and transmission line construction, there will be some land
used temporarily, such as passageways for equipment transportation, personnel
E
4-6



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
access, pylon foundation construction sites etc. These areas should be retumed
to agriculture immediately after completion of construction. The damage of the
crops and plants incurred by transient land use is only temporary.
4.2.16 Farm crops and trees on the 33.66ha occupied by substations will be
destroyed. The construction of the transmission lines and tower foundations will
result in loss of 12.28 ha of farm crops and plants.
4.2.17 There are economic compensation requirements for loss of farm crops, trees
and land. To mitigate impacts associated with resettlement, Hunan Electric
Power Development Project Resettlement Plan was drafted in accordance with
the World Bank's Operational Direction (OD) 4.03 (Involuntary Resettlement)
and the "PRC Land Administration Law" and relevant Hunan Provincial
Govemment regulations.
4.2.18 The PRC Land Administration Law and Provincial regulations require that
individuals and/or collectives must be compensated for loss of land, standing
crops and resettlement.  Formulas for compensation are provided in the
provisions of the PRC Land Administration Law. These are -designed to ensure
that the living standards of affected people will not be reduced as a result of the
development.
4.3 Ecology
F Flora
4.3.1 The transmission lines are 10km from the nearest boundary of Dongtinghu
Lake nature reserve, 15km from Hengshan nature reserve, and over 30km from
the boundaries of other reserves (Fig 14). Construction will not affect any rare
wild species or natural ecological environment.
4.3.2 Constructing transmission lines in hilly areas with tree plantations, any trees
encroaching within the clearance requirements (see Table 2.3-4) will be cut. A
total of 17500 trees will be felled (mostly pine and secondly tea-oil camellia).
4.3.3 The region has more than thousand years history of human activity and
agricultural production. As a result there is only farmland, artificial forest and
shrubbery grove and there are no remains of the original vegetation in the area.
* Fauna
4.3.4 The major protected animal species is the pangolin, which occurs in Hengshan
V             Nature Reserve. The construction of the project will not affected the living
4-7



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                       Power Consult
environment of the pangolin.
4.3.5 The fauna within 10km of the transmission line routes mainly comprises hare,
snake, fox, pheasant, wild pig, wolf, wild duck, weasel and hedgehog. There are
no records of endangered animals that could be affected.
4.4 Social Environment
4.4.1 Based upon "Aerial power line design technical regulation" SDJ3, PRC "Inland
river navigation criteria" BDJ 139-90, and other relevant technical regulations
and prescriptions, the permissible distances for power transmission lines to
cross obstacles are shown in Table 2.3-3.
* Traffic
4.4.2 The requirements for transmission lines to cross highways, railways and rivers
are shown in Table 4.2-3 and Table 4.2-4.
4.4.3 While transmission lines are erected to cross highways or railways, supports
will be used. There will be no impact on traffic.
4.4.4 The erection of transmission lines across navigable river courses, such as
Xiangjiang River, Leishui River, Zhishui River, Youshui River etc., will have
transient impacts on navigation for less than 6 hours in each case.
* Power Transmission Lines
4.4.5 Power lines of less than 11OkV being crossed by the 220kV power
transmission lines are shown in Table 4.2-3 and Table 4.2-4. The transmission
lines are to cross 147 transmission lines of <110kV.
4.4.6 The lines will be designed according to "Aerial power line design technical
regulation" SDJ3 and relevant technical regulations and prescriptions with
sufficient safety margins (see Table 2.3-3). The transmission line will not have
any impact on existing power lines during construction.
* Agricultural Production
4.4.7 The farm fields occupied by temporary access to pylon construction sites will
be returned to agriculture as soon as possible after the completion of
construction. However, some crops will be destroyed affecting the agricultural
harvest.   Such losses will be subject to compensation of land occupants
according to Chines laws and regulations (including "PRC Land Administration
4-8



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
Law")
* Communications
4.4.8 The power transmission lines to cross a total of 136 grade 1, II or IlIl
communication lines.  The crossing places will be designed according to
'Telecommunication lines risking power lines influences design regulation"
GB5033-94, and so will have no impact on telecommunication lines.
* Impact on Cultural Resources
4.4.9 Culture, education, health care and recreation facilities will not be affected
during the construction period, because within a 1km range of substations and
transmission lines, there are no hospitals, schools or recreation facilities.
* Historic relics.
4.4.10 Cultural relics departments and other relevant departments at various
locations along the lines were consulted (see Table 4.5-1). Within 3km of the
substations, and transmission lines, there are no recorded historic relics either
above ground or underground. Construction will have no impact on any historic
relics, either directly or through the construction of access roads.

* Impact on Scenic Areas.
4.4.12 The nearest recognised scenic area within the vicinity of the transmission
lines is Yueyang Building, 4 km away. The construction will have no adverse
I
4-9



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                       Power Consult
impact on this.
* Impact on Landscape
4.4.13 The transmission lines are mainly in countryside and hilly areas not
recognised for their scenic value. It is therefore considered that there will be
little significant impact on surrounding landscape during construction.
* Imported Labour Force
4.4.14 The major tasks in constructing high voltage power transmission lines and
220kV substations will be undertaken by professional personnel from the electric
power industry. These personnel are all trained in specialised technologies, and
will come from within the province. Owing to the fact that the work is of
specialised nature, the local people are not suitably qualified. Therefore, the
non-local labour will have no confrontation with locals over job opportunities.
4.4.15 The construction will possibly require the employment of some local people
to undertake logistic services.  It can thus provide some temporary job
opportunities. Typically 7-8 construction workers and 3-4 local farmers will be
employed for 7-10 days for the construction of each pylon. Each substation
would require 10-30 construction workers and 10-20 local farmers over a
construction period of approximately 1 year.
4.4.16 The construction workforce will increase the consumption and demands of
social commodities and services. They will require food stuffs, daily necessities
and other services which will lead to an acceleration of social commodities
circulation and further development of service trades.
4.4.17 There will be a demand for building materials and transportation by project
construction personnel and that of social commodities and tertiary industries.
This will directly or indirectly create job opportunities to promote the
development of local economy and the enhancement of part of the people's
living standards.
* Land Occupation and Resettlement
4.4.18 Based upon the current engineering progress and the results of primary
design relocation requirements are shown in Tables 2.2-1 and 2.3-1. The
substations ,ill occupy a total area of 33.66ha, require resettlement 994 people
in 174 families, remove 8876m2 of houses.
4.4.19 The transmission line pylon foundations land area and house removal
4-10



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
requirement are shown in Table 2.3-1. The tower foundations will occupy
approximately 12.28ha, remove 21000m2 of houses, and require resettlement
of 286 people from 72 families. Specific resettlement plans have been compiled
by Hehai University and Hunan Provincial Electric Power Company.
4.4.20 The land occupation and resettlement compensation are undoubtedly
important aspects of the project construction. The project constructor, Hunan
Provincial Electric Power Company, has given special consideration to this task.
This EIA Report only provides an outline sketched in principles adopted to tackle
this problem.
4.4.21 Under Chinese law, the proprietary right of land is owned by the State. The
peasant individuals and commercial enterprises only have a right to use land.
The State plans land use and manages it in a unified way. The land requisition
activities of the project construction institution should strictly follow the relevant
requisition procedures according to P. R. China "Land Management Law' and
other relevant laws and regulations. For the current occupants, land use rights
and ground surface facilities, such as factory buildings and crops etc., should be
economically compensated according to the relevant laws and regulations. This
is designed to guarantee that the work, income and living standard of the
affected population is not reduced.
4.4.22 Because of the potential for adverse impacts to the population affected, if
compensation and relocation arrangements are not adequate, the govemments
of various localities and at various levels consider this issue very seriously.
They ensure adequate compensation according to the relevant laws and
provision of other arrangements to solving employment problems and house
rebuilding. Organisations are established to manage and supervise the entire
a             process to minimise impacts arising from land requisition and house removal.

5.2 Natural Environment
* Waters
5.2.1 Tower foundations will be built in Dongfeng Lake to occupy 400m2 of water
area, and have negligible impact on it.
5.2.2 Towers will not be constructed in the river for spanning Xiangjiang River,
Leishui River, Zhishui River, Yuanjiang River etc. There will be no impact on
river waters.
5.2.3 During operation period, there are less than 20 personnel in a 220kV
substation, producing up to lOt/day of domestic sewage. This will be treated by
septic tank and have very small impact on surrounding environment.
5.2.4 The Chinese Govemment has promulgated 'Waste containing polychlorinated
biphenyl pollution controlling criteria"GB13015-91. Currently, the substations are
prohibited to use equipment containing PCB.  Therefore, no PCB will
contaminate the surrounding environment.
- Atmospheric Environment
5.2.5 The operation of substations and transmission lines will have no impact on the
atmospheric environment.
- Acoustic Environment
5.2.6 The measured audible noise level under the 220kV Tianding to Xiangshuiba
line, in Changsha, under normal power frequency this year, was 39.2-41.7dB(A)
during daytime. At 20m from the corridor centreline, 36.3-37.6dB(A) was
recorded.  It is expected that, under normal power frequency conditions, the
noise under the newly built transmission line corridors will be well below
50dB(A). This will meet the limiting values of 6GdB(A) during day time and
5OdB(A) in night, as stipulated in 'Urban area environment noise standard"
(GB3096-93) 2nd class standard.
5.2.7 The substation noises mainly come from major transformers etc. The noises
of major transformers measured at 5m are between 64.3 and 69.7dB(A). Based
upon these results, at the boundary of the 220kV Tianding substation, the noise
levels are 39.9-44.0 dB(A) during the daytime and 37.8-41.9dB(A) at night. It is
expected that, the boundary noise of the proposed new 220kV substations will all
meet the 11 class standard limiting value of 60 dB(A) during daytime and 50

6.3 Ecology
* Rare Birds and Wild Animals
5.3.1 Dongfenghu substation, 11 km of Huaneng Yueyang Power Plant to
Dongfenghu lines, and 2x5 km of Yueyang to Xinshi line joining Dongfenghu
substation, are 10 km from the boundary of Dong Dongtinghu Nature Reserve.
5.3.2 In the nature reserve, the protected birds are, Siberian white crane, hooded
crane, white-naped crane, Mergus squamatus, red-crowned crane, Gruidae
etc.,.
5.3.3 Near the 220kV transmission line to be newly built, there have been 220kV
power transmission lines which have operated for 8 years. According to a
collaborative survey by Chinese and foreign omithologists in 1996, species of
birds in the nature reserve have increased from 158 to 206, an increase of 48
species. It is therefore thought that the 220kV transmission lines will not affect
the bird's living environment and migration in Dong Dongtinghu nature reserve.
5.3.4 Concerning possible interference of transmission lines on bird migration, a bird
expert* and animal expert' considered it unlikely that there would be any
significant interference with migratory birds in this area.

** Prof. Cheng Jianxiu, Nanjing University, Tel: 025-3593389
5.3.5 Hanshou substation and Ganshi to Yiyangbei jointing Hanshou substation
2x7km transmission lines are 20km from the boundary of Dongtinghu (lake) and
consequently no significant impact is predicted.
5.3.6 Huaneng Yueyang Power Plant to Dongfenghu lines pass around the
boundary of Dongtinghu, to within 500m. The lake supports Chinese river
dolphin and finless porpoise but there will be no influence on these from the
proposed developments.
5.3.7 The project transmission lines are 15km from the boundary of Hengshan
Mountain, and have no impact on Chinese pangolin to be protected in the
Hengshan Mountain area.
5.3.8 There are no wild animals to be protected within 30km of other transmission
lines of the said project

* Agriculture and Forestry
5.3.9 The areas of Wangcheng, Hengbei and Hanshou substations are originally
planted with trees, tea-oil camellia, rice and rape: the areas of Qiyang, Jiahe,
Yongzhou and Chenbei substations are on hills covered by shrubbery and
coyongrass; the areas of Furong substation is a residential area, from which the
residents will be resettled. The substations will occupy 2.5ha farmland and 6ha
forest land and 25.16ha uncultivated hills.  After these substations are
commissioned, the land use will be permanently converted into industrial land.
5.3.10 The transmission lines will cross farmland, forest and hills.  Tower
foundations will occupy the total of 12.28ha.
5.3.11 When the transmission line is to cross forest, or trees planted at road and
river sides, any trees not conforming with the clearance requirements in Table
2.3-3, are to be felled. It is expected that 17500 trees will be cut, of which the
majority are pine and secondly tea-oil camellia.
5.3.12 The requirements of the PRC Land Administration Law are that levels of
compensation are sufficient to ensure that no economic losses or reduction in
living standards will be suffered by individuals and/or collectives that lose land,
buildings or crops as a result of the development.
5.3.13 After completion of the transmission lines agricultural cultivation can still be
carried out under the power lines and there will be no impact on the original land
usage.
5.4 Communication Infrastructure
* Vehicles
5.4.1 Designed according to 'Aerial power transmission line design technical
regulation"  SDJ3 and relevant aerial transmission line crossing highway
technical regulations and relevant prescriptions (see Table 2.3-3), the
transmission line will keep sufficient net height to have no impact on traffic.
5.4.2 Designed according to criteria and prescription in PRC "Inland river navigation
standard" GBJ139-90 and "Aerial power transmission line Design technical
Regulation" $DJ3 (see Table 2.3-3), the transmission lines will keep sufficient
net height to have no impact on navigation.
5.4.3 Designed according to 'Aerial power transmission line design technical
regulation"  SDJ3  and  relevant  aerial* power transmission       line

Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
crossing railway prescriptions and technical regulation (see Table 2.3-3), the
transmission line, will keep sufficient net height to have no impact on railway
operation.
5.4.4 When transmission line double circuits are to be erected on the same pylon,
the conductors should be arranged in reverse phases to weaken the ground
surface electric field intensity.
5.4.5 Based upon the measured results of existing 220kV power transmission line
ground surface electric field intensity, the maximum ground surface field intensity
does not exceed 4kV/m.  This is less than the publicly acknowledged
requirement of 7kV/m in crossing highways in China. Thus no impact is
predicted.
* Power Transmission Lines
5.4.6 Designed according to "Aerial power transmission line design technical
regulation" SDJ3 and relevant technical regulations and prescriptions, the 220kV
power transmission lines will operate above the existing 110kV lines and so have
no impact on their operation.
* Telephone, Radio and Television Communications
5.4.7 Wire communication cables are mainly affected by electromagnetic induction
from 220kV power transmission lines and by high frequency electromagnetic
interference signals produced by transmission lines when corona discharge has
occurred. According to the regulations, the angle the transmission line crossing I
grade communication cable should not be smaller than 450, crossing 11 grade
lines should not be smaller than 300 and crossing IlIl grade there is no
requirement.
5.4.8 Designed strictly according to 'Allowable value for telecommunication lines
risking power line influences' (GB6830-86,) 'Design regulation of
telecommunication lines risking power lines influences" (DL5033-94), "Preventing
from and solving power lines interfering and endangering the communication
signal lines principled agreement" (Electric Power and Water Conservancy
Ministry,.Railway Ministry, Telecommunication and Post Ministry, Signal Corps
Ministry), 'Preventing Power lines from endangering the telecommunication lines
and their protective design technical prescriptions"(SDGJ79-88), the 220kV
transmission lines will have no impact on wire communication line normal
operation.
5-6



Hunan Power Development Project (Paft B)                       Power Consult
5.4.9 Designed strictly according to "Protective interval between aerial power line
and  Amplitude-modulation  broadcast  receiving  station"  (GB7495-85),
"Requirement of electro-magnetic environment for short wave radio direction
finding service (station)"(GB13614-92), "Protective requirement of electro-
magnetic environment for radar station against air raid situation" (GB13618-92)
and other technical prescriptions, the power transmission lines have kept
sufficient intervals with radio communication, broadcast and radio transmitters.
The power transmission line radio interference level will be lower than permitted
values. Therefore, the electro magnetic interference produced by corona in
220kV power transmission line operation will have no impact on radio
communication, broadcast and radio station norrnal operations.
5.5 Agriculture
5.5.1 Pylon foundations will occupy approximately 12.28ha, of which 3.Oha will be
farm fields, effecting agricultural harvest.
5.5.2 Substations will occupy approximately 33.36ha, of which 2.5ha will be
farmland, effecting agricultural harvest.
5.5.3 Thus in total, the transmission line pylon foundations and substations will
occupy approximately 5.5 ha of farm fields. Each ha produces approximately 15
tons grain annually.  The annual harvest will consequently decrease by
approximately 83 tons. Individuals and collectives affected by this loss will be
fully compensated for their losses.
5.5.4 The transmission line pylon foundations in the farm field will bring some
inconvenience to mechanised cultivation.  However, the land under the
transmission line corridor can continue to plant farm crops, not effecting the
original land function and agricultural harvest.
5.5.5 Where houses have been demolished within the transmission line corridor the
land can be reclaimed to plant farm corps.
5.6 Cultural Resources, Scenic Areas and Relics
5.6.1 The transmission lines and substations have, by design, avoided schools,
hospitals, cultural relics and scenic spots. Therefore, their operation will have no
adverse effects on these.
5.6.2 In selecting sites, substations have avoided historical relics and scenic and
tourist areas. The substations are all at least 4km from the nearest boundary of
5-7



Hunan Power Development Pnrject (Part B)                        Power Consult
those areas.
5.6.3 The power transmission line are to avoid, as far as possible, residential
quarters, urban and township planned areas, scenic and preservation spots,
cultural relics, historic relics, tourist areas, sanatoria, nature reserves and
wetlands etc.. Therefore, the power transmission lines will have no unfavourable
impact on the surrounding landscape.
5.7 Electric Fields
5.7.1 The transmission line operation will possibly exert impacts on human health.
Statistical results of eletro-magnetic fields have been measured at part of the
currently existing 220kV power transmission line and substations in Hunan
province.
- 220kv Power Transmission Line
5.7.2 Currently in China, research on the ground surface electric field intensities of
power transmission lines mainly concentrate on 500kV and above. In general,
insulation is only considered for 220kV power transmission lines and not the
electric field intensity. Refer to uthe electrostatic induction of EHV transmission
line and substations* (draft for examination, concentrated on 500kV), the ground
surface electric field intensity limiting value against power transmission line
(details in Appendix D) are:
Line situation                     Field intensity limiting value
Crossing farm field                   9.5kV/m
Crossing highway                      7kVlm
Crossing or close to residential building    4kV/m
5.7.3 There are also limiting values of electric field intensity for high voltage power
transmission line abroad, such as US Oregon State (9kV/m), Minnesota State
and North Dakota State (all to be 8kV/m) etc.
5.7.4 The maximum ground electric field intensities of 220kV power transmission
lines observed in China all are smaller than 9kV/m. In fact, under most
situations, the line ground electric field intensities are all smaller than 5kV/m;
5.7.5 This year, the existing electric field intensities were measured   under  the  f
5-8



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                       Power Consult
220kV Tianding to Xiangshuiba double circuit using the same transmission
towers as would be used in this project. The monitored results show that, the
maximum electric field intensities of power transmission line are all smaller than
3kV/m.
5.7.6 In the USA, Bonneville Power Administration have had its great many 500kV
power transmission lines electric field intensities measured with their average
max. field intensity only to be 3.7kV/m (power frequency 60Hz)
- 220kV substation outgoing line
5.7.7 In China, the maximum ground electric field intensity of existing 220kV
substation outgoing lines is less than 7kV/i. In fact, electric field intensities are
mostly less than 3kV/m;
5.7.8 The max. ground electric field intensity in Changsha Tianding and Shumuling
substations outgoing lines are less than 3kV/m based on our monitoring under
existing power frequency.
5.7.9 Based upon this survey, it can be predicted that this project 220KV power
transmission line (to be newly built) ground electric field intensity can satisfy the
requirements of the standards in "The electrostatic induction of EHV
transmission line and substations". This is a draft document (in Chinese) for
discussion, which mainly concentrates on 500kV systems. There are no specific
220 kV transmission line and substation standards in China. The power
transmission line conductors of double circuits on the same pylon will be
arranged in reverse phase to weaken the ground field intensity.
- Substations
5.7.10 "The electrostatic induction of EHV transmission line and substations" (draft
for discussion, concentrating on 500kV systems), defines ground surface electric
field intensity limiting values against power substations as:
Area                              Field intensity limiting value
Power distribution installation area  10kV/m (the area <Sm  can be 10-
15kV/rn)
Operation working area            8kV/m
Power distribution installations  5kV/m (not between out-going-line)
enclosure wall
5-9



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                       Power Consult
5.7.11 The actual measurement results show that the maximum electric field
intensity values of 220kV substation, even in the direction of the outgoing-line
are all smaller than 3kV/m. The maximum values of actually measured ground
electric field intensities in the 220kV outgoing line direction are 1.53kV/m in
Tianding substation and Shumuling substations (see Appendix D).
5.7.12 Based upon these results, the maximum ground electric field intensities will
be less than 5kV/m and are predicted to satisfy the requirement of relevant
prescriptions.
- Impact on human health.
5.7.13 In nature, when thunder is impending, the ground electric field intensity can
reach as high as 20kV/m, but for very short periods. Compared with this, the
ground electric field intensities at power transmission lines and substations are
much smaller, but are obviously sustained levels.
5.7.14 Considering the possible human health effects of electro-magnetic fields
produced by power transmission lines and substations, many countries (such as
USA, Germany, Russia, Canada and Sweden) have carried out a lot of
research. Most research shows that there is no evidence to show the electric
field produced by power transmission equipment is harmful to human health.
5.7.15 The routing of power transmission lines has avoided schools, hospitals and
residential quarters or other sensitive areas. Therefore, the power transmission
lines have no effect on the above mentioned sensitive areas.
5.7.16 Within 50m of substations, there are no residents. Considering that the
electromagnetic-field will decrease with increasing distance, the electromagnetic
field incurred by substation operation have no impact on resident's health.
5.7.17 Changsha Furong substation is to be built in a steel and concrete building
and use underground cables in and out. The electromagnetic field of Furong
substation will be attenuated by the walls and will be reduced in strength so as
to have no significant impact on outside residents.
- Impact on Ecology
5.7.18 There have been some studies conceming the impact of electric fields. The
major research results are extracted as follow.
* Electric fields will not effect the growth of farm crops and other plants;
5-10



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                       Power Consult
* No unfavourable impacts have been recorded on wild animal behaviour or
health attributable to electric fields. Under field intensities as high as 12kV/m,
domestic stock health and behaviour is not effected.
* Many factors indicate that fishes are not likely feel the electric field produced
by power transmission lines. In fact, the transmission line is usually high over
the water surface, so the electric field produced in water is negligible.
* The electric field produced by transmission line does not have unfavourable
impact on birds.
* Even under corona when the noise is loudest, various livestock's and wild
animals' activities proceed as usual under power line corridor.  Some
research results show that the transmission line audible noise has nothing
effect on wild animal habitat.

7.1.5 Install accident oil pond within substations.  Install bunds for equipment
containing oil. Oil contaminated water to be treated by water being separated from
oil and released after attaining the discharge standards. Oil recovered will be sent
to the Power Supply Bureau for recycling or disposal. Domestic sewage to be
treated by septic tank and discharged after attaining standard.
7.1.6 The trucks entering into the station should, according to regulations, be installed
with metal trailing wires so that they are grounded.
7.1.7 The station electric equipment's noise levels should be strictly controlled, with
corresponding. standards being used in their purchase specification. In design,
working and living places should be situated as far from noise sources as possible.
The control room etc. can adopt sound isolating, silencing measures.
7.1.8 The substation should as much as possible be afforested to absorb dust, reduce
noise and enhance visual appearance.  Afforestation coefficient should be
approximately 10%.

7.2 Transmission Lines
7.2.1 Power transmission line environmental mitigation proposals and costs are
indicated in Table 7.2-1.
* Construction period
7.2.2 When construction is close to residential properties, it should as much as
possible adopt construction machinery with low noise emissions to reduce their
impact. Construction should avoid working at night.
7.2.3 When construction close to residential properties, it should apply protective
enclosures to reduce construction fugitive dust in giving impact on the surrounding
environment. The construction access road should be sprayed with water when
needed to minimise environmental impacts incurred by fugitive dust.
O Operation period
7.2.4 In project planning and preparation, collecting information, site surveying, routing
design, and altemative scheme comparisons, throughout the design process,
opinions from various level govemments and local population along the route have
been attended to. As far as possible the proposals avoid urban, township planned
areas, residential quarters and scenic spots.
7.2.5 By design, the project has maintained a certain distance from residential quarters
and sensitive areas to satisfy the requirements in relevant design regulations and
of the environment. These requirements are. for power transmission line corridor
50m wide; within 5m of side-conductors; when maximum deviation in wind, the net
clearance between houses and conductors should not be smaller than 5.0m; when
the electric field intensity on ground surface (1m height) surrounding the houses
would be greater than 3.0kV/m, the dwelling houses would be removed. These
measures, will ensure safe operations in the vicinity of the line.
7.2.6 To strengthen the education and guidance on safety relevant to equipment and
power line for the population in the vicinity of substation and power transmission
line corridor notification should be given that:
* In rain, particularly under thunder and lightening weather conditions, one should
not bring -umbrella with metal handle to pass through power transmission line
corridor;
* In the vicinity of power transmission line corridor, don't hang out washing on a

7.3 Crossing Traffic
7.3.1 Having been designed according to 'Aerial power transmission line design
technical regulation" SDJ3 and other relevant aerial power line crossing highway
technical regulations and prescriptions, the power transmission line will operate
safely.
7.3.2 The power transmission lines have been designed according to 41nland river
navigation standard" BGJ139-90 and other relevant aerial power line crossing river
technical regulations and prescriptions.
7.3.3 When the construction time for crossings are decided, notice should published
immediately to inform relevant departments.
7.4 Agriculture
7.4.1 The measures alleviating the impact on agricultural land incurred by the project
mainly are:
* Construction period
7.4.2 The agricultural land temporarily occupied during construction should be
immediately recovered (within 2 weeks) after construction is completed.
7.4.3 During constructing, aftention should be paid to mitigate the destruction of
planted farm crops, forest, orchard and tea-oil trees, and to compensate for any
destroyed farm crops.
* Operation period
7.4.4 Lands occupied by substations and pylon foundations are permanently
requisitioned land. In engineering design these agricultural lands should be
reduced as much as possible.
7.4.5 Users of the requisitioned agricultural land should be compensated according to
govemment prescriptions.
7.4.6 Pylon -design and construction should minimise the impact on agricultural
mechanised cultivation.
7.4.7 When the engineering conditions permit, the transmission tower should be built
over hills and high land to reduce the number of trees to be cut.
E
7-6



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
7.4.8 When transmission line cross large areas of trees, the height of towers should be
increased properly, treated as big crossings, to reduce the need to fell trees.
7.5 Land Occupation and Compensation
7.5.1 The project construction will occupy some land, with mitigation and
compensation measures as follows:
* Construction period
7.5.2 Land temporarily occupied during construction, such as material and equipment
access routes, should be occupied for as short a time as possible and in as small
an area as possible. It is envisaged that each pylon will require temporary land
occupation for up to 10 days. Access routes need only be 1 m wide, length
depends on location but would typically be 100-500m. Fees will be paid to
compensate for young crops/ seed costs and land rental according to
corresponding prescriptions.
7.5.3 After construction being completed, the occupied lands should be reclaimed
immediately (within 2 weeks).
X Operation period
7.5.4 The substations have been arranged to occupy as little land area as possible.
However, part of the area is to be occupied permanently, for this purpose, the
following measures should be adopted:
- The project constructor should confirm the land category and the lands area
occupied by the project and should have them compensated according to "Land
Management Law' and other laws and regulations and the land requisition
compensation fee paid.
- The local govemment should co-ordinate the compensation In a unified way. Part
of the compensation fees will be given directly to people for their daily living use.
Other compensation fees will be used to implement training programmes designed
to enhance labour skills and to develop other industries such as handicraft industry,
breeding industry and commercial and other tertiary industry to employ redundant
labourers.
7.5.5 In residential areas, the cat-head type straight tower with conductors triangularly
arranged should be adopted as the main tower type.
7.5.6 The labour requirements for operation have been minimised   as  far  as
7-7



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                    Power Consult
possible.
7.5.7 The power transmission line totals 750km long and the project is to build nine
new substations and to extend two 220kV substations. In extending substations,
there are no houses to be removed. The construction of new substations and
power transmission lines will require 29876m2 of houses, 236 families with 1280
persons, to be removed . The major alleviating measures are the following:
- In programming and designing the power transmission line, by routing and site
surveys, collecting information, and listening to peoples' opinion, the proposals
have avoided houses, as far as possible, to reduce resettlement.
- Aiming at reducing houses removal, the transmission line are to adopt 0°-10°
and 100-200 angle-tuming pylons to avoid some densely located houses.
- The project constructor has house removal and resettlement incurred by the
project construction compensated according to "Land management law' and
other relevant prescriptions. This will guarantee the dwelling conditions and
living standards of people affected not to be reduced.
- The government should, as much as possible, arrange unified programmes, for
new residential areas, so that public facilities such as power and water supply,
traffic, communication, culture and education, medical and health care are
optimised.
- For people loosing too much means of production, the govemment will arrange
re-employment (details in ReseKtlement Action Plan).
7.6 Cultural Resources
* Construction period
7.6.1 During construction, if cultural relics are discovered, the constructor would have
the site protected and inform the relevant department in charge of the relics.

* Operation period
7.6.1 In design, the power transmission line should avoid urban areas, townships and
their planned areas. Its routing should cross sparsely populated areas at the
juncture of villages or townships and also steer clear of cultural resources such as
schools.
7.6.2 The both sides of the proposed power transmission lines and 3km range of
substations surroundings have no discovered cultural relics at various levels.
7.7 Landscape
7.7.1 The substations and power transmission lines have been designed to avoid
urban and township planned areas, and so will have no impact on their further
development.  The routing of power transmission line has crossed sparsely
populated areas at village or township junctures.
7.8 Ecology
* Construction period
7.8.1 The trees not satisfying the clearance requirements are to be felled. The
vegetation in the area passed by transmission lines include no rare plant species.
The dominant species are pine, oil-tea camellia and other artificial forest species.
During construction, as few trees should be cut as possible to protect the local
ecological environment.
7.8.2 The temporary disturbance of the ground surface due to construction should be
duly recovered after construction completion to preserve the original ecological
environment.
* Operation period
7.8.3 To plant tree at other places to reduce the impact incurred by trees being cut.
7.8.4 Plant as much vegetation as possible on the substation sites, to get an

afforestation coefficient of at least 10%.
7.9 Safety
7.9.1 The labour safety and protection during construction and operation period will be
by implementation of the requirements of the Labour Ministry 'Temporary
prescriptions relevant to productive construction engineering project professional
safety hygienic supervision" and Ministry of Energy 'The temporary prescriptions
on electric power industrial productive construction engineering project labour
safety and industrial hygiene to implement 'three simultaneous implementation'".
7.9.2 During operation, with respect to operating.workers labour safety and protection,
other than to strictly implement the relevant prescriptions, the operation institution
should also be concemed with operation features of the substation and power
transmission lines to pay attention to the following respects:
* Fire prevention, explosion proofing, dust proofing.
- Prevention from electric shock injury, mechanical harm and other injury.
* Noise proofing, cold proofing, damp proofing.
* The railings surrounding substations and metal structures should be grounded
in segments to ensure safety.

9 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
9.1.1 The opinions and requirements of various circles in society have been
extensively solicited and collected by the following forms:
(1) In the process of routing and design: listening extensively to the opinions of
government departments at various levels.
(2) In the process of design, Hunan Provincial Electric Power Co. and Hunan
Electric Power Design Institute, have visited relevant institutions, called
symposium to extensively solicited opinions from various departments on 220kV
power transmission engineering project construction.
(3) Inviting experts to demonstrate the design scheme.
(4) In routing and site optimisation, visiting the local population.
(5) Carrying out specific surveys along the line with public participation.
9.1.2 In engineering planning and preparation, the project has been reported to and
consulted functional departments on the engineering necessity, building scale
and taken their opinions.
9.1.3 Various symposia have been called to extensively solicit the opinions on
project construction and its environment protection with respect to the route
selection from govemment functional departments, experts, peoples' congress
delegates and women's representatives.
9.1.4 Aiming at selecting the optimal route and substation sites to reduce residential
house removal and avoid nature reserves, scenic spots, county and township
planned areas and cultural and historic relics, the design departments at various
lines segments have put forward many schemes for local govemments,
functional departments, experts and peoples representatives to discuss,
compare and screen altemative routes.
9.1.5 In designing the route scheme, the design department has visited along the
line the Planning Commission, Urban Construction Bureau, Programming
Bureau, State Land Administration, Agriculture Bureau, Forestry Bureau, Culture
Bureau, Traffic Bureau, Broadcast And TV Bureau, Telecommunication and Post
Department, Railway and Highway Department in all relevant municipalities and
solicited their opinions.

Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
9.1.6 The opinions are summarised in the following:
* The power transmission engineering construction has no impact on the
construction and planning of cities and towns along the line.
* The engineering construction has no impact on the traffic on highway, river,
railway and navigable course.
* The engineering construction has no impact on the communication and
broadcasting etc.
* The engineering construction has no impact on the exploitation and utilisation
of underground mineral resources, and also does not cover and pass over
the mine.
* The engineering construction has no impact on cultural relics, famous places
and historic relics, nature reserve tourist scenic spots and natural landscape
in the vicinity of the lines.
* Supporting the project construction, which will alleviate power shortages in
Hunan Province, promote the economical development and environmental
protection in this province, and increase the local people's living quality.
9.1.7 Aiming at extensively soliciting opinions on the transmission lines engineering
and its environmental impact problems from various circles in society, symposia
have been called and questionnaires distributed to carry out a public
participation survey at 23 points along the lines route. The public participating
survey points are shown in Table 9.1-1.
9.1.8 At public participation meetings the representative of the Project constructor
(HEPC) gives a general introduction about the propose, construction scale,
schedule  and  the   situation   during   planning,  construction   and
operation/maintenance of the Project.  This takes 30-45 minutes.  The
representative of environmental assessment unit (NEPRI) gives a speech about
(i) the environmental status quo of the local area, (ii)the possible environmental
impact incurred by the Project during its construction and operation/maintenance
period, the mitigation measures that will de adopted, the environmental
management plan and the environmental monitoring plan of the Project
construction and operation/maintenance period, and (iii) the land use and
resettlement situation if needed. This takes about one hour. A detailed
discussion follows between the Project constructor, the environmental expert of
NEPRI and the representatives of local people about the environmental issues of

Hunan Power Development Project (Part B)                     Power Consult
concem.  This generally requires more than an hour.  Finally the public
participation questionnaires will sent out during the meeting and are taken back
for analysis.
9.1.9 The surveys have distributed 340 public opinion questionnaires (Table 9.1-2),
reclaimed 327, (96% response rate).  Among those responding, 25% were
educated to primary school level and 75% to above junior middle school level.
Among those responding, women representatives share 20% of the total. The
results are shown in Table 9.1-3.
9.1.10 The land occupied by the line and tower foundation in the engineering should
be compensated economically and the redundant labour should be assisted in
various ways to guarantee enhancing their living standards.
9.1.11 The removed residential houses along the line incurred by the engineering
construction should be sufficiently compensated to guarantee their living
standards are not being lowered after relocation.
9.1.12 The farm crops affected by engineering construction should be reduced to
the minimum. Farmers whose crops are affected should be given appropriate
economic compensation.
9.1.13 In order to minimise impact to mechanised cultivation, the power
transmission line tower should adopt self-standing towers rather than guyed
towers.
9.1.14 None of the participants at the meetings considered that electric fields
resulting from transmission lines or substations are a significant human health
issue. There is already an extensive network of 220 kV transmission lines in
Hunan Province and no health related problems have been identified that would
give rise to public concem.

6 Conclusions: Operating Period
Based upon the results of survey of analogous locations with the same kind 220kV
power transmission lines and substation predictions have been made of potential
impacts from this development

The 220kV transmission line to be built by the said project has a corridor with width
of 50m.
From these noise monitoring results, the day and night time noises at line corridor
are all lower than 5OdB(A). Thus the project 200kV power transmission line corridor
can be predicted to satisfy the requirement of daytime 6OdB(A) and nigh time
5OdB(A) in GB3096-93.
In the same manner, by analogous comparison with 220kV power substations
already in commission, the substation boundary noises are all lower than 5OdB(A)
both at day time and at night. Considering the plan arrangement of various
substations and noise-alleviating-measures to be adopted, we can predict that the
substation boundary noise (lm outside of enclosure will be lower than 6OdB(A) at
day time and lower than 50dB(A) at night, also satisfying the requirement of relevant

Appendix D
ELECTRIC FIELD INTENSITY
Power Transmission Line and 220kV Substation
The ground surface power frequency electric field intensity were measured inside
and outside of the enclosure of two built 220kV transmission line and 220kV power
substations at Changsha municipality, Hunan Province in Nov., 1997. The power
frequency field intensity-monitoring instrument used in on-site measurement was the
HI-3604 power frequency field intensity monitoring instrument made in U.S.A.
Holaday Co.
According to relevant criteria in China, the requirements the ground surface field
intensity at power substation and under power transmission line should satisfy are:
1. The limiting undistorted electric field value at 1.5m above the ground surface at
enclosure of power substation power distribution apparatus (non-outgoing line
direction) is 5kV/m, that at line outgoing direction, stipulated by line portion.
2. The limiting undistorted electric field value at 1.5m above the ground surface
under power transmission line is 9.5kV/m, when across farm field, 7kV/m when
across highway.
3. The undistorted electric field intensity at 1.5m above the ground inside power
substation under normal operation condition is, in general, not greater than 10kV/m,
that at a little part area, is promised to reach 10-15kV/m.
4. When power transmission line neighbours on or crosses residential housing, the
maximum undistorted electric field intensity limiting value at the house should be
<3.0kV/m.
The following power substation and power transmission line electro-magnetic
environmental assessments are carrying out all according to these criteria.
I Changsha Municipality 220kV Shumuling substation
The two monitoring items carried out in Shumuling power substation were ground
surface electric firld intensity monitored at high voltage outgoing line side with 220kV
main transformer within the substation and that, in the vicinity of a residential house
under 220kV outgoing line outside of the enclosure (Fig. D-1)
D-1



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B) APPENDIX D          Power Consult
Ground surface electric field intensity monitoring at main transformer 220kV
outgoing line side in Shumuling power substation (Fig D-2).
The 220kV main transformer is a three phase one. There are cement support pillars
for high voltage line suspension frame about 7m distant to high voltage side at left
and right side, among which, the left side cement pillar has a grounding line.
During monitoring, the measuring electrode of field intensity meter is 1.5m above the
ground with atmospheric condition temperature be 200C relative humidity, 75%.
The ground surface measuring points distribution is as the following
Measured data are following:
Measuring points   a   b   c   d   e   f   g   |h  1i  j>
Field intensity (kV/m) 1.85 1.13 1.20 1.37 1.38 1.22 1.02 0.80 0.53 0.52 0.
Measuring points    I   m   n   o   p   q   r   s   t    u
Field intensity (kV/m) 0.87 0.95 0.85 1.58 1.82 1.58 1.07 1.07 1.28 1f.14
Data analysis: Due to the electric apparatus layout within the power substation being
relatively complicated, the electric field distribution wihin the substation is also
complicated. However, viewed from all measurement results, the maximum. field
intensity among all the ground measuring points is 1.85kV/m, far lower than the
limiting value 10kV/m stipulated by the criterion. Therefore, it will not endanger the
human safety of the operating and maintaining personnel in the power substation.
e The electric field intensity measurement in the vicinity of residential house under
out going line outside of Shumuling power substation enclosure.
Outside of Shumuling power substation enclosure under the 220kV outgoing line
(Yun Shu Line ) corridor between pylon no.85 and pylon no.86, there are some trees
and residential houses. Aimed at comprehending does the power frequency electric
field under power transmission line affect the resident's safety, the monitoring
personnel carried out the measurement of ground power frequency field intensity in
the area in the vicinity of residential houses. No.86 pylon is an angle tuming one
with conductors vertically-arranged upwards; no.85 pylon is one with conductors
triangularly arranged. Under the line, the residential house is about six meters high,
the surroundings of which, except a small patch of ground, are covered by brush or
trees, the big tree in front of the residential house is about 1 Om high.
Atmospheric condition: temperature 200C, relative humidity, 75%.
Point a is located under big tree, b, c, d are located at ground in front of the house,
D-2



Hunan Power Development Project (Part B) APPENDIX D           Power Consult
point e is under house eaves. The transmission line is crossing over the residential
house and big tree.
The measured power frequency electric field intensity data at various measuring
points are the following:
Measuring points    a         b         IC         Id         le
Field intensity (V/m)   17.6  35.0       55.0       54.2       3.0
Measured data analysis: As seen from measured data at various points, the power
frequency electric field intensities in the vicinity of the residential house and under
the tree are all very low, far lower than the limiting value 3.0kV/m, prescribed in the
criteria. Especially that of area (e point) closely neighbouring on the residential
house is smallest. The power frequency field intensity at this level is safe and will
not endanger the human bodies and lives of peoples dwelling in the house.
2 Changsha 220kV Tianding Power Substation
The Tianding Substation has been built on a small mountain in suburb with
Changsha Municipality. With good afforestation inside of and near-by regions
outside of the substation, the air is relatively clean there. The monitoring items
carried out at the Tianding Substation are: the measurement of ground power
frequency field intensity at high voltage outgoing line side of the 220kV main
transformer inside of the substation, and that in the vicinity of outgoing line outside of
the substation enclosure.
, Measurement of ground power frequency field intensity at 220kV main
transformer high voltage outgoing line side inside of Tianding Substation.
The No.2 main transformer in Tianding Substation is a 220kV 3-phase one with high
voltage outgoing line 12.3m above the ground. Over the measuring point (see Fig.
D-3), there is suspension frame for high voltage outgoing line. The measuring points
are selected in the area between the two cement support pillars of the outgoing line
suspension frame.  During measurement, the measurement electrode of field
intensity meter was 1 .5m above the ground.
Atmospheric conditions: temperature, 130C, relative humidity, 80%.
The ground measuring point distribution is shown in the following sketch diagram:
The measured electric field intensity data at various points are as the following:
Measuring points a  b  c  d   e f  g  h   i           k   I   m   n

(kV/m)
D-3



Hunan Power Development Pmject (Part B) APPENDIX D              Power Consult
Data analysis: As seen from measured data at various points, the max. value 4kV/rn
is scarcely a half of the standard limiting value of 1 OkV/m. Therefore, this kind of field
intensity level is safe to personnel within the substation. By comparison, the ground
field intensity at the main transformer high voltage side is higher than that at main
transformer in Shumuling substation. This is relevant to the arrangement of other
electric equipment within the substation and variation of suspension-height of main
transformer high voltage connecting conductor's etc. factors. Therefore, this sort of
variance is acceptable.
2. The measurement of electric field intensity at outside of Tianding Substation
enclosure.
The electric field intensity measuring points outside of Tianding Substation enclosure
are selected at high voltage outgoing line side where the ground field intensity to be
relatively larger. The Tianding Substation outgoing lines have seven circuits,
arranged in parallel within the substation, arranged in triangular double-circuit
outside of substation. All measuring points are located at 4m a distance greater than
enclosure height from outside of enclosure, with conductors over them arranged
basically in parallel. Due to the fact the arrangement of conductors outside of
enclosure is basically the same, i.e. A1-B1-C1-A2-B2-C2-...-A-BrC', so the
measuring area is selected in a typical range (as shown in Fig D-4), among which
the measuring points directly below A2, B2, and C2 are respectively 4.5m, 7m and
1 Om from point 0.
Atmospheric condition: temperature 130C, relative humidity 80%.
The measured data at various points are the following:

Data analysis: The selected measuring area is the relatively typical segment in high
voltage outgoing line side, so it can reflect the ground electric field intensity
distribution of whole high voltage line side. The maximum field intensity value among
those measured 1 .53kV/m, is smaller than standard limiting value 5kV/m. The power
frequency field intensity at this level is safe and will not incur any dangerous impact
