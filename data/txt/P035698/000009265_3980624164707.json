environmental assessment of\n            Phase 2 of the Hunan Power Development Project, which\n            constructs the Leiyang Power Plant--an additional thermal\n            power station using anthracite coal, two transmission lines,\n            and associated substations. These measures mitigate impacts\n            from plant, substation, and transmission line construction\n            and operation: Wastewater, drainage, and domestic sewage\n            will be treated, used in ash sluicing, and the ash water\n            reclaimed later for re-use. The ash lagoon will encroach on\n            vegetation, but not result in any significant habitat loss.\n            A drainage ditch will redirect and recirculate all ash water\n            and ash dam seepage within the power station. Ash\n            by-products will either be stored in lagoons, used in\n            construction, or dried for fly ash use. Control noise by\n            adopting silencers and sound insulation, among other\n            measures. Using a boiler with low NOx combustion technology\n            will control emissions, and studies will decide whether to\n            improve dispersion or further distance the sites from each\n            other. Maintain clearance over trees, other power lines,\n            roads, railways, etc. Suitable species will be planted to\n            replace felled trees and to revegetate. Use water sprays to\n            suppress dust emissions. Collect runoff and let it settle to\n            discharge suspended solid emissions. Collect domestic sewage\n            in septic tanks or sewers. Routing will minimize\n            relocations. Compensate crop loss and project-occupied land,\n            and quickly reinstate land after use."}, "docdt": "1998-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
