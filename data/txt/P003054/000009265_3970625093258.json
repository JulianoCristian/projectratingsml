(a) ensure a reliable supply of electrical energy\n            to the main interconnected networks of Bukavu, Goma, Uvira\n            and Kiliba; (b) make use of the electric energy within the\n            Zaire (Kivu) - Rwanda - Burundi interconnected system; and\n            (c) strengthen Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNEL)\n            as an institution.  These objectives will be achieved\n            through several methods.  The first will be accomplished by\n            (i) rehabilitating the existing Ruzizi I plant and the\n            distribution networks of (a); (ii) completing the\n            rehabilitation of the generation stations and transmission\n            and distribution system in the Shaba Region; and (iii)\n            carrying out urgent maintenance works and improving\n            operation of the Inga hydropower complex.  Secondly, optimal\n            use of electric energy will be achieved through increasing\n            the transmission and distribution capacity of the\n            electricity network in that portion of the Kivu region where\n            there is considerable suppressed demand. Finally, SNEL will\n            be strengthened through better planning, rational pricing,\n            improved financial policies and training of its staff."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
