 Development Policy Credit (DPC) are to support strengthening\n            institutions to promote government efficiency and\n            effectiveness through sound fiscal and public financial\n            management and procurement, and strong public administration\n            as well as to foster private sector development by improving\n            the policy environment and facilitating productive\n            employment opportunities and expand access to infrastructure\n            in a sustainable manner. The project has three components.\n            The first component, on promoting government efficiency and\n            effectiveness, will contribute to the cross-cutting theme on\n            governance in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).\n            Moreover, improved budgetary processes, better fiduciary\n            systems, expanded e-governance, and stronger public\n            administration will strengthen institutional capacity and\n            achieve better quality of services for citizens. The second\n            component, on private sector development, aligns directly\n            with the economic diversification and financial inclusion\n            pillar of the CPS, and the actions taken to enhance\n            employability and improve the policy environment for the\n            private sector will contribute to the corresponding CPS\n            goals. The third DPC component on improving sustainable\n            access to infrastructure will support spatial planning and\n            public services. Institutional strengthening in the roads\n            and urban sectors will ultimately help provide better access\n            and quality, while measures to promote environmental\n            sustainability and disaster risk management will contribute\n            to better environmental stewardship and improved\n            sustainability of infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2010-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
