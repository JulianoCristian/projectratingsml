                    DPC1 supports strengthening institutions to: (i) promote government efficiency
                    and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public financial management and
                    procurement, and strong public administration; (ii) foster private sector
                    development by improving the policy environment and facilitating productive
                    employment opportunities; and (iii) expand access to infrastructure in a
                    sustainable manner.

                    The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering FY11-14 has been
                    prepared, and is closely aligned to the 10FYP. The CPS emphasizes selectivity,
                    and envisages Bank Group support for development in Bhutan based on two
                    broad areas of engagement: (i) economic diversification, job creation, and
                      financial inclusion -- with a view to increased growth and employment led by
Program               the private sector; and (ii) spatial planning and public services -- with a view to
Development           enhanced living standards for increased well-being. These areas are underscored
Objective(s) and      by the cross-cutting themes of capacity building for good governance, and
Contribution to CAS   environment.

                      The objectives of the DPCs are consistent with the new CPS -- since both are
                      derived from the common goal of supporting the implementation of the 10FYP.
                      The three focus areas of the DPCs tie in with the CPS areas of engagement, and
                      support its goals and objectives. The first DPC component on promoting
                      government efficiency and effectiveness will contribute to the cross-cutting
                      theme on governance in the CPS. Moreover, improved budgetary processes,
                      better fiduciary systems, expanded e-governance, and stronger public
                      administration will strengthen institutional capacity and achieve better quality of
                      services for citizens. The second DPC component on private sector development
                      aligns directly with the economic diversification and financial inclusion pillar of
                      the CPS, and actions to enhance employability and improve the policy
                      environment for the private sector will contribute to the corresponding CPS
                      goals. The third DPC component on improving sustainable access to
                      infrastructure will support spatial planning and public services. Institutional
                      strengthening in the roads and urban sectors will ultimately help provide better
                      access and quality, while measures to promote environmental sustainability and
                      disaster risk management will contribute to better environmental stewardship
                      and improved sustainability of infrastructure.
                      The main risks that need to be managed relate to: (i) macroeconomic risk from
                      vulnerability to external shocks -- mitigated by strengthening public expenditure
                      management, as well as by efforts to foster economic diversification and labor
                      market development; (ii) capacity constraints due to the small scale of
Risks and Risks
                      government -- mitigated by the government`s ongoing capacity building efforts
Mitigation
                      (in many areas supported by development partners); (iii) political risk of
                      changing government priorities -- mitigated by the government`s careful
                      preparation and consultation on the new governance arrangements, and
                      commitment to sustaining reforms.

                           IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT
                                     FOR
                 A PROPOSED FIRST DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT
                         TO THE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN

                                      I.      INTRODUCTION

1. This Program Document proposes policy-based budget support to the Royal Government of
Bhutan (RGoB). Assistance is envisaged as a programmatic series of two single-tranche Development
Policy Credits over the next 2-3 years. The operations are designed to align with the RGoB`s reform
program as anchored in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10FYP) (2008/09­2012/13). This document focuses
on the First Development Policy Credit (DPC1) within the broader programmatic framework.

2. Bhutan has consistently been a good performer in the South Asia Region. The RGoB has
recorded impressive progress in implementing its medium-term program of institutional and policy
reforms through its recent transition to democracy. Economic growth averaged almost 9 percent per
annum during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP) (2002/03­2007/08, extended by one year). The per
capita Gross National Income of US$2020 in 2009 is higher than that in other South Asia Region
countries, except the Maldives. Bhutan has already achieved or is on track to achieve most of its
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Despite limitations in capacity, Bhutan is undertaking several
relevant initiatives to promote environmentally sustainable development, reduce corruption before it
becomes a major issue, use its vast hydropower resources to fund socio-economic development,
strengthen fiscal management to counter the impacts of economic volatility, foster private sector
development, and provide employment for the educated youth. With a Transparency International
Corruption Perception Index of 5 in 2009, Bhutan is the least corrupt country in the region.1 Bhutan had a
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating of 3.9 in 2009, which is the highest in the
region. Coupled with strong ratings on the portfolio and governance, Bhutan received an IDA Country
Performance Rating rank of fourth out of 75 active IDA countries worldwide in 2009.2

3. At the same time, Bhutan faces several policy challenges that are recognized in the 10FYP.
Economic volatility remains a concern for the small landlocked country. About 65 percent of the
country`s revenues during the 10FYP are projected to come from electricity and budgetary grants, and the
revenue stream is heavily dependent on the timing of hydropower projects coming onstream, and on
external assistance materializing on schedule. Private sector development is constrained by factors
including limited access to finance, shortage of skilled / educated labor, and transport. Unemployment
among the youth has risen from 2.2 percent in 1998 to 13 percent at present, and there are mismatches
between skills and employment opportunities. Underdeveloped infrastructure constrains the delivery of
public services as well as private sector growth, and access remains a problem in the remote areas.
Despite the rapid expansion of the road network, more than 50 percent of the population lives half a day`s
walk from the nearest motor road. With the urban population projected to reach 50 percent by 2020,
urban development needs attention. Furthermore, given the country`s dependence on environmental
resources and vulnerability to natural disasters, it is critical that development plans continue to be
implemented in a sustainable manner.

4. Bhutan faces a shortage of resources in financing its development agenda over the 10FYP,
even though the overall macroeconomic framework is sound. The new democratically-elected
government that took office in 2008 has put forward an ambitious program in its 10FYP. The RGoB is

committed to maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework over the 10FYP -- in particular, keeping
the actual fiscal deficit to below 5 percent of GDP on average by maintaining prudent expenditure
patterns, and maintaining current expenditures in line with domestic revenues. The economy has run
small fiscal surpluses (inclusive of donor assistance) during 2006/07-2008/09. However, largely on
account of projected ambitious capital expenditures for infrastructure development, an average fiscal
deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP and an average net resource gap of 5 percent of GDP are projected for the
entire 10FYP period.3 The net resource gap over the remaining years of the 10FYP (2010/11-2012/13) is
projected to be almost US$430 million, and the RGoB requires support to finance this.4

5. Bhutan has been adversely affected by external shocks in 2009, which have collectively caused
significant losses. The recent global economic crisis had significant effects on tourism, and convertible
currency revenues from tourism were fell to US$31.8 million in 2009 from US$38.8 million in 2008.
More importantly, 2009 saw two major natural disasters hit the country. First, floods resulting from
Cyclone Aila in May cost the kingdom an estimated US$15 million in damages to infrastructure. Second,
an earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale struck eastern Bhutan in September, and a rapid needs
assessment estimated damages of about US$52 million. Together, these three events resulted in losses
amounting to over 5.2 percent of GDP in 2009.

6. The World Bank has supported the RGoB's development efforts through three budgetary
operations which have achieved good results in promoting institutional reforms. The First and
Second Development Policy Grants (DPGs) were designed as a programmatic series in support of
RGoB`s medium-term reforms.5 They provided US$15 million in FY06 and US$12 million in FY07
respectively, to help the RGoB meet selected development goals, and contributed to deepening the policy
dialogue. With the Kingdom`s move to democracy, culminating in elections in 2007 and 2008, and based
on progress on the medium-term reform program, a Development Policy Financing for Institutional
Strengthening (DPFIS) for US$20.22 million was approved under the FY06-09 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Bhutan. It was designed as a stand-alone operation, anchored in a medium-term
programmatic framework to support the attainment of 10FYP development goals, as requested by the
RGoB.6 All three operations have closed, and have satisfactorily achieved their development objectives.7
Under the operations, Bhutan has introduced several institutional reforms to improve public fiscal and
financial management and procurement, enhance transparency and accountability in public services,
foster private sector development, enhance employment opportunities, promote access to and enhance the
quality of infrastructure, and support environmental sustainability.

7. The RGoB has requested further budget support from the Bank to: (i) deepen its ongoing
program of institutional reforms; and (ii) provide resources for its development agenda. First, as
the two-year old democratically elected government deepens its reform program, Bank assistance will
support the RGoB to highlight its own key development priorities to meet the challenges. Bank support
through budgetary operations has achieved significant success in recent years, and the RGoB would like

  There was an average fiscal deficit of 2.5 percent (including budgetary grants) during the 9FYP. In the absence of these grants,
the 9FYP would have seen an average of fiscal deficit of more than 16 percent.
4
  The RGoB`s fiscal projections define the net resource gap as the fiscal deficit less net project-tied loans. Net loans are loan
disbursements less loan repayments. Calculations use an exchange rate of Nu.44.27 per US dollar.
5
  The DPG series highlighted measures to: (a) enhance the delivery of public services by strengthening fiscal management, (b)
increase the effectiveness of public spending by improving financial management and procurement processes, (c) create better
income earning opportunities by improving the investment climate, facilitating greater labor market flexibility, and increasing
foreign direct investment, (d) raise educational attainment, particularly in previously under-served areas, by expanding access to
high quality education services, and (e) reduce maternal mortality by increasing the number of births delivered in health facilities.

  See Program Document for Bhutan DPFIS, Report No. 47008-BT. The DPFIS supported strengthened institutions to: (a)
promote good governance through sound fiscal and public financial management and procurement, and strong accountability
institutions; (b) foster dynamic labor markets, ensure skills match, and generate employment; and (c) expand access to
infrastructure (roads, hydropower, ICT) in an environmentally sustainable manner.

build on this momentum. Second, the projected resource gap in financing the remaining 10FYP agenda is
about US$430 million, including earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation costs spread over the rest of
the Plan period. Total donor assistance committed in response to earthquake damages amount to only
about US$7 million so far.8 DPC1 funds will help fill almost 25 percent of the currently projected net
resource gap of US$102 million for FY11. Although Bhutan receives significant external assistance in
general, more than 80 percent of this is project-tied -- making programmatic budget support valuable for
its quick disbursement and the flexibility with which it can be deployed.

8. The RGoB has indicated that it wishes to continue with the same three broad components that
were supported under the DPFIS, with some adjustments to reflect ground realities. The DPFIS
reforms were designed to fit closely with the 10FYP priorities of the new government, and remain highly
relevant. The DPCs support strengthening institutions to:
    o Promote government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public financial
        management and procurement, and strong public administration;
    o Foster private sector development by improving the policy environment and facilitating
        productive employment opportunities;
    o Expand access to infrastructure in a sustainable manner.

                                          II.       COUNTRY CONTEXT

9. The Kingdom of Bhutan is a small landlocked country in South Asia, located in the eastern
Himalayas, and bordered by India and China. The Kingdom is home to a population of about 695,000,
spread over an area of 38,394 sq. kms, with about 72.5 percent of the land area under forest cover.9 Much
of the population lives in the central highlands, and almost two-thirds are classified as rural. The terrain
is mostly hilly, with alpine peaks in the north, and some sub-tropical plains in the south. Bhutan is
located along the boundary between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The relative movement and
collision between both plates causes large and frequent earthquakes in the area.10 Bhutan has no
independent seismic zoning map; however the seismic zoning map of India categorizes Bhutan under
Zone V, which is considered seismically as very active. The country is also prone to other disasters such
as landslides, forest fires, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

10. The country has seen significant political changes in recent years. Bhutan's political system evolved
from an absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy, following a decade of planning and
consultations. After 34 years on the throne, the Fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, stepped down on
December 9, 2006, in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. The Constitution was
prepared, following a process led by the Chief Justice, and involving widespread public consultations
within Bhutan, and with the international community.11 The new democratic system comprises a National
Council and a National Assembly, the latter based on political party affiliations. Elections for the
National Council were held on December 31, 2007, while elections for the National Assembly were held
on March 24, 2008. The ruling party, Druk Phuensum Tshogpa, currently holds 45 of the 47 seats in the
National Assembly, and recently completed its second year in office.

8
   The main sources of funds presently include `250 Million from GoI, US$2 million from Government of Kuwait, and Nu. 10
million from philanthropists. US$4 million from the Asian Development Bank is under consideration for reconstruction of
primary schools. The RGoB is supporting the reconstruction effort through provision of materials (Nu. 40 million) as well as
insurance compensation (Nu. 97.5 million) to homeowners for rebuilding their houses. His Majesty's Welfare Fund (Nu. 70
million) is, among other things, financing the cost of free timber for homeowners and its transportation to sites through the
assistance of the Bhutanese Army. An estimate of materials required for housing include about 60,000 CGI sheets (of which
21,000 have already been provided by UNDP).
9
  The first full census of 2005 revealed a population of 672,425 in Bhutan. The National Statistics Bureaus 2009 Statistical Year
Book estimates a population of 695,822 for 2010, and puts the forest cover at 72.5 percent of total land area.
10
   A total of 30 earthquakes have been recorded in Bhutan between 1937 and 1998. Of these, an earthquake on January 21, 1941,
with a magnitude 6.75 on the Richter scale, was the most powerful.

                            A.       Recent Economic Developments in Bhutan

11. The early years of the 10FYP have seen some slowdown in growth rates. Bhutan averaged
about 9 percent annual economic growth during the 9FYP. This was driven largely by hydropower
development, as Bhutan started to effectively tap into its 23,760 MW hydropower potential.12 The
services sector also saw good growth in sub-sectors like tourism, and finance and insurance. The
economy grew at over 13 percent and 11 percent in 2006/07 and 2007/08, as the 1020 MW Tala
hydropower project came onstream in 2006/07, trebling Bhutan`s power generation capacity. Growth
rates in 2008/09 and 2009/10 were about around 6-8 percent, as the effects of the Tala hydropower project
wore off, although construction work on new hydropower projects continued to drive the economy
forward. On the other hand, agriculture grew at just over 1.7 percent per annum since the beginning of
the 9FYP. The share of the primary sector in GDP has been declining steadily, and stands at 15 percent at
present -- down from about a quarter in 2002/03.

12. Despite some volatility, overall fiscal balances have remained under control, with small
surpluses during 2006/07-2008/09. The fiscal deficit (including budgetary grants) has averaged 2.5
percent of GDP over 2002/03-2008/09. At the same time, the fiscal balance has varied from a deficit of
12 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to a surplus of over 7 percent of GDP in 2006/07. The underlying reasons
can be traced to volatility in both total revenues and grants, and expenditure and net lending of the central
government (Figure 1). On revenues and grants, Bhutan`s heavy reliance on foreign grants (particularly
from India) and hydropower revenues have contributed to overall volatility. When Tala came on-stream
on 2006/07, for instance, it boosted domestic revenues by 45 percent over 2005/06. With regard to total
expenditure and net lending, growth ranges from a low of -5.5 percent in 2003/04 to a high of 17 percent
in 2007/08. The factors underlying the swings in expenditure include interest payments to Tala under
current expenditure (which started in 2007/08) and an increase in discretionary capital expenditure in
2007/08, as the new government assumed office. However, strong fiscal discipline and donor assistance
have resulted in small fiscal surpluses during the last three years, and 2008/09 sees a surplus of 1.9
percent of GDP on account of underspending on capital expenditures (Figure 1). Implementation of a
civil services pay hike approved in early-2009 has resulted in current expenditures growing at rates of 15-
25 percent in the last two years, but this has been covered by higher domestic revenues from the
electricity sector. It is worth noting, however, that revised estimates for 2009/10 peg the fiscal deficit at
above 6 percent. Capital expenditures have been revised upwards by more than a quarter (compared to
initial budget estimates for 2009/10) on account of land acquisition for green zone areas of Thimphu city,
construction of cottages for nuns in Punakha, and expenditures incurred to host the South Asia
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in April 2010. Current expenditures are covered
by domestic revenues for both 2008/09 and 2009/10, which is the continuing cornerstone of the RGoB`s
fiscal stance.

13. The external balances also display volatility, even though large grants from India and foreign
aid from Bhutan's development partners have resulted in positive overall outcomes in recent years.
The overall balance of payments has averaged around 6.5 percent of GDP over 2002/03-2008/09 on
account of strong aid inflows, even as the current account deficit has been in the range of about 10.8
percent of GDP over the same period. There has been some volatility, which has come from the current
account. The current account deficit reached a high of 31 percent of GDP in 2004/05, when there were
large imports due to the RGoB`s purchase of aircraft. The situation, however, improved dramatically,
and, in 2006/07, Bhutan`s current account balance ended in a surplus of more than 14 percent of GDP due
to robust growth in export of goods and services, and delay in Tala`s interest payments (Figure 1). The
current account deficit deteriorated from about 2 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to 9 percent of GDP in
2008/09. This deterioration can be attributed to increased imports from government expenditure on

12
  In the hydropower sector, the country has the potential to develop 23,760 MW of capacity, of which only 5 percent has been
tapped so far. See Paragraph 20 for details.
                                                               4
hydropower projects, the interest payments from Tala, and decline in commodity exports (particularly
manufactured and mineral-based products) during the global economic crisis. However, the overall
balance of payments surplus actually improved from 3.8 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to 8.7 percent of
GDP in 2008/09 -- helped by higher capital transfers. The current account deficit is expected to improve
to about 6 percent of GDP in 2009/10, as a worsening trade balance is offset by higher grants. Foreign
reserves have grown at about 12 percent annually since 2002/03, and stand at over 13 months of import
cover at present.

14. The stock of government debt is high, even though debt has been declining as a share of GDP
since 2005/06. In nominal terms, the debt increased from US$308 million in 2001/02 to an estimated
US$721 million in 2008/09 on account of hydropower development loans. At the same time, the
government`s ability to service the debt is also increasing due to higher GDP as hydropower projects
come onstream. As such, the debt-to-GDP ratio shows a decrease from a high of 92.2 percent in 2005/06
to a low of about 59.6 percent in 2008/09 (Figure 1). Over 96 percent of total government debt is foreign,
and about 60 percent is for hydropower development.

improvement, with the ratio of non-performing loans coming down from 8.9 percent in December 2008 to
7.5 percent in December 2009. Even though there is a long way to go, the financial sector in Bhutan has
experienced rapid growth in provision of credit over the years (Figure 2), with the total volume of credit
provided by the financial institutions rising from Nu. 8.15 billion to Nu. 27.49 billion during 2003-2009.
Credit to the private sector accounted for about 93 percent of total outstanding credit on December 2009.

16. After easing of inflationary pressure from the elevated levels of late-2008, inflation is
resurging. Since the Bhutanese ngultrum is pegged to the Indian rupee, price developments have tracked
India`s inflation closely (Figure 3). When India`s inflation peaked in the summer of 2008 due to high oil
prices, Bhutan`s inflation was about 8-9 percent. With the easing of inflation in India due to a drop in

Non-food inflation in India has reached 18 percent in the first half of 2010 (from 1.4 percent in 2009),
while food inflation has declined marginally from about 18 percent in the first quarter of 2010 to about 16
percent in the second quarter. Inflation in Bhutan tracks this overall trend. In the second quarter of 2010,
food inflation in Bhutan fell from 10-12 percent in the previous two quarters to 6.9 percent, while non-
food inflation rose from 0-3 percent to 5.7 percent.

17. The global economic crisis had impacts on the tourism industry from which the economy is
showing signs of recovery. Tourist revenues for 2009 were about US$7 million lower compared to 2008
(Figure 4). Part of this decline can be attributed to the fact that the last quarter of 2008 saw unusually
high tourist inflows due to the coronation of the new king. Overall, seasonally-adjusted tourism revenues
are about 20 percent lower in 2009 compared to 2008. Data for the first half of 2010 suggests that the
tourism sector may be recovering slowly. While it is still too soon to be conclusive, data from the
Tourism Council of Bhutan shows total convertible currency earnings from the sector to be more than 6
percent higher in the first half of 2010 (US$14.3 million), compared to the first half of 2009 (US$13.5
million). Compared to 10432 tourists in the first half of 2009, there were 11156 tourists in the first half of
2010. However, the 2010 revenues from the sector still remain below the corresponding first half
revenues for 2008 (US$15.0 million).

18. Social development indicators are improving steadily, although youth unemployment is a
growing concern. Bhutan received a score of 0.619 on the UNDP`s Human Development Index in 2007,
placing it in the medium range, along with most of its neighboring South Asian countries.16 This
represents steady improvement over scores of 0.602 and 0.608 based on 2005 and 2006 data respectively.
Supportive government policies have ensured that Bhutan is on track to achieve most of its Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) for which data are available. The poverty headcount ratio shows substantial
reductions, falling from 36.2 percent in 2000 to 23.2 percent in 2007, with the official incidence of
poverty being much lower in urban areas (1.7 percent) than in rural areas (30.9 percent).17 However, the
overall unemployment rate has risen to 4 percent, from 3.7 percent in 2007. This translates to about
13,000 unemployed Bhutanese, of which 81 percent are 15-24 years old. The youth unemployment rate
has gone up to 13 percent (from 9.9 percent in 2007, and 2.2 percent in 1998). Despite expansion of basic
education, the nation`s skill base is narrow, and Bhutanese youth have had insufficient exposure to
practical and applied studies that equip them with skills required for employment in expanding sectors.
This, in turn, hinders the growth of the private sector.

project expected to come onstream during the 10FYP is Dagachu (114 MW), growth prospects during the

   The National Statistics Bureau (NSB) released the Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS) 2007 Report and the Poverty
Analysis Report (PAR) 2007. The BLSS was undertaken in the first half of 2007 and is not strictly comparable to the pilot
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) of 2000, which was the first attempt to quantify poverty in Bhutan at the
household level. However, these form the only time series estimates of poverty available.
                                                               7
10FYP are not quite as bright as during the 9FYP (when the 1020 MW Tala came onstream) -- but an
average annual real growth rate of about 6.5 percent is expected, driven by hydropower construction.
Given its small size, Bhutan will always remain susceptible to economic volatility in external assistance
and hydropower revenues, and financing will be needed, along with fiscal prudence, to help maintain
macroeconomic targets. Furthermore, the projected net resource gap in financing the entire 10FYP
agenda is substantial, at almost US$485 million -- albeit based on fairly ambitious projections of capital
expenditure on infrastructure development.

20. The electricity sector is projected to be a major driver of the economy over the medium term.
The Kingdom has the potential to develop 23,760 MW of capacity, of which only 5 percent has been
tapped so far. Under the 10FYP, the installed hydropower generation capacity is targeted to go up from
1,488 MW in 2007 to 1,602 MW, with the planned commissioning of the 114 MW Dagachu hydropower
project in 2012/13. In addition, the RGoB proposes to add 10,000 MW capacity by 2020.18 Towards this
end, construction work on the 1200 MW Punatsangchhu I, the 720 MW Mangdechhu, and the 1000 MW
Punatsangchhu II hydropower projects has already commenced, and they are targeted to come online by
2017/18. Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) are under preparation for several other projects. Bhutan has
limited domestic demand, and surplus power is exported to India at pre-negotiated prices. In fact, export
prices are higher than the average domestic price at which energy is sold within Bhutan. The Basochhu,
Chhukha and Kurichhu hydropower projects, which were already operational, were amalgamated into the
Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC) with effect from January 2008, and, in April 2009, DGPC took
over the Tala Hydroelectric Authority. The RGoB earns revenues from DGPC through taxes and
dividends.

21. Electricity and budgetary grants are the main projected sources of revenue during the 10FYP.
Bhutan`s tax base is small, and revenues from personal income tax and business income tax are projected
to show modest increases, growing at between 6 and 10 percent annually during the 10FYP. The average
share of electricity in aggregate revenue is estimated to be about 27 percent during the 10FYP. Absolute
revenues from the electricity sector are estimated to grow at over 7.5 percent per annum over the period.
Grants account for over 37 percent of Bhutan`s projected aggregate revenues during the 10FYP. About
80 percent of these grants are expected to be tied to specific projects. India alone accounts for almost 70
percent of grants expected during the 10FYP.

22. Fiscal projections show a favorable medium-term outlook and an ability to withstand
reasonable short term shocks. The fiscal deficit projected by the RGoB`s Budget Policy and Fiscal
Framework Statement (BPFFS) is expected to average about 4.8 percent during the 10FYP (Table 1).
This is below the RGoB`s self-mandated upper cap of 5 percent of GDP. This projected deficit includes
the effects of the recent natural disasters, and assumes full implementation of planned reconstruction
activities. In fact, the RGoB`s ambitious projections are based on near-doubling of capital expenditures
from 2008/09 levels, which may be constrained by capacity. More modest growth in capital expenditures
-- at the historical rate of about 10 percent per annum observed post-2001, for example -- will result in a
lower fiscal deficit of about 3 percent of GDP during the 10FYP period. The RGoB has introduced short
term Treasury Bills in March 2010, to help finance the resource gap during the 10FYP. Most
importantly, even if grants were to disappear altogether, Bhutan`s projected current expenditures could be
covered from its domestic revenue stream, enabling the delivery of basic services.

23. The overall external balance will continue to show a surplus during the 10FYP period due to
robust capital inflows, even as the current account deficit is projected to average above 6 percent
over the period. The current account deficit will improve somewhat, with a deteriorating trade balance
and increased interest payments offset by higher current transfers (Annex 3). Electricity is expected to

  Bhutan and India have agreed on a list of 10 hydropower projects to be developed -- either under an intergovernmental
model` of financing through a mix of grant and loan, or under the joint venture model whereby public sector companies from
both countries will implement the project.

remain the dominant export commodity (accounting for almost 50 percent of total exports), and India will
remain the key trading partner. Moreover, robust capital inflows in the form of capital transfers from
India, foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as loans and grants from development partners are
expected to finance the current account deficit and enable an increase in gross international reserves at the
rate of 15 percent per annum during the 10FYP. The import cover is also projected to go up from 13
months at present to over 21 months by 2012/13.

24. The total debt burden is expected to rise, largely on account of external borrowing for the
construction of new hydropower projects, but the resources needed to service the debt will be
generated directly by the asset created through borrowing. The debt burden, which is presently close
to 60 percent of GDP, is likely to rise over the next few years, as hydropower projects are launched to
meet the ambitious goals of the 10FYP, and as the country moves to hardened terms for its multilateral

lending.19 It should be noted that some of the rising hydropower debt is offset by a projected decline in
the non-hydropower debt (Figure 5). Hydropower projects will also contribute to government revenues,
even as it raises overall debt through external financing. The external debt service payments as a share of
exports of goods and services also shows a steady fall over the 10FYP period (Figure 5).

25. A joint IMF / World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggests moderate risk of debt
distress over 2008/09­2029/30. The policy-related Low Income Country DSA (LIC-DSA) thresholds
are breached for several indicators due to debt on account of hydropower projects. However, these
hydropower projects bring strong growth dividends, boosting the average real GDP growth and exports.
Sensitivity analyses show that the public debt profile is sustainable under most scenarios, and the debt
ratios decline over time and eventually fall below the LIC-DSA thresholds. Despite breach of thresholds
in the initial period of the analysis, a rating of moderate risk of debt distress is supported by: (i) Bhutan`s
strong track record of project implementation; (ii) commercial viability of new hydropower projects; and
(iii) Bhutan`s close economic and political ties with India which render minimal the commercial risks of
these projects, as India is both the main provider of financing for hydropower projects and the main
consumer of the projects` output.

26. In sum, the overall macroeconomic framework is sound. The IMF`s recent Article IV Staff
Consultation broadly confirms that Bhutan`s macroeconomic outlook remains bright (Annex 4).20 The
continuation of a policy stance conducive to macroeconomic stability is a necessary condition for
economic growth and poverty reduction.          The RGoB is committed to maintaining a sound
macroeconomic framework over the 10FYP -- in particular, keeping the actual fiscal deficit to below 5
percent of GDP. The average fiscal deficit during the entire 10FYP as projected in the BPFFS is 4.8
percent of GDP -- based on somewhat ambitious projections of capital expenditure.21 Prudent current
expenditure patterns are expected to contribute to this, even though domestic revenues and grants as
shares of GDP are projected to decline / level off (Table 1). Current expenditures are projected to be
covered by the domestic revenue stream.

27. Small economies relying on specific natural resources for its growth -- like Bhutan depends
on hydropower -- can potentially be affected by Dutch Disease symptoms.22 However, the limited
available data does not show this to be an issue yet in Bhutan. The IMF`s Article IV Staff Consultations

19
   The RGoB has graduated to hardened credit terms for IDA lending from FY10.
20
   The Consultations took place in October 2009, and the report was approved by the IMF Board in December.
21
   The RGoB has worked out macroeconomic projections based on development priorities, past trends, and anticipated future
economic developments, as reflected in the BPFFS, which is regularly updated on the basis of latest available information.
22
   The Dutch Disease effect would manifest itself in symptoms like real exchange rate overvaluation, high unemployment,
lagging growth in tradables, and a shift away from manufacturing.
                                                               10
did not find any evidence to this effect. The real exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium with the Indian
rupee. Hydropower revenues have India as the dominant and stable market, which was not affected even
during the global economic crisis. While youth unemployment is an issue, general unemployment rates
of around four percent compare favorably even with developed countries. In fact, the Investment Climate
Assessment Enterprise (ICA) Survey of 2010 shows that private formal firms in Bhutan are growing
rapidly (although from a low base), with the median firm reporting an increase of 36 percent in sales and
25 percent in employment over 2006-08.23 The RGoB uses its revenues from hydropower to finance its
budgetary expenditures, with the social sectors being major areas for government spending. Going
forward, it would be useful to monitor closely to guard against Dutch Disease effects.

     III.    BHUTAN'S REFORM PROGRAM AND THE PARTICIPATORY PROCESS

28. The 10FYP, which is also the RGoB`s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), lays out key
elements of the reform program over the next few years. The overarching target of the 10FYP is to bring
down the poverty headcount rate from of 23.2 percent in 2007 to 15 percent by the end of the Plan period.
To sustain a target real growth rate of 7.7 percent over the medium-term, the RGoB sees its major sources
of growth as construction, electricity, and transport and communication. The strategic priorities for the
10FYP are: (i) vitalizing industry; (ii) strengthening national spatial planning; (iii) synergizing rural-
urban development; (iv) expanding strategic infrastructure; (v) investing in human capital; and (vi)
fostering an enabling environment through good governance.

29. The formulation of the 10FYP has been based on a participatory process of consultations that started
soon after the completion of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the 9FYP in 2005. Following extensive
deliberations and consultations with various stakeholders, including the private sector and local
government bodies across the country, a preliminary set of guidelines were drawn up that contained the
core objective, priorities, strategies, and resource allocation principles for the 10FYP. These policy
guidelines also incorporated important recommendations of the MTR and the Good Governance Plus
Report of 2005. The guidelines for the preparation of the 10FYP were subsequently circulated to all
ministries, agencies, dzongkhags, and gewogs as the broad policy framework for the formulation of the
plan programs. The aggregate Plan is based on a consolidation of individual dzongkhag plans, and was
finalized at the Assembly Session in January 2009.

30. This section describes specific elements of the RGoBs own overall reform program under the three
identified components for the DPCs (Para 8), covering 2009/10­2011/12. While the RGoB is undertaking
several interesting and effective initiatives to achieve the 10FYP goals, this section describes only a
subset of those that the client identified to be critical, and requested to be highlighted as part of the new
series of operations. This largely continues the RGoB`s reform actions during the earlier DPFIS
operation. This section is based on the RGoB`s Letter of Development Policy, and summarized in the
RGoB`s own policy program matrix (Annex 2).

     (a)   Promoting Government Efficiency and Effectiveness through sound Fiscal and
      Public Financial Management and Procurement, and strong Public Administration

31. One of the pillars of the 10FYP is the need to ensure good governance, in order to enhance the
enabling environment for equitable and sustainable socio-economic development. This is particularly
important, given Bhutan`s recent transition to a democracy. The focus of this pillar of the 10FYP is not
simply on removing governance gaps or tackling issues of corruption, but involves a much more
comprehensive and proactive approach. Strengthening the public financial management (PFM) and

23
   See Investment Climate Assessment Report (2010) for Bhutan. The manufacturing, trade, tourism, and ICT sector firms
showed significant growth. Young firms, established five years or less, report he largest increases in sales and employment over
the past two years.
                                                             11
procurement systems continue to be an area of high priority for the RGoB, given that the government is
the major controller of public resources, and grants and hydropower revenues flow through the
government. The RGoB is committed to use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to
enable better public service delivery and to streamline government procedures. Even though Bhutan is
the least corrupt South Asian country, the RGoB seeks to control corruption before it becomes an issue,
and strengthen the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to promote transparency and reduce costs of
public service delivery.

                                   (a1)      Strengthening Budgetary Processes

32. The RGoB has prioritized health and education in its budget allocation in the last three Plans, and
continues to do so, allocating close to 25 percent of the budget to these sectors. Costs of delivering
services, however, have escalated, and the RGoB has been considering options to improve effectiveness
and efficiency of spending. One approach adopted has been to begin linking budgets with performance.
As such, the 10FYP includes a plan to introduce results-based management. In this context, sectors /
agencies seek to ensure that their inputs, products, and services contribute to clearly stated results.
Another initiative undertaken recently involves the signing of performance contracts` between several
sectors (including health and education) and the Prime Minister, in a move to closely monitor
performance in select areas and improve efficiency.24 Both of these initiatives could help achieve greater
performance linkages with social sector spending and also introduce improved monitoring and results in
key policy areas.

33. Improving performance linkages of social sector spending. The Ministries of Health and
Education will agree with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on achieving results in key performance areas,
to be monitored semi-annually. The Bank has initiated an Analysis of Public Expenditure for Human
Development, which will attempt to plug in key information gaps required by the social sector ministries,
and provide evidence to inform their policy and reform agenda. During the next two years, performance
areas related to improving resource allocation and efficiency as per actions identified through the ongoing
sectoral review will also be incorporated in the performance monitoring framework.

                  (a2)     Bolstering Fiduciary Systems for Public Financial Management

34. Reforms in this area have proceeded well in recent years. In order to improve the quality and
timeliness of financial information for decision making, the RGoB has initiated the process of developing
integrated web-based application software, which will allow the newly introduced Multi-Year Rolling
Budget (MYRB) process to align with the accounting and reporting functions, developed in the Public
Expenditure Management System (PEMS). An integrated financial management system has been
developed, and rolled out across all spending agencies of RGoB with effect from July 2010. The Internal
Audit function has been strengthened with the establishment of a separate Internal Audit Division within
the MoF. The newly set up Internal Audit Division, which is yet to be staffed, will be mandated to
provide the central policy framework, develop a common set of procedures, and ensure adequate quality
assurance mechanisms.

35. Adopting international standards for accounting and financial reporting. As a basis for
competent financial reporting and transparency, the RGoB proposes to develop Bhutanese Accounting
Standards in line with the International Accounting Standards (IAS) / International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) for the public and private sector. International consultants have been engaged to assist
the RGoB in defining the standards and its implementation, including advising the RGoB on the changes
required in the necessary policy and legal frameworks to harmonize the accounting and financial

24
  This is part of an RGoB-commissioned consultancy with McKinsey and Company, to accelerate the implementation of the
10FYP in nine ministries and government agencies, designed to increase efficiency and quality of services delivered, and to
extend coverage.
                                                          12
reporting requirements. Towards this objective, RGoB has established an Accounting and Auditing
Standards Board of Bhutan (AASBB). A Technical Working Committee (TWC) will assist the Board
with technical inputs. A medium term road map has been prepared by AASBB towards the adoption of
standards aligned to IAS/IFRS. The RGoB will notify new standards in a phased manner in line with the
road map, and this will eventually form the basis for financial statements prepared by companies.

36. Applying the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework for
assessment of public financial management performance. The RGoB has conducted a diagnostic
study of the PFM system using the Public Financial Management Performance Measurement
Framework,25 developed by PEFA.26 An assessment using the PEFA framework will enable integrated
assessment of performance of PFM systems and also provide a tool for demonstrating progress in PFM
performance over time, enable regular, rigorous, evidence-based monitoring by domestic and
international stakeholders, provide a common information pool on PFM performance, and facilitate
harmonization through wide international acceptance.27 The PEFA Report 2010 is available, and provides
ratings along 31 indicators of budget credibility, comprehensiveness and transparency of the budget,
policy-based budgeting, predictability and control in budget execution, accounts recording and reporting,
external scrutiny and audit, and donor practices. Overall scores denote reasonably good PFM systems in
Bhutan, with 18 of the 31 indicators receiving grades of A or B based on well-defined and objective
criteria. Some indicators in areas like predictability and control in budget execution, and accounting
recording and reporting are in need of improvement. Going forward, the RGoB proposes to prepare and
adopt a time-bound action plan to bring about improvements in the PFM framework.

                   (a3)      Improving Transparency and Efficiency of Public Procurement

37. In public procurement, the RGoB`s reform agenda aims at bolstering the procurement system, and
enhancing transparency, accountability, and efficiency. In order to strengthen the legal framework for
procurement, the RGoB revised and launched the new procurement manual in April 2007, which contains
the rules and regulations guiding public procurement processes in Bhutan. This was revised in April
2009, and renamed as the Procurement Rules and Regulations 2009. Last year, the RGoB issued
Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) and Standard Request for Proposals (SRFPs) to go along with the
new Procurement Rules and Regulations 2009. The SBDs and SRFPs are now in use in Bhutan. The
RGoB is taking measures to build procurement capacity over the next three years.28 It will create
institutional and individual capacity through the delivery of certified procurement training on a
sustainable basis. Although a separate Public Procurement Policy Division (PPPD) was established under
the earlier DPG series, its capacity still remains an issue. The RGoB is taking further steps towards the
operationalization of this division during the next few years. Training is being provided to PPPD staff in
line with identified requirements.29 The PPPD will also produce an operations manual and users` guide
for the SBDs, to provide support to public procurement in Bhutan.

38. Preparing specific Standard Bidding Documents. With a view to reforming the legal framework,
the SBDs for works and goods and the SRFP for consultancy services have been revised, and the MoF has
officially issued them. Experience with their use suggests that they may be too complex for smaller

25
   The PFM Performance Measurement Framework has been developed as a contribution to the collective efforts of many
stakeholders to assess and develop essential PFM systems, by providing a common pool of information for measurement and
monitoring of PFM performance progress, and a common platform for dialogue.
26
   The PEFA Program is a partnership among the World Bank, the European Commission, the UK Department for International
Development, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Norwegian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the International Monetary Fund, and the Strategic Partnership with Africa. A Steering Committee,
comprising members of these agencies, manages the Program. A Secretariat is located at the World Bank in Washington, DC.
27
   The assessment has been undertaken jointly with the World Bank.
28
   This will be helped by the World Bank Institutional Capacity Building Project for Procurement, which became effective in
September 2008. Training is provided by the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply (CIPS).
29
   This will be supported by an IDF grant.
                                                              13
contracts. Accordingly, the RGoB will prepare SBDs specifically for small works, goods, and services.
It is envisaged that further specific SBDs will be developed for procurement in selected sectors where the
standard documents are not available; e.g. for procurement of health sector goods, and ICT equipment.

39. Implementing recommendations of Use of Country Systems Assessment. An assessment of the
Use of Country Systems (UCS) in Procurement was undertaken recently, aiming to introduce use of
national procurement systems. The assessment recommends actions for further strengthening of public
procurement over the short and medium-term. Going forward, the RGoB will amend the Procurement
Rules and Regulations of April 2009 to take into account the priority short term recommendations.

                             (a4)      Strengthening Public Administration

40. Improving service delivery is a major ongoing initiative of the RGoB. It started with the RGoB`s
concern that outdated and unnecessary regulations were imposing high administrative burdens on
individuals, private firms, and the public sector itself. Administrative costs -- both to the service
recipient and provider -- were estimated in three pilot organizations: the Road Safety and Transport
Authority, Business Licensing, and Thimphu City Corporation. This accountability measure was
expanded, in April 2009, to a government-wide initiative called the Integrated Public Service Delivery
System (IPSDS). A team drawn from the Royal Civil Services Commission, Anti-Corruption
Commission (ACC), and MoF are analyzing the changes to processes and regulations that are needed to
make the delivery of services more efficient. In the meantime, the ACC, established in 2006, continues
its awareness and advocacy programs.

41. Improving service delivery. In order that critical public services are dealt with effectively, 42
government agencies have drawn up a prioritized list of services it provides to public. Under the
standards, the concerned ministry / agency / dzongkhag specifies the modalities of accessing a particular
service. These standards are expected to be adopted and implemented over the next few years, enhancing
the ease of accessing citizen services.

42. Enhancing the strategic framework. An Anti-Corruption Act for Bhutan was approved in 2006,
laying out the guidelines for prevention and control of corruption in Bhutan. In order to implement the
same, a National Anti-Corruption Strategic Framework (NACSF) has been prepared by the ACC, laying
out an action plan to combat corruption. Each organization is drawing up its unique NACSF
implementation plan, which will be implemented going forward.

43. Implementing Anti-Corruption Rules. In order to enhance transparency, the ACC has issued
Asset Declaration Rules setting procedures for the declaration of assets by public officials in 2008/09.
This is now under successful implementation, and compliance level is above 80 percent among Schedule I
(higher level officials) who submit their asset declaration (AD) statement to the ACC. The scope of
public officials required to file their statement of assets is being widened. Officials beyond Schedule I
will be required to make timely submissions of asset statements to their own organizations, and the online
submission option is available to both high-level and general officials. The ACC will manage the AD
database, which can be accessed by the AD focal points of each organization.

                                    (a5)   Establishing E-Government

44. The government`s reforms are proceeding well. Towards institutional strengthening, the Ministry of
Information and Communication (MoIC) / Department of Information Technology (DIT) has prepared an
e-Governance Implementation Roadmap, in consultation with stakeholders. The RGoB has put in place a
second institutional mechanism for e-Governance (the first being the MoIC itself) in the form of the
IPSDS office to establish one-stop delivery points for government services throughout the country. Some
initial data standards, security management policy, and systems development guidelines have also been

                                                    14
developed, and new systems under the responsibility of DIT are being developed in accordance with
them.30 Towards developing an integrated information systems and resources, two important systems
have been developed by DIT as initial components of the future technology platform for e-Governance.
They are the Office Procedure Automation and the e-Platform systems, both of which are designed for
government-wide use and are according to the Standards. An ICT human resource development plan has
been prepared and fiscally sanctioned as part of the 10FYP. MoIC is implementing a bilateral
cooperation training program with the National Indian Institute of Training sponsored by the GoI.

45. Developing full policy and standards framework, including e-Governance architecture and
interoperability standards. The e-Governance Implementation Roadmap has been prepared with Bank
assistance, and includes: (i) a diagnostic of current systems & gap analysis; (ii) a proposed architecture,
technical and security standards (including costing of expected investments); and (iii) recommendations
for enabling policy reforms and e-Government. This will be fleshed out and converted into a full
implementation plan with precise activities, responsibilities, schedule and budgets. The RGoB will
complete the formulation of technical policies, standards, guidelines and architectures necessary to ensure
integration of application systems (whether new or existing), security, and data sharing across
government agencies. The RGoB will also have the necessary institutional capacity in place for updating
and improving the standards at appropriate periodic intervals. This will culminate in a first generation e-
Governance technology platform, which will consist of integrated application systems, software
infrastructure to deliver online information and services, and hardware facilities to process all data and
communications and connect civil servants with each other, and with citizens.

46. Developing single window service delivery system. This system will be analogous to an
electronic pathway through which many government services will be delivered seamlessly to a single
customer at a single place. It will make the organizational complexity of government transparent to the
citizen, and allow the specification and monitoring of client-oriented service delivery standards
irrespective of the agencies involved in each transaction. E-government services will be deployed over
this system gradually as the infrastructure of delivery centers (Kuenphen Tewas) will need to be created
and a large and complex set of software modules (web services) deployed.

     (b)   Fostering Private Sector Development by Improving the Policy Environment and
                      Facilitating Productive Employment Opportunities

47. A strategic priority of the 10FYP is to revitalize industry, for which private sector development is a
key requisite. The RGoB is cognizant that the industrial and export base is narrow, and is exposed to
single market (India) and single commodity (hydropower) risks. While the economy will remain
dependent on hydropower, it is important to promote economic diversification and ease the constraints to
private sector development. The RGoB accords high importance to sunrise industries such as tourism and
ICT, with the latter being particularly valued for its contribution to the creation of a knowledge-based
society. It is also important to access capital, technology, and global markets -- and the lack of a clear
industrial and regulatory framework is to be addressed during the 10FYP, by ensuring that the necessary
regulatory and legislative measures to promote industrial economic activity are put in place.

48. The Kingdom faces growing challenges in creating suitable productive employment opportunities for
the educated and semi-skilled population, and for the youth. The 10FYP focuses attention on tackling
Bhutan`s rising unemployment problem, particularly among youth, by facilitating high quality jobs for
labor market entrants while enhancing productivity of the workforce. The 10FYP highlights both demand
and supply side interventions, including expansion of and improvement in vocational training, promotion
of private sector jobs, betterment of work conditions, development of labor market information systems,
and enhancement of off-farm employment opportunities.
30
   This includes the e-Platform, the Security Clearance System, the Crime Case Management System and the Bio Security
system.
                                                            15
                  (b1)      Creating an Enabling Policy Environment for the Private Sector

49. The RGoB recognizes that it is important to provide a holistic approach to private sector
development, with a clear, transparent, and predictable framework for achieving dynamic and accelerated
economic growth. The reconstitution of the Private Sector Development Committee (PSDC) in 2009 has
been a major development in line with the focus of the 10FYP on vitalizing industry. The PSDC is an
excellent starting point to building a Public-Private Dialogue, and an inclusive mechanism for
consultations on cross-cutting and sector-specific policies, strategies for facilitating private sector
development, and the diagnostic and design of investment climate reforms. The RGoB has supported the
Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI) to play an active role as the PSDC Secretariat.

50. Leveraging private sector participation in industrial and strategic infrastructure is a 10FYP priority.
The RGoB intends to develop and establish industrial estates to promote balanced regional development
and rural-urban linkages. A number of potential industrial estates identified in the 9FYP could not be
implemented due to resource constraints. The development of the Pasakha industrial estate, with a total
area of 267 acres and thirty eight industrial plots, has begun, with mixed results and useful lessons learnt.
Recent contract agreements for public private partnerships (PPPs) in the Thimphu IT Park (Thimphu Tech
Park) and the Dagachu Power Plant open the way for leveraging public sector investments to attract
private sector investments, management for industries, and strategic infrastructure development.

51. Formulating an Economic Development Policy. In order to provide the necessary framework for
economic development (with a focus on niche industry) in a more focused manner, the RGoB has
prepared an Economic Development Policy (EDP) to help guide private sector development over the next
15 years.31 This includes several critical measures to encourage the private sector and will be
implemented over the next few years through a roadmap presented in the EDP.

52. Encouraging Foreign Direct Investment. With an objective of encouraging more FDI to broaden
the employment and revenue base, to benefit from technology transfer, and to increase foreign exchange
earnings, the RGoB revised the 2002 FDI Policy, and Rules and Regulations (2005) with an intention that
the revised policy will lead to the introduction of an FDI Act.32 The amended FDI Policy was prepared,
supported by extended consultations, and approved by the Cabinet in May 2010. The RGoB will issue
rules and regulations to implement the policy.

53. Securing private sector participation by fostering Public Private Partnerships. The successful
search for a private investor, and contract agreement in September 2009 with a global Special Economic
Zone (SEZ) developer to Design, Build, Finance, Own, Operate, and Transfer (DBFOOT) an IT park in
Bhutan triggered high level RGoB support to create an enabling environment for Public Private
Partnerships (PPPs). This development -- and the business environment reforms it fostered -- opens the
road not only to foreign direct investment for the Bhutan IT Park, but also to other PPPs in the country, in
line with the RGoB's 10FYP roadmap. Recognizing the need to leverage private investments in order to
develop economic zones and strategic infrastructure in Bhutan, as planned in the 10FYP, the MoEA
prepared Guidelines for Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) Projects. These guidelines, released
in March 2010, formed the basis for a PPI Policy. The PPI policy will govern institutional arrangements
for government facilitation of PPPs in Bhutan. Given the emphasis on developing economic zones in
Bhutan, an Economic Zone Policy would complement the PPI Policy, and provide an enabling
environment for PPPs for industrial development. The government`s next step will be to set up a PPP unit
within the RGoB, to build the necessary government capability and capacity to facilitate PPPs in Bhutan.


31
  The EDP was initially called the Industrial Policy. UNDP has supported this effort.
32
   The World Bank and IFC/SEDF supported the MoEA in reviewing the 2002 FDI policy as well as preparing required FDI legal
framework. IFC/SEDF is planning to provide further Technical Assistance to support the drafting of FDI rules and regulations.
The World Bank group has also provided two rounds of technical advice on the FDI Policy that has been approved.
                                                             16
          (b2)      Fostering Private Sector Dynamism through Enhancement of Access to Credit

54. The RGoB has taken steps to improve access to credit, although challenges remain. Several
important recent reforms are progressing well. Four new licenses to financial institutions have been
issued recently, enhancing competition in the financial sector in Bhutan. As reflected in the 10FYP and
proposed under the EDP, the RGoB is keen to develop an efficient national electronic payment system to
do away with moving cash and paper-based instruments. A long-term strategic plan to introduce a
modernized electronic payment system was prepared in January 2009, with World Bank Group support.33
The Electronic Funds Transfer Clearing System (EFTCS) is aimed at stimulating commercial and
financial transactions, and reducing costs of cash and checks. The Credit Information Bureau (CIB) is
another important reform action that will help enhance the efficiency of the financial sector. These
systems are enabled under the revised Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) Act, which empowers RMA to
regulate electronic payment systems.34 The next steps to provide a detailed enabling environment for
modern financial infrastructure will be for RMA to draft payment and settlement systems regulations
through a consultative process.

55. Issuing new banking / insurance licenses. In order to foster competition and overcome the
duopolistic nature of the financial market, the RMA Board approved three new banking licenses and one
new insurance license in 2010, after the new players met qualification criteria set through an in-principle
approval process granted in December 2009.35 Bhutan Insurance Limited was granted a new insurance
license in August 2009 by the RMA. Two new private commercial banks, T-Bank and Druk Punjab
National Bank, launched operations in the first quarter of 2010, at about the same time that Bhutan
Development Finance Corporation acquired a specialized bank license. This increases the total number of
financial institutions in Bhutan from two in early 2009 to six in early 2010. At the same time, as the
number of the financial institutions increase, with more variety of financial services and credits, it will be
equally important to strengthen supervisory functions in the RMA to ensure stability of the financial
sector. While the RMA`s supervisory department has trained its existing staff in insurance, securities, and
banking, staffing has not yet increased. The RMA plans to hire and train four additional staff by the end
of 2010, in order to effectively supervise the financial sector, using emerging trends in supervision --
such as risk-focused supervision.

56. Developing modern financial sector infrastructure. A credit information sharing system and a
modernized payment and settlement system, are basic but essential financial infrastructure.36 A CIB has
recently been established, and is expected to make the financial system more efficient and reliable by
increasing the efficiency in the process of credit risk assessment on the borrowers, reducing the
extraordinary amounts of collateral, lowering the default risk, and enabling the expansion of credit-based
lending. The EFTCS, currently operational in Thimphu, will be expanded to a national coverage. The
system`s functionalities include credits (salaries, dividends) and debits (utility bill payments). Future
functionalities under consideration include pension payments, Initial Public Offering (IPO) refunds and
government taxes, among others. To allow for interoperability of Automatic Teller Machines (ATM), the
RMA plans to implement a national card switch system by the end of 2010.

            (b3)      Strengthening the Institutional Framework underpinning the Labor Market

57. The 10FYP targets full employment, defined as an unemployment rate of not more that 2.5 percent.
An important strategic initiative under the 10FYP is to improve working / employment conditions in the

33
   Support for the long-term strategic plan for modernizing payment systems infrastructure in Bhutan was provided jointly by the
World Bank and IFC under the Bhutan Private Sector Development Project.
34
   See Chapter 1, Section 9c of Revised RMA Act.
35
   The RMA Board comprises of: (i) the Minister, Ministry of Finance; (ii) the Secretary, Ministry of Finance; (iii) the Director,
National Statistics Bureau; (iv) the Director General, Economic Affairs, Cabinet Secretariat, and (v) Managing Director, RMA.
36
   These have been supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank respectively.
                                                               17
private sector through the enforcement of the 2007 Labor and Employment Act and its regulations.
Before the introduction of the Act, there was no labor market legislation in Bhutan, with the exception of
some fragmented regulations on minimum wages and on occupational health and safety. To rectify this
situation, the RGoB approved the Labor and Employment Act, striking a balance between labor market
flexibility and employment protection, thus encouraging job creation and efficient labor allocation while
simultaneously protecting fundamental rights of the employees. In order to implement the Act, the RGoB
has approved 14 Rules and Regulations on Employment Conditions.37

58. Issuing Rules and Regulations on Occupational Health and Safety. In order to fully implement
the Labor and Employment Act, the RGoB plans to issue eight additional Rules and Regulations, focusing
on Occupational Health and Safety, over the next two years. These Rules and Regulations, emphasizing
both preventive and protective measures to be observed and implemented by workers and employers,
have been drafted, and will be finalized and approved in the coming years.

              (b4)      Improving the Skills of the Workforce and Employability of Jobseekers

59. The 10FYP seeks to expand skills and employability. Even though there have been positive
developments in this area, significant challenges at both pre-service and in-service levels remain. At the
pre-service level, the quality and relevance of vocational training needs to be improved -- by measures
to update curricula and training materials, increase accessibility, and diversify programs (including
strengthening capacities of alternative modes of delivery for training, and introducing new areas of
training that attract young people`s interest). At the in-service level, an overall Human Resources
Development (HRD) policy and strategy was needed, and sufficient resources had to be ensured.
Effective monitoring and evaluation systems of training programs need to be developed and implemented.
The RGoB has taken steps to introduce pre-employment engagement programs to improve skills and
employability. Among them, the Apprenticeship Training program has shown good results as placement
rates of its graduates exceeded those of graduates from VTIs. Over the next few years, the RGoB seeks to
further enhance enrollment in the Apprenticeship Training Program, Special Training Program, and Pre-
Employment Program.

60. Strengthening the strategic framework for human resource development. To improve the
overall strategic framework, the RGoB prepared a national HRD Policy, which was consulted nationwide
over the last year. This has been approved by the Cabinet in January 2010, and measures for
implementation are being drawn up. This will provide an overall direction to human resource
development in Bhutan.

61. Improving quality of vocational training. In order to improve quality of and accessibility to
technical and vocational training, the RGoB is preparing a Vocational Education and Training (VET)
Reform Program. Revised curricula have been developed and introduced for six trades, starting 2008/09.
The Department of Occupational Standards will produce new occupational skills standards, for priority
occupations -- in eight trades during 2009/10, and also pilot Competency Based Training in five selected
occupations. To this end, occupational skills standards have been developed for four occupations
(construction carpentry, automobile, masonry, and plumbing).

               (b5)    Enhancing Labor Market Information and Job Intermediation Systems

62. An important strategy outlined under the 10FYP is to strengthen labor market information, so that
better information flows can lead to improved matching of skills and opportunities. While the Ministry of
Labor and Human Resources (MoLHR) introduced a modern, web-based job intermediation system

37
  These include rules on minimum wage, provident fund, foreign workers` recruitment, acceptable forms of child labor, sexual
harassment, leave, workers` compensation, gratuity, worker`s associations, internal service, labor inspection, grievance
procedures, and penalties regulations.
                                                           18
named Job Portal in 2004, to help job matching of national employment seekers, the scale of posted
vacancies and registered jobseekers has so far been rather modest. Thus, the effectiveness of the Job
Portal has been limited, indicating the need to rethink the approach and system. To help recruit Foreign
Workers in occupational fields that cannot be filled locally, a web-based recruitment system called Labor
Net was launched in 2006. The Labor Market Information System (LMIS) of MoLHR was fragmented,
several useful sources of information (including Job Portal and Labor Net) were not linked, and data were
stored in an Excel database that does not allow effective processing and retrieval of information. To
provide better guidance for jobseekers and employers, the RGoB has integrated the LMIS with Labor Net
in 2008/09, and reports from the integrated system are available. Moreover, four external sources have
been linked to the LMIS, and it now includes information from the Ministry of Education, Royal
University of Bhutan, Royal Civil Service Commission, and the National Statistics Bureau. At the same
time, the Job Portal is in clear need of being revamped, to make it more useful.

63. Improving labor market information and intermediation. While the LMIS has been integrated
with Labor Net last year, the Job Portal is presently not functional, and has not been integrated. The
RGoB is preparing a proposal for improving the job intermediation system for job seekers. This is
expected to be developed and implemented over the next two years, so that the number of intermediations
is increased, to enable more effective labor market insertion, particularly for young people.

                  (c)      Expanding Access to Infrastructure in a Sustainable Manner

64. The RGoB recognizes that, for a small, landlocked, and under-developed economy like Bhutan, the
expansion of infrastructure is an absolute requisite for the broader economic and social transformation of
the country. Achieving growth and poverty reduction targets in the 10FYP would be difficult without the
development of infrastructure that critically serves a modern economy. The development, expansion, and
maintenance of rural economic and communication infrastructure such as local markets, farm and feeder
roads, irrigation schemes, electricity, and communication centers will be undertaken, as they are vital for
stimulating and sustaining a thriving rural economy. Given the rapid projected pace of urbanization,
enhancement of national urban management capacity through institutional strengthening of various
agencies and municipalities involved in urban development is a 10FYP goal.

65. The RGoB is committed to securing ecologically balanced and sustainable development, while
promoting justifiable economic and social progress.38 In recognition of its environmental fragility,
Bhutan has developed reasonably sound environmental acts, regulations, guidelines, and codes of
practices. Under the 10FYP, the RGoB will focus on developing requisite environmental legislation,
mainstreaming environmental concerns into policies and programs, disseminating environmental
information, and enforcing environmental laws / guidelines. The RGoB also realizes the importance of
having an effective and robust disaster management and response system, and aims to move towards a
proactive approach through putting certain mitigation measures in place, having communities prepared,
and providing a better coordinated and effective overall response in case a disaster were to strike.

                         (c1)      Promoting Institutions to help meet Road Sector Targets

66. The 10FYP has an ambitious road construction and expansion program. An important target for
10FYP is to ensure that 85 percent of the rural population lives less than half a day`s walk from the
nearest road-head, up from 77.5 percent in 2005. The sector is presently guided by the Road Act of 2004
and the Road Sector Master Plan (RSMP), which provides the strategic tool to guide the development of
road infrastructure over 20 years (2007-2027). Last year, the RGoB has prepared and published
Guidelines on Road Classification System and Delineation of Construction and Maintenance
Responsibilities, which clarify ownership and roles of various agencies as regards to planning and

                                                                   19
budgeting, implementation, and maintenance. While there is an increasing demand for new roads and
improving existing road infrastructure across the country, the Department of Roads (DoR), Ministry of
Agriculture (MoA), and the engineering division of dzongkhags require significant capacity enhancement
to implement development programs. Measures to implement training in line with the HRD Master Plan
prepared by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlements (MoWHS) and MoA have not progressed as
anticipated, largely due to funding constraints -- even though ad hoc training measures have been
undertaken with donor support. In order to meet these new challenges, the MoWHS is considering a
proposal to restructure the DoR, and to give it autonomy and convert it into statutory authority.

67. Strengthening the policy framework. To reflect changes suggested by the road classification
guidelines, the existing Road Act of 2004 will need revision. The MoWHS has already initiated the
preparation of the revised / new Road Act, and a draft is currently under discussion.39 This Act is
expected to be submitted to Parliament in the coming years, and will form the basis of the sector strategy.
Once the legal framework is in place with the enactment of the new / revised Road Act, the next key steps
to strengthen the sector policy framework would be to: (i) re-designate the existing road network of the
country as per the new road classification guidelines; and (ii) finalize a tool and / or a strategy to prioritize
the road sector investment programs and revise the existing Road Sector Master Plan based on such a
strategy / tool. The DoA already uses a software called the Dzongkhag Rural Access Planning (DRAP),
which allows prioritization of roads based on objective data. The DoR also plans to adapt the DRAP, or
some similar software that can help them prioritize road construction.40 This will form the basis for
future budget planning, beyond the 10FYP.

68. Promoting environmentally friendly road construction. The RGoB already has in place several
policy requirements to ensure environmentally conscious expansion of roads. In the DoR, the
Investigation and Development Division (I&DD) has an environmental unit, which is presently involved
in forwarding, with its recommendations, the applications for environmental clearances to competent
authorities for issuing environmental clearances. At present, only an Assistant Engineer is responsible for
the functioning of the unit, and, going forward, the responsibilities of this unit will be expanded to
involve staff in planning, monitoring, and capacity building.

                      (c2)      Fostering Urban Development and Municipal Management

69. Economic development is fueling rapid urbanization, with resulting challenges for Bhutan. The
RGoB has undertaken various recent measures to meet the growing challenges. Given the ongoing
democratization and decentralization process in the country, in order to create a more autonomous and
accountable local government system, the RGoB has recently prepared the Local Government Act (LGA)
2009, which subsumes the Thromde Act with its purview of all local governments. 41 This has been
widely consulted with stakeholders, before being enacted by the Parliament in September 2009. A
Municipal Finance Policy (MFP) is also under preparation, supporting municipal reform towards more
decentralized and accountable local governments.

70. Finalizing Thromde Rules. The RGoB has finalized and approverd the Thromde (Municipal)
Rules for the implementation of the new LGA. These Rules give legal effect to the provisions of the
LGA, and clearly specify responsibilities, procedures, functions, and revenue sources of the Thromde.
Going forward, the RGoB expects to implement these Thromde Rules, starting with measures like



39
   This is being supported by the Asian Development Bank.
40
   The DRAP was prepared with donor support from SNV (Netherlands).
41
   The overall direction of urban development is provided by Bhutan`s National Urbanization Strategy (BNUS) of 2008, which
emphasizes: (1) municipal reform towards more decentralized and accountable local governments; (2) balanced regional
development by creating urban hierarchy and identifying regional centers; (3) prioritization of investments in the two major cities
and regional centers; (4) environmental protection and cultural conservation; and (5) capacity building of urban institutions.
                                                                20
municipal budgets being processed and executed by Thimphu City Corporation (TCC) and Phuentsholing
City Corporation (PCC).

71. Adopting Municipal Finance Policy. The RGoB plans to prepare a financially sustainable policy
for the delivery of public services by municipalities, in an effort to further the decentralization agenda.
An MFP has already been drafted, and this is expected to be reviewed and finalized in 2009/10. Once it is
adopted in the coming years, the RGoB proposes to begin implementation of selected priority measures.
These measures will be identified through further discussion, as the finalized MFP is adopted by the
RGoB.

          (c3)    Enabling Access to Fairly Priced and Reliable Backbone Capacity in the ICT sector

72. The development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a major cross-cutting
theme in the 10FYP. The Bhutan ICT Policy and Strategy (BIPS) provides a clear direction for sectors to
harness the ICT potential. The Department of Telecom and Information Technology (DITT) was
designated as the key agency to spearhead the ICT development. The RGoB has implemented various
reforms in the sector including the establishment and strengthening of an independent regulator (Bhutan
Information, Communications and Media Authority (BICMA)), licensing private Internet Service
Providers (ISPs), opening the mobile sector for competition by licensing a private mobile operator, and
the corporatization of the incumbent operator, Bhutan Telecom. The issuance of a tariff order by BICMA
in June 2010 to regulate the price of international wholesale connectivity from the international gateway
operators, to internet service providers (ISPs) and other businesses, was aimed to bring the cost of
connectivity under regional benchmarks. To ensure the reliability of domestic ICT infrastructure, the
RGoB initiated a plan to roll out the domestic backbone throughout the nation. Roll-out of additional
communication infrastructure for the international gateway is underway. A memorandum of
understanding (MoU) was signed in August 2009 between MoIC and Bharti Airtel to provide a redundant
international ICT infrastructure Optical Fiber Ground Wire (OPGW) through Gelephu, and is expected to
be completed by December 2010. An MoU was also signed between Bharti Airtel and Tashi InfoComm
for a Fiber Link via Phuentsholing. The RGoB is championing the implementation of OPGW over the
existing power transmission lines across the country through the Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC), who
will be in charge of implementation, operation and maintenance of the OPGW both for existing fiber
(Phuentsholing­Thimphu­Paro route) as well as for the new routes.

73. Providing connectivity at fair prices. BICMA has issued a tariff order in June 2009, placing a
price cap on wholesale bandwidth tariffs. The new ceiling price for leased lines in Bhutan marks a
reduction of 67 percent of previous bandwidth prices, and changes Bhutan`s competitive position in the
provision of connectivity. However, the tariff order has not yet been implemented consistently. Once
enforced, Bhutan`s international wholesale bandwidth prices would be lower than regional averages,
compared to Bangladesh (by 32 percent), Pakistan (by 12 percent) and Sri Lanka (by 20 percent).42 These
new developments should ensure regionally competitive wholesale bandwidth prices. The next steps will
be for BICMA to ensure that the tariff order is consistently enforced, and that this decrease in wholesale
bandwidth prices is passed on to individual and business customers. Further, BICMA will also develop
accounting separation rules in order to ensure that cross-subsidization does not negatively impact sector
competition.

74. Upgrading domestic and international ICT infrastructure. The tendering of Phase 1 of
replacing the groundware with OPGW by BPCL and laying down additional OPGW in all districts was
initiated in September 2009. About 50 percent of Phase 1 has been completed. Full completion is
expected in May 2011, and will ensure the deployment of ICT infrastructure in all dzongkhags. Phase 2
will be aimed at deploying the domestic backbone at the gewog level. Reforms will also include
facilitating the deployment of a second international gateway for ICT Connectivity in Bhutan, in addition

to the current gateway in Phuentsholing. Discussions between Indian and domestic operators are
currently facilitated by the RGoB. Finally, BICMA is drafting new rules and regulations for ICT
infrastructure sharing between the various telecom operators, which should increase the overall reliability
of ICT connectivity on implementation.

                                (c4)     Promoting Environmental Sustainability

75. Reforms have progressed well in recent years. The National Environment Protection Act of Bhutan
2007 (NEPA 2007), the Environmental Assessment Act 2000 (EAA 2000), Regulation for the
Environmental Clearance of Projects 2002 (RECP 2002), and Regulation on Strategic Environmental
Assessment (RSEA 2002), as well as various sectoral legislations such as Forest and Nature Conservation
Act 1995, collectively provide the legal basis for environmental safeguard and management in Bhutan.
At present, there are eight Applications for Environmental Clearance Guidelines,43 and three
Environmental Codes of Practice (ECoPS).44 The environmental legislations and guidelines / codes of
practice have evolved over a period of time -- as a result, there are some overlaps of mandates, and
confusion and ambiguities regarding roles, responsibilities, and authority with regard to various aspects of
enforcements and compliances.

76. Reforming environmental regulations. In order to clarify mandates, roles, and responsibilities, the
RGoB is in the process of revising EAA 2000 and RECP 2002. Legal consultants have been hired to look
at the areas needing clarification. A draft amendment bill for this purpose has been prepared, and reforms
are on track. NEC has held wide stakeholder consultations on this with the line ministries, NGOs, and
private sector. Of the eight sectoral Application for Environmental Clearance Guidelines, draft revisions
for the four priority sectors -- roads and highways, mines, hydropower, and transmission lines -- have
been prepared, and stakeholder workshops on the guidelines for road and highways have taken place.
Review of other guidelines and ECoPs is ongoing. Guidelines for the priority sectors will be finalized,
and necessary stakeholder consultations and awareness workshops will be undertaken. Going forward,
revisions of the remaining Guidelines and ECoPs will be undertaken, and new codes of practice and
guidelines will be developed for emerging sectors.

77. Revising environmental quality standards. In 2004, National Environment Commission
Secretariat (NECS) issued environmental standards for effluent discharges, emissions, and noise from
point and non-point pollution sources. The RGoB also issued interim standards for ambient
environmental quality. The existing environmental standards are based on literature review and adopted
from various sources, and it was recognized that they needed revision. Accordingly, revised National
Standards for Ambient Air Quality, Industrial Emission, Workplace Emissions, and Noise Levels for
Bhutan have been finalized and issued.

                               (c5)      Strengthening Disaster Risk Management

78. The RGoB realizes the importance of having an effective and robust disaster management and
response system in place, especially in view of the natural disasters in 2009. Most countries have an ad
hoc and response-based system, with an ex-post rather than ex-ante funding mechanism in place. The
RGoB is looking to move away from such an approach. In pursuance of this objective, the RGoB created
the Disaster Management Division in 2005, and later upgraded it to a full-fledged Department of Disaster
Management (DDM) under the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs (MoHCA) in 2008. The DDM has
three wings -- Response and Early Warning, Mitigation and Preparedness, and Recovery and
Reconstruction. The RGoB also formulated the National Disaster Risk Management Framework

43
   These are for Forestry Activities, Hydropower, Mines, Tourism, Highways and Roads, Industrial Projects, Transmission and
Distribution Lines, and Urban Development.
44
   These are for Installation of Underground and Overhead Utilities, for Storm Water Drainage Systems, and for Tourism
Activities.
                                                             22
(NDRMF) in 2006. The key objectives of the framework include the promotion of a Disaster Risk
Management (DRM) approach rather than an ad hoc reactive approach, the recognition of the respective
roles of different organizations in DRM, better coordination in the event of a disaster, and establishment
of linkages between DRM and ongoing activities in different development sectors. In consultation with
MoHCA and other stakeholders, the DDM has recently drafted the National Disaster Management Bill,
which will soon be put before the Cabinet and Parliament for discussion. The Bill, when passed, will
provide the legal basis and framework for undertaking various DRM activities in the country -- including
definition of various oversight and decision-making mechanisms, as well as defined Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) and annual budget allocations. The Bank has been engaged in a dialogue with the
RGoB on DRM following the September 2009 earthquake, and collaborated on a Damage and Needs
Assessment (DNA) which identified specific policy reforms that could be undertaken. Based on this
analysis, the following priority actions have been identified by the RGoB.

79. Preparing macro-level multi hazard risk assessment. Various agencies have conducted limited
assessments related to different disasters in small areas across Bhutan. There is a need to develop a
composite picture of the risks faced by communities in relation to multiple hazards. This would be
possible through the development of a Disaster Database for input of all existing DRM data, collation of
all existing disaster maps, and development of a base map leading up to a macro-level hazard risk
assessment. This assessment would provide the large picture regarding disaster risks in the country and
show the hot spots which could be further mapped to come up with micro-zonation maps -- and
ultimately lead to a multi-hazard atlas allowing for, among other things, better land use planning. The
DDM has initiated the formulation of a disaster database and information system, and is in the process of
collecting historical and other relevant data. A Terms of Reference for activity this has also been
developed.

80. Building DRM capacity at the national, district and community levels. The RGoB is faced with
real challenges in the area of DRM on account of weak capacity. Although Bhutan is prone to disasters
such as earthquake and floods, the country does not have any Search and Rescue (SAR) Team. In
coordination with the Royal Bhutan Police, Army, and relevant sectors, the DDM has come up with
standard kits which are in use at various levels. Similarly no disaster management plans exist at the
district or community levels. The RGoB aims to develop these capacities through training at the national
level to raise at least two SAR Teams, and further train communities as first responders and help develop
DRM plans at the district and community levels in vulnerable districts. The DDM has provided
Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) training in four districts, and the district teams
are in the process of finalizing block disaster management plans. This initiative will be scaled up in the
coming years.

81. Improving disaster resistant building codes. Bhutan is located in a high seismic zone and,
therefore, buildings are at serious risk if constructed based on traditional and often seismically unsafe
designs or low construction quality. The RGoB has building codes in place for the urban areas, but no
such codes exist for rural communities. In the aftermath of the 2009 earthquake, the RGoB seeks to
reassess these codes -- based on the losses suffered in the disaster due to sub-standard construction and
other factors.

82. Progressing on recovery and reconstruction. The September 2009 earthquake caused extensive
damage to infrastructure. In the health sector, two hospitals and 43 Basic Heath Unit were reportedly
damaged, while 117 schools were damaged in the education sector. Some temporary arrangements have
been put in place. Following recommendations of the DNA, the RGoB is in the process of developing
sector strategies and plans which would inform the actual reconstruction. The plans for education and
health are at advanced stages. It is expected that these will be finalized soon, and the RGoB would
reconstruct structures adhering to timelines specified under these plans.


                                                   23
        IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE ROYAL GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                      A.      Link to Bhutan's Country Assistance Strategy

83. The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering FY11-14 has been prepared, and is closely
aligned to the 10FYP / PRSP. The CPS emphasizes selectivity, and envisages Bank Group support for
development in Bhutan based on two broad areas of engagement: (i) economic diversification, job
creation, and financial inclusion -- with a view to increased growth and employment led by the private
sector; and (ii) spatial planning and public services -- with a view to enhanced living standards for
increased well-being. These areas are underscored by the cross-cutting themes of capacity building for
good governance, and environment. During several rounds of CPS consultations, the RGoB has reiterated
its request for continued support through budgetary operations -- as reflected in the CPS.

84. The objectives of the DPCs are consistent with the new CPS -- since both are derived from the
common goal of supporting the implementation of the 10FYP. The three focus areas of the DPCs tie in
with the CPS areas of engagement, and support its goals and objectives. The first DPC component on
promoting government efficiency and effectiveness will contribute to the cross-cutting theme on
governance in the CPS. Improved budgetary processes, better fiduciary systems, expanded e-governance,
and stronger public administration will strengthen institutional capacity and achieve better quality of
services for citizens. The second DPC component on private sector development aligns directly with the
economic diversification and financial inclusion pillar of the CPS, and actions to enhance employability
and improve the policy environment for the private sector will contribute to the corresponding CPS goals.
The third DPC component on improving sustainable access to infrastructure will support spatial planning
and public services. Institutional strengthening in the roads and urban sectors will ultimately help provide
better access and quality, while measures to promote environmental sustainability and disaster risk
management will contribute to better environmental stewardship and improved sustainability of
infrastructure.

                      B.      Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

85. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank staff prepared the Joint Staff Advisory Note of
Bhutan`s PRSP in 2009 (Report No. 47813-BT) and consult regularly on various issues. The Bank
provided inputs into the IMF`s Article IV Staff Consultations in October 2009. The two organizations
have prepared the Debt Sustainability Analysis for Bhutan which was presented to the Board in December
2009.

86. The DPC team has maintained close contact with donors, which is facilitated by the relatively small
number of multilateral and bilateral donors in Bhutan. A workshop to review progress under DPG1&2 in
Bhutan, held in April 2008, was attended by the representatives from all the major donors, and their
inputs were reflected in the choice of focus areas for the DPFIS, which is largely continuing under the
DPC program. Discussions at the workshop also centered on sectors and themes that could be supported
by future operations, and have been reflected in this document. Additional donor consultations to discuss
the new reforms and the Bank`s program were organized in October 2008, June 2009, and June 2010.

87. The Bank is working with development partners on several reforms reflected in the DPCs. The
Bank, IMF, and United Nations Development Program (UNDP) teams are supporting RGoB`s efforts to
develop a sound multi-year fiscal framework and improve public expenditure management. The Bank`s
ongoing PFM work has undertaken comparisons of national and international public sector accounting
and auditing standards, and is moving towards alignment or adoption of international standards of
accounting and auditing in a phased manner, using an incremental approach, in collaboration with other
donors, including ADB. The Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) has supported the
PEFA Assessment of the Bhutan`s financial management systems which forms the basis for further PFM
                                                    24
reforms, while Helvetas, UNDP, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have
participated in consultations around it. To strengthen procurement systems in Bhutan, the Bank and
DANIDA have collaborated on a series of procurement reform measures, which include the development
of the Procurement Manual, Standard Bidding Documents, and a Policy Note on Grievance Mechanisms
in Procurement, among other key initiatives in this area. The ADB has also collaborated with the Bank`s
procurement team to further the united donor approach to support the RGoB to modernize its public
procurement system. The UNDP has supported the RGoB in preparing its Economic Development
Policy, which is reflected in the DPC program. The Bank has fruitfully collaborated with the UNDP on
the Damage and Needs Assessment following the September 2009 earthquake in Bhutan, and the reform
program in disaster risk management (DRM) has been prepared to complement the UNDP efforts in this
area.

                         C.       Relationship to Other Bank Operations

88. The proposed budgetary operation will support the objectives of Bank`s investment operations by
highlighting key policy and institutional changes that will contribute importantly to some of the projects
achieving their expected results. The initiatives under the proposed DPC1, on macroeconomic / fiscal
management and fiduciary systems, will have cross-cutting impacts enhancing the effectiveness of public
spending, as well as include more specific elements that will be central to the implementation of the
procurement training project. Several of RGoB`s efforts supported by DPC1 on private sector
development will be important to the Private Sector Development project, including the labor law, FDI
regulations, and the cost of doing business. The skills enhancement / employment component of the
DPCs complement the objectives of the Education Development Program, IDA's third support in a series
and currently the largest IDA support to Bhutan, by focusing on employability of Bhutanese youths
coming out of the education system. Initiatives supported under DPC1 on strengthening infrastructure --
particularly road development -- will complement the Second Rural Access Project (RAP II), which
focuses on helping residents of beneficiary dzongkhags to utilize improved rural transport infrastructure
and services. Policy reforms supported under the newly-introduced urban development component
support the policy objectives of the Second Bhutan Urban Development Project (BUDP2).

89. The earlier Development Policy Operations (DPOs) have been complemented by focused technical
assistance, and this approach will continue. Several Institutional Development Funds (IDF) grants
support objectives of the DPC series. There was a deepening engagement on macroeconomic, fiscal, and
financial management issues, through IDF grants supporting capacity in these areas. An IDF grant on
Public Financial Management improvements focused on building capacity within the RGoB for better
expenditure control and information, and enhancing technical capacity in internal and external audit.
Another IDF is assisting the development of the MYRB/PEMS, with a view to better performance
monitoring. In order to strengthen and harmonize Bhutan`s environmental safeguard system, use of
country systems to address environmental issues is being piloted under RAP II, and the use of the country
systems is also being considered in the proposed BUDP2. The RGoB, through the National Environment
Commission Secretariat (NECS), is also implementing an IDF Grant for Strengthening Institution
Capacity for Implementation of Environmental Safeguards, with the aim of revising / updating the
existing environmental codes of practices and guidelines and developing new ones, improving capacity
and skills for decentralization of environmental clearances, enforcement and monitoring, training of
trainers, etc. In order to strengthen the recently-established Public Procurement Policy Division (PPPD),
the Bank has approved a three year IDF which aims to support the operationalization of this division.
The Bank recently approved an IDF grant to strengthen the institutional capacity of the MoLHR to
facilitate employment and labor market entry of Bhutanese youth. This IDF focuses on: (i) developing a
National Employment Policy and reviewing of Occupational Health and Safety regulations; (ii)
developing innovative PPPs for skills development training for disadvantaged youth; and (iii) building the
capacity of regional Labor and Employment offices to promote employment and labor services.

                                                   25
90. In addition, the Bank team is leveraging technical assistance funds from other sources. A Japan
Social Development Fund (JSDF) proposal is under preparation to support the Community Based Disaster
Risk Management (CBDRM) capacity building measures, while Global Facility for Disaster Risk
Reduction (GFDRR) funds will be used to provide support to the DRM components in the RGoB`s
program more broadly. Technical assistance is being provided to the DIT for the RGoB`s e-governance
program.

                                       D.       Lessons Learned

91. The current operation benefits from several important lessons drawn from policy-based lending both
in Bhutan, and also from the World Bank`s wider experience in budgetary support.

 Meaningful progress on key reforms is helped when leveraged with investment projects (or other
 direct support) in related areas. This was evident in the case of Bank financing for private sector
 development, education, procurement, and HIV/AIDS under DPG1&2. The DPFIS sought similar
 synergies from Bank projects in procurement, rural access roads, and private sector development. In
 fact, it is to leverage wider policy reforms that urban development has been brought under the DPC
 program, since an investment project, BUDP2, has been approved in FY10.

 Reforms backed by analytical work find strong support within government. The Bank`s engagement
 is based on significant new analytical content as described in Section IV(E). Reform actions that are
 supported by specific background studies -- as in the ICA work for private sector development
 reforms, the PEFA assessment for public financial management reforms, the UCS study for
 procurement reforms, the Analysis of Public Expenditure for Human Development for reforms to
 improve budgetary processes in human development sectors, and the DNA for the disaster risk
 management reforms -- have been welcomed by the RGoB.

 Capacity is a major issue constraining the RGoB`s reform efforts, and progress was strongest where
 adequate capacity either already existed, or was mobilized as a part of the deepening engagement in
 the area (such as in procurement). The proposed DPC1 is being prepared with these considerations in
 mind, and additional technical assistance is being mobilized to support RGoB counterparts in their
 work (Paras 89-90).

 Reforms work well in a programmatic framework. The DPFIS was designed as a standalone
 operation since it was the last operation in the FY06-09 CAS. Given that the new CPS will cover
 FY11-14, there is scope to prepare the DPC operations as a programmatic series (like DPG1&2).
 This will preserve continuity of reforms.

 Identifying good indicators to gauge progress can be difficult, especially in a country with limited
 capacity and data. The DPFIS experience also shows the difficulty in finding suitable indicators of
 progress, when attribution is difficult. The DPC series is making efforts to rely on quantitative and
 qualitative progress indicators that can be measured / assessed within the duration of the series.

                                 E.         Analytical Underpinnings

92. The DPC series builds on substantial new analytical work. The Joint Fund-Bank DSA for Bhutan,
along with the IMF`s Article IV Staff Report, suggest that the macroeconomic framework for Bhutan is
stable, and the outlook is bright -- and forms one of the bases for further budget support to Bhutan (Para
25).



                                                   26
93. Reform measures under the operations also draw on new analytical work. Following an ICA for
Bhutan, undertaken in 2002, the Bank group has undertaken a follow-up. In order to better understand
investment climate constraints, a survey of 248 firms -- covering Thimphu, Phuentsholing, Gelephu, and
Samdrup -- was completed in June 2009. The results suggest that the private sector finds insufficient
access to finance, tax rates, inadequately educated labor force, labor regulations, and transportation to be
major obstacles to business development in Bhutan (Figure 6). Results from the enterprise survey,
ranking access to credit as the leading investment climate constraint, is consistent with the low rank of
Bhutan`s credit accessibility in the Doing Business Report 2010.45 Accordingly, the DPC series
prioritizes access to finance and labor issues as key areas for support. Furthermore, the EDP addresses
                                                                         issues of tax rates and regulatory

the Ministries of Health and Education. The PFM reforms build on the PEFA Assessment, and
recommendations from the draft report have been consulted internally, and form the basis for reform
actions in the DPC series (Para 36). This PEFA assessment has great relevance in the context of the new
democratization of the political processes, and a strong movement towards devolution through the Local
Government Act 2009. Similarly, the UCS study for procurement has come up with various measures
and recommendations which form the bases for some specific procurement reforms highlighted under the
DPC program (Para 39). The DNA undertaken following the earthquake in September 2009 provides the
analytical underpinnings for the DRM reforms in the RGoB`s program (Para 78).

95. Development objective. The overarching objective of the proposed DPC series of operations is to
strengthen institutions to: (a) promote government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and
public financial management and procurement, and strong public administration; (b) foster private sector

    Firms were asked about the fifteen factors on the x-axis of Figure 6, and asked to rate which they considered obstacles of
different degrees. Percentage of the 248 surveyed firms that rate a particular factor as the most severe obstacle are shown in
Figure 6.
                                                              27
development by improving the policy environment and facilitating productive employment opportunities;
and (c) expand access to infrastructure in a sustainable manner. These development objectives are closely
aligned with the strategic priorities of the 10FYP, and have been formulated in close consultation with
RGoB counterparts.46

96. Programmatic approach. Bank engagement is proposed as a programmatic series consisting of
two single tranche operations supporting the RGoB`s reform agenda over 2009/10­2011/12. The Bank
and the RGoB teams have jointly designed the operations as a programmatic series in order to preserve
continuity of reforms, to leverage stronger policy actions, and to better monitor implementation of
institutional measures. DPC1 is being presented to the Board, to be disbursed against prior actions.
Indicative triggers for a follow-on operation, DPC2, have also been identified.

97. Size of DPC1. Based on a strong reform program and financing needs, budgetary support from the
Bank through the proposed DPC1 is envisaged to be about US$24.75 million. Therefore, DPC1 is
expected to finance about a quarter of the currently projected resource gap for 2010/11. DPC2 would
necessarily come from Bhutan`s IDA16 allocation, and the size will be determined when it is under
process. Current estimates suggest that DPC2 could be about US$20 million.

                                                  B.        Policy Areas

98. The proposed operation supports specific policy measures within the RGoB`s overall program that
have been mutually agreed as critical to disbursement of funds (Annex 1). This section presents the
individual actions within the broad framework (described in Section III) that form the legal basis for
disbursement of the proposed DPC1. It provides the rationale for the selected actions, and the latest
available information on their status. These actions are consistent with the overarching reform vision, and
are based on consultations with the RGoB, with considerations of feasibility within the timeframe
requested for the processing of DPC1. All the prior actions have been met in 2009/10.

99. The proposed DPC1 is prepared as the first in a new programmatic series. Accordingly, the Bank
and the RGoB have identified some indicative triggers for a possible follow-on operation, through a
process of mutual consultations. These have been selected as actions within the RGoB`s overarching
reform program under the three broad themes, and are regarded as critical to taking forward the reform
agenda, as well the development objectives of the current DPC1. It is expected that DPC2 may be
processed on the basis of the strength of the overall program, and once the relevant indicative triggers are
met. It is to be noted, however, that DPC2 triggers will be further developed and refined in consultation
with the RGoB. The indicative triggers for DPC2 are highlighted in Annex 1, and elaborated below.

                                              (a) Prior Actions for DPC1

Component A: Promoting Government Efficiency and Effectiveness through sound Fiscal and
Public Financial Management and Procurement, and strong Public Administration

(i)    Prior action for DPC1 (1 of 7)
       As part of the Integrated Public Service Delivery System initiative, service delivery standards
have been prepared and forwarded to the Cabinet Secretariat by ten ministries, twelve autonomous
agencies and twenty dzongkhags (Para 41).

Background: Improving service delivery for its citizens is high on the governance agenda of the RGoB.
Last year, the RGoB piloted the Standard Cost Model in three agencies -- Road Safety and Transport

46
  During preparation of the DPC series in 2009/10, the Bank team undertook two full multi-sector missions as well as six smaller
missions to discuss the policy reforms.
                                                              28
Authority, Business Licensing, and Thimphu City Corporation -- to reduce administrative and regulatory
burden to its citizens. This initiative has widened to cover all government agencies In order that critical
public services are dealt with effectively, government agencies have drawn up a prioritized list of services
they provide to the public.

Status: In all, 10 ministries, 12 autonomous agencies, and 20 dzongkhags have developed service
delivery standards for those priority services. Under the standards, the concerned ministry / agency /
dzongkhag specifies the modalities of accessing a particular service (including fees, if any), the point of
contact or coordinating body (with address and contact number), and the number of days within which the
service will be delivered to the citizen. This has been developed in-house, and the IPSDS secretariat has
held consultations with the participating ministries and agencies on developing these standards --
including provision of technical assistance and guidance. In many cases, these standards are already
available on the respective websites for public review and feedback. No formal Cabinet approval of the
standards is required, and agencies are expected to begin implementation. Several entities, such as the
MoWHS, MoEA, Royal Audit Authority, and Drug Regulatory Authority, have already taken steps
towards implementation of the standards that they have prepared. The standards are expected to be
adopted and implemented in most agencies by 2011/12. The ultimate goal is to locate all units that a
seeker of a particular service needs to interact within the same facility or same internet portal -- the One
Stop Shop. An e-platform has been developed (and tested for rural timber permits), and twenty services
have been identified that are targeted for delivery via this same platform.

(ii)    Prior action for DPC1 (2 of 7)
        The Cabinet has approved a National Anti-Corruption Strategic Framework on July 14, 2009,
and has distributed the framework to stakeholders and posted it on the Anti-Corruption Commission
website (Para 42).

Background: Enhancing the strategic framework for anti-corruption is an RGoB priority under the
10FYP. Even though Transparency International rates Bhutan as the least corrupt country in South Asia,
the RGoB is committed to control corruption before it becomes an issue. An Anti-Corruption Act for
Bhutan was approved in 2006, laying out the guidelines for prevention and control of corruption in
Bhutan. Under the DPFIS, Rules for Asset Declaration and Gifts Restriction have been approved, and are
under implementation -- with over 80 percent of eligible officials declaring assets online.

Status: A National Anti-Corruption Strategic Framework (NACSF) has been prepared by the ACC,
laying out an action plan to combat corruption. The RGoB, through its ACC, has undertaken extensive
consultations on the NACSF. The NACSF identifies seven strands of action, and lists the objectives,
outputs, timetables, and responsibility for each in an implementation plan. These strands of action are: (i)
making integrity an essential part of the recruitment process especially in leadership positions, (ii)
adopting and sustaining a defined policy on corruption, (iii) reviewing legal frameworks to make
corruption a high-risk offence, (iv) strengthening institutional capacity in agencies to tackle corruption,
(v) refining systems for procurement, PFM, rule-making, and minimizing discretionary powers of
decision-makers, (vi) implementing a long term strategy to educate citizens in values, ethics, and
integrity, and (vii) promoting partnerships with stakeholders like media, private sector, civil society, and
spiritual institutions to combat and minimize corruption. The NACSF was approved by the RGoB in July
2009, and has been published and disseminated. The RGoB realizes that, for its successful
implementation, the NACSF needs to be adopted by government organizations and implemented
according to their own functions. Each organization is drawing up its unique NACSF implementation
plan. The MoA and MoLHR have taken steps towards implementation, and the ACC is leading
discussions with other ministries for the adoption of the NACSF. The Committee of Secretaries has been
charged with developing indicators and monitoring NACSF`s implementation across government. In his
annual report to the National Assembly, the Prime Minister will report on the progress in implementation
of the NACSF. An evaluation of the implementation of the NACSF is to be prepared in 2012.

Component B: Fostering Private Sector Development by Improving the Policy Environment and
Facilitating Productive Employment Opportunities

(iii)   Prior action for DPC1 (3 of 7)
        The Cabinet has approved an Economic Development Policy on November 10, 2009, and has
formally released it to the public on April 2, 2010 (Para 51).

Background: Providing a holistic framework for private sector development is recognized by the RGoB to
be extremely important to meet its 10FYP goals of revitalizing industry. Since 2001/02, industry has
been growing rapidly at over 9 percent per annum. However, this is largely on account of growth at the
rate of over 14 percent in the electricity sub-sector, and the private sector is still to become a meaningful
engine of growth. The 2010 ICA, which has been prepared in close consultation with both private and
public sector representatives, has identified various constraints to private sector development, which
include tax policies, access to finance, and regulatory environment (Para 93). The RGoB proposes to
address several of these constraints in a phased manner.

Status: Towards this end, the RGoB has prepared an EDP to achieve economic self-reliance and full
employment, with specific steps to be implemented till 2020. The articulated goals are to: (i) achieve
economic self-reliance; (ii) generate employment; (iii) harness and add value to natural resources in a
sustainable manner; (iv) realize import substitution; (v) promote entrepreneurship; (vi) diversify the
economic base; and (vii) increase and diversify exports. The draft EDP was prepared and extensively
consulted with stakeholders over several rounds, including government, private sector, and civil society.
It has been approved for implementation, and released to the public. The EDP contains clear
implementable recommendations on a wide range of critical factors -- including specific timebound
incentives (tax and non-tax) for various sectors, review of the regulatory framework, and policy reforms
to be undertaken. It contains a host of financial incentives for various industries, including tax holidays,
corporate and business income tax exemptions, tax deductibles, sales and customs tax exemptions, and
income tax exemptions. The EDP also encompasses major economic reforms in areas including finance,
FDI, trade, public sector, and other legislative initiatives. Institutional arrangements for implementation
of the EDP are being set up. The MoEA will be responsible for implementing the policy, while the
GNHC will take responsibility for periodically reviewing the implementation. Going forward, all
institutional arrangements for the implementation of the EDP will be set up. Specific actions highlighted
in the EDP are already under implementation. Key among them is a decision to allow borrowing from
abroad by the private sector, to help ease credit constraints. The RGoB has already drafted rules and
regulations for External Commercial Borrowing, allowing commercial borrowing by selected private
sector entities. Rules for Inter Corporate Borrowing are also under preparation. It is expected that further
consultations around these will be undertaken.

(iv)   Prior action for DPC1 (4 of 7)
       The Credit Information Bureau has been established in September 2009, is operational and offers
products including Consumer Credit Information Reports and Self Inquiry Reports (Para 56).

Background: Access to finance is identified as a major constraint to the private sector -- both under the
ICA and the Doing Business Indicators (DBI). Through the earlier DPOs and the PSD project, the Bank
has been supporting various aspects of the RGoB`s reform program in this area -- including
establishment of an EFTCS. Under the DPFIS, the RMA Board approved three new banking licenses and
one new insurance license in 2010, after the new players met qualification criteria set through an in-
principle approval process granted in December 2009. The recent ICA finds collateral requirements to be
exorbitant, and most loans in Bhutan are provided on the basis of collateral rather than creditworthiness of
the borrower. Overall, 97.3 percent of the firms surveyed in the ICA reported providing collateral in
order to obtain their recently approved loans or lines of credit, and the collateral-to-principal ratio of
283.4 percent is one of the highest among comparator countries. From the perspective of banks, the

                                                     30
absence of credit history of the borrowers makes it difficult for commercial banks to carry out a proper
loan appraisal for the borrowers` creditworthiness, thus necessitating more collateral from the borrowers.
The Depth of Credit Information Indicator, which is one of the components of the Access to Credit index
in the DBI 2010, rates Bhutan at zero on a scale of 0-6, compared to a South Asia average of 2.1.

Status: To move from high collateral requirements towards creditworthiness as a basis for borrowing, it
is important to establish better systems of information about a potential borrower. Towards this end, the
RMA has recently established a CIB. Data on more than 75 percent of accounts with different financial
institutions have been fed into the CIB system already. A Membership Agreement will be signed
between the RMA and Financial Institutions, which will include necessary code of conduct, data
submission guidelines, and other important regulatory terms. It is expected that this will lead to an easing
of collateral requirements for the private sector, and provide a boost to industrial development.

(v)     Prior action for DPC1 (5 of 7)
        The Cabinet has approved a Human Resource Development Policy on March 5, 2010 (Para 60).

Background: Strengthening the strategic framework for human resource development is important, given
that, while firms cite lack of skilled labor as a key investment climate constraint in the ICA,
unemployment has been growing. Full employment -- denoted by an unemployment rate of no more
than 2.5 percent of the labor force -- is a 10FYP goal. Demand driven skills development is therefore
crucial for the country ­ both for achieving full employment and for providing the private sector with a
vibrant human recourses it needs to develop. To this end, starting 2008/09, the MoLHR has revised and
introduced new curricula for six trades, as a specific prior action under the DPFIS, and these reforms will
continue over the next few years.

Status: To improve the overall strategic framework, the RGoB prepared a National Human Resource
Development Policy, which was consulted nationwide. The key objectives of the Policy are to: (i) create
human capital; (ii) strengthen existing and plan for new HRD institutions; (iii) promote coordination
among HRD agencies; and (iv) study and project future labor market scenarios. The HRD Policy
contains implementable recommendations and responsibilities for tertiary, vocational education and
training (VET), as well as for pre- and in-service training in civil services and the private sectors. It was
presented to the GNHC in 2009. After completing the consultation process, the MoLHR presented the
HRD Policy to the Cabinet, and it was approved earlier this year. Resources for implementation will be
provided by the RGoB, as well as by donors, fees and endowments, etc. As a first step, an inter-
ministerial National HRD Committee will be set up to improve coordination. A working-level Secretariat
will be established within MoLHR, to review and monitor implementation.

Component C: Expanding Access to Infrastructure in a Sustainable Manner

(vi)    Prior action for DPC1 (6 of 7)
        The Ministry of Works and Human Settlements has adopted the Thromde Rules on June 30, 2010,
and the Rules have come into force on July 1, 2010 (Para 70).

Background: Urban development is a new area introduced under development policy lending in Bhutan,
to benefit from the synergies with the recently approved Second Bhutan Urban Development Project
(BUDP2), and leverage national-level reforms in parallel. The RGoB recognizes that the urban
population is currently almost a third of the total, and will reach 50 percent by 2020. Under the 10FYP,
the RGoB seeks to enhance urban management capacity with a view to decentralization and gradual
autonomy for municipalities.

Status: With this end in view, the RGoB has finalized and adopted the Thromde (Municipal) Rules for
the implementation of the new LGA. These Rules give legal effect to the provisions of the LGA, and

                                                     31
clearly specify responsibilities, procedures, functions, and revenue sources of the Thromde. The Rules
provide for democratic and accountable government urban local governments, and: (i) set forth criteria to
enable the RGoB to upgrade Thromdes into higher categories; (ii) empower the Thromdes to provide
essential services, review and implement physical plans; (iii) promote public participation in decision-
making; and (iv) manage the resources and growth of the Thromde in a sustainable manner. Going
forward, the RGoB expects to implement these Thromde Rules, starting with measures like municipal
budgets being processed and executed by Thimphu City Corporation (TCC) and Phuentsholing City
Corporation (PCC).

(vii)   Prior action for DPC1 (7 of 7)
        The National Environment Commission has approved the National Standards for Ambient Air
Quality, Industrial Emission, Workplace Emissions, and Noise Levels in February 12, 2010, commenced
the implementation of the Standards and has made them available to general public through the National
Environment Commission website (Para 77).

Background: Environmental conservation constitutes an important part of national spatial planning, and
the RGoB recognizes that the accelerated pace of infrastructure development, urbanization,
industrialization, and population expansion will put great stress on the environment. While the air and
water quality in the country are good, there are emerging problems of air pollution in and around
industrial sites, and deteriorating water quality in urban centers. Tackling these issues at an incipient
stage is important to prevent them from becoming a public health hazard in the future. Developing
environmental standards is a key strategy in the 10FYP, and the Bank is providing assistance through IDF
grants to address some of these issues.

Status: The 2004 environmental quality standards for effluent discharges, emissions, and noise from
point and non-point sources have been under revision to consolidate experiences, as well as to expand
coverage. The earlier standards were based on literature review, and needed to be revised in the light of
baseline data and in-country experiences. The revised National Standards for Ambient Air Quality,
Industrial Emission, Workplace Emissions, and Noise Levels for Bhutan have been finalized and issued
by the NEC. The standards are available on the NEC website, and are under implementation. Any new
project proposals have to be in line with the new standards. Existing entities have been given specific
timelines within which to comply. The NEC will be monitoring compliance through random checks. In
the coming years, standards for water quality will also be prepared and implemented.

                                   (b) Indicative Triggers for DPC2

100. In addition to the specific indicative triggers for DPC2 listed below, it is expected that the RGoB
will also maintain a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, in line with its BPFFS, which will be
regularly updated to take into account macroeconomic developments, and any unforeseen circumstances
will be factored into updates. Moreover, the RGoB`s overall program as presented in Annex 2 will be
reviewed by the Bank through periodic implementation support missions. If it is determined that RGoB is
broadly on track with its overall reform program, the Bank could process a follow-on operation. The pace
of reform implementation will be left to the RGoB, but DPC2 could be presented to the Bank`s Board in
early 2012/13, subject to adequate reform progress and mutual interest.

Component A: Promoting Government Efficiency and Effectiveness through sound Fiscal and
Public Financial Management and Procurement, and strong Public Administration

(i)     Indicative trigger for DPC2 (1 of 6)
        Amend Companies Act 2000 to reflect Accounting and Auditing Standard Board's mandated role
as the standard-setting body for Bhutan, and notify Bhutanese Accounting Standards from Phase I of
road map (Para 35).

                                                   32
Background: Bhutan does not have clear accounting standards, and Indian Accounting Standards are
often followed in practice. Since there are no clear guidelines on the accounting standards to be followed
by the private sector in Bhutan, these are followed inconsistently -- as evident in a review of the 2006
financial statements of a sample of 22 firms. Schedule XIII of the Companies Act 2000 provides some
formats for presentation of financial statements. The RGoB seeks to improve quality of financial
reporting, following consistent application of accounting standards aligned with IAS/IFRS. Accordingly,
the AASBB was established in May 2010, under the chairmanship of the Auditor General of the Royal
Audit Authority (RAA). Wide consultations have been held with various stakeholders including the
MoF, RMA, and members of industry groups to arrive at a general consensus on the way forward. The
AASBB has prepared a roadmap covering 5-7 years for implementation of IAS/IFRS in phased manner,
since there is a shortage of qualified accountants in Bhutan to adopt all standards simultaneously. The
roadmap is linked with capacity building measures. In order to minimize inconvenience to industries, the
IAS/IFRS will be implemented over three phases. At present, there are 29 IAS and 8 IFRS issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board, which Bhutan proposes to adopt. Of these, 18 basic standards
have been identified for notification in the first phase -- while those that are more complex will be
adopted over the medium term. The Companies Act 2000 will be also amended for the implementation of
the standards, and to recognize the authority of the AASBB. The overall objective is to increase the
reliance of investors and analysts in financial statements prepared by companies.

(ii)  Indicative trigger for DPC2 (2 of 6)
      Amend Procurement Rules and Regulations 2009 to account for priority short term
recommendations from the Use of Country Systems Assessment (Para 39).

Background: Given that the government is the main controller of national resources, reforming public
procurement has been supported under the earlier DPOs, and technical assistance through IDF grants and
a procurement capacity building project. Specifically supported by the Bank under the DPFIS, the RGoB
has developed the Procurement Rules and Regulations 2009, and issued SBDs for goods and works, and
SRFPs for services to go along with the same. These SBDs are under implementation. This agenda will
continue in the DPC series, with the objective of increasing the efficiency of public procurement. An
assessment of the Use of Country Systems in Procurement was undertaken recently, aiming to introduce
use of national procurement systems for all competitive bidding in Bank-supported projects in countries
where procurement standards are deemed adequate. A baseline has been established from its findings. 47
While 35 percent of baseline indicators pass the established requirements, 9 percent pass with conditions
(implying that an action plan is required), and the remaining 56 percent do not live up to required
conditions. The assessment recommends actions and corrective measures for further strengthening of
public procurement over the short and medium term. The RGoB will amend the Procurement Rules and
Regulations of April 2009 to take into account the priority short term recommendations.

Component B: Fostering Private Sector Development by Improving the Policy Environment and
Facilitating Productive Employment Opportunities

(iii)    Indicative trigger for DPC2 (3 of 6)
         Approve revised Foreign Direct Investment Rules and Regulations (Para 52).

Background: Foreign direct investment needs to be encouraged, with the 10FYP goal being a 10 percent
rate of increase in FDI inflows. The RGoB has adopted the FDI Policy 2010 to achieve the objectives as
set out in the EDP, to encourage FDI in both manufacturing and service sectors. The FDI Policy has
recently been approved by the Cabinet, and: (a) lists priority sector activities which shall be fast tracked
for approval and clearances; (b) allows FDI in other activities with specified maximum foreign investors`
equity and minimum project costs; and (c) lists activities where FDI will not be permitted. The objectives

47
  This study was undertaken with Bank assistance. It has been validated through a visit from OPCS representatives, and is
expected to be finalized shortly.
                                                          33
of the FDI policy are to: (i) support private sector development; (ii) generate employment; (iii) promote
capital inflow; (iv) foster transfer of skills and appropriate technology; (v) expand market access and
international trade; and (vi) enhance foreign currency earnings. The draft was consulted extensively, and
the FDI Committee that worked on the policy has representation from the private sector. Both the Bank
and the IFC collaborated on providing advisory services on the formulation of the FDI Policy. As the
next step, the supporting Rules and Regulations for implementation will be prepared and approved.

(iv)   Indicative trigger for DPC2 (4 of 6)
       Finalize eight remaining rules and regulations on Occupational Health and Safety for approval
by Ministry of Labor and Human Resources (Para 58).

Background: Improving working and employment conditions in the private sector is an important 10FYP
goal. There was no labor market legislation in Bhutan until 2007, when the RGoB approved the Labor
and Employment Act. In order to implement the Act, the RGoB has approved 14 Rules and Regulations
on Employment Conditions, which was a measure specifically supported by the DPFIS. 48 In order to
fully implement the Act, the RGoB plans to issue eight additional Rules and Regulations, focusing on
Occupational Health and Safety, over the next two years. These Rules and Regulations, emphasizing both
preventive and protective measures to be observed and implemented by workers and employers, have
been drafted, and will be finalized and approved in the coming years. There have been some delays in the
timeline that was discussed early during the DPFIS dialogue. However, this is due to valid reasons, since
these Rules and Regulations are fairly technical in nature, and require further refinement and consultation
-- which are well under way. A recently approved IDF will support this (Para 89).

Component C: Expanding Access to Infrastructure in a Sustainable Manner

(v)      Indicative trigger for DPC2 (5 of 6)
         Present new Road Act to the Parliament (Para 67).

Background: Reforms in the roads sector were introduced into development policy lending in Bhutan,
starting with the DPFIS -- in order to exploit synergies with investment lending operations. A key sector
strategy under the 10FYP is to formulate a comprehensive plan for strategic infrastructure development.
As a first step towards strengthening the policy framework in the roads sector, a specific measure
supported by the DPFIS was for the RGoB to prepare and publish Guidelines on the Road Classification
System and Delineation of Construction and Maintenance Responsibilities, which clarify ownership and
roles of various agencies as regards to planning and budgeting, implementation, and maintenance. These
guidelines have been adopted. This in turn necessitates changes to the Road Act of 2004, which governs
the sector strategy and budgeting processes. The MoWHS has already initiated the preparation of the
revised / new Road Act, and a draft is currently under discussion. This Act is expected to be submitted to
Parliament shortly, and will form the basis of the sector strategy. Once the Act is adopted, the revised
road classification system will form the basis for budgetary planning and allocations.

(vi)   Indicative trigger for DPC2 (6 of 6)
       Adopt Municipal Finance Policy, and apply selected priority measures Thimphu and
Phuentsholing City Corporations (Para 71).

Background: A Municipal Finance Policy (MFP) has already been drafted, and this is expected to be
reviewed and finalized shortly. The purpose of the MFP is to provide a financially sustainable policy for
the delivery of public services by municipalities (Thimphu, Phuentsholing and other Class A Thromde).
The list of activities proposed in the draft MFP include measures to strengthen own source revenues,

48
  These include rules on minimum wage, provident fund, foreign workers` recruitment, acceptable forms of child labor, sexual
harassment, leave, workers` compensation, gratuity, worker`s associations, internal service, labor inspection, grievance
procedures, and penalties regulations.
                                                           34
intergovernmental fiscal systems, and expenditure management and financial administration of
municipalities. Municipalities shall collect all the taxes, charges and fees as stipulated in the LGA, as
well as receive development grants. It will adopt measures to improve budget implementation and
accounting. In the coming years, the RGoB proposes to begin implementation of selected priority
measures, with particular focus on Thimphu and Phuentsholing.49

101. Furthermore, it is expected that specific policy actions on strengthening disaster risk
management will be included in DPC2. A US$10 million emergency IDA allocation was approved in
response to the September 2009 earthquake, and has been added to DPC1. The RGoB is presently
pursuing a nascent program in disaster risk mitigation and management, as described above (Paras 78-82).
This is also a new area for Bank engagement, starting with the earthquake. The Bank has initiated
technical assistance through GFDRR funding (Para 90). A JSDF project to support community-based
DRM is under preparation. It is expected that, as the dialogue progresses and the reform agenda is
deepened, DRM will be brought in as a policy reform area under sustainable development of
infrastructure component in DPC2. The specific actions will be determined by the Bank and the RGoB,
through a process of discussion and mutual agreement.

                  Box 1: The Proposed DPC and Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The proposed DPC supports implementation of Bhutan`s own development program as laid out in its 10FYP, and evolved
through a participatory process involving local governments and central agencies. It comprises a people-centered
development approach underlying strong ownership of the reform process. The DPC series supports national ownership
through a joint consultative approach to identify key areas for support. The content of the program has taken into account
governance changes in the country in recent years. Specific actions have been discussed with the RGoB team.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The program has been developed to support results-based outcomes as outlined in the 10FYP. The reform matrix was
developed in close coordination with the RGoB. All missions have been held jointly with the RGoB counterparts, and
aide memoires have been prepared and agreed with the RGoB. In the RGoB, the management and coordination of
external assistance is systematically institutionalized under the Ministry of Finance. There are regular donor meetings at
the technical level, and the broad DPC reform program -- as well as individual elements in public financial management,
procurement, infrastructure, and private sector -- has been discussed with relevant donors.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The accountability and mode of assistance (budget support) are customized to Bhutan`s circumstances. Budget support is
a response to the RGoB`s request, and past successful attempts to implement policy-based reforms. It takes into account
the low share of budget support in the RGoB`s overall external assistance. The triggers and prior actions have been
developed keeping in mind the timings for disbursement, as requested by the RGoB. Indicative triggers for DPC2 allow
for flexibility, to take into account any changes in country circumstances in future.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
One of the principles of budget support is that there is focus on a few monitorable and realistic indicators. The triggers
and actions for the proposed DPC series represent only those actions that will be critical for achieving the program`s
project development objectives and the various outcomes. They have been identified in close consultation with the RGoB.
Selectivity is particularly important when capacity is limited. The DPC series picks up very specific actions (Annex 1)
from the RGoBs wider reform program (Annex 2) for the disbursement of funds.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
Although monitoring and evaluation remains challenging, the RGoB is taking steps to strengthen this. The Bank`s
supervision plan, along with the indicators in the Policy Program Matrix provides a framework in which to review
progress. During the supervision phase of the operations, benchmarks will be regularly evaluated and interim steps taken
by the RGoB will be monitored.


49
     This would be supported through the recently approved IDA project, BUDP2.
                                                               35
                          VI.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                A.      Poverty and Social Impacts

102. The proposed operations are expected to yield several positive social impacts. No significant
negative impact is anticipated. Bhutan is already on track to meet key MDGs. The RGoB is committed
to improving the living standards of the population as demonstrated by heavy public spending on the
provision of social services, especially in remote areas. The operation is expected to contribute to
improved poverty and social impacts as described below.

 Measures to promote government efficiency and effectiveness are expected to have positive social
 impacts. Investment in human capital is a key priority for the 10FYP, and the RGoB already spends
 about a fourth of its budget on social sectors -- health and education. Support to public procurement
 and financial management will contribute to improved usage of public resources, including social
 sector spending. The governance reforms would improve service delivery standards, which would
 have benefits for the entire economy.

 Reforms to foster private sector development and better skills matches will have direct social benefits
 in the form of enhanced employment opportunities for the population. The enforcement of the Labor
 and Employment Act through supporting Rules and Regulations will rectify the institutional void and
 provide basic protection to all workers. The poor are expected to benefit particularly from the
 introduction of the Provident Fund, because the poor are especially vulnerable to old-age poverty.
 Moreover, by limiting child labor, the Act will enhance human development of poor children -- the
 group where child labor is most prevalent. The increased access to and quality of training programs
 that cater to low-paid workers (such as Apprenticeship Training and Village Skills Development
 Training) will enhance labor market opportunities of these workers, among others by offering off-
 farm employment opportunities to underemployed rural workers. Better guidance for jobseekers,
 particularly via enhanced job-matching services, will help young people to find jobs faster, and to
 ensure better job matches (including enabling higher wages).

 Measures to improve infrastructure availability will directly help poor and remote communities to
 access basic services and market infrastructure. It will also encourage private sector development,
 and help sustain the growth momentum. Accessibility to strategic infrastructure affects the living
 conditions and welfare of communities all across the country and determines their livelihood
 opportunities. Infrastructure investments are expected to greatly enhance national productivity and
 competitiveness and stimulate new businesses, while enriching the quality of life for all Bhutanese.
 To the extent that the livelihoods of the poor are more significantly affected by natural disasters,
 measures to improve disaster risk management will have special benefits for them, in addition to
 benefiting the entire Bhutanese society.

103. Bhutan`s transition to democratic governance and the RGoB`s ambitious agenda of policy and
institutional reform, as formulated in the 10FYP, is making the government agencies more responsive to
their constituencies and the Bhutanese citizens. The 10FYP, which the specific reforms supported under
the DPC are based on, has been prepared and approved following an extensive process of national
consultations (Para 29). The individual reform actions have also been widely discussed and consulted
among the key stakeholders, as noted through the text and summarized below.

104. The service delivery standards have been discussed between the IPSDS and relevant line ministries,
and uploaded on several agency websites in draft form to incorporate feedback. The NACSF has been
widely disseminated, following its approval, as implementation plans are being drawn up by agencies.
Discussions have been held with various stakeholders including the MoF, RMA, and members of industry
groups to arrive at a general consensus on the way forward on the adoption of IAS/IFRS standards in
                                                  36
Bhutan, to improve the quality of financial reporting. The draft EDP has been approved following
extended stakeholder consultations, and discussions with the private sector -- spanning over two years.
The FDI Policy has also been supported by extended discussions and feedback, with the BCCI being
closely involved in its preparation. The RGoB has had nationwide consultations on the draft national
HRD Policy, before it was approved. The Rules and Regulations on Occupational Health and Safety have
been drafted, and are under revision following national consultations. The NEC has held wide
stakeholder consultations with the line ministries, NGOs and private sector (particularly the industry
associations related to hotel / tourism and construction and the bigger business houses) on the
environmental standards. Similarly, the Local Government Act and the draft Road Act have also been
widely discussed.

                                         B.        Environmental Aspects

105. Bhutan has a reasonably sound environmental policy and legislative framework for environmental
safeguard, mitigation, and management. Projects or development activities are not permitted in the core
zone of protected areas. All development proposals are subject to environmental screening and
assessment processes and procedures which result in environmental management plans that incorporate
specific recommendations for mitigating potential negative impacts. The sectoral guidelines for
application of Environmental Clearances and Codes of Practices recognize environmental risks relevant to
the sector, and require addressing and mitigating them for each project.50

106. The RGoB`s reforms highlighted above are expected to improve institutions for environmental
practices (Paras 75-77). Reforms of environmental regulations will clarify mandates, roles, and
responsibilities. Revised Application for Environmental Clearance Guidelines and new environmental
quality standards will improve environmental mainstreaming. A web-based information management
system that is under preparation will enhance availability of data.

107. No major environmental concerns are noted for the first two themes supported under the DPCs.
Measures to promote good governance are unlikely to have negative environmental consequences, and are
expected to be environmentally neutral. Potential environmental concerns of encouraging greater
employment through fostering private sector dynamism include the risk of increased pollution from
industries, and lower health and safety of the workers. The proposed Rules and Regulations on
Occupational Health and Safety are expected to address the health and safety concerns. The risk of
increased pollution may be minimized, if environmental standards are not lowered and environmental due
diligence is maintained in all private sector investments, including FDIs. The FDI Policy incorporates
international best practices, to ensure that environmental standards are met. All FDIs are subject, at the
least, to Bhutan`s environmental requirements.

108. The potential environmental concerns related to access to infrastructure are more significant.
However, it is to be noted that infrastructure expansion is part of the RGoB`s 10FYP regardless of this
operation. The planned expansion will proceed, subject to funding and capacity -- irrespective of the
Bank`s involvement. By supporting environmental sustainability, the DPC series actually mitigates those
concerns. Adverse environmental impacts of DPC1 are expected to be minimal, since the RGoB is
committed to applying strict environmental guidelines. In the roads sector, the Department of Roads
(DoR) has gained considerable experience in Environmentally Friendly Road Construction (EFRC)
during implementation of RAP I and RAP II, and the approach is being mainstreamed to all road
construction activities. In urban development, only limited environmental impacts are expected from the
expansion of municipal services in the designated local areas, and proposed activities are unlikely to have
adverse impacts on natural habitat and forest resources. In fact, activities supported under the proposed
50
  These include Application for Environmental Clearance Guideline for Hydropower, Application for Environmental Clearance

BUDP2 are likely to contribute to improving environmental conditions of cities. Project design includes
provision of wastewater treatment plant and an Environmental Management Plan that supports specific
measures to mitigate relevant, though minor, impacts that are likely to result from the project activities --
for example slope disturbances and erosion, air quality and noise issues during construction, labor and
labor camp issues, etc. Building on the ongoing RAP II experiences, BUDP2 also proposes to use
Country Systems on environmental safeguards.

                       C.      Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation

109. The Department of Public Accounts (DPA), Ministry of Finance, will be responsible for overall
implementation and monitoring of the DPC program. The RGoB has already established an inter-
ministerial group of officials, headed by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, to provide overall
coordination for the DPC process. This group has been working with the Bank team since the inception
of the earlier DPOs, and is familiar with Bank procedures. The Bank team will supervise the project by
monitoring actions and reviewing implementation progress of the proposed operation. The Policy
Program Matrix of the proposed operation will provide a results framework that describes expected
outputs / outcomes, as well as indicators by which to gauge progress and monitor interim steps.
Implementation Support Missions will be undertaken at regular intervals, in consultation with the RGoB.

110. Monitoring and evaluation remains challenging, as significant data gaps and uncertainties are still
being addressed. The National Statistics Bureau (NSB) of Bhutan has prepared a National Statistics
Development Strategy (NSDS) with the support of the World Bank Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity
Building in order to improve the coordination and strengthen the capacity of the Bhutan Statistical System
(BSS) to meet the user data needs. The NSDS provides a framework and action plan that aim to align the
statistical development strategy with wider poverty-focused national development programs and
strategies. The NSDS is consistent with Bhutan`s overall development vision, and will lead to better
monitoring of development outcomes under the upcoming DPC program. In parallel, the Bank is also
working with the RGoB to further support statistical development through technical assistance.

                                       D.      Fiduciary Aspects

111. The Bank team has been deeply engaged in financial management issues, through an extensive TA
program and supervision activities on investment projects, as well as the DPO support to RGoB`s reform
program, as described above. While several challenges remain (including the timeliness of accounting
and reporting, the monitoring of financial performance, the effectiveness of internal audits, and the
execution of other control functions), the core elements of an effective financial management system are
largely in place. Progress is also being made in strengthening the capacity of the accountability and
oversight institutions, and establishing the necessary legal underpinnings needed to ensure that the
financial management and transparency demands arising from the increased revenues and spending
expected over the coming years are met.

112. The overall fiduciary framework is adequate to receive the proceeds of DPC1. The positive
trajectory of improvements in financial management stems from RGoB`s commitment to: (a) strengthen
the legal framework; (b) bolster the institutional framework; (c) enhance the financial management
information system, and (d) strengthen the oversight of public finances. Together, these actions are aimed
at increasing accountability and improving the timeliness, quality, transparency and reliability of the
RGoB`s accounting and reporting functions. These positive steps, as well as the RGoB`s demonstrated
focus on results and strong commitment for continued PFM reforms, provide a satisfactory basis for
proceeding with the proposed budget support operation.

113. The IMF has not carried out a Safeguards Assessment of the RMA, Bhutan's Central Bank. As part
of the appraisal for DPC1, the audit reports and published annual financial statements for the two
                                                     38
financial years 2007/08 and 2008/09 were reviewed by the Bank. The accounts and audits were compiled
and conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards. Based on the
audit reports and the satisfactory track record in the operation of special (designated) accounts in several
IDA-financed investment operations which have been held in the RMA, it was concluded that the Bank
has reasonable assurance that the control environment for foreign exchange at the RMA is satisfactory.
An assessment of future annual financial statements will be undertaken for DPC2.

114. In procurement, external donors have looked favorably on the national procurement system. The
UCS Assessment to follow uniform procurement procedures highlights a number of areas which need to
be further improved, and together with the Bank and other development partners, efforts are underway to
harmonize the use of Bhutan`s fiduciary (including procurement) and safeguards systems. As noted
above, there is a deepening engagement on procurement issues, and the RGoB has moved forward on key
items of their reform program, including: (a) revising the procurement manual (including drafting and
issuing standard bidding and request for proposal documents); (b) creating a central Public Procurement
Policy Division; and (c) improving capacity through procurement training (improving implementation of
rules and facilitating decentralization of procurement functions). Overall, the procurement risk can be
gauged as medium, but in partnership with other donor agencies, the Bank team is working with the
RGoB to continue moving forward on fiduciary reforms.

                                 E.      Disbursement and Auditing

115. Once the credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the RGoB will submit to the IDA a
withdrawal application. IDA will disburse the US dollar proceeds of the credit in one tranche to the
Government Budget Fund Account through the RMA, which will be available to finance budgeted
expenditures. Transactions and balances of the account will be promptly and fully incorporated into the
Government`s accounting records and financial statements. The government will confirm to the Bank
within 30 days of disbursement, the receipt of these funds and its credit into the Government
Consolidated Account of the country (including the date and name/number of the government`s bank
account in which the funds have been deposited). The administration of this credit will be the
responsibility of the MoF.

116. Disbursement of the credit proceeds would not be linked to specific purchases. However, the RGoB
would not use the credit proceeds to pay for expenditures included in the Bank`s standard negative list
which includes expenditures on military hardware and environmentally hazardous goods. If any portion
of the credit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA
shall require RGoB to refund the amount to IDA.

                                  F.      Risks and Risk Mitigation

117. No major risks that are likely to derail the reforms are identified. However, there are some risks
that can affect implementation progress -- but mitigation measures are also in place.

 Macroeconomic risk. External shocks could impact the macroeconomic framework. As a small
 landlocked country, Bhutan faces several vulnerabilities, including, most notably, the heavy reliance
 on hydropower for its budget, balance of payments, and growth prospects. The heavy dependence on
 India as a source of external assistance, as the major trading partner and the critical buyer for
 electricity exports also make Bhutan liable to shocks that affect the Indian economy -- although,
 given that assistance to Bhutan is a very small share of India`s resources, there was no significant
 pass through of the effects of the recent global financial crisis from India to Bhutan. The IMF has
 also identified risks associated with debt sustainability, potential overheating due to spillovers from
 hydropower and development spending, financial sector vulnerabilities, and gaps in reserve
 management. The Bank`s emphasis on establishing a sound medium-term fiscal framework should
                                                    39
   help ensure that the multi-year consequences of investments and other decisions are forecast and
   taken into account as best as possible. The focus on improving the general environment for private
   sector development should also help the country realize more of its potential for economic
   diversification. Faster private sector development through higher productivity could deliver growth
   without inflationary pressures.

 Capacity risk. The preceding DPOs identified risks related to technical capacity constraints and put
 forward some mitigation measures, including the provision of appropriate technical assistance to
 support the RGoB in implementation of the reforms. In addition to technical capacity, high-level
 managerial capacity is also in short supply and may be adversely affected by the political transition.
 To some extent, familiarity with Bank procedures and continuity of key counterpart officials will help
 mitigate this risk. As in the case of the earlier DPOs, the design accounts for capacity constraints
 through selectivity of focus and a limited number of prior actions. It will also seek to leverage
 technical assistance resources.

 Political risk. Changes in government priorities and working officials could affect the relevance and
 implementation of the program. Recent political changes have culminated in a new government
 taking office in 2008. Sustainability is helped by the extensive and careful preparation of the ongoing
 changes in governance, and the strong ownership of the reform program by the current government
 (and civil service). The operation is a response to a request by the new administration, which is on
 board with the reform program supported by the proposed DPC series as anchored in the RGoB`s
 own 10FYP. Key counterpart officials have not changed, and the inter-ministerial group of officials
 steering the implementation have already had experience in satisfactorily implementing the earlier
 DPO program.

                  Annex 4: Bhutan--IMF Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                     September 7, 2010



Bhutan's growth was resilient to the financial crisis and the outlook remains positive.

       Given the concentration of trade and financial linkages with India, the impact of the global crisis was
       small and limited to tourism and a few manufacturing industries. GDP growth is estimated at 5½ percent
       in 2008/09, and projected to be 6­7 percent in 2009/10 and in the medium term, driven by developments
       in the hydropower sector. Inflation is rising in line with pressures in India, but still manageable at
       5¾ percent in Q1 of 2010.

       The level of rupee reserves remains highly volatile due to linkages with the hydropower cycle, but rupee
       credit lines with India (totaling Rs 7 billion or 4½ months of goods imports from India) provide a useful
       safeguard. Convertible currency reserves, however, are less volatile and more than adequate at US$
       825 million in March 2010 (16 months of imports), thanks to the substantial aid flows which have
       resulted in a balance of payments surplus, offsetting the volatile trade deficits arising from the
       hydropower cycle.

       Banking sector indicators are generally sound. Banks` capital adequacy ratio was 15 percent at end-
       2009; gross non-performing loans declined and its ratio to total loans fell by 1½ percentage points
       during 2009 to 6 percent. While credit growth is slowing, it is still strong at 18 percent in the year to
       March 2010. Meanwhile, banks` excess liquidity climbed sharply in 2009--the ratio to total assets
       jumped from 7 percent in June to 21 percent in December.


Containing fiscal expansion and enhancing liquidity management are necessary to avoid economic
overheating. Strengthening bank supervision is also a top priority.

       Given higher development spending to meet the goals of the 10th Five Year Plan, and the recent wage
       increases, the fiscal deficit has been rising. Preliminary estimates indicate a deficit of 6½ percent of
       GDP in 2009/10, and one of similar magnitude in the 2010/11 budget, creating overheating risks.
       Moreover, high spending pressures combined with the possibility of shortfalls in largely aid-based
       foreign financing due to weak global recovery, risks further build up of already high public debt levels
       (70 percent of GDP), jeopardizing public debt sustainability. In particular, excessive domestic debt
       buildup could undermine the most recent debt sustainability assessment of moderate debt distress.

       Maintaining monetary policy consistent with the rupee peg, and improved liquidity management are
       necessary for economic stability. The rising yield spread between India and Bhutan due to a decline in
       Bhutan`s T-bill rate relative to comparable Indian bills is a source of concern, especially in light of
       increasing imported inflationary pressures. Intensified monetary operations are also needed to drain the
       high level of excess liquidity which poses risks of a sharp increase in credit growth.

       The entry of two new banks this year creates much needed competition in Bhutan`s banking sector and
       could help lower the level of excess liquidity. With more banks, and in light of the rapid credit growth,
       enhanced supervision over banks` risk management practices and financial disclosure are necessary for
       maintaining asset quality and financial sector stability.

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 2



       Continued efforts to enhance private sector development remain an important priority. In this regard,
       advancing donor-supported SME-lending schemes and steps to develop a commercial paper market are
       needed to improve the financing mix available to the private sector.

                Annex 5: Implementation of RGoB Reforms highlighted under the DPFIS

1.       The DPFIS has officially closed on March 31, 2010. Based on progress indicators identified in the
RGoBs medium term Policy Program Matrix, the team concludes that the RGoB has remained on track with its
overall reform program, and that the achievements against qualitative and quantitative targets (where available)
have been satisfactory. The risks to development outcomes are assessed to be negligible.

     A.     Promoting Good Governance through sound Fiscal and Public Financial Management
                      and Procurement, and strong Accountability Institutions

2.       The RGoB has successfully introduced several reforms to improve macroeconomic monitoring, in order
to better respond to the impact of external shocks and volatility on the small Bhutanese economy. Under the
earlier DPG series, the Macroeconomic Framework Coordination Committee (MFCC), established in 2005, has
become the focal group preparing macroeconomic and fiscal projections, with capacity and expertise being
developed through successive iterations. The Public Finance Act, which was passed in June 2007, provides for
the development of a three-year Budget Policy and Fiscal Framework Statement (BPFFS), based on the Medium
Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF). Debt management software has enhanced the capacity of the RGoB to
monitor and report on debt, and the RGoB now has the capability to undertake basic Debt Sustainability
Analysis. As a specific prior action for the DPFIS, in order to further improve the accuracy of macroeconomic
monitoring, the RGoB has enhanced the BPFFS to include monitoring of budget execution on a quarterly basis.
Quarterly reports on revised budget and revenue figures are being developed by the Department of National
Budget (DNB), by major government department, and submitted internally to the Finance Minister and Finance
Secretary, to identify suitable policy responses to emerging situations. The formats of the reports have already
been revised and refined once, based on internal feedback. In addition, the RGoB has maintained a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework aligned to its BPFFS, with actual fiscal deficits well below 5 percent of GDP in
2008/09.

3.       Bolstering the public financial management systems is an area of high priority for the RGoB, given that
the government is the major controller of public resources. Overall, the RGoB has made good progress in taking
forward the public financial management reforms agenda. In order to improve the quality and timeliness of
financial information for decision making, the RGoB has initiated the process of developing integrated web
based application software, which will allow the newly introduced MYRB process to align with the accounting
and reporting functions. This will substantively update and replace the existing budgeting and accounting
systems, as well as interface with the Planning and Monitoring System (PlaMS) of the Gross National
Happiness Commission (GNHC).51 The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has begun the process of defining the
systems design and IT consultants are being engaged to develop and update the budgeting, accounting and
reporting systems (MYRB/PEMS). As a basis for competent financial reporting and transparency, the RGoB
proposes to adopt international standards for accounting for the public and private sector. International
consultants have been engaged to assist the RGoB in defining accounting and auditing standards.52 The Bureau
of Internal Audit has been established, and internal audit staff has been augmented from 18 to 25.

4.      In public procurement, the RGoB`s reform agenda aims at bolstering the procurement system, and
enhancing transparency, accountability, and efficiency. In order to strengthen the legal framework for
procurement, the RGoB revised and launched the new procurement manual in April 2007, which contains the
rules and regulations guiding public procurement processes in Bhutan. This was revised in April 2009, and
renamed as Procurement Rules and Regulations 2009. As a specific prior action for the DPFIS, the RGoB
issued Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) and Standard Request for Proposals (SRFPs) to go along with the
Rules and Regulations 2009. The SBDs and SRFPs are now in use in Bhutan, and sector-specific and small

   The PlaMS is a centralized data collection and management system, which enables real time online data entry, analysis, data storage,
and report generation of development programs and projects. This system is expected to be fully operational shortly.

   This is supported by the ADB-financed Financial Sector Development Program.

                                                                                                                          Page 2 of 5

value contract SBDs will be prepared. The RGoB is taking measures to build procurement capacity over the
next three years.53 It will create institutional and individual capacity through the delivery of certified
procurement training on a sustainable basis. Training is being provided to PPPD staff in line with identified
requirements.54 The PPPD is also working to produce an operations manual and users` guide for the SBDs, to
provide support to public procurement in Bhutan. However, progress on measures to set up a grievance
redressal mechanism has been slow. While the Ministry of Information and Communication (MoIC) has taken
significant steps on e-government as described below, electronic government procurement has not yet seen
major developments, although it remains on the RGoB`s agenda.

5.       Reforms to enhance audit effectiveness have progressed well. The Royal Audit Authority (RAA) was
brought within the legal framework of an Audit Act, which was passed by the National Assembly in 2006, and
set up a separate division to actively track and monitor responses by public spending units of audit observations
until settlement / adjustment. During 2009/10, the RAA has focused on enhancing performance audits:
compared to seven undertaken in 2008/09, the RAA is on course to do nine -- which is in line with the Strategic
Plan (2008-2013). Also, the RAA has adopted international auditing standards in line with the INTOSAI
Auditing Standards, and incorporating the IFAC/IAASB International Standards on Auditing by an Executive
Order in August 2009--an improvement over the earlier auditing approach based on the General Auditing Rules
and Regulations (GARR), 1989.

6.       The RGoB has made good progress in reforms to reduce regulatory burdens and enhance transparency.
In order to enhance transparency, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has issued Asset Declaration and
Gifts Restriction Rules setting procedures for the declaration of assets by public officials, which was a prior
action for the DPFIS. Both are online and under successful implementation, and compliance level is above 80
percent among Schedule I (higher level officials) who submit their asset declaration statement to the ACC. The
online submission option is available. Administrative costs -- both to the service recipient and provider --
were estimated in three pilot organizations: the Road Safety and Transport Authority, Business Licensing, and
Thimphu City Corporation. This accountability measure was expanded, in April 2009, to a government-wide
initiative to analyze and implement measures to enhance service delivery standards.

7.       Reforms to establish e-Government are on track. Towards institutional strengthening, the Ministry of
Information and Communication (MoIC) has commenced preparation of an e-Governance Implementation
Roadmap, in consultation with stakeholders, with inputs from international expertise. The RGoB has put in
place a second institutional mechanism for e-Governance (the first being the MoIC itself) in the form of the
IPSDS office to establish one-stop delivery points for government services throughout the country. Some initial
data standards, security management policy, and systems development guidelines have also been developed and
new systems under the responsibility of Department of Information Technology are being developed in
accordance with them.55 Towards developing an integrated information systems and resources, two important
systems have been developed by DIT as initial components of the future technology platform for e-Governance.
They are the Office Procedure Automation and the e-Platform systems, both of which are designed for
government-wide use and according to the Standards. An ICT human resource development plan has been
prepared and fiscally sanctioned as part of the 10FYP. MoIC is exploring a possible bilateral cooperation
training program with the National Indian Institute of Training sponsored by the Government of India.

B.        Fostering Dynamic Labor Markets, Ensuring Skills Match, and Generating Employment

8.     An important strategy to strengthen the institutional framework underpinning the labor market is to
improve the working / employment conditions in the private sector through the enforcement of the 2007 Labor

   These include the e-Platform, the Security Clearance System, the Crime Case Management System and the Bio Security system.

                                                                                                                            Page 3 of 5

and Employment Act and its regulations. Before the introduction of the Act, there was no labor market
legislation in Bhutan, with the exception of some fragmented regulations on minimum wages and on
occupational health and safety. In order to implement the Act, the RGoB has approved 14 Rules and
Regulations on Employment Conditions, which was a prior action for the DPFIS.56 Nine additional Rules and
Regulations, focusing on Occupational Health and Safety have been drafted, but there have been some delays in
the timeline that were discussed early on during preparation of the DPFIS. However, this is due to valid
reasons. Since these Rules and Regulations are fairly technical in nature, they require specialized expertise,
local adjustment and consultation--which are well under way. As other actions, 19 labor officers (against a
DPFIS target of 15) are now working to enforce the Act, up from 11 in 2008/09, and the number of Regional
Offices of the Ministry of Labor and Human Resources (MoLHR) has gone up from 1 to 4 (against a DPFIS
target of 3) over the last two years.

9.       With a view to improving skills and employability of job-seekers, a Human Resource Development
Policy has been prepared and approved by cabinet for implementation, with the objectives of (i) creating human
capital; (ii) strengthening existing and plan for new HRD institutions; (iii) promoting coordination among HRD
agencies; and (iv) analyzing and projecting future labor market scenarios. In order to improve quality of and
accessibility to technical and vocational training, revised curricula were developed and introduced for six trades,
starting 2008/09, as a specific prior action under the DPFIS. The Department of Occupational Standards is
working on new occupational skills standards, for priority occupations -- in eight trades during 2009/10, and
also to pilot Competency Based Training in five selected occupations. The Apprenticeship Training program
has shown good results in placement rates of its graduates, and more than 320 participants are enrolled in this
program, against a DPFIS target of 300. However, there has been little progress on improving M&E of training
programs as envisaged in the DPFIS.

10.     Finally, it is important for Bhutan to enhance labor market information and job intermediation to better
match skills and opportunities. To provide better guidance for jobseekers and employers, the RGoB integrated
the Labor Market Information System (LMIS) with Labor Net (a database that helps recruit foreign workers),
and reports from the integrated system are available. Moreover, four external sources have been linked to the
LMIS, and it now includes information from the Ministry of Education, Royal University of Bhutan, Royal Civil
Service Commission, and the National Statistics Bureau. At the same time, the Job Portal, which was launched
in 2004 as a web-based job intermediation system, has been identified as in clear need of being revamped, to
make it more useful.

11.     In order to set up the framework for private sector development, the RGoB has prepared an Economic
Development Policy (EDP) to help guide public sector development over the next 15 years.57 The articulated
goals are to: (i) achieve economic self-reliance; (ii) generate employment; (iii) harness and add value to natural
resources in a sustainable manner; (iv) realize import substitution; (v) promote entrepreneurship; (vi) diversify
the economic base; and (vii) increase and diversify exports. As highlighted under the DPFIS, the draft EDP was
prepared and extensively consulted with stakeholders over several rounds, including government, private sector,
and civil society. The Policy was approved by the Cabinet in November 2009, subject to the incorporation of
comments to be collected through a last intra-ministerial round of consultations. The final version was released
in April 2010. With an objective of encouraging more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to broaden the
employment and revenue base, to benefit from technology transfer, and to increase foreign exchange earnings,
the RGoB is currently in the process of revising the 2002 FDI Policy and Rules and Regulations with an
intention that the revised policy will lead to the introduction of an FDI Act.58 A revised draft FDI Policy has

56
    These include rules on minimum wage, provident fund, foreign workers` recruitment, acceptable forms of child labor, sexual
harassment, leave, workers` compensation, gratuity, worker`s associations, internal service, labor inspection, grievance procedures, and
penalties regulations.
57
   UNDP is supporting this effort.
58
   IFC/SEDF has been supporting the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MoEA) in reviewing the 2002 FDI policy as well as preparing
required FDI legal framework and is planning to provide further Technical Assistance to support the drafting of FDI rules and
regulations.

                                                                                                                               Page 4 of 5

been prepared, supported by extended consultations, and the amended FDI policy was presented to the Cabinet
in March 2010. Some further revisions have been recommended. It is expected that the revised Policy will be
resubmitted for approval to Cabinet shortly, and that the supporting rules and regulations will be drafted as soon
as the policy is operational. The number of FDI projects has gone up from five before 2005 to 20 in 2010, and a
19.5 percent growth in FDI over the 2008/09 level of about US$ 17 million is projected for 2009/10 (well above
the 10FYP target of 10 percent annual growth).

12.      Important reforms to improve access to credit are progressing well. As a prior action for the DPFIS, the
Royal Monetary Authority Board provided an in-principle approval to three banks and one insurance company
in December 2008, with specific qualification criteria to be met by these financial institutions to obtain licenses
within one year of the approval.59 All in-principle licenses have been issued, radically changing the financial
sector in Bhutan. Bhutan Insurance Limited was granted a new insurance license in August 2009 by the RMA.
Two new private commercial banks, T-Bank and Druk Punjab National Bank, launched operations in the first
quarter of 2010, at about the same time that Bhutan Development Finance Corporation acquired a specialized
bank license. Furthermore, an efficient payment system would stimulate commercial and financial transactions,
and reduce costs of physically moving cash and paper-based instruments across regions especially in a country
like Bhutan. The RMA has prepared a long-term strategic plan in January 2009 with a phased approach to
introduce a modernized electronic payment system.60 The Credit Information Bureau (CIB), an important
reform action highlighted under the DPCs, will help enhance the efficiency of the financial sector. The CIB was
launched in September 2009, and the system is operational from November 2009, with products including
Consumer Credit Information Reports and Self Inquiry Reports.

 C.        Expanding Access to Infrastructure (Roads, Electricity, and ICT) in an Environmentally
                                        Sustainable Manner

13.      Towards institutional strengthening of the roads sector, the RGoB has prepared and published
Guidelines on Road Classification System and Delineation of Construction and Maintenance Responsibilities,
which clarify ownership and roles of various agencies as regards to planning and budgeting, implementation,
and maintenance. This was a prior action for the DPFIS, has been adopted, and is currently under
implementation. The DoR is undertaking the process of redesignating roads along these guidelines, and the
2004 Road Act is under revision on this basis. While there is an increasing demand for new roads and
improving existing road infrastructure across the country, the DoR, Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and the
engineering division of dzongkhags require significant capacity enhancement to implement development
programs. Measures to implement training in line with the Human Resource Development Master Plan prepared
by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlements (MoWHS) and MoA has not progressed as anticipated in the
early stages of the DPFIS dialogue, largely due to funding constraints -- even though various ad hoc training
measures have been undertaken with donor support. In order to meet these new challenges, the MoWHS is
considering a proposal to restructure the DoR, and to give it autonomy and convert it into statutory authority. In
the DoR, the Investigation and Development Division (I&DD) has an environmental unit, which is presently
involved in forwarding, with its recommendations, the applications for environmental clearances to competent
authorities for issuing environmental clearances. There is an Assistant Engineer responsible for the functioning
of the unit, and the responsibilities are to be expanded.

14.      Progress on the power sector reforms has been relatively modest. The key players in the sector are the
Government of India (GoI) for hydropower development, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for rural
electrification -- and overall development of the sector is good. A proposal to upgrade the Department of
Energy to a Secretariat was approved in 2008/09. However, due to concerns from the Royal Civil Services

   The RMA Board comprises of: (i) the Minister, Ministry of Finance; (ii) the Secretary, Ministry of Finance; (iii) the Director, National
Statistics Bureau; (iv) the Director General, Economic Affairs, Cabinet Secretariat, and (v) Managing Director, RMA.
60
   Based on the Plan, the first phase of the development of an Electronic Fund Transfer System is being carried out under the Bank`s
Private Sector Development Project.

                                                                                                        Page 5 of 5

Commission on staffing, the proposal is still awaiting implementation. The Bhutan Electricity Authority has
been delinked from the Department of Energy, and is now autonomous. Draft policies for Renewable Energy
and Captive Power Generation are available, and under consultation.

15.      Reforms for the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector have moved well. As
recommended during the DPFIS, Bhutan Information, Communications and Media Authority (BICMA) has
issued a tariff order in June 2009, placing a price cap on wholesale bandwidth tariffs. The new ceiling price for
leased lines in Bhutan, a reduction of 67 percent of previous bandwidth prices, changes Bhutan`s competitive
position in the provision of connectivity. In order to strengthen capacity, the RGoB proposed to undertake and
implement organizational strengthening of the telecom entity in the Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) under
DPFIS, to equip it to undertake the ambitious agenda. Further capacity is still required for BPC to further
expand its business to the telecom sector including Dark Fiber leasing as well as bandwidth leasing, and this will
be an element of the DPC program. The RGoB has provided financial resources from the ICT Development
Fund to the BPC to install Optical Fiber Ground Wire (OPGW) over the existing power transmission lines
throughout the nation. To ensure the reliability of domestic ICT infrastructure, the RGoB initiated a plan to roll
out the domestic backbone throughout the nation. Roll-out of additional communication infrastructure for the
international gateway is underway. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed in August 2009
between MoIC and Bharti Airtel to provide a redundant international ICT infrastructure optical fiber link
through Gelephu, and is expected to be completed by December 2010. An MoU was also signed between Bharti
Airtel and Tashi InfoComm for a Fiber Link via Phuentsholing.

16.     Reforms highlighted under the DPFIS to promote environmental sustainability show good advancement.
In order to clarify mandates, roles, and responsibilities, the RGoB is in the process of revising Environmental
Assessment Act 2000 (EAA 2000) and Regulations for the Environmental Clearance of Projects 2002. Legal
consultants have been hired to look at the areas needing clarification. A draft amendment bill has been prepared
and consulted with the line ministries, NGOs, and private sector. Of the eight sectoral Application for
Environmental Clearance Guidelines, draft revisions for the four priority sectors -- roads and highways, mines,
hydropower, and transmission lines -- have been prepared, and stakeholder workshops on the guidelines for
road and highways have taken place. Review of other guidelines and Environmental Codes of Practices
(ECoPs) is ongoing. The interim ambient air quality standards have been reviewed and revised in light of the
baseline data. The revised National Standard for Ambient Air Quality, Industrial Emission, Workplace
Emissions and Noise Levels for Bhutan have been finalized and issued. These are available on the NEC
website, and are under implementation.
