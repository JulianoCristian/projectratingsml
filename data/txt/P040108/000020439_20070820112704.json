"Ratings for the Trinidad and Tobago\n            Postal Services Reform Project were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: privatization\n            may be an unrealistic objective of postal service reform;\n            privatization may be an unrealistic objective of postal\n            service reform; service standards should be defined in a\n            demand-driven manner; Postal sector transformation is a\n            long-term process, and unlikely to be completed within the\n            life of one project; Broad-based commitment of key\n            stakeholders is a necessary precondition to successful\n            reform; pioneering transactions should be more modest in\n            setting key indicators, and allow for their adjustments in\n            the course of implementation, and concentrate more on\n            lessons learnt. Also, Lessons from world-wide experience and\n            World Bank studies indicate that successful Management\n            Contracts have the following characteristics: (1) Robust,\n            meaningful and relevant performance indicators; (2) Emphasis\n            on incentive fees and financial performance indicators; and\n            (3) Operational autonomy by the operator."}, "docdt": "2007-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
