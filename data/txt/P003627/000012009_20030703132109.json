Lessons\n            address the following. The project demonstrated the\n            economic, and technical feasibility of grain marketing\n            investments, when actually the objective is moving, not\n            storing, grain. By comparison, previous Bank financed grain\n            projects which have focused more on grain storage, have had\n            relatively poor returns. Furthermore, the project\n            implementation period would have been substantially reduced,\n            had key preliminary design work been completed during the\n            preparation phase; and, the process of completing the\n            preliminary design work would have highlighted the fact that\n            management, and ownership arrangements for the Dalian\n            Terminal had not been adequately resolved, which would have\n            led to all those involved in the project better\n            understanding the magnitude of the engineering challenge,\n            and depth of the technology transfer. Although the final\n            outcome was strongly favorable, and the technology transfer\n            was profound, the Bank's influence over this crucial\n            engineering process was haphazard, and uncertain. Most\n            critically, such a massive engineering undertaking requires\n            adequate international technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
