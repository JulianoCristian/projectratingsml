Total\n            expected investment amounts to about $69 million of which\n            more than 50 percent would be for tractors and other farm\n            machinery, about 22 percent for citrus plantation\n            development and about 13 percent for winter vegetable\n            production. The project would involve about 8,000 loans to\n            individual farmers, groups of farms and operators of packing\n            facilities. Farms receiving loans would range in size from 5\n            to 50 ha on irrigated land, or from 15 to 200 ha on dry land."}, "docdt": "1972-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
