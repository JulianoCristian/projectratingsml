Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear sirs,
We refer to the Loan Agreement between International Bank of Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) and Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (the Borrower), dated June 10, 
1994 with respect to the above-captioned project.  We are pleased to inform you of our 
agreement to amend said Loan Agreement.
Regarding your letter BBL-529-VII-98 and in accordance with the established 
terms contained in numerals 2.22 and 2.23 on the Aide Memoire of the Supervision 
Mission #9, we inform you that the Bank agrees to transfer USD15.0 million from 
Category 4 to Category 3.
The Bank also agrees to extend the date for disbursements under Categories 3 and 
4 from June 30, 1999 and June 30, 1998, respectively, to June 30, 2000, which is the 
closing date of the Loan.
The Loan Agreement amendments will read as follows:
1.     The table in paragraph I Schedule I is hereby amended by: (a) replacing the 
figure "93,500,000" in the second column of Category (3) with the figure 
"108,500,000"; and (b) replacing the figure "50,000,000" in the second column of 
Category (4) with the figure "35,000,000".
2.
Paragraph 3(b) of Schedule I is hereby amended by replacing the date "June 30, 
1999" with the date "June 30, 2000".
3.
Paragraph 3 (c) of Schedule 1 is hereby amended by replacing the date "June 30, 
1998"
with the date "June 30, 2000".
4.
Paragraph 2 of Section II of Schedule 4 is hereby amended to read as follows in
its entirety: "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I of this Section, the 
provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or approval of 
terms of reference, budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, 
proposals, evaluation reports, and contracts shall not apply to contracts estimated to 
cost less than $100,000 equivalent each (in the case of contracts with consulting 
firms) or less than $50,000 equivalent each (in the case of contracts with individual 
consultants), up to an aggregate amount which shall not exceed $9,200,000 equivalent 
(said aggregate amount to combine contracts with consulting firms as well as contracts 
with individual consultants).  However, this exception to prior Bank review shall not 
apply to the terms of reference for such contracts or to single source selection of 
firms, to assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank or to 
amendments of contracts raising the contract value to $100,000 equivalent or above (in 
the case of contracts with consulting firms) or $50,000 equivalent or above (in the 
case of contracts with individual consultants)."
