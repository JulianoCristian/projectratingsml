of the On-Farm & Minor\n            Irrigation Networks Improvement Project was satisfactory,\n            while the sustainability was highly likely, the\n            institutional development impact was high, and the Bank and\n            borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that irrigation agriculture should be\n            complemented by training and improvement of technology. The\n            project requires the inclusion of a co-executing agency, an\n            arrangement and binding agreement should be established on\n            modalities of collaboration in project implementation. An\n            improvement in networks, canal lining, etc. improves water\n            quality, saves water, and contributes to the sustainable\n            management of the environment. Decentralization of\n            management and additional activities, such as improving the\n            technical capacity of water user organizations, improve\n            regulations and procedures such as water tariff payments.\n            Establish a national contingency fund to assist in covering\n            financial costs during economic crisis. Transfer of\n            irrigation management and the cultural shift towards more\n            consolidation work create a strong demand for credit by\n            water users organizations to invest in their individual\n            plots. The acquisition of machinery by modules showed a very\n            positive result. It is important to provide training on a\n            continuous basis, both to staff of government agencies and\n            water users organizations."}, "docdt": "2002-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
