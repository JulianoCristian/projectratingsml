would initiate a program to\n            minimize the degradation of Himalayan ecosystems caused by\n            depletion of forest cover, overgrazing and bad land use.\n            These have resulted in increasing erosion and in\n            exacerbating flooding of the Gangetic Plains. The project\n            activities would include: establishment of about 87,000 ha\n            of fuelwood, timber and fodder plantations on government and\n            community land and about 81,000 ha of fuelwood and fodder\n            plantations on private land and field boundaries; soil\n            conservation measures; livestock development (including a\n            cattle exchange program to promote stall-feeding of\n            animals); improvement of agricultural extension services;\n            horticultural development; minor irrigation; as well as\n            research and training. The project would also help\n            strengthen GOI's and GOUP's capacity to plan and\n            implement such schemes and invoke people's\n            participation at various levels."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
