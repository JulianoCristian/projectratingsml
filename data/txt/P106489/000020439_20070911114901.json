        and improve the quality of the implementation of the package\n            of social sector reforms presented by Lebanon at the Paris\n            III donor conference in the areas of social insurance,\n            safety nets, and health expenditures. The project has three\n            main components with the first being the modernization of\n            the social insurance system. This component has four core\n            subcomponents: (a) preparation of a policy framework for\n            social insurance and coverage expansion; (b) improvement of\n            the governance and administration of the NSSF; (c) reforms\n            to guarantee the medium and long terms sustainability of the\n            NSSF; and (d) reforms to strengthen income protection\n            programs (pensions and family allowances). The second\n            component is the strengthening of the social safety nets.\n            These reforms include: (i) institutional strengthening and\n            capacity building for social safety nets and social\n            development; (ii) strengthening protection of the disabled;\n            (iii) safety net programs implementation and service\n            delivery arrangements; and (iv) strengthening the poverty\n            focus of the social safety net programs. Finally the third\n            component is the health sector cost rationalization which\n            will focus on reforms in the Ministry of Public Health and\n            its implementation will be closely coordinated with\n            Component one. Component three focuses on improving on\n            allocation and technical efficiency in health spending"}, "docdt": "2007-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
