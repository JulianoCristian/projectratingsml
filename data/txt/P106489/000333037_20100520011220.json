Lebanon were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the Bank needs to address more\n            aggressively the issue of governance structures, which can\n            foil project implementation. The Bank should improve its\n            efforts to advertise the benefits of a project to win the\n            support of the general populace. It was reported in the\n            Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) component that one reason\n            for the resistance to the Bank project was that there was\n            not enough understanding of what the project benefits will\n            be, on one hand, compared with too much cynicism spawned by\n            too many failed projects of the past, on the other. During\n            the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR)\n            mission, MOPH made the suggestion to hold workshops for\n            stakeholders to inform them of what the project was\n            attempting to achieve as this will provide the opportunity\n            to lower resistance to reforms. The Bank, like other donors,\n            has often made the erroneous assumption that simply because\n            a piece of policy reform is in the national interest of\n            Lebanon, it will be implemented. In Lebanon, the\n            confessional system of governance and the resulting\n            diffusion of political authority make such reforms subject\n            to collective action, and such collective action is, for the\n            same reasons, far from guaranteed."}, "docdt": "2010-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
