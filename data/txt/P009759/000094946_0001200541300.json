time slice of\n            Gujarat's investment program for irrigation which will\n            comprise: continuation of construction of three on-going\n            major irrigation schemes and improving the village-to-market\n            roads network in their command areas; modernization of parts\n            of Gujarat's largest existing irrigation scheme\n            (Ukai-Kakrapar) including reclamation of coastal lands;\n            catchment protection and construction of irrigation\n            facilities in the coastal areas of Saurashtra peninsula;\n            operational and management improvements on existing and\n            on-going irrigation projects; establishment of an institute\n            for training of land development and water management\n            specialists; and project monitoring and evaluation. In\n            addition, the Second Gujarat Irrigation Project will include\n            the preparation of future irrigation projects in India for\n            possible Bank Group financing, including Narmada development\n            projects. The project is designed to increase agricultural\n            production and the standard of living of the farmers in\n            Gujarat. The risks under the proposed project are those\n            normally associated with irrigation projects in India."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
