enterprises and private farmers, for\n            investments in agriculture. The funds would support the\n            objectives of the agricultural development plan to increase\n            production, improve product quality and raise productivity\n            and income, especially on private farms. The more developed\n            Republics and Provinces would receive the bulk of the loan -\n            73 percent compared with 27 percent for the less-developed.\n            Forty-three percent of the proposed loan would be allocated\n            to the private sector and a significant part of that\n            percentage would reach the poorer farmers in whatever part\n            of the country. The proposed project woud cover investments\n            in livestock, vegetable and fruit production, land\n            reclamation and development, agro-industries including grain\n            drying, cold storage and milk collecting, and on-farm mechanization."}, "docdt": "1975-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
