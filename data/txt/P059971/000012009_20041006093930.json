Several lessons\n            are drawn from implementation of the project, as follows. It\n            is suggested that upon introducing innovations to promote\n            changes in educational quality, a gradual building on the\n            concept of effective schools from the ground up is critical,\n            beginning with essential inputs of supplies, teacher\n            training and basic management practices. However, in-service\n            teacher training must have strong connections with the\n            mainstream teacher training department, and institutions if\n            the programs are to have enduring benefits. Next, in order\n            to change attitudes, and pedagogical practices at the\n            classroom level, sustained efforts over time are required,\n            and support at all management and policymaking levels.\n            Particularly important for change are those at the central,\n            provincial and district levels, in a context where\n            hierarchal relations are dominant. Furthermore, technical\n            assistance is important to infuse new ideas, and their\n            continuous reinforcement. Capacity building is a necessary\n            condition to effect lasting institutional change. This is\n            especially important, and useful at decentralized levels.\n            Lessons outline the constraints of the environment, and work\n            within existing structures, suggesting strong, and open\n            communication with policymakers at the national level,\n            required in particular, for innovation programs supported by\n            continuous supervision, and effective monitoring and\n            evaluation systems."}, "docdt": "2004-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
