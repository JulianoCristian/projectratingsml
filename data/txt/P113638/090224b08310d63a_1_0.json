Poverty reduction programs were\n            also fragmented, and poverty measurement and targeting\n            systems needed to be improved. International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) financing and World\n            Bank expertise has helped support Indonesian reform efforts\n            to improve the investment climate, strengthen public\n            financial management, and enhance poverty alleviation and\n            service delivery. The World Bank has been providing this\n            support since 2004 through a series of annual loans under\n            the Indonesia Development Policy Loans (DPL) program. The\n            DPL program overall is a broad, cross-cutting program that\n            has been designed to focus on strengthening government\n            systems for improved policy implementation, in line with the\n            World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy for\n            Indonesia. The DPLs are seen by the Indonesian government\n            not only as a financing instrument, but more as a tool for\n            accelerating its own critical reforms. In November 2011, the\n            World Bank approved the Eighth Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL-8) aimed at building on progress made in improving the\n            investment climate, strengthening public financial\n            management, and enhancing poverty alleviation."}, "docdt": "2012-04-17T03:40:05Z"}
