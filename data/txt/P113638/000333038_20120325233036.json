Fifth Development Policy\n            Loan (DPL) Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: constant collaboration and dialogue\n            between the Government and the Bank continued to be\n            fundamental for the success of the DPL program. The\n            Bank's strong field presence continued to facilitate\n            constant collaboration and dialogue with the Government, not\n            only on the DPL but also on other engagements that provide\n            synergies with the DPL. Such collaboration and dialogue also\n            benefited from the involvement of key reform champions, both\n            within the Government and the Bank, who were able to\n            complete actions in the timeframe agreed upon and ensure the\n            successful delivery of the DPL program. Mapping out a reform\n            program provides meaningful direction and substantive\n            results down the road, but a degree of flexibility is still\n            needed, especially to ensure sustained government ownership.\n            The continued policy dialogue under the DPL has strengthened\n            the knowledge base and allowed the Government to move\n            proactively and take precautionary measures at the time of\n            crisis. Establishment of the Financial System Stability\n            Forum (FSSF), for instance, has formed the basis for the\n            financial sector safety net and allowed the Government to\n            swiftly address systemic risks in the financial system. The\n            Government was also able to proceed quickly in requesting\n            for the Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO)-DPL, which eventually\n            helped in restoring public confidence and advancing other\n            policy reforms, particularly those under public financial\n            management and investment climate. Had the DPL been\n            non-existent, the swift resolution of the financial systemic\n            risks and quick delivery of the DDO-DPL at the time of\n            crisis would not have been possible. DPLs are only one\n            instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted\n            engagement, and the choice of instrument should be\n            contingent on the issue, the political context and the\n            institutional circumstances. This is particularly applicable\n            in the Indonesian case because of the size and scope of the\n            World Bank program in Indonesia. The Bank program in\n            Indonesia is one of the largest of any country in terms of\n            number of staff and overall resources. Large teams are\n            working closely on a daily basis with government\n            counterparts at often very senior levels on a wide range of\n            issues from public financial management and trade and\n            investment, finance, public expenditures and poverty. In\n            this context, the DPL is not the only instrument for\n            supporting reform, but rather complementary to other\n            instruments such as investment projects, Technical\n            Assistance (TA) and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)."}, "docdt": "2010-10-11T00:00:00Z"}
