project will finance expertise,\n            training and equipment for key institutions responsible for\n            macro-economic management and civil service. Specific\n            components include establishing a national planning system\n            through the strengthening of the structures of the National\n            Planning Ministry. Also the efficiency of the tax and\n            customs operations will be improved; and financial\n            management strengthened through the enhancement of the\n            analytical capacity of the Economic and Finance Ministry.\n            Furthermore the project will establish within the Statistics\n            Department a permanent capacity for carrying out standard of\n            living surveys and in depth socio economic studies to\n            identify adverse impacts of adjustment measures. Finally the\n            civil service will be modernized through improving the\n            structures, staff levels and data processing methods of the\n            Civil Service Department and the Central Payroll Agency, and\n            reviewing the existing civil service rules and regulations."}, "docdt": "1988-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
