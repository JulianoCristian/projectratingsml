MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL FOR A
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum ard recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Senegal for SDR 12.5 million (US$17.0
million equivalent) is subm.tted for approval.  The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, and would help
finance a Development Management Project. The project would be cofinanced
by CIDA for US$2.0 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  In 1977, the Government of Seneg?l (GOS) began taking
the first steps to revitalize what had been a stagnating economy, including
a large and inefficient public sector. Starting with efforts to
rationalize public enterprises (supported by two IDA credits), in 1985, the
GOS formulated a medium and long term adjustment program, supported by two
IDA SALs, aimed at reducing public finance deficits, strengthening
financial management, improving investment and production incentives, and
rehabilitating the financial sector. The implementation of this adjustment
program, supported by an IDA Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1061-SE)
brought some positive results, although Senegal continues to face severe
economic difficulties with low per capita income, slow growth, unfavorable
balance of payments, and budget deficits. As a result, the desire to
deepen the effects of the adjustment measures, as well as to sustain the
adjustment process, has led Government to, focus increasingly on the
weaknesses of its administrative system.
3.       Drawing on lessons from earlier admin.strati-e reform programs,
launched in 1972 and 1976 respectively, which failed to bring significant
improvements, and cn the basis of recommendations by an administrative
assessment carried out by IDA, the GOS has reoriented its approach to
administrative reform to give special attention to three key strategic
management functions: planning, financial management, and human resource
management. A long-term reform program has been outlined, stressing the
need to establish a national planning system, to pursue reforms in
financial management, to monitor the social impact of adjustment measures,
and to start the rehabilitation of the personnel system. Action programs
have been developed by the ministries concerned--Plan, Finance, and Civil
Service--covering the first five year period of a much longer term effort
to improve the -ublic sector.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Improving public sector management
is a critical factor to ensure the success of the adjustment process in
Senegal. The weaknesses and inefficiencies, which at present characterize
many government institutions, unless rectified will inhibit the
implementation, on a sustainable basis, of the best formulated policy
reforms. IDA, from th- start, has been most intimately involved with the
conception and progress of this process, and has taken the lead in
developing a constructive dialogue on adjustment related issues, including
institutional strengthening as supported by this project. Thus, IDA has a
comparative advantage over other donors in maintaining its involvement
through support for this project. However, care has been taken to ensure
that project actions complement other ongoing institutional development



- 2 -
efforts in macro-economic management by other donors (mainly UNDP and FAC),
and there will be a continuing effort to pursue close donor coordination
throughout the project.
5.       Proiect Obiectives.  The project would assist the GOS to carry out
administrative reforms to strengthen its economic and financial management
c-pacity in the context of its new policy orientation which is
simultaneously supported by structural adjustment efforts. Specific
objectives are to. (a) improve Government's strategic planning capacity;
(b) increase its ability to mobilize fiscal resources and manage
expenditures including the public debt; (c) monitor the social impact of
its structural adjustment program; and (d) reform its civil service system.
6.       Project Description.  Specific components of the project would:
(a) establish a national planning system, essentially through strengthening
the structures of the Planning Ministry, consolidating the three-year
rolling investment programming and budgeting mechanism, and preparing long-
term development scenarios to guide investment decisions; (b) strengthen
economic and financial management, essentially through improving the
efficiency of tax and customs operations, extending the coverage of public
debt management, modernizing the statistical system, and enhancing the
policy analytical capacity of the Economy and F:nance Ministry; (c)
incorporate the social dimensions in adjustment programs, through
establishing a permanent capacity in the Statistics Department to carry out
standard of living surveys, and financing in-depth socio-economic studies
to identify adverse impact of adjustment measures and propose appropriate
actions; and (d) modernize the civil service system. essentially through
improving the structures, staff level, and data processing methods of the
Civil Service Department and the Central Payroll Agency, and reviewing the
existing civil service rules and regulations. Annual work programs will be
established for the individual components in agreement with IDA. The
project, to be carried out over five years, provides funds for the services
of national and international consultants, training, studies, vehicles and
equipment, office refurbishing, maintenance and incremental operating
costs, and a limited number of contractual staff and performance incentives
to strengthen the Ministries of Planning, Economy and Finance, and Civil
Service and Labor. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$24.7
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$13.4 million
(54Z). The break-down of costs and financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
the status of the Bank Group operations in Senegal are given in Schedules C
and D respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 7106-SE dated April 25, 1988, is also attached.
7.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following: (i) the first-year work program for each participating
agency; (ii) the review of subsequent programs by October of each year; and
(iii) the establishment of a Study Unit in MEF by March 31, 1989. The
conditions of effectiveness will be: (i) deposit of US$50,000 equivalent
made to the Project Counterpart Account; (ii) adoption of a project
monitoring system acceptable to IDA; and (iii) adoption of a system of
managing performance bonuses acceptable to IDA. The conditions of
disbursement will be: (i) against components for contractual staff and for



- 3 -
studies, the adoption of selection criteria and procedures of utilization
of these funds acceptable to IDA; and (ii) against the SDA component,
meeting of all disbursement conditions for co-financing from CIDA and
establishment of a Users' Committee with terms of reference and composition
acceptable to IDA.
8.       Benefits.  Tha GOS must strengthen the organization and staffing
of its core ministries and build up its own capability to design and
implement economic reforms in order to carry through its adjustment program
and capitalize fully on the gains recently acquired through policy reforms.
This project is a first step towards achieving these long-term objectives
by supporting the immediate need for strengthening the capabilities of
agencies involved in implementing and monitoring key SAL measures and
initiating reforms in the civil service systems.
9.       Risks.  The main risks are that: (a) poor civil service conditions
may hinder the full implementation of project activities on a sustainable
basis; (b) management of the reform process may exceed local capacity; ar.d
(c) finding the right technical expertise to assist GOS may be difficult.
The first risk would be minimized by (i) involving agencies in the design
of the reform program; (ii) providing means and incentives to those
responsible for carrying them out; and (iii) reviewing related civil
service rules and regulations. The second risk would be reduced by: (i)
adjusting the pace of reforms to actual capacity through review of annual
work programs; and (ii) setting up effective coordination and a project
administration and monitoring system. To minimize the third risk, the
project would assist Government in (i) identifying the required technical
expertise, both in Senegal and abroad; (ii) resorting to external
consultants only in specialized areas and generally for short-term periods;
and (iii) encouraging the Senegalese within and outside the Government to
participate with foreian experts in the search for solutions to che
problems facing their country.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend its
approval by the Executive Directors.
