The key lessons learned\n            include: 1) Ownership is a sine qua non for project success.\n            2) Lack of motivation was a severe problem in the Senegalese\n            administration. A lesson for the Bank is to recognize that\n            only when a proposed incentive system receives broad support\n            by users and providers will it have a chance to be\n            successfully implemented. 3) Institutional stability and\n            continuity are essential to ensure responsibility for\n            project outcome. 4) The Bank should adjust to realities. The\n            institutional reality was staff turnover and lack of\n            incentives. The political reality was lack of Government\n            ownership and commitment to implement the program. By\n            encouraging a disinterested government to extend the closing\n            date three times, the Bank demonstrated indecisiveness and\n            undermined its own credibility with the Borrower."}, "docdt": "1997-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
