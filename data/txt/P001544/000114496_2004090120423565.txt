          Re:   Credit No. 1967 MAG
                (Economic Management and Social Action Project)
                Amendments to Schedule I of the
                Development Credit Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to the above-mentioned Development Credit Agreement between
the democratic Republic of Madagascar (the Borrower) and the International
Development Association (the Association) dated December 15,
1988.  We also refer to discussions held with your
representatives during the last supervision mission and the
letters re: 019/PASAGE/CN, 020/PASAGE/CN and 021/PASAGE/CN from
His Excellency Bruno Bearino, Minister of Budget and Plan p.i.,
requesting the financing of the project coordination services
out of the proceeds of the Credit, a reallocation of Credit
proceeds no longer required for the components "Health" and
"Food Security" and a simplification of the disbursement
categories.
     Further to these requests, I am pleased to inform you that
the Association hereby agrees to the following changes in the
table under paragraph 1 of Schedule I to the Development Credit
Agreement:
          The sub-categories (a) Training and (b) Consultants'
          services and studies under Categories (1), (4), (5),
          (6), (8), (9) and (10) are merged into a single sub-
          category under said Categories, with a disbursement
          percentage of expenditures to be financed at 100%; said
          disbursement percentage will also apply to Category (11).
          The sub-categories (a) through (g) under Category (2)
          and Category (3) are merged under a single Category
          entitled "Parts A.3 and A.4 of the Project."
          A new Category (12) is created, entitled "Materials,
          equipment, vehicles, consultants' services and
          operating costs for Part C.4 of the Project" with an
          amount of DTS 130,000 reallocated from Category (13)
          Unallocated and a disbursement percentage of
          expenditures to be financed at 100%.  Categories (12)
          and (13) are consequently renumbered (13) and (14),
          respectively.  An amount of DTS 700,000 from sub-
          category I (c) is reallocated to Category (II), and an
          amount of DTS 300,000 from Category (2) is reallocated
          to Category (13) Unallocated, now renumbered (14).
          As a result of these changes, a revised table is set
forth in the Annex to this letter, including paragraph 2 in
which a new sub-paragraph (c) has been added defining
incremental "operating costs."
As a result of these changes, a revised table is set forth in
the Annex to this letter, including paragraph 2 in which a
new sub-paragraph (c) has been added defining "operating costs."
In addition, the Association hereby agrees to the addition of
a new Part C.4 in Schedule 2,
Description of the Project, which reads:
    "Part C: Economic Management
Page  2
    (4) Strengthening the services of the Ministry of Plan for
