The project is composed of three major\n            components: (a) a social action program, which will include\n            a malaria control program, family planning expansion, and a\n            worker redeployment program; (b) a program to strengthen the\n            Government's administrative capacity for identifying,\n            implementing and monitoring long-term targeted social\n            programs; and (c) the financing of short-term technical\n            assistance for studies, training and logistical support for\n            public sector reform."}, "docdt": "1988-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
