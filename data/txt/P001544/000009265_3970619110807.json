{"cdata!": "The Economic Management and Social\n            Action Project in Madagascar was implemented. The\n            Bank's performance during identification is considered\n            satisfactory. Project implementation was affected by a\n            number of factors, both general and specific to individual\n            components of the program. General factors include: (a) poor\n            project design, making it necessary to restructure the\n            project in October 1992; (b) lack of strong project\n            leadership initially, which was reflected in a lack of\n            accountability; and (c) sluggish procurement procedures, as\n            a result of repeated controls by various central agencies.\n            The situation became worse in July 1991 as the political\n            situation grew unstable. Large demonstrations and general\n            strikes paralyzed the Government and seriously disrupted the\n            economy. The primary lessons to be drawn from this project\n            are as follows: Project structure and design should be\n            simple and manageable. It proved to be unrealistic to\n            undertake such a diverse project and complicated project\n            structure. In their haste to attenuate the effects of the\n            structural adjustment program, the Bank and the Government\n            designed an overly ambitious, multi sectoral project that\n            was difficult to appraise and implement, and costly to\n            supervise. In view of the weak institutional capacity, the\n            project should have been designed in a simpler fashion, and\n            should have concentrated on those areas where the political\n            climate and the institutional capacity were most conducive\n            to success."}, "docdt": "1997-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
