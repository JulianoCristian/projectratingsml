 the Poor of the Northern Uplands and Central Highlands\n            Project for Vietnam were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, and both the Bank and Grantee performance was\n            moderately satisfactory.  Lessons learned include the\n            following: (1) It is possible to deliver on needed health\n            results to the hard to reach and vulnerable population\n            groups with different approaches.  (2) Impact on national\n            programs and systems would be enhanced with clear\n            expectations and appropriate integration into the health\n            administration rather than as a separate project. (3) The\n            World Bank administering the funds of another donor should\n            be done only when it does not add a double burden of project\n            supervision and reporting and provides leverage for greater\n            impact. (4) Pilots providing temporary relief to a chronic\n            health condition should consider the ethical implications\n            and Governments should not exempt such activities from its\n            own human experiment review procedures."}, "docdt": "2012-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
