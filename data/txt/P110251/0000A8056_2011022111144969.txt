                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project remains relevant for the health sector needs of the involved provinces and the project development objectives are still valid. The progress towards the development
                         objectives is moderately satisfactory and the overall implementation progress is moderately unsatisfactory. The disbursement rate of the project is very low and the financial
                         management has deteriorated since the last supervision mission due to the lack of sufficient capacity and resources to deal with the rapidly increasing demands for disbursement.
                         Considering that only 18 months are left until the project's closure tremendous efforts will be required to disburse the remaining balance of the trust fund. The main bottleneck in the
                         project is the lack of human resources at the district level where the bulk of the trust fund amount is expected to be spent.
