                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The project outcomes continue to show good improvement. For example and based on the reported data from the project communes and districts through September 30, 2011
                         there has been increase in the percentage of children under age one fully vaccinated against DPT and Measles vaccines from 89.3 in 2010 to 94.6 percent by September 2011 the
                         percentage of deliveries attended by trained health staff increased from 56 in 2010 to 66 by September 2011and the number of people per 1000 population able to access in-patient
                         consultation services increased from 57.6 to 73.6.

                         2. The number of outreach services was significantly scaled up. For example, more than 5800 outreach sites for delivering the extended program of immunization was established
                         delivering more than 20,000 immunizations to previously missing children. Almost 19,000 antenatal care visits were provided to women at their homes while more than 23,000
                         postnatal care visits were provided. About 26,000 malnourished children were identified and about half of those children received nutritional supplements in 2011.

                         3. The Ministry of Health project team completed 97 of the original 2011 procurement plan or 80 of the approved mid-year revised plan, including additional activities to expand some
                         of the project investments in Communes not originally supported by the Project. The 2012 annual plan was approved sufficiently ahead of the time to allow for its smooth
                         implementation. Forty-eight percent of the Grant was disbursed in 2011. The Ministry of Health is currently expected to make full use of the Grant funds. Only a few contract
                         activities are on-going and are expect to be completed by April 30, 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The Ministry of Health Project Team, supported by the EU financed technical assistance, has developed an 'exit strategy' given that the Trust Fund financing the outreach services
                         and the health insurance support for the poor will close June 30, 2012. In the implementation of this exit strategy, important decisions are to be reached in terms of which activities
                         will be able to continue without additional funding, possible other State funding sources (Provinces, National Targeted Programs), and the handover of certain project activities to
