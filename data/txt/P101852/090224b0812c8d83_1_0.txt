The mini CPPR concluded that enough progress is being made on the project and therefore recommended that the Implementation Progress be upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory.
It was also recommended to maintain the Project Development Objective rating as Moderately Satisfactory.
Since the resolution of outstanding challenges the speed of implementation of all project activities has increased. A common targeting of the poor strategy has been completed for
O    implementation by all stakeholders. This is a collaborative effort of the Ministries of Health and Employment and Social Welfare as well as the National Health Insurance Authority.
