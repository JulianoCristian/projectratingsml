                         The Claims Processing Center has been successfully upgraded and is being piloted in one facility in Accra. A successful pilot will be followed by roll out into all tertiary, ten regional,
                         and a number of district hospitals.

                         Implementation of the capitation pilot is underway in the Ashanti Region and the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), in consultation with key stakeholders, developed a plan
                         for nationwide roll-out of the capitation program to other parts of the country.

                         Participation in the Gatekeeper and Medical Referral Policies sensitization has improved significantly. Nationwide training for service providers was completed on September 30,
                         2012.

                         The Government is preparing to submit a formal request to the World Bank to extend the closing date so that they can ensure that the electronic claims system that is being out in
                         place functions properly before the project closes. The Country Director (CD) has agreed in principle to this request and once the request is received the extension will be processed.
                         The proposed new closing date will be June 30, 2013.

                         The project continues to be relevant as the objective of strengthening the financial and operational management of the project is still one of the priorities of the Government. This is
                         included in the Health Sector Medium-term Development Plan, 2010 - 2013.

                         The delay in project implementation could adversely affect the efficiency of the project as cost of implementation of activities could go up.

                         The efficacy of the project may be affected if there are challenges of power connections to the health facilities and the District Health Insurance Schemes that may not allow the full
                         utilization of the computerized claims management system that is being put in place under the project.
