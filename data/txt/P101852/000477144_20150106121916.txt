                                          xii
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       At the time of project appraisal in 2007, Ghana had experienced relative macroeconomic
stability and high real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The GDP growth rate averaged 6.2
percent between 2005 and 2006, compared to the previous twenty-year average of 4.5 percent.
The Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2006-2009 (GPRS II) built on the country’s
macroeconomic stability and high economic growth rates, and focused on developing Ghana into
a middle-income country by 2015.

2.       On the health financing side, the Cash and Carry System of user charges instituted in
1992 had shown both intended and unintended outcomes. As intended, this system contributed to
facility revenue generation and reduced unnecessary service usage; user fees accounted for 16.5
percent of the total public health services revenue in 2003. In 1985, when user charges were first
substantially increased, outpatient visits in hospitals dropped from 4.5 million to 1.6 million.
While achieving the intended purposes of generating revenue and reducing unnecessary use,
concerns were raised that such system may expose the poor and vulnerable to risks related to
catastrophic health expenditures, e.g., increased financial burden and averting necessary care. It
was also thought to have contributed to worsening health indicators. Infant mortality rates
increased from 57 to 64 per 1,000 live births and under-5 child mortality rates increased from 108
to 111 per 1,000 children from 1998 to 2003 (Ghana Ministry of Health 2006). In addition, wide
discrepancies persisted in health indicators across socio-economic and regional groups. For
example, the infant-mortality rate per 1,000 live births in 2003 varied from 33 in Upper East
Accra to 105 in Upper West Accra (Ghana Ministry of Health 2006).

3.       The Health Insurance Act 650 of August 2003 was introduced in an effort to reduce
financial barriers to access. Since 2003, the Government of Ghana (GoG) has been working to
implement the Health Insurance Act. At the time of project appraisal and according to the
Government, District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes (DMHIS) were operating in all 138
districts with 38 percent of the population registered. Based on this, the National Health Insurance
Scheme (NHIS) set a target of reaching 55 percent insurance coverage by 2007, but noted that the
achievement of this target might be compromised by a number of issues at policy and
implementation level as follows:

       Lack of concrete governance arrangements and responsibilities for NHIS
        implementation;
       Challenges to maintain financial sustainability of the NHIS and the DMHIS;
       Poor management of public expectations of NHIS;
       Difficulties providing effective coverage for the poor and “exempt” indigents;
       Delays and inconsistencies in issuing health identity cards to those who are registered;
       Inadequate tools for processing and reimbursing claims; and
       Insufficient administrative, managerial and technical human capacity.

Rationale for Bank involvement

4.       The Bank’s involvement was well justified at the time of project appraisal. First, this
project would contribute to poverty reduction and the achievement of the MDGs by supporting a
health insurance scheme that could potentially mobilize additional resources for the health sector,
improve risk management, and support the poor. Second, the Bank had extensive experience in

                                                 1
fiscal policies, labor policies, and international competitiveness that are critical for designing
contributory health insurance schemes. Third, this project would provide support in
accountability, management capacity, and governance, the areas for which reforms were needed
according to analytical reports published by the World Bank and the International Labor
Organization. Finally, the proposed project support was consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy at the time of project appraisal.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

5.      The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the financial and operational
management of the National Health Insurance Scheme by improving: (i) the policy adaptation
and implementation capacity of the National Health Insurance Council in addressing ongoing
core policy issues related to contribution collection, risk equalization, and provider payment
mechanisms; and (ii) the purchasing function of the District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes,
and the billing function of the Providers.

6.       The key indicator used to measure progress towards the PDO is “% of total claims ($)
that are not paid within statutory time period (30 days) due to vetting delays caused by suspected
error, abuse, and fraud”.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

7.       The PDO remained the same through the entire implementation period, while the PDO
indicators were changed through project restructuring in 2011. A level-II restructuring was
undertaken in April 2011, but due to a Government request of changing the definition of the PDO
indicators, the restructuring paper was processed again in June 2011. Therefore, while there
appear to be two restructurings in the system (there was less than two months between these two
restructuring and two project papers appear similar), in reality there was only one restructuring to
revise the PDO indicators. For this reason, only the restructuring of June 2011 is referred to in
other sections of the ICR when it is related to changes in component activities and indicators.
Through this restructuring, the original PDO indicator was dropped and four new indicators were
proposed (Table 1) to improve M&E of the project. The main reason for changes in PDO
indicators was because there was difficulty in measuring the original indicator as a result of data
unavailability.

Table 1. PDO indicators before and after restructuring

Time period                         PDO indicators
Before restructuring in June        Indicator One: % of total claims ($) that are not paid
2011                                within statutory time period (30 days) due to vetting delays
                                    caused by suspected error, abuse, and fraud.
After restructuring in June         Indicator One: total number of claims received
2011                                electronically by processors (NHIS) from provider

                                    Indicator Two: % of total claims submitted by providers
                                    to NHIS (DMHIS or Claims Processing Center/CPC) for
                                    processing that passed the initial screening (i.e. not rejected

                                                 2
                                    by first electronic/manual review)

                                    Indicator Three: % of total “clean” claims that are
                                    reimbursed by payers (NHIS) to providers within 60 days
                                    of claims receipt

                                    Indicator Four: % of population in the lowest quintile
                                    (20% of the index of socio-economic status) registered
                                    under the NHIS with a valid card

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.        As described in the PAD, the beneficiaries of the Health Insurance Project were to be: (i)
the National Health Insurance Council (NHIC), who would be more capable of managing the
National Health Insurance Scheme operationally and financially; (ii) the District Mutual Health
Insurance Schemes which would have streamlined mechanisms for local level administration; and
(iii) the Providers including Ghana Health Service (GHS), the teaching hospitals, Christian Health
Association of Ghana (CHAG), the health service providers from other ministries, and other
providers who will have improved financial management and administrative mechanisms to
improve their overall management performance.

9.      In addition, users of health services and insurance members within the population were
also expected to benefit from the project as a result of improved efficiency of the health insurance
schemes and service providers.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component A: Enabling Environment for NHIS Implementation (US$2.05 million)
10.      This component of the Project was to strengthen the policy adaptation and
implementation capacity of the National Health Insurance Council in the following areas: 1)
Stakeholder coordination; 2) Project management and sustainability; 3) Communication strategy
to manage public expectations; 4) Standardizing fee schedules and medicines lists; 4)
Performance-based provider payment mechanisms and other policy adaptations; 5) Development
of related projects for donor support; 6) System for conducting routine audits and controlling for
fraud and abuse.

Component B: Financial and Operational Management Tools (US$8.6 million)
11.      This component of the Project was to improve the purchasing function of the DMHIS and
the billing function of the Providers by moving the billing and claims process from a paper-based
to electronic-based system. Specifically, the project was to support the development and
implementation of the Provider interface in the following areas: 1) Providers’ ne eds analyses and
strategies for business process tools; 2) Network development, hardware, and alternative energy
solutions; 3) Software and systems integration.

Component C: Financial and Operational Management Training (US$4.35 million)
12.     This component was to improve the skills in health insurance administration for staff
working for the MOH, NHIC, DMHISs, and the Providers, including actuarial analysis, insurance
daily operation, premiums management, payment mechanism, liquidity and utilization.
Specifically, the Project was to support training and capacity building in the following areas: 1)

                                                 3
Needs assessment and strategy development; 2) Management training; 3) Training in ICT
Network Operations; 4) Training for internal actuarial analysis and other core analysis skills; and
5) Financial management training.

1.6 Revised Components

13.      Activities were revised and regrouped under components through the Level II
restructuring of June 2011, as follows:

       For Component A, the Project was to focus on: (i) streamlining to an efficient provider
        payment mechanism for NHIS; (ii) improving the sustainability of the NHIS, (iii)
        improving equity in the coverage of the poor by the NHIS, (iv) support restructuring data
        and analysis, and (v) support project management, coordination and monitoring and
        evaluation.
       For Component B, the Project was to focus on: (i) strengthening governance and
        oversight of e-health; (ii) streamlining an integrated claims management system for the
        NHIS; and (iii) strengthening automation in the major hospitals.
       Component C was dropped, with some of the activities dropped or folded into
        Components A or B.

14.     The rationale for changes in components A and B was to reduce the number of sub-
components, as well as to make activities more connected and results-focused. The rationale for
dropping component C was that activities could be moved to the other two components without
losing the original intent of the project; also, the Government decided to finance some of the
Component C activities on its own. Details of these changes can be found in Annex 2.


1.7 Other significant changes

15.      In addition to changes in the components and PDO indicators, there were changes in
project cost allocation, closing date, and one legal covenant.

16.      Change in project cost allocation: Project cost allocation was changed through
restructuring of June 2011. While the total cost of the project remained the same through
implementation, there were changes in component costs due to changes in component activities.
Table 2 shows the funding allocation between components before and after restructuring of June
2011.

17.      Extension of the Closing Date: The original Closing Date of the project was December
31, 2012. In order for the implementation agency to have sufficient time to complete all planned
project activities, the Closing Date was extended to March 31, 2014.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.      It was critical that the Bank decided to support the National Health Insurance Authority
(NHIA) in strengthening health insurance management. The Bank had been taking a leading role
in health insurance and financing globally and has accumulated a large knowledge base in this
area. When the project was prepared, both Ghana NHIS and National Health Insurance Authority
(NHIA) were in their infancy, and could benefit greatly from international knowledge and
lessons. In addition, there was no development partner working with the NHIA until this project
was prepared. Indeed, throughout the entire project period, the Bank was the only development
partner that provided significant support to NHIA. This gave enormous opportunities for the
Government to be exposed to and benefit from international expertise, e.g., the introduction of
capitation, a globally proven effective provider payment mechanism.

19.      A strong technical team was deployed by the Bank to bring up-to-date knowledge and
international experiences into the project design. The design of the project included both
knowledge service and infrastructure investment at the same time. The technical arm on policy
development introduced globally proved effective policies and methodologies, creating country
specific evidence, and building domestic capacity. The operational arm on claims system adopted
advanced technology to reduce errors and expedite bill processing. In addition, these two arms of
the design together had an interactive effect in addition to their own benefit, as the electronic
claims processing system makes it much easier to obtain evidence on service delivery and
utilization, as well as implement policies on cost containment and quality assurance.

20.     In March 2007, one month before appraisal, a Quality Enhancement Review was
conducted at the request of the task team. The panel endorsed the project as well designed and
commended team on the project design, as well as on the quality and appropriateness of the
background analysis. Many of the recommendations made by the panel were addressed in the
project design and implementation, such as the development of a health data dictionary, assuring
comparability of equipment, and coordinating with Ghana ICT Directorate in the Ministry of
Communications.


21.      Lack of implementation readiness delayed project implementation in its early phase.
Looking retrospectively, the risk analysis at appraisal appeared to be optimistic without
adequately anticipating the risk of slow implementation by a new agency which had no
experience in implementing Bank-financed projects. Major risks identified were either IT specific
or political1 . The original disbursement estimate did not appear to have considered the weak

 The major risks included: a) delay or lack of coordination in implementing the ICT Network
Platform; b) political barriers to making unpopular but necessary changes to benefits, premiums,
or exemptions; and c) lack of flexibility of planned IT to incorporate policy changes.

                                               5
implementation capacity and the lead time needed for procurement and policy activities. Further,
the project could have benefited from a more participatory approach during preparation to involve
additional stakeholders such as service providers. The lack of realism in designing PDO indicator
has caused that the indicator couldn’t be measured for a long period of time.


2.2 Implementation

22.      The project experienced a slow start after effectiveness due to lack of readiness. On the
Bank side, the early stage ISRs reveal that the slow disbursement was not of particular concern,
as it was expected that disbursement could only take place after Government procurement of the
ICT network was completed. Looking retroactively, the Bank could have been more proactive in
addressing the slow progress and disbursement lag. On the Government side, the NHIA, as a new
institution, had to devote a significant amount of time and effort to develop a collaborative
working relationship with other key stakeholders including the Ministry of Health, GHS, CHAG
and teaching hospitals.

23.      A mid-term review (MTR) was carried out in December 2009 to identify main
bottlenecks for the slow progress since effectiveness, as only 10.5 percent of project funds were
disbursed by then, two years after effectiveness. The newly on-board supervision task team rated
both the likelihood of achieving PDO and implementation progress as moderately unsatisfactory,
and identified key factors impeding the implementation as follows: 1) lack of preparedness before
implementation, e.g., information technology assessment required for Component B was not
carried out until the MTR; 2) relatively low implementation capacity of the responsible agency,
NHIA, as a four-year old institution; 3) lack of common understanding of the roles of different
institutions in implementing the project, exacerbated by changes at leadership and staff level in
MOH and NHIA following 2009 elections.

24.      A project restructuring during the MTR in 2009 to revise PDO indicators and
components was deemed necessary but this did not take place until June 2011 (eighteen months
later). This long lag to process the restructuring was due to a number of factors, including
changes in Government leadership as a result of elections, change in project implementation staff
within NHIA, as well as time and efforts required to reach agreement between the Government
and Bank team. Nevertheless, through the restructuring process, the project activities were
mainstreamed and the PDO indicators became measurable. During the period between MTR and
restructuring, although no substantial progress was made on project implementation and fund
disbursement, the Bank team provided strong technical support to assist the NHIA in designing a
pilot of capitation for primary health care, which later became impactful in shaping Government’s
policy on provider payment mechanism. A number of sectoral works financed by a separate trust
fund implemented by the Bank such as health financing study and country status note, were also
undertaken during this period to generate evidence base for policy making.

25.     This project was transformed from a problem project to a fully disbursed and impactful
project during the later stage of implementation after the June 2011 restructuring. About 75
percent of project fund was disbursed during an 18-month period, with disbursement ratio
increasing from 21 percent as of January 2012 to 96 percent as of June 2013. A number of key
factors have contributed to this achievement: 1) detailed review of project activities during the
two years following mid-term review; 2) enhanced project management by NHIA such as
appointing key staff (project coordinator, procurement specialist, ICT analyst), establishing a
network of focal persons for each component throughout NHIA, GHS, CHAG and teaching

                                                6
hospitals; 3) the Bank management’s close follow up on project status and constant guidance
through portfolio reviews including Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPRP), etc.; 4) the
Bank team coming on board after restructuring provided timely and pragmatic implementation
support to expedite the procurement process of ICT equipment, which has been highly
appreciated by both the Government and Bank management.

26.     There was a proactive and consistent focus on reaching the poor under this project.
Coverage of the poor has always been highlighted by the Bank team and management throughout
implementation, and this attention never diminished for both the Government and the Bank, even
when there was increased pressure from the perspectives of actuarial balance and financial
sustainability. To reach the poor, there was also close collaboration between the NHIA and the
Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare to use the common targeting mechanism.

27.     Project implementation was integrated into the routine work of NHIA. With the project
implementation unit as an integral part of the organization, the project received close oversight
from senior management of NHIA and close collaboration with other departments within NHIA
such as finance, membership, clinical audit, and CPC. This arrangement has also ensured
consistency and synergy between project activities and other ongoing initiatives, as well as
sustainability of project achievements after the project was closed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28.     M&E design: Overall, the design of M&E was conceptually relevant. A common
evaluation framework was designed by NHIA to guide data collection, consolidation and
dissemination, ensuring stakeholder feedback captured in project implementation. The M&E
design also took into consideration the existing capacity of the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to
collect provider side information such as revenues collected and time taken to submit claims.
Looking retrospectively, some elements of the M&E design showed lack of realism and
preparedness. For example, it was raised in the ISR that the PDO indicator may not be
measurable six months after the project became effective. This issue was eventually resolved
through a project restructuring in June 2011.

29.      M&E implementation: The M&E implementation was diligent. The rating for M&E in
ISRs started as Satisfactory, then downgraded to Unsatisfactory because the original PDO
indicator was not measurable. The rating for M&E was eventually upgraded as Satisfactory
reflecting the regular updates on indicators after restructuring. The documentation of component
activities was also informative. It is worth highlighting that the project not only updated
information in the results framework, but also regularly updated key developments that are
critical for the scheme’s overall performance, including scheme liquidity and financial
sustainability. There was also M&E process built into the pilot of the capitation policy, trying to
inform decision making on scale-up. It is however noted that targets used to track project progress
in ISRs and AMs are different than what are specified in the project paper of June 2011 and it is
not clear why this was the case and not identified and rectified during implementation. The M&E
for the capitation was not able to capture all the baseline information (e.g., service utilization and
quality), which may be enhanced in future operations.

30.     M&E utilization: M&E data was often used for communication with key stakeholders.
The project coordinator regularly provided updates to the steering committee and Bank portfolio
performance review so that senior management on each side was kept informed of the project
progress and impact. The evaluation of the capitation pilot played a key role in informing policy

                                                  7
makers during the decision process of scale up. The Government also took advantage of the
Bank’s flagship courses/workshops on health financing and UHC, to communicate the status of
the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and share experiences with peer countries and
experts.

31.     Overall, the M&E process of the project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory due to issues
with the original design and implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     Safeguards: This project was classified as Category C and no safeguard policies were
triggered. The ratings for safeguard compliance have been Satisfactory throughout the
implementation period.

33.      Financial Management: This project was fully disbursed before closing, and the last
ISR rated FM as Satisfactory. Some FM issues were raised during implementation, but were
eventually resolved as a result of enhanced project management and implementation support.
These issues were: 1) there was no FM specialist in NHIA knowledgeable on Bank procedures; 2)
some financial statements and audit reports were submitted late and not in required formats; 3)
the project had a large disbursement lag due to delays in implementation of component B
activities during early stages of implementation.

34.     Procurement: Although with delays and slow implementation, there was no major
compliance issues reported to be related to procurement. In only one ISR, the procurement was
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory, because the procurement plan was not updated. This issue
was resolved soon after it was identified, with a qualified procurement consultant recruited and
the plan updated.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.      Transition arrangements: The Government has announced the plan to expand the
capitation pilot in Ashanti region to another three regions (Upper West, Upper East and Volta
regions). Transition arrangements have also been made for the electronic claims processing
system in terms of transfer of equipment and maintenance requirements. It is likely that these
systems will continue to be used even after project closing, as it has become part of the routine
business of the NHIA and concerned facilities.

36.      Next phase/follow-up operation: During the recent years, more development partners
have started working together with the Government on NHIS, or broadly, on health financing.
Both DFID and USAID have started providing support on provider payment, health expenditure
review, capacity building, etc. The newly approved Bank financed project on maternal and child
health will strengthen the enrollment of pregnant women into schemes by incentivizing
community workers. The Bank also plans to engage the NHIA on technical work that will review
service utilization under insurance scheme, which will serve as critical inputs for evaluating the
efficiency and equity of insurance scheme, provide baseline information for the roll-out of
capitation in the three regions, and provide inputs to the discussions on a follow-up project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


                                                8
Rating: High

37.     Country and global priorities: According to Ghana’s Health Sector Medium Term
Development Plan (HSMTDP) for 2010-2013 and 2014-2017, one of the country’s priorities is to
bridge equity gaps in access to health services, ensuring sustainable financing and financial
protection for the poor, and improving efficiency in the governance and management of the
health system. Globally, achieving health-related MDGs by 2015 and moving toward Universal
Health Coverage during the post-2015 era remain priorities for all developing countries. In the
Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy FY13-16 that embraces the Bank’s twin goals, the overall
aim is to assist Ghana in sustaining economic growth, accelerating poverty reduction and
enhancing shared prosperity in a sustainable manner, with one outcome specifically focusing on
improving access to health services.

38.      Relevance of objectives: The project’s objective, “to strengthen the financial and
operational management of the National Health Insurance Scheme”, remains highly relevant to
current country and global priorities, as well as to the Bank’s assistance strategy both before and
after restructuring as the PDO did not change. The high relevance to current country and global
priorities, and the Bank’s assistance strategies is demonstrated by the project’s direct contribution
to efficiency improvement of health insurance management, which has an evident effect on health
system efficiency, equitable access to services, and poverty reduction.

39.      Relevance of design and implementation: The design and implementation of the project
were well-aligned with the objective in aiming to improve the operational and management
efficiency of Ghana’s health insurance scheme. The project supported the National Health
Insurance Authority in mainstreaming health insurance policies and improving billing operations,
such as piloting an innovative provider payment policy and a sophisticated claims processing
system, which fully serves the objective and maintains its relevance to country and global
priorities. The project had a special focus on covering the poor and vulnerable by NHIS with one
PDO indicator being “percent of population in the lowest quintile (20% of the index of socio -
economic status) registered under the NHIS with a valid card”.

40.      Although there are some modifications to the project design during restructuring, the
design remains highly relevant both before and after restructuring as the restructuring only made
the design more coherent and results focused. The relevance of implementation is rated
Substantial before restructuring despite the overall progress, particularly disbursement, was slow,
because there was close dialogue expediting the policy related work. The relevance of
implementation after restructuring is rated High as the implementation made sure all designed
activities were put into place, outputs achieved and objectives achieved (see more details in the
following section). There is no record of deviating from project design and intended objectives
during implementation.

41.      Overall, the relevance of the project is rated as High, considering the high relevance of
the objective throughout the entire implementation period, the substantial relevance of design and
implementation before restructuring, and the high relevance of design and implementation after
restructuring.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial


                                                 9
Achievement of PDO before restructuring

42.      The original PDO indicator before restructuring was “% of total claims ($) that are not
paid within statutory time period (30 days) due to vetting delays caused by suspected error, abuse,
and fraud”. As previously indicated, this PDO turned out not measurable and was dropped during
restructuring. Prior to being dropped during the restructuring, there was no data collected for this
indicator to measure the progress towards achieving objectives. Progress was, however, made
during this period in some of the intermediate outcome indicators such as in development of cost
containment policies and population exemption policies. There was also progress in getting ready
for activities related to Component B such as preparing specification of needed IT equipment and
development of a procurement plan. With the above considerations, the achievement of PDO is
rated as modest for the period before restructuring.

Achievement of PDO after restructuring

43.      Overall, the Project has achieved the PDO of “strengthening the financial and operational
management of the National Health Insurance Scheme” after restructuring. The ICR team notes
that different targets have been used to track project performance in different Bank documents
including the restructuring paper, Aide-Memoires (AMs) and ISRs. The ICR team chose to use
the targets set for year 2012 in the project paper of June 2011 2 to evaluate achievement of
outcomes, as there were no further official changes in the targets when the project closing date
was later extended. Table 3 summarizes the achievement of each PDO indicator, showing three
indicators over-achieved and one indicator 79 percent achieved. As shown in Table 3,
achievements for three indicators are high, and one is substantial. Considering the over-
achievement of three PDO indicators and close-to-achievement of one PDO indicator, the rating
for achievement of PDO after restructuring is rated as high.

  In the June 2011 restructuring paper, there were different presentations of project targets of
PDO indicators between the main text and the annex: in the main text, year 2012 targets were
used as final targets for the project; while in the annex, targets were set for the period up to year
2014 to envision achievement beyond project implementation period for planning purposes.
Given the official project closing date at the time of restructuring was December 31, 2012, the
ICR team used year 2012 targets as final targets of the project. No formal revisions were made to
the final project targets when the project closing date was later extended in December 2012.

2010 to 864,534 at the end of March, 2014 when the project closed. The project has achieved
about 86 percent of the 1 million targeted for this indicator. Although not a 100 percent
achievement, this indicator has progressed impressively since the electronic claims system was
put in place in April 2013. Within a year, the number of claims received reached more than
800,000 when the project closed. Data collected beyond project closing period shows that by end
of June, 2014, the total number of claims processed electronically has exceeded the target of one
million (Figure 1).

PDO Indicator Two: Percentage of total claims submitted by providers to NHIS (DMHIS or
CPC) for processing that passed the initial screening (i.e. not rejected by first
electronic/manual review)

45.     The percentage of claims submitted to NHIS that passed initial screening increased from
45 percent in 2010 to 99 percent in 2014. Compared with the target of 59 percent, this project has
achieved 178 percent of the target.

PDO Indicator Three: Percentage of total “clean” claims that are reimbursed by payers
(NHIS) to providers within 60 days of claims receipt

46.      The percentage of total clean claims that are reimbursed by NHIS to providers within 60
days of receipt increased from 65 percent in 2010 to 100 percent in 2014. Compared with the
target of 80 percent, this project has achieved 125 percent of the target.

47.    The achievement of PDO indicators one, two and three are closely related to successful
implementation of the following project activities:

       A National Health Data Dictionary was developed under the project. It includes over 800
        elements and enables health facilities to generate and submit uniform reports using
        standardized terminology to the NHIS (IO#6).
       A medical terminology and disease coding module was developed and training was
        provided to 936 participants who are claims processing staff in NHIA or health facilities
        and have no clinical background. The training greatly improved their capacity in
        submitting and processing claims accurately (IO#5).
       The installation of E-claims system and deployment of iHost under the project made it
        possible for providers to submit claims electronically. The project has provided

                                                                   12
        upgrading to the E-claims system in the CPC and targeted 47 health facilities to submit
        claims electronically. When the project closed, 30 facilities were submitting claims
        electronically. Trainings were also provided under the project to sensitize health care
        providers about the e-claims system, and create awareness about the efficiency,
        effectiveness, accuracy and transparency of the e-claims payment system. The project has
        deployed the iHost to 6 facilities, and each of them is currently either submitting
        electronically or undergoing testing (IO#8 and #10).
       The project also supported the building of statistical reporting, data warehousing and
        CPC call center. (IO#9).

PDO Indicator Four: Population in the lowest quintile (20% of the index of socio-economic
status) registered under the NHIS with a valid card

48.      The percentage of population in the lowest quintile registered with a valid NHIS card
increased from 14 percent in 2010 to 48 percent in 2014. Compared with the target, 40 percent,
this project has achieved 120 percent of the target.

49.      In order to reach the target, the NHIA worked closely with the Ministry of Health and the
Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare to use the common targeting mechanism. Starting in
2010, community-based targeting combined with proxy means testing was launched in 30
districts and enrolled 214, 530 poor people by 2011. The NHIA also embarked on a special
registration of the poor and vulnerable between June and August 2013. Box 1 shows criteria used
to identify the poor and vulnerable. During this process, officers of the district and regional
offices in NHIA were trained on how to identify these groups and enroll them into the scheme.
Each district held stakeholder meetings with key players, e.g., Ghana Education Service,
Department of Social Welfare, and Opinion Leaders, to discuss enrollment strategies. At the end
of this exercise, about 1.2 million poor and vulnerable people were enrolled into the scheme.

          Box 1. Criteria used to identify the poor and vulnerable for NHIS enrollment
             1. Beneficiaries of the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP).
             2. Children in orphanages across the country.
             3. Children who are blind, deaf and dump in special schools and in the
                 community.
             4. Mentally retarded and mentally ill patients within mental homes and in the
                 community who can be reached.
             5. Persons currently receiving financial support from recognized institutions
                 or NGOs due to extreme poverty i.e. District Assemblies.
             6. Mothers with twins and triplets begging to feed them within the
                 community.
             7. People Living with HIV/AIDS who are poor and do not have any source of
                 income.
             8. Persons being treated for Tuberculosis on Daily Observation Treatment
                 (DOTs) and do not have any source of income.
             9. Prisoners who are reported poor by the Prison officers.
             10. Children who are receiving free school uniforms.
             11. Children benefiting from the schools feeding program.


50.   By supporting policy development and strengthening financial and operational
management of the NHIS, this project has enhanced the NHIA’s capacity as a strategic purchaser

                                               13
of health services, as well as health facilities’ capacity as key partners for policy implementation
and claims submission. Through the project implementation period, new policies have been
introduced adapting international experiences to country context. Financial sustainability of the
scheme has been evaluated, and strategies have been explored to expand coverage while ensuring
financial sustainability. The following have also been supported by the project:

       A set of policies have been developed with the support of the project, including
        population exemption policies, provider payment policies, and cost containment policies
        (IO#2, IO#3, and IO#11).
       Actuarial analysis being carried out as a regular exercise. This has not only increased the
        institution’s capacity in conducting actuarial analysis per se, but also greatly raised the
        management’s awareness to the financial sustainability of the scheme and urged solutions
        to be found (IO#4).
       A clinical auditing study identified inappropriate prescription behaviors and yielded
        substantial savings in claims reimbursement, and provided training on clinical auditing.
       The country’s achievement in adopting capitation is worth highlighting (IO#2, IO#3,
        IO#4, IO#5, and IO#11). Box 2 summarizes key information on the pilot of capitation in
        Ghana including background, implementation, evaluation results and its impact.

Box 2. Pilot of capitation in Ghana3
    Background on capitation:
    Unlike Fee-for-Service that pays provider retroactively based on quantity of services
    provided, capitation pays providers at a fixed rate in advance for a defined package of
    services.

    Based on global experiences, total health expenditures decline with capitation, because it
    shifts financial risk to service providers who would otherwise have financial incentives to
    induce patients to use more services under a fee-for-service system.

    Pilot of capitation in the Ashanti region:
    Starting in 2012, with the support of the project, capitation was piloted in the Ashanti
    region as a payment mechanism for primary care services.

    Evaluation results:
    The evaluation of the pilot in the Ashanti Region showed that the majority of affiliates and
    providers had knowledge about capitation and were satisfied with this system.

    A study examining the impact of capitation in the Ashanti region shows that total claims
    payment in surveyed facilities have been reduced from GHc 26.2 million in 2011 (before
    pilot) to 21.3 million in 2012 and 19.3 million in 2013. This represents a substantial savings
    of 10.5 percent in 2012 and 15.2 percent in 2013 out of total claims payment.

    Capitation in general may cause providers to under provide services as they have to bear
    eventual financial risks. The pilot and evaluation of capitation in Ashanti region has some
    limitations in collecting detailed information on service utilization and quality. This has
    been internalized by the NHIA and taken into consideration during the preparation for the
    roll-out of capitation into the three other regions.

    Impact:
    A decision has been made to scale up the pilot through a phased approach, initially to
    another three regions including the Upper West, Upper East and Volta regions, and
    eventually across the entire country.


51.       This project has taken a lead in using advanced Information Technology (IT) to
strengthen health financing and delivery systems in developing countries. Although some
hospitals had started using electronic medical records system before the project started, these
systems tended to be disconnected from each other. By introducing an electronic claims
processing system, it provided a momentum and platform to standardize the interface between
providers and the insurer, so that standard claims can be used across providers. More importantly,
with such a system in place, claims can be analyzed and compared between patients, physicians,
facilities, districts and regions by linking with the biometric membership database. Furthermore,
potential fraud, abuse, mistakes and underservice can be identified by such analysis. In other
words, it made it possible to implement cost containment and quality assurance policies more

project. This plan can be used as a good planning document for the future development of ICT in
the health sector overall.

Overall achievement of the PDO

52.    The overall achievement of the PDO is rated as Substantial, considering Modest
achievement before restructuring and High achievement at project closing.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

53.     In order to assess project efficiency in a comprehensive manner, the economic and
financial analysis for this ICR both assesses the overall project development impact and
undertakes a cost-benefit analysis for the two main interventions supported by the project,
introduction of capitation policy and use of electronic claims processing system, which accounted
for about half of the total project cost (details see Annex 3).

Project development impact

54.     The Ghana Health Insurance project has generated substantial development impact in
Ghana at a number of levels. First, at the operational level, this project strengthened operational
management of the NHIS. Second, at the policy level, this project has enhanced the NHIA’s
capacity as a strategic purchaser of health services. Both of these impacts are closely related to
improvements in technical efficiency of service delivery at facility level, and allocative efficiency
at scheme level. Third, at the health sector level, it has contributed to the achievement of health-
related MDGs and Universal Health Coverage. Fourth, at the country level, the project has
contributed to both economic growth and equity by removing financial barriers to service access
among the poor. This project will also generate long-term economic benefit by increasing the
active and productive labor force who can potentially contribute to economic growth and poverty
elimination.

Cost-benefit Analysis on introduction of capitation policy

55.      This cost-benefit analysis on capitation assesses nation-wide benefit and cost of
capitation based on the piloting experiences supported by this project. A number of scenarios are
examined by using different assumptions on how benefit and cost may change from pilot to scale-
up, with assumptions at different levels of stringency. The timeframe from 2013 to 2017 is used
considering data availability, though all benefit is expected to extend beyond this period. A
discounting rate of 3 percent is used to estimate present value based on existing guidelines (WHO
guide to CEA, 2003).

56.     Cost-benefit analysis results show that support of capitation pilot which has led to a
scale-up decision is a highly efficient intervention. With less stringent assumptions, the net
present value is 802.1 million GHc/US$248.7 million, and the benefit-cost ratio is 15.3. Even
under a very stringent combination, the net present value is 22.8 million GHc/US$7.1 million,
and the benefit cost ratio is 1.14.

Cost-benefit analysis on the electronic claims system

                                                 16
57.      The introduction of electronic claims processing system brings drastic changes to the
health insurance system. It benefits both the scheme manager and insurance provider in terms of
improving the efficiency of processing claims. It makes possible for effective implementation of
cost containment and quality assurance policies such as clinical audit. Table 5 outlines all benefits
related to the use of the electronic claims processing system. Further, it also prompts necessary
actions in standardizing disease coding and medical terminology in claims, calls for digitalization
of membership management (introduced by NHIA as biometric registration system), financial
payment, and integration with other systems such as electronic medical record system in hospitals
and health information management system in the Ministry of Health.

             Table 4. Benefits related to use of electronic claims processing system
                Benefits
                Saved operational cost by not using paper-based system
For service     Decreased rejection rate due to better quality claims
providers       Decreased turn-around time for reimbursement
                Increased fund stability and predictability
                Saved operation and management cost for claim processing by not
                using cumbersome paper-based system
                Saved operation and management cost for clinical auditing
For scheme      Increased capacity and efficiency to identify fraud claims
managers        Increased capacity and efficiency to identify inappropriate services
                and improve service quality
                Increased capacity to provide evidence for policy making and
                implementation
Interactive     Increased capacity to link up with digitalized membership
effect between management system, electronic insurance payment system,
providers and electronic medical records system in hospitals and health
scheme          information management system
managers        Improved human resource capacity to implement administration
                requirement of the health insurance scheme

58.     This cost-benefit analysis aims to assess the situation when the project investment on IT
hardware and software are fully operational during a three year period from 2013 to 20154. It is
expected that 4.8 million claims will be processed electronically when the system is fully
functional based on the results from a system capacity assessment. This analysis focuses only on
two benefits to demonstrate the soundness of the investment, as it is challenging to translate all
above-listed benefits into monetary values. These benefits include: 1) saved operation and
management cost for claims processing by not using paper-based system; and 2) saved claims
payment from increased accuracy of claims.

59.     Results show that full operation of the electronic claims processing system yields great
returns even with only very selected benefits considered. The net present value is GHc 4.7
million/US$1.46 million, and the benefit-cost ratio is 1.29.

  The project has procured equipment for more than 40 target facilities, but only around 20 facilities
started submitting claims as of March 2014 when the project was closed.


                                                 17
Rating for efficiency

60.     The impact analysis and cost-benefit analysis does not explicitly differentiate the period
before and after restructuring. This is mostly because both the project objective and total project
cost remain the same from effectiveness to closing, thus, one set of analysis shall suffice.
Nevertheless, we rated efficiency separately for the periods before and after restructuring:
efficiency is rated as modest for pre-restructuring period considering that the project
implementation was quite slow and the efficacy was modest; the efficiency for post-restructuring
period is rated as high considering this project has turned around after restructuring and fully
disbursed before closing, generated significant development impact, supported policy
interventions and infrastructure investment that show impressive efficiency levels demonstrated
by high benefit-cost ratios. Overall, the efficiency is rated as substantial taking into consideration
the modest efficiency before restructuring and after restructuring.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

61.      Overall outcome rating is rated as Satisfactory. The team follows the IEG guidelines to
rate by weighting ratings before and after restructuring. A numeric value of 3 is assigned to
Moderately Unsatisfactory rating and a value of 5 is assigned to Satisfactory rating. The weighted
value based on disbursement percent is 4.6, between Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory and
closer to Satisfactory. Considering the overall ratings for relevance, efficacy and efficiency are all
substantial, which yields a rating of Satisfactory, the overall outcome is rated as Satisfactory for
the purpose of consistency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.     This project has contributed to poverty reduction in two ways. On one hand, this project
has greatly expanded the insurance coverage among the poor, which in turn will improve their
access to basic health services. Improved access to basic services has proved to be a strong force
for poverty reduction. On the other hand, by providing insurance coverage to non-poor people,

                                                 18
the risk of getting impoverished due to catastrophic expenses will be minimized to the extent
possible.

63.     There is evidence that coverage among the poor has been expanded through this project.
As shown by PDO indicator 4, the insurance coverage among the lowest wealth quintile
population has more than tripled from 14 percent to 48 percent during the project period.

64.      Evidence also shows that the disparity between poor and non-poor in service utilization
has been reduced due to expanded insurance coverage, indicating improved equity and shared
prosperity. Figure 2 plots concentration curves for skilled birth attendance by insurance status. A
concentration curve plots the cumulative percentage of the variable of interests (y axis) against
the cumulative percentage of the population (x axis), ranked by wealth status, beginning with the
poorest and ending with the richest. A diagonal line is always presented with concentration
curves to show the ideal situation where coverage of services is the same across all groups. The
distance between the diagonal line and a concentration curve shows the extent of inequality; the
larger the distance, the more inequitable the coverage of services. As shown by the graph, the
distance was much smaller between the concentration curve for the insured population and the
ideal situation shown by diagonal line, compared with the distance between the concentration
curve for uninsured and the diagonal line.

    Figure 2. Concentration curves for the percent of pregnant women giving births in facilities, by

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

65.     This project has greatly contributed to institutional capacity building by supporting the
NHIA to develop and implement policies that are critical to the financial and operational
management of NHIS. Through the project implementation period, the NHIA has been
introducing new policies, adapting international experiences to country context, evaluating

financial sustainability of the scheme, and exploring strategies to expand coverage while ensuring
financial sustainability. Many policies were put in place, such as M&E framework, human
resource management, IT staffing policy, provider payment mechanism (e.g., capitation). The
capacity of undertaking actuarial analysis was built through project implementation, which has
greatly helped to raise the management’s awareness to the issue of financial sustainability and the
required solutions. In addition, health facilities that implement capitation pilot or submit claims
electronically have greatly strengthened their capacity in financial and operational management.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

66.     The Government has undertaken a beneficiary survey focusing on the effectiveness of
and impact of the various training program organized under the project, as well as views of NHIS
staff and service providers on capitation policy and training programs. This survey collected a
sample of 341 NHIS staff and service providers in all 10 regions.

67.      The study results show that trainees have greatly benefited from different types of
training programs. They identify the most beneficial ones include trainings on Electronic Claims
processing and vetting; Medical Terminologies and Diagnostic Billing; ICT related programs; the
revised Ministry of Health Referral Policy and Gatekeeper system, Clinical Auditing, and
programs for the actuarial division on NHIS. Beneficiaries generally reported that these training
programs have enhanced their performance.

68.     The study results also show that the level of knowledge on capitation concept was high
among both NHIS district offices and service providers. Beneficiaries were able to identify key
benefits and challenges associated with capitation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

69.     Ghana NHIS will continue to face the challenge of ensuring financial sustainability while
expanding coverage. To address this challenge, extra attention needs be to paid to the following
in a broader context: 1) how the insurance revenue will be affected by the deteriorating
macroeconomic context, e.g., high debt level; 2) how the insurance expenditure will be affected
by the generous benefits package and medicine use that is paid under the fee-for-service system;
3) how to continue enrolling members of the informal sector and the poor; and 4) how to ensure
service quality while containing insurance cost.

70.      Nevertheless, the risk to development outcome is considered as modest based on the
following considerations. First, many achievements under this project have been internalized by
decision makers. For example, the Government has announced the plan to expand pilot of
capitation to another three regions. Electronic claims processing has become part of the routine
business of the NHIA and concerned facilities. Second, NHIA’s capacity has been enhanc ed
during the past few years. The authority has realized the importance of ensuring the scheme’s
financial sustainability and started exploring options to improve efficiency and raise revenues.
Third, in addition to the Bank, more development partners have started working together with the
Government on the NHIS, or broadly, on health financing issues for which insurance is an
important aspect for the country.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

71.      The Bank engaged the Government of Ghana at a critical moment in the development of
its health insurance program, and provided strong technical inputs into project preparation,
however, the project had experienced significant delays due to lack of readiness and was not able
to fully translate good intention to good results. The Bank performance during the project
preparation phase is therefore rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. As described in Section 2.1, a
strong technical team was deployed to bring up-to-date knowledge and international experiences
into the project design. A QER meeting was also undertaken to receive experts’ inputs. However,
looking retrospectively, the risk analysis at appraisal appeared to be optimistic without adequately
anticipating the risk of slow implementation by a new agency that had no experience with
implementing Bank-financed projects. Substantial and above risks identified were either IT
specific or political 6 . The original disbursement estimate, particularly for early phase, didn’t
appear to have considered the weak implementation capacity and the lead time that would be
required by the NHIA. The PDO indicator, although conceptually valid and relevant, was not
measurable by the existing system and had to be revised later.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.      The Bank’s performance on supervision quality is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. This
project has experienced a trajectory from moderately satisfactory to problem project, then to
moderately satisfactory and to Satisfactory at the end of the project period. Through the entire
implementation period, the Bank as a whole has put in great efforts in maintaining policy
dialogue, identifying solutions to expedite disbursement and turn the project around. The
implementation had momentum for making operational progress and disbursing until the later
phase of the project life, but policy related work had advanced quite significantly before the
disbursement curve took off. Nevertheless, the technical and operational support provided by the
Bank team was indispensable for the full disbursement and achievement of PDOs. Although some
early ISRs and AMs appear to be a bit optimistic in expecting things to turn around on their own,
overall the AMs and ISRs are candid in documenting project status and reflecting improvements
in M&E, fiduciary compliance and disbursement. While the procurement and disbursement had
been delayed in the early phase of the project, there were no major issues in compliance to
fiduciary policies. One shortcoming during implementation after restructuring was the quality of
monitoring and evaluation; the targets used to track indicator performance appeared inconsistent
between documents including AMs, ISRs, and restructuring papers.




6
 These major risks included: a) delay or lack of coordination in implementing the ICT Network
Platform; b) political barriers to making unpopular but necessary changes to benefits, premiums,
or exemptions; and c) lack of flexibility of planned IT to incorporate policy changes.


                                                21
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     Overall the Bank team provided a Moderately Satisfactory level of support during the
design and implementation of the project. This rating also correlates with the overall Satisfactory
outcome rating for the project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.     The Government performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Overall the
Government was highly committed, actively involved and responsive during both preparation and
implementation stages. For some time after the mid-term review, there seemed to be confusion
about implementation arrangements partially due to the election process, which led to unclear
responsibility for project management and delays in actions. Nevertheless, the project was
eventually restructured and the implementation arrangements were organized and clarified.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     The performance of the implementing agency, National Health Insurance Authority is
rated as Moderately Satisfactory. As a newly established institution, NHIA neither had
experiences in working with the Bank, nor working with other key stakeholders such as GHS,
CHAG, and Ministry of Health. As a result, it took NHIA long time to go through the learning
curve on issues such as institutional dynamics and Bank fiduciary procedures, which has
compromised the implementation and efficiency of the project during early period. However, the
agency was highly committed to deliver on the project. The agency provided high level oversight,
deployed competent staff for the project management unit, and worked closely with the Bank
team, GHS, CHAG and MOH, particularly during the later phase of the project implementation.
All these have led to the successful implementation of the project and achievement of outcomes.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.     The overall performance of the borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

77.      It is important to get engaged at the right time. This project was prepared and approved at
a time when the counterpart needed most help as the NHIS was just established. This opened a
window of opportunity for the Bank to bring in international expertise and experiences, and for
the country to get exposed to them, discuss potential consequences, and adapt to their own
context.

                                                22
78.      By adopting a two-arm approach in the design, the project was able to provide both
knowledge service and infrastructure investment at the same time. The technical arm on policy
development introduced globally proven effective policies and methodologies, created country
specific evidence, and built domestic capacity. The operational arm on claims system adopted
advanced technology to reduce errors and expedite bill processing. In addition, these two arms
together may generate interactive effect on top of their own benefit, as the electronic claims
processing system makes it much easier to obtain evidence on service delivery and utilization, as
well as implement policies on cost containment and quality assurance.

79.      It is important for the Bank to deploy a team that has a combined skill set in strategic
policy discussion, technical studies as well as operational project management. It appeared that
the momentum of project progress was driven by specific skills available at a given time,
therefore, different pieces advanced at different stages. The project implementation and support
would have been more efficient if all these skills were available at the same time for the duration
of the project life. This also raised question to the Bank management how to make such
arrangements available by committing needed skills and resources.

80.      Implementation readiness is critical for project performance, in particular when the
implementation agency is not experienced. More realistic disbursement estimates should have
been prepared based on the existing capacity and the required lead time. Reality checks on
feasibility of M& E plans and fiduciary procedures are more than necessary, and they need to be
followed with rigorous capacity building measures for robust implementation. In addition,
stakeholder sensitization also plays a key role for making projects ready to be implemented,
especially for such a project that requires interactions with many stakeholders who are stronger
institutions historically.

81.      Integrating project implementation with overall work on health insurance and health
financing maximizes the leveraging impact of the project and ensures sustainability. The
engagement between the Bank and the Government goes beyond implementation of specific
project activities, rather progresses with a vision of improving overall health insurance scheme
and advancing the health financing agenda. This is evidenced by the update on overall sector
situation in the ISRs. Additional resources available through a separate trust fund managed by the
Bank also made a broader engagement possible.

82.     This project presents another case on the importance of strengthening M&E capacities on
both the Bank and Government teams, including design of realistic indicators, tracking
performance of indicators consistently, and verifying results. Due to the limited scope of work
and resource constraints, the ICR team used information from project records (ISRs, AMs, etc.) to
evaluate achievement of project objectives. The ICR team trusted that the Bank supervision team
had verified all these results provided by the Government through its institutional reporting. To
enhance accountability of future projects, it will be useful if the ICR teams can be provided with
the resources to undertake independent approaches to verifying project results (such as sample
checks and household surveys) and explicitly document particularly when source of information
is administrative data.

83.       This project has opened doors for further engagement with various stakeholders and built
foundation for strengthening the efficiency of NHIS, however, continuous and substantial support
in this area together with other partners will be required on a long term basis. NHIA and NHIS
still face numerous challenges such as expanding coverage, ensuring financial sustainability

                                                23
mostly through cost containment and assuring service quality. It is suggested that a
comprehensive in-depth evaluation of the insurance scheme be undertaken through a separate
modality to cover all these different aspects, e.g., efficiency of scheme, impact of insurance
(including its cost containment policies) on service utilization and service quality, as well as the
related implications on equity. This will not only complement this ICR that is mandated to focus
on the project, but provide key inputs for Bank management and government to make decisions
on follow-up actions.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       Cost-benefit analysis provides a basis for assessing project efficiency by comparing the
total expected cost of each option against the total expected benefits, and examining whether the
benefits outweigh the costs, and by how much. Such approach fits well with the Bank’s projects
in earlier decades, because projects at that time were typically of the “bricks -and-mortar” variety
— physical rehabilitation of a road, for example. In such cases, expected project costs and
benefits could usually be readily monetized at least to a reasonable approximation. Consequently
the analyst could quickly arrive at an estimate of the rate of return.

2.        Cost-benefit analysis, however, may not capture all aspects of the potential development
impact related to a project because some of them cannot be easily translated to monetary values
given constrains of existing data and methodology, e.g., efficiency improvement and equity
improvement. This health insurance project is one of such cases, but not the only one. As a matter
of fact, the Bank’s current portfolio comprises more complex and innovative operations involving
institutional redesign, incentive restructuring, decentralized decision-making, and so on.

3.      In order to assess project efficiency in a comprehensive manner, this economic and
financial analysis both assesses overall project development impact and undertakes a cost-benefit
analysis for the two main interventions supported by the project, introduction of capitation policy
and use of electronic claims processing system.

Project development impact

4.       The Ghana Health Insurance project has generated substantial development impact in
Ghana at a number of levels: operational level of the NHIS, policy level of the NHIA, health
sector level and country level. The following section assesses these impacts in details.

5.       First, at the operational level of the NHIS, this project strengthened operational
management of the NHIS. Through standardization of medical terminology and disease coding in
submitted claims, all claims have passed initial test and improved accuracy. Through the
installation of electronic claims processing system and its interface with provider s’ electronic
medical record system, close to 800,000 claims were submitted to NHIA electronically within a
one-year period. Electronic system not only saves operational and management cost by reducing
processing time, it has set up a solid operational system for NHIA to implement cost containment
and quality insurance policies more effectively.

6.       Second, at the policy level of the NHIS, this project has enhanced the NHIA’s capacity as
a strategic purchaser of health services. Through the project implementation period, the NHIA
has been introducing new policies, adapting international experiences to country context,
evaluating financial sustainability of the scheme, and exploring strategies to expand coverage
while ensuring financial sustainability. The NHIA has demonstrated its capacity in undertaking
actuarial analysis independently and regularly in its interactions with key stakeholders. Another
example is the pilot of capitation policy in the Ashanti region in 2012 with support from the
project.

        Based on global experiences, total health expenditures decline with capitation, a
         prospective payment mechanism that reduces over utilization by shifting financial risks to
         providers.

                                                32
         A study examining the impact of capitation in the Ashanti region shows that total claims
          payment in surveyed facilities have been reduced from GHc 26.2 million in 2011 (before
          pilot) to 21.3 million in 2012 and 19.3 million in 2013. This represents a substantial
          savings of 10.5 percent in 2012 and 15.2 percent in 2013 out of total claims payment.
         More importantly, this pilot and its evaluation have informed policy makers in deciding
          on the scale up of capitation across country by the end of 2014.

7.      Third, at the health sector level, it has contributed to the achievement of the health-related
MDGs and Universal Health Coverage. Global evidence shows that a well-managed insurance
scheme improves survival from disease and life events as it increases access to essential health
services, which in turn will contribute to improvement of health outcomes. According to WHO,
around 70 percent of early childhood deaths are due to conditions that can be prevented or treated
with access to some simple and affordable interventions. Past research results show that 80
percent of childbirth related deaths could be averted with access to essential maternity services.
The NHIS has a comprehensive benefit package that covers 95 percent of the disease burden,
which makes it possible to increase utilization of all essential services.

8.      A Bank study shows that the insured population has a higher rate of utilizing essential
health services that are proved cost-effective globally. For example, the percent of pregnant
women in Ghana who delivered in a health facility was 74.3 percent among the insured,
compared with 41.4 percent among the uninsured. This result alone can be translated into an
enormous impact on women survival from pregnancy related deaths, as literature shows that up to
one-third of maternal deaths may be prevented through the presence of skilled birth attendance.
In addition, another published evaluation study shows that people are more likely to seek care
when sick with insurance coverage (78.6 vs. 90.5 percent respectively).

9.        Fourth, at the country level, the project has contributed to both economic growth and
equity.

10.     This project promoted equity and shared prosperity by removing financial barriers to
service access among the poor.

         As shown by PDO indicator 4, the insurance coverage among the lowest wealth quintile
          population has more than tripled from 14 percent to 48 percent during the project period.
         Evidence shows that among the lowest quintile pregnant women, there is a significant
          difference in percent who gave birth in facilities by insurance status, 34.8 percent among
          the insured, versus 12.2 percent among the uninsured. Figure 1 plots the concentration
          curve for this indicator by insurance status. In an ideally equitable world, the
          concentration curve should be the diagonal line with each quintile having same percent of
          women giving birth in facilities; the distance between the real situation and the ideal
          situation shows the extent of inequity. As shown by the graph, the distance was shorter
          for the insured population than for the uninsured population, indicating decreased
          inequity.

11.     This project will also generate long-term economic benefit by increasing the active and
productive labor force who can potentially contribute to economic growth and poverty
elimination. With improved health and nutrition status, more children will survive into adulthood
and work more productively as a result of better cognitive development. Women who are saved
from maternal deaths will contribute directly to productive activities or relieve household
members who would have had to provide child care without their presence.

          The most recent empirical estimates of the negative effects of stunting on worker
           productivity and adult earnings range from about 10 percent per year7, to as high as 20
           percent per year 8 . Anemia is associated with a 2.5 percent reduction in wages.
           Productivity losses at the individual level are estimated to be more than 10 percent of
           life-time earnings, which at the macro level can lead to a 2‐3 percent loss in GDP.
          One study that estimates the effect of maternal mortality on GDP in Africa shows that
           maternal mortality has a statistically significant negative effect on per capita GDP. An
           increase in MMR by one death decreases per capita GDP by US$0.36 per year on average.


Cost-benefit Analysis focusing on introduction of capitation policy

12.      This cost-benefit analysis on capitation assesses nation-wide benefit and cost of
capitation based on the piloting experiences supported by this project. A number of scenarios are
examined by using different assumptions on how benefit and cost may change from pilot to scale-

up, with assumptions at different levels of stringency. The timeframe from 2013 to 2017 is used
considering data availability, though all benefit is expected to extend beyond this period. A
discounting rate of 3 percent is used to estimate present value based on existing guidelines (WHO
guide to CEA, 2003).

          Benefit scenario 1: The pilot experiences show that claims payment have reduced about
           10 and 15 percent respectively in year 1 and year 2 after capitation. This scenario
           assumes claims payment may be reduced compared with projected health expenditures
           without capitation, with same impact of 10 percent (low bound for pilot) reduction each
           year from 2013 to 2017. This scenario is considered as the least stringent assumption on
           benefit size moving from pilot to scale up.
          Benefit scenario 2: This scenario assumes the impact of capitation on claims payment
           will decline gradually over time. Compared with projected health expenditures without
           capitation, claims payment will reduce by 10 percent for 2013, 8 percent for 2014, 6
           percent for 2015, 4 percent for 2016, and 2 percent for 2017.
          Benefit scenario 3: This scenario assumes the nation-wide impact will only be half of
           what is achieved under pilot, and the impact will be same for each year. In other words,
           compared with projected health expenditures without capitation, claims payment will
           reduce by 5 percent for each year from 2013 to 2017.
          Benefit scenario 4: This scenario assumes the nation-wide impact will only be half of
           what is achieved under pilot, and the impact will decline gradually over time. In other
           words, compared with projected health expenditures without capitation, claims payment
           will reduce by 5 percent for 2013, 4 percent for 2014, 3 percent for 2015, 2 percent for
           2016, and 1 percent for 2017. This scenario is considered as the most stringent
           assumption on benefit size moving from pilot to scale up.
          Cost scenario 1: Pilot experiences showed that the implementation cost of capitation in
           pilot region was GHc 3.87 per active member, and the majority of the cost was one-time
           cost. Based on this, this scenario assumes that the nationwide cost in year 2013 will be
           GHc 3.87 per active member, and for the following years, the cost will be 30 percent of
           that for year 2013. This scenario is considered as a less stringent assumption on benefit
           size moving from pilot to scale up.
          Cost scenario 2: This scenario assumes that the implementation cost will be three times as
           much as cost scenario 1. This scenario is considered as a more stringent assumption on
           benefit size moving from pilot to scale up.

13.        Key assumptions used:
      1)   Population grows by 2% during the period from 2013 to 2017, projected based on census
           data
      2)   Insurance coverage increase by 1% annually during the period from 2013 to 2017
      3)   Average annual inflation will not exceed 9.5% from 2013 to 2017
      4)   Increase in tariffs and medicines will not exceed 20% per annum
      5)   The benefit package remains unchanged

14.       Table 2 shows the estimated benefit and cost for each year and each scenario, and Table 3
shows the results of net present values and benefit-cost ratios for different combinations of cost
and benefit scenarios. It reveals that support of capitation pilot which has led to a scale-up
decision is a highly efficient intervention. Under the least stringent scenario combination (benefit
scenario 1 and cost scenario 2), the net present value is 802.1 million GHc/US$248.7 million, and
the benefit-cost ratio is 15.3. Even under the most stringent combination (benefit scenario 4 and
cost scenario 2), the net present value is 22.8 million GHc/US$7.1 million, and the benefit cost
ratio is 1.14.

Cost-benefit analysis for the electronic claims system

15.      The introduction of electronic claims processing system brings drastic changes to the
health insurance system. It benefits both the scheme manager and insurance provider in terms of
improving the efficiency of processing claims. Effective implementation of cost containment and
quality assurance policies such as clinical audit is made possible. Table 4 outlines all benefits
related to use of electronic claims processing system. Further, it also prompts necessary actions in
standardizing disease coding and medical terminology in claims, calls for digitalization of
membership management (introduced by NHIA as biometric registration system), financial


                                                36
payment, and integration with other systems such as electronic medical record system in hospitals
and health information management system in Ministry of Health.

             Table 4. Benefits related to use of electronic claims processing system
                Benefits
                Saved operation cost by not using paper-based system
For service     Decreased rejection rate due to better quality claims
providers       Decreased turn-around time for reimbursement
                Increased fund stability and predictability
                Saved operation and management cost for claim processing by not
                using cumbersome paper-based system
                Saved operation and management cost for clinical auditing
For scheme      Increased capacity and efficiency to identify fraud claims
managers        Increased capacity and efficiency to identify inappropriate services
                and improve service quality
                Increased capacity to provide evidence for policy making and
                implementation
Interactive     Increased capacity to link up with digitalized membership
effect between management system, electronic insurance payment system,
providers and electronic medical records system in hospitals and health
scheme          information management system
managers        Improved human resource capacity to implement administration
                requirement of the health insurance scheme

16.     This cost-benefit analysis aims to assess the situation when the project investment on IT
hardware and software are fully operational during a three year period from 2013 to 20159. It is
expected that 4.8 million claims will be processed electronically when the system is fully
functional based on the results from a system capacity assessment. This analysis focuses only on
two benefits to demonstrate the soundness of the investment, as it is challenging to translate all
above-listed benefits into monetary values. These benefits include: 1) saved operation and
management cost for claims processing by not using paper-based system; and 2) saved claims
payment from increased accuracy of claims.

17.     Results in Table 5 show that full operation of the electronic claims processing system
yields great returns even with only very selected benefits considered. The net present value is
GHc 4.7 million/US$1.46 million, and the benefit-cost ratio is 1.29.

18.      Key data and assumptions used:
      1) Saved cost by not using system is estimated based on: a) one person can process 400
         electronic claims per day according to NHIA staff estimation; b) the workload of paper
         system is three times more than that of electronic system according to NHIA staff
         estimation and direct observation; c) average monthly salary being GHc 3,566 according
         to Ghana salary survey.
      2) Using electronic system may improve the accuracy by 7 percent. This is considered a
         fairly conservative estimate as this level of improvement was observed in developed
         countries.
      3) The cost for 2013 is the actual project cost for procuring the related hardware, software
         and services. For the following years, it is expected that only maintenance cost will occur,
         which is estimated as one percent of the start-up cost.

Annex 5. Summary of Beneficiary Survey Results

1.    This Annex summarizes the results of a beneficiary survey undertaken by the
Government.

2.      In pursuance of attaining Universal Health Insurance coverage for all people in Ghana,
the Government of Ghana established the National Health Insurance Scheme in 2003. The
National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) was subsequently established and given the
responsibility of registration of subscribers, ensuring access to healthcare without payment at
point of service, registration and licensing of mutual and commercial health insurance schemes
and management of the national Health Insurance Fund. With assistance of the World Bank, the
Government of Ghana subsequently launched a Health Insurance Project with the primary
objective of strengthening the financial and operational management of the NHIS.

3.       This study examines the effectiveness and impact of the various training programs
organized for NHIS staff and health service providers under the Health Insurance Project. It also
examined views of NHIS staff and service providers on capitation policy in the Ashanti region
and various training programs. Data was gathered through face-to face interviews on sample of
341 NHIS employees and service providers in all 10 regions of Ghana in March 2014.
Additionally, focus group discussions, and non-participant observations were used to gather
primary data. The study shows that the beneficiaries of the Health Insurance Project were
relatively highly educated young people, who have several years to work with the scheme. This is
a positive sign for the sustainability of the scheme. The level of knowledge of capitation concept
was high among health care providers and staff of NHIS district offices in the Ashanti Region,
and this suggests that training given to these actors is adequate. However, there will be a need for
further mop up training exercises for lower level officials at the health facilities, in particular.
Majority of the officials of the health facilities, in principle, support the capitation concept.

4.       The major benefits of capitation identified by respondents include: reduction in the
incidence of abuse of NHIS system by clients; potential for early payments of NHIS funds to
service providers; improved patient-doctor relationships; and potential to reduce corruption.
Despite these benefits, the respondents also identified a number of challenges associated with the
capitation concept. First, while the NHIA invested heavily in the training of service providers and
NHIS officials on the capitation policy, little attention was paid to education and sensitization of
clients. Another challenge is low rate of capitation, which forces health providers to adopt
copayment. A majority of service providers and NHIS officers support the capitation policy,
despite these initial challenges. Suggestions for dealing with initial challenges include intensive
education of clients, upward adjustment of capitation rate, frequent meeting of stakeholders on
the programme, and prompt transfer of funds to service providers.

5.       The study revealed that different types of training programs were organized by the NHIA
for staff of NHIS district and regional offices as well as health care providers in all the 10 regions
of Ghana. The most popular training programs identified were those on: Electronic Claims
processing and vetting; Medical Terminologies and Diagnostic Billing; ICT related programs; the
revised Ministry of Health Referral Policy and Gatekeeper system, Clinical Auditing, and
programs for the actuarial division on NHIS. Beneficiaries generally reported that these training
programs have enhanced their performance. However, some of the training programs will need to
be scaled up, as some employees have not yet benefited. These include the training in clinical
auditing and that of referral and gate-keeper system.



                                                 41
6.       Although respondents were generally satisfied with the way the training programs were
organized, they also highlighted some organizational lapses which affected the success of the
training programs. These organizational lapses include: short duration of some training programs;
short notices given to employees about some of the training programs; low supply of equipment
after the training; and lack of adequate follow up training programs. We conclude that despite the
few challenges with organization of training programs, beneficiaries generally assessed all the
training programs as very useful and suggested that more of such trainings should be organized in
the near future. We recommend that the government of Ghana and its development partners must
provide adequate funds to the NHIA to organize more follow up training programs. There must
also be intensive public education on the capitation policy and referral and gate keeper systems to
ensure that clients support their implementation.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR
1.      Since 2003, the Government of Ghana has been working to implement the National
Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Several challenges ranging from broad policy decisions to
detailed implementation arrangements have hampered the process. Key among the challenges are;
A) Poor coordination among stakeholders and lack of concrete governance arrangements and
responsibilities for NHIS implementation, B) Challenges to maintaining financial sustainability of
the NHIS, C) Difficulties providing effective coverage for the poor and “exempt” indigents, D)
Implementation Issues for DMHISs and Providers. E) Inadequate technical tools for processing
and reimbursing claims, and F) Insufficient administrative, managerial, and technical human
capacity. This Project complements the efforts of the Ministry of Health (MOH, the Teaching
Hospitals, the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), the Ghana Health Services (GHS), and
health service providers from other ministries, the CHAG, other providers, to ensure that the
National Health Insurance Scheme is strengthened and deliver the quality health care that all
Ghanaians seek.

2.      The Health Insurance Project became effective in December 2007 to ameliorate the
challenges associated with implementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme and was
scheduled to be completed on 31st December 2012. Subsequently the completion date was
however revised to June 2013 on the basis of the Mid Term Review (MTR). The MTR
recommended restructuring of the project. A technical mission of the World Bank further
recommended an extension to March 2014 to enable the project team to complete the necessary
changes agreed between the World Bank and the Ministry of Health.

Target Groups and Project Beneficiaries

3.          The key project beneficiaries of the HIP were:
                  The Ministry of Health (MoH)
                  The Ghana Health Service (GHS)
                  Teaching Hospitals-Korle Bu, KomfoAnokye and Tamale
                  National Health Insurance Council (NHIC)
                  District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes (DMHIS)
                  Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG)
                  Ghana Armed Forces Medical Service
                  Ghana Police Health Services
                  Society of Private Medical and Dental Practitioners

Project Development Objectives

4.    The overall project development objective was to strengthen the financial and operational
management of the National Health Insurance Scheme by improving:

     (i)       the policy adaptation and implementation capacity of the National Health Insurance
               Council in addressing ongoing core policy issues related to contribution, collection,
               risk equalization, and provider payment mechanisms; and
     (ii)      the purchasing functions of the District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes, and the
               billing function of the Providers.

Financing and Funding of the components of the HIP



                                                  44
5.     The HIP went through restructuring in 2011, but the total project funding of $15 million
remained the same. The International Development Association (IDA) provided total funding.
There was no counterpart funding from Government of Ghana.

Components of the HIP project

6.      There were two components for the HIP project; Component A and Component B.
With regard to Component A, the Project focuses on five elements or sub-components: (i)
streamlining to an efficient provider payment mechanism for NHIS, (ii) improving the
sustainability of NHIS (through addressing cost containment mechanisms), and strengthening
quantitative and actuarial analytical capacity, (iii) addressing the equity element on the coverage
of the poor under NHIS, (iv) restructuring data and analysis; and (v) Effective project
management, coordination and monitoring and evaluation. With regard to Component B, the
Project focuses on three elements: (i) strengthening governance and oversight for e-health; (ii)
streamlining an integrated claims management system for the NHIS, and (iii) linking Hospital
Management Information System (HMIS) with NHIS claims processing.

Financial and Procurement Management

7.      Satisfactory Financial Management Performance rating was consistent throughout
implementation of the project, which can be attributed to the competence and skill of the Project
Finance staff at the NHIS. This resulted in the project complying fully to the Financial covenants
of the submission of quarterly reports and audits reports, albeit there were instances where these
reports were submitted late. The good FM rating is also supported by the project not having any
adverse audit opinion throughout implementation. The project, as at end of March 31 2014, had
disbursed USD 4,479,529.97 as against funds allocated of 15,305,539.97: see table below.

8.      The procurement management of the HIP project followed the World Bank’s Guidelines
for Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits. Guidelines for Selection and Employment of
Consultants by world Bank Borrowers, and the provisions stipulated in the Development Credit
Agreement. Other procurement and selection of consultants were based on the Ghana Public
Procurement Act (Act 663).



                                                45
9.       The procurement process under the HIP project was extremely slow in the first three
years of the project effectiveness, until 2010 when a procurement consultant was hired to
facilitate the procurement management. Based on the post procurement reviews, contracts
procured by the project met the appropriate procurement procedures in terms of the thresholds
and methods of procurement stipulated in the PIM. The procedures and the arrangements were
also consistent with provision of the Credit Agreement and practically complied with the World
Banks guidelines.

HIP Project Challenges

10.     The implementation of the project activities was not without challenges culminating in
several extensions.
     The project had several stakeholders with varied interest and this posed a serious
        challenge in coordinating them. This challenge delayed in the implementation of some of
        the project activities particularly the Electronic Claims component of the project.
     Change in Government in 2009, challenged the smooth implementation of the project as
        the new administration took time to understand the project governance and structure
        before proceeding with it. Close to a little over a year was lost as result of this change.
     Lack of consensus between GOG and the World Bank in certain activities of the project
        also posed a serious challenge in implementing the project. As a result of the paradigm
        shift from paper claims to electronic claims, several consultants were hired by the World
        Bank to assist in the implementation process. However, most of them came with their
        own understanding of the issues that was different from that of GOG and even part of the
        Bank staff. This resulted in a prolonged delayed in reaching consensus on some of the
        key project activities especially the electronic claims processing on which software and
        methods to use in achieving the set objective.
     Internal bureaucracy of the Implementation Agency and lack of clear communication and
        approval channels affected the project implementation process.
     The M & E system in place to track project activities was not robust and coherent. Report
        submission deadlines were not adhered to, resulting in the delay of key project reports.

Achievement of Results

11.       The HIP was to be measured by the following Development Objectives:

         % of total clean claims that are reimbursed by payers (NHIA) to providers within 30 days
          of claims receipt;
         Number of total claims received electronically by processor from provider;
         % of total claims submitted by provider to NHIS (DMHIS or CPC) that passed the initial
          screening (i.e. not rejected by first electronic/manual review);
         % of population from among the lowest quintile (20% of the index of socio-economic
          status) registered under the NHIS with a valid NHIS card.

                        under the NHIS with a valid NHIS
                        card.



12.      Based on the performance indicators the project generally performed well by supporting
the introduction and enhancing the electronic claims submission by providers to NHIS to
facilitate rapid claims payment and improving the overall health delivery system. The continuous
improvement in Electronic Claims submission from the Health Facilities is an indication that the
lay down infrastructure is well placed to support this component far into the future.

13.       The project has completed the following products.
         Capitation Pilot in the Ashanti Region
         Development of Medical Terminology & Disease Coding
         Review of Ghana Diagnostic Related Groupings Tariffs
         Training on Ministry of Health Referral & NHIS Gatekeeper Policies
         Support Clinical Audit Directorate
         Conduct Actuarial Study on NHIA (March2010)
         Increase Equity in Coverage of the Poor and Vulnerable
         Establishment of Health Data Dictionary
         Conduct of National Health Accounts
         Development of ICT Master plan
         Upgrading of Ghana Health Service Hospital Management Information System – iHOST
         Upgrade of NHIA Claims Processing Center
         Capacity Building of Beneficiary Institutions

14.       The development of the above stated project products has led to the following outcomes.

         Support to the development of Medical Terminology & Disease Coding. This increases
          the ability of staff of both NHIS and Providers to generate the right claims for
          adjudication. The critical link between the healthcare providers and the health insurance
          is the billing, adjudication and reimbursement of medical claims. However, monitoring
          and other reports had suggested inadequacy of medical knowledge, diagnosis, procedures
          and medical coding.



                                                 47
         Health Data Dictionary has been developed with over 800 data elements defined. This
          was done to facilitate the exchange of data among agencies in the health sector of Ghana
          and to aid in the implementation of the electronic claims. Series of workshops were held
          to facilitate the definition of the data elements.

         National Health Accounts was conducted. The project supported the Ministry of Health
          to hire a consultant to assist in the conduct of National Health Accounts in 2013 using the
          2005 and 2010 data. This was also done with the thought of building database for the
          future health financing analysis and actuarial studies of the National Health Insurance
          Scheme. It was successfully conducted and the report has been printed.

         The development of a Health sector ICT Master Plan (2011 – 2016) is aimed at
          producing a strategic plan to guide the design, acquisition, implementation and
          management of health information systems in Ghana. The master plan is expected to
          guide the development and deployment of ICT in healthcare for all categories of
          providers in Ghana.

         The development of this master plan will involve review of existing ICT projects and the
          development of a support and sustainability plan. This plan will serve as the blueprint for
          ICT projects in the NHIA and the health sector.

         Upgrade of NHIA Claims Processing Centre: In trying to improve the billing and
          adjudication process of health care providers and NHIA respectively, the project assisted
          the NHIA to upgrade its Claims Processing Centre to enable it to receive and adjudicate
          healthcare providers claims electronically. This was conceived with the objective to
          improve efficiency in the claims processing cycle. The NHIA CPC has been upgraded
          and its now receiving electronic claims from providers.

         The paradigm shift of the NHIA from paper-based claims processing to electronic
          necessitated the building of capacity of both healthcare providers and NHIA staff.
          Beneficiary Institution of the project equally benefited from the project in building their
          staff capacity identified by those agencies as pertinent to enhancing their productivity,
          either through their internal capacity building process or through training institutions. A
          total of 5,806 staff was trained in various areas identified by their agencies that were of
          utmost important to them.

         Capitation in the Ashanti Region – A capitation pilot was conducted in the Ashanti
          Region and which has provided the basis for a national scale-up.

Lessons Learnt

15.       A number of lessons have been learnt through the implementation of this project.
         A major lesson learned from the pilot of the capitation was that because financial
          constraints and poor planning did not allow training of an adequate critical mass of staff,
          it fed the poor misunderstanding of the pilot and the confusion in implementation. For
          National Scale up, adequate training is required to prepare the critical staff for the pilot.
         The draft guidelines for a financial management and reporting system and training
          modules for providers that were developed to be used to train and orient providers to the
          financial and other management changes that a per capita payment system would
          introduce should be revised based on the experience of the pilot. The revised modules

                                                  48
       should be used for training of providers and district scheme workers in the national scale
       up.
      In the future, the roles and responsibilities of the Implementing Agency and the
       supervisory ministry should be clarified from the onset of the project to allow for the
       smooth implementation.
      Because of the numerous changes of the project staff at the project coordination unit,
       project implementation was delayed as new staff took time to understand project
       coordination issues and governance.
      In the future, staffs that are dedicated to the project implementation should be selected to
       coordinate the project in order to avoid situations where they had to combine their routine
       work duties with that of the project. This situation will provide more stability to project
       coordination and implementation.
      In the future, a more robust M & E system should be developed for the project
       coordination Unit to ensure that project baseline data and project tracking mechanisms
       are dependable.

Way Forward

16.     The way forward for the project as seen through the various recommendations from the
consultants assigned to the project and our own review are encapsulated in the following three
key areas.

      The National Scale up of Capitation Payment Mechanism should be supported after
       adopting the recommendations from the Ashanti Pilot.
      The registration of the Poor under the National Health Insurance Scheme should be
       encouraged and supported continuously. The process should be on-going.
      Support should be provided for Healthcare Providers to process claims electronically.
       More Healthcare Providers should be encouraged to process claims electronically by
       building their capacities as well as providing them with a suitable ICT platform and
       interface.
