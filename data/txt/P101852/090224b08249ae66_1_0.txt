                         The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the financial and operational management of the National Health Insurance Scheme by improving: (i) the policy
                         adaptation and implementation capacity of the National Health Insurance Council in addressing ongoing core policy issues related to contribution collection, risk
                         equalization, and provider payment mechanisms; and (ii) the purchasing function of the District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes, and the billing function of the
                         Providers.

                         Project achieved the targets set for three PDO indicators: (i) proportion of total claims submitted by providers to NHIS (District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme or Claims Processing
                         Center) for processing that passed the initial screening; (ii) proportion of total “clean” claims that are reimbursed by payers (NHIS) to providers within 60 days of claims receipt; and
                         (iii) % of population within the lowest quintile registered under NHIA and with a valid card.

                         The indicator of "number of total claims received electronically by processors from providers" is progressing impressively. As of February 2014, a total of 709,190 claims were
                         submitted electronically from one National Referral Hospital, 8 Regional Hospitals and 21 District Hospitals submitting eClaims. Compared with three month ago when 430,960 claims
                         were processed electronically, this indicator has progressed at a rate of 22 percent per month on average. With this momentum continuing, it will reach 2.5 million during the next 12

                         months.

                         All activities under Component A - Streamlined Purchasing Policies and Mechanism - have been completed. These include the capitation pilot that was successfully completed and
                         and reviewed; accreditation of providers, gate keeper and referral policy training with about 4,154 health providers and health insurance scheme staff trained. Under Component B -
                         Strengthening Integrated Claims Management Systems, - the Health Data Dictionary (HDD) is completed and is being matched against the Ghana Health Service elements to ensure
                         that their health facilities can generate report and submit through the District Health Information Management System II (DHIMSII). The project fund is 100 percent percent disbursed.

                         As contained in the medium term strategic plan 2010 of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), one of the goals of the NHIA is to increase coverage of the poor and
                         vulnerable under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). As part of efforts to meeting this goal, the NHIA embarked on a special registration of the poor and vulnerable unto
                         the NHIS between June and August 2013. At the end of the exercise about 1.2m poor and vulnerable persons got enrolled unto the scheme.

                         The preliminary judgment is that relevance of the project is high, particularly after project restructuring, and taking into account that 3 out of 4 PIs have been achieved with great
                         extended impact. Project implementation was handled well by a strong team at the NHIA, which is comprised of highly competent professionals. Overall, this type of institutional
                         building projects are critical to put in place the necessary building blocks to facilitate access to quality medical care services and and protect the population from financial hardship in
                         case of illness and disability that is commonly associated with out of pocket payments. By supporting the development of a modern risk pooling arrangement for health care in
                         Ghana in the form of the NHIS, the project contributed to advance universal health coverage in the country--after 10 years, the scheme covers about 10 million registered affiliates or
                         close to 50 percent of the total population in the country.

                         To prepare for the closing of the project:
                         1) The field work for beneficiary assessment has been competed by the recruited firm. A draft report is expected by mid April 2014.
                         2) The ICR mission was carried out in the week of March 17, 2014; the team has had meetings with the project team, National Health Insurance Authority authorities and teams,
                         Ghana Health Services, Christian Health Association in Ghana, one teaching hospital, and beneficiary hospital. The ICR team also visited a teaching hospital and the national claims
                         processing center.
                         3) The ICR team also proposed an economic assessment of the eClaims system and had initial discussions with the counterpart. This will be a cost-benefit analysis evaluating the
                         soundness of the project's investment on eClaims system supported by this project, aiming to quantify the intended and unintended benefits such as efficient claims processing,
                         increased capacity to identify fraud claims and inappropriate services.
