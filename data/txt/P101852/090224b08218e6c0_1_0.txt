                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the financial and operational management of the National Health Insurance Scheme by improving: (i) the policy
                         adaptation and implementation capacity of the National Health Insurance Council in addressing ongoing core policy issues related to contribution collection, risk
                         equalization, and provider payment mechanisms; and (ii) the purchasing function of the District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes, and the billing function of the
                         Providers.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The likelihood of achieving the Project Development Objective is maintained as Moderately Satisfactory as three out of the four outcome indicators have met their targets. The
                         Implementation Progress (IP) is maintained at Satisfactory.

                         The three outcome indicators that have met their targets are (i) proportion of total claims submitted by providers to NHIS (District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme or Claims

                         Processing Center) for processing that passed the initial screening; and (ii) proportion of total “clean” claims that are reimbursed by payers (NHIS) to providers within 60 days of
                         claims receipt and (iii) % of population within the lowest quintile registered under NHIA and with a valid card. While the target of the outcome indicator on electronic claims (eclaims)
                         management system is still far from being met it is important to note that the processing center (the CPC) was completed and twenty 20 facilities out of the target 47, and 371,873
                         claims have been submitted to date up from 5,918 adjudicated and paid through the system as at November 15, 2013. Some unforeseen challenges came up during expansion of the
                         eclaims to other facilities and these have delayed the process hence the current number of eclaims. Some of these challenges are the slow internet connectivity, the systems being
                         used by some of the facilities and the need to configure them to be compliant enough for the CPC to receive their claims and adjudicate successfully. Efforts are being made by the
                         project team to address them.

                         The recruitment of a firm to carry out the beneficiary assessment is to be completed shortly. All activities under Component A - Streamlined Purchasing Policies and Mechanism -
                         have been completed. These include the capitation pilot that was successfully completed and and reviewed; accreditation of providers, gate keeper and referral policy training with
                         about 4,154 health providers and health insurance scheme staff trained. Under Component B - Strengthening Integrated Claims Management Systems, - the Health Data Dictionary
                         (HDD) is completed and is being matched against the Ghana Health Service elements to ensure that their health facilities can generate report and submit through the District Health
                         Information Management System II (DHIMSII).
