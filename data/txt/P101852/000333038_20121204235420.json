This is to extend the closing\n            date for the project from December 31, 2012 until June 28,\n            2013 as per the Government's request dated September\n            28, 2012. All procurement contracts have been signed and the\n            outstanding deliveries will be done by end October 2012.\n            Consequently disbursement has also picked up since then. It\n            improved from US$2.9 million in March, 2012 to US$10.73\n            million out of US$15.0 million International Development\n            Association (IDA) credit. An amount of US$2.7 million is\n            also committed in four signed contracts. It is expected that\n            all credit proceeds will be disbursed by closing and that\n            the project will achieve its project development objective\n            (PDO). The Borrower has put in place an action plan to\n            complete the project. The extension is necessary to enable\n            the completion of the remaining project activities which\n            include upgrading of claims processing center, health data\n            dictionary and enhancement of software for the health\n            service providers and to monitor the systems that are being\n            put in place to ensure sustainability of the Ghana National\n            Health Insurance System for their effective functionality.\n            All legal covenants are fully complied with and there are no\n            pending audits. Implementation of the last activities of the\n            project will require supervision beyond the regular monthly\n            meeting established to improve project performance. This\n            will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
