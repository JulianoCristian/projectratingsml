Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            moderately satisfactory performances. Overall, the Project\n            has achieved the PDO of strengthening the financial and\n            operational management of the National Health Insurance\n            Scheme after restructuring. Activities were revised and\n            regrouped under components through the Level II\n            restructuring of June 2011, as follows: For Component A, the\n            Project was to focus on: (i) streamlining to an efficient\n            provider payment mechanism for NHIS; (ii) improving the\n            sustainability of the NHIS, (iii) improving equity in the\n            coverage of the poor by the NHIS, (iv) support restructuring\n            data and analysis, and (v) support project management,\n            coordination and monitoring and evaluation. For Component B,\n            the Project was to focus on: (i) strengthening governance\n            and oversight of e-health; (ii) streamlining an integrated\n            claims management system for the NHIS; and (iii)\n            strengthening automation in the major hospitals. Component C\n            was dropped, with some of the activities dropped or folded\n            into Components A or B. Project cost allocation was changed\n            through restructuring of June 2011. While the total cost of\n            the project remained the same through implementation, there\n            were changes in component costs due to the aforementioned\n            changes in component activities. There were several lessons\n            learned and are as follows: (1) It is important to get\n            engaged at the right time. This project was prepared and\n            approved at a time when the counterpart needed most help as\n            the NHIS was just established. (2) By adopting a two-arm\n            approach in the design, the project was able to provide both\n            knowledge service and infrastructure investment at the same\n            time. (3) It is important for the Bank to deploy a team that\n            has a combined skill set in strategic policy discussion,\n            technical studies as well as operational project management.\n            (4) Implementation readiness is critical for project\n            performance, in particular when the implementation agency is\n            not experienced. (5) Integrating project implementation with\n            overall work on health insurance and health financing\n            maximizes the leveraging impact of the project and ensures\n            sustainability. (6) This project presents another case on\n            the importance of strengthening M&E capacities on both\n            the Bank and Government teams, including design of realistic\n            indicators, tracking performance of indicators consistently,\n            and verifying results."}, "docdt": "2014-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
