                         The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the financial and operational management of the National Health Insurance Scheme by improving: (i) the
                         policy adaptation and implementation capacity of the National Health Insurance Council in addressing ongoing core policy issues related to contribution
                         collection, risk equalization, and provider payment mechanisms; and (ii) the purchasing function of the District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes, and the
                         billing function of the Providers.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This Implementation Status Report reports on the project's progress following the supervision mission completed on May 5, 2011. The previous mission was in December 2010.

                         The Government of Ghana launched the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2005, with the primary objective of removing financial barriers to the utilization of health care.

                         The Government requested the Bank's assistance to help strengthen the NHIS program. The Health Insurance Project (HIP) was designed to help refine policies and systems to
                         improve the efficiency of the NHIS.

                         During the Project Mid-Term Review in December 2009 and the discussions in the following months, the task team determined that the likelihood of achieving the project
                         development objective (PDO) by project closing was moderately unsatisfactory. Implementation progress was also rated moderately unsatisfactory. Upon the Bank's suggestion, the
                         government agreed to restructure the project.

                         The changes proposed are to: (i) streamline the project by reducing the number of components and subcomponents and adapt them to the current needs of the sector; (ii) change the
                         project's outcome indicators and targets to better capture progress in efficiency and equity; and (iii) change one of the legal covenants. The proposed restructuring would
                         accommodate the current sector needs and would help improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the investment.

                         Some accelerated progress is seen in the project's activities since January 2011: preparation of terms of reference, concepts, implementation and procurement plans, and bidding
                         documents. This development suggests that the project is moving in the right direction. As these activities are just starting, disbursements are still limited.

                         Some significant achievements in the past fiscal year are: (i) a well advanced design on the capitation pilot; (ii) Concept notes prepared for the increased coverage of the poor, and
                         the National Health Accounts; (iii) a good progress in the preparation of the terms of reference for services, and in the specification for the procurement of information technology
                         equipment, and (iv) the draft contract for the non-consulting services (outsourcing of the call center) is also in a much advanced stage of preparation.

                         Should the government move fast in this area, it would allow for significant improvement in disbursements in the next 6-months, as the latter component represents about 40% of the
                         project cost.

                         Project management will still need to be strengthened and the project's progress monitored closely. Monitoring systems continue to require strengthening.
