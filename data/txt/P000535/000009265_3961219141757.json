At the national level, the project will\n            lay the groundwork for a permanent structure in charge of\n            all conservation activities by creating a Project Management\n            Unit (PMU) and a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) to\n            manage and monitor the project in the interim.  The project\n            will also support the capacity-building of the Directorate\n            in charge of protected areas, the National Herbarium, the\n            National Geographic and Cartographic Center, and national\n            nongovernmental organizations.  At the local level, the\n            project will focus on five sites representative of the\n            country's biodiversity:  Nouabale-Ndoki, primary closed\n            forest; Conkouati, mixed gallery forest, savannah and\n            mangrove swamp; Dimonika, mixed closed forest; Lefini,\n            savannah and gallery forest; and Lake Tele-Likouala,\n            inundated forest.  Additional inventory and survey work will\n            be carried out in Mt. Fouari, Mt. Nabemba-Garibenzam and\n            other sites for possible inclusion at a later stage.  In the\n            five priority reserves, the project will support the\n            development and execution of rational management plans,\n            including alternative activities for local populations."}, "docdt": "1993-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
