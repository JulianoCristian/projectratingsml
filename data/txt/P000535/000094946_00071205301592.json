The project was successful in protecting\n            several of Congo's important ecosystems: it established\n            a national park in primary closed forest, a community\n            reserve in an inundated forest, and a sanctuary in savannah\n            and gallery forest, and reinforced an established reserve.\n            However, the achievement of objectives is considered\n            marginal due to the impact of civil war and unrest, the high\n            turnover of senior government officials that delayed many\n            activities, and the numerous misunderstandings between\n            government and the trustee regarding project objectives and\n            implementation. Project sustainability is unlikely. Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are adjudged\n            satisfactory. Principal lessons include: The cross-sectoral\n            nature of the project initially resulted in little\n            ownership. This was exacerbated by the large role of\n            international nongovernmental organizations. By project end,\n            both of these factors were seen as strengths and the project\n            succeeded due to both government partnerships and the strong\n            and independent role of the NGOs. Because NGOs were directly\n            included in project management, continuity was maintained\n            when government upheaval occurred. NGOs also provided\n            cross-fertilization of ideas and solutions to problems never\n            encountered by the government. And, the cross-sectoral\n            nature and NGO involvement attracted a lot of international\n            media, which promoted national ownership and international recognition."}, "docdt": "2000-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
