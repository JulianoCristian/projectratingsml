highway network\n            through investments in rehabilitation and resurfacing of\n            paved highways; (b) improve highway rehabilitation,\n            resurfacing and maintenance (HRRM) planning by strenghtening\n            the institutional capacity of the Secretariat for\n            Communications and Transport's (SCT's) highway\n            maintenance directorate; (c) support measures to improve\n            funding for HRRM; (d) reduce transport costs through\n            improvements in traffic safety and more efficient traffic\n            flow on the federal highways; and (e) support further policy\n            improvements through:  (i) studies on road financing; (ii)\n            development and implementation of a computerized data base\n            for the transport sector; (iii) preparation of project\n            planning and evaluation manuals; and (iv) improved\n            consideration of environmental factors in highway\n            maintenance. The objectives will be achieved through the\n            implementation of: (a) an institutional strengthening\n            component for improving transport sector planning and\n            policies; (b) a comprehensive, four year HRRM program for\n            the federal highway system; and (c) a road traffic safety\n            program. The institutional strenghthening component will\n            include specific measures and actions to improve: (a) sector\n            planning and coordination, especially for HRRM; (b) HRRM\n            funding and budget preparation; (c) sustainability through\n            development of a coherent framework for road sector\n            financing; (d) control of truck overloading through the\n            issuance of revised vehicle weight and size regulations and\n            a program for their implementation; (e) specifications for\n            HRRM works, to include quarry management and pollution\n            control of construction equipment; (f) the system for truck\n            driver education, testing and licensing; and (g) training of\n            sector staff. The four-year HRRM program will include about\n            27,000 km of highway rehabilitation and resurfacing,\n            improvement and rehabilitation of bridges and depots\n            maintenance, replacement/rehabilitation of equipment, and\n            consultancy services. The road traffic safety program will\n            include improvement of some 350 hazardous road locations. It\n            will also finance the purchase of equipment for the new\n            licensing and vehicle inspection system and for the\n            preventive medical unit, road safety studies and information\n            campaigns, a vehicle standards study and an international\n            traffic safety seminar."}, "docdt": "1993-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
