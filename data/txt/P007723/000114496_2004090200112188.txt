Re:

3628-ME) - 
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sirs:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement (Highway Rehabilitation and Traffic Safety 
Project) between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) 
and Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Públicos, S.N.C. (the Borrower) dated July 8, 
1993, as amended (the Loan Agreement). Whenever used in this letter, the several terms 
defined in the Loan Agreement have the respective meanings therein set forth. 
Pursuant to discussions between staff of the Borrower, the Guarantor and the 
Bank, the Bank hereby agrees to increase the percentage of expenditures to be financed 
for Category 1 (Capital Expenditures and Resurfacing Civil Works for Road under Part B 
of the Project and Capital Expenditures Civil Works for Part C. 2 of the Project). 
Accordingly, Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended as follows:
In the table of paragraph 1, Category 1 (Capital Expenditures and Resurfacing 
Civil Works), the figure of “48%” of expenditures to be financed is deleted and 
replaced with “80%”.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating 
this letter in the spaces provided below.  This amendment letter may be executed in 
three counterparts, each of which shall be an original.  Upon your confirmation, 
please return one fully executed original to us. Upon receipt by the Bank of one fully 
executed original of this amendment letter, the provisions of this amendment letter 
will be deemed retroactively effective as of January 1, 1999.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK OF RECONSTRUCTION  
  AND DEVELOPEMENT
