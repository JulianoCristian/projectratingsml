   OED Mission:Enhancingdevelopmenteffectiveness through excellenceand independenceinevaluation.


 About this Report
      The Operations EvaluationDepartmentassesses the programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two
 purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocessand to verifythat the Bank'swork is
 producingthe expectedresults, and second, to helpdevelopimproveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough
 the disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As part of this work, OED annuallyassessesabout25 percentof
 the Bank's lending operations.Inselectingoperations for assessment,preferenceis givento thosethat are
 innovative, large,or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudiesor countryevaluations;those for which
 ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requested assessments;and thosethat are likelyto generate
 importantlessons.The projects, topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessment supportlarger evaluation
studies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a review of the ImplementationCompletion
 Report (a self-evaluationby the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit
the borrowingcountry for onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR therebyseeks to
validate and augmentthe information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interestto broader
OED studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review processand OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
Board of ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has beensent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

About the OED RatingSystem
      The time-tested evaluationmethods used by OED are suited to the broad rangeof the World Bank's work.
The methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. OED evaluators all applythe same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
the definition and ratingscale usedfor each evaluationcriterion (more informationis availableon the OEDwebsite:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectivesare consistentwith the country's
current developmentpriorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistancestrategiesand corporate
goals (expressedin PovertyReductionStrategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies,Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project'sobjectiveswere achieved,or expectedto be achieved,taking into
account their relative importance.Possibleratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency:The extent to which the projectachieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives.Possiblerafings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generallyappliedto adjustmentoperations.
      Sustainability:The resilienceto risk of net benefits flows over time. Possibleratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient,equitableand sustainableuse of its human, financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a)
better definition,stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictabilityof institutionalarrangementsand/or (b)
better alignmentof the missionand capacityof an organizationwith its mandate,which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intendedand unintendedeffects of a
project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome:The extent to which the project's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possibleratings: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     BankPerformance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthroughappropriatesupervision(including ensuring adequatetransition arrangements
for regular operationof the project). Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerformance:The extent to which the borrowerassumedownership and responsibilityto ensure
quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and agreements, towards the
achievementof developmentobjectivesand sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

         This is a Perfonnance Audit Report (PAR) for three projects inMexico: the
Transport Air Quality Management Project for the Mexico City MetropolitanArea
(Loan 3543-ME), the Highway Rehabilitation and Safety project (Loan 3628-ME),
andthe InfrastructurePrivatizationTechnical Assistance project (Loan 3937-ME).
The Transport Air Quality project was approved December 15, 1992, for $220 million
andclosedJune 30, 1999, two years laterthanplanned; $128.2 milliono fthe loan
was cancelled. The Highwayproject, approved June 24, 1993, for a loan o f $480
million, closed fully disbursed on December 31,2000, six months behind the
expected closing date. The InfrastructurePrivatization project was approved for a $30
million loan on August 29, 1996, and closed as scheduled on June 30, 1999; $17.9
million o f the loan was cancelled.

        This report is based onreviews o fthe Implementation CompletionReports
(ICRs), the Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs), loan documents, project files, transcripts
o f Boardproceedings, and other Bank documents, as well as documents from other
sources and discussions with Bank staff. An OED mission visitedMexico in
December 2002 and discussedthe projects with federal and state government
officials, andwith private consultants. Their kindassistance i s gratefully
acknowledged.

        The PPAR was undertakenbecause the projects coveredthree different but
important dimensions o fthe transport sector and therefore provided an excellent
opportunity to make a broad assessment o f Bank operations inthe sector. The PPAR
gives special attentionto specific issues ineach o f the three projects. Inthe transport
and air qualityproject, it assesses the impact o f the project inreducing air pollutants,
andinreducing air quality-relatedemergencies andillnesses. Inthe highway project,
it examines the longstandingissue o f funding for road maintenance, andthe missed
opportunity to advance decentralization. Inthe infrastructure privatizationproject,
the PPAR focuses on its transport components, with special attention to the successful
railway privatization, andthe conditions required for infrastructure privatization to
gain public acceptance. Inaddition, the report provides a current assessment o f the
outcome, representing an updating o f some 3-4 years inthe case o f the two projects
that closed in 1999.

        Following standard procedures, copies o f the PPAR were sent to the Mexican
authorities for comments. Comments received are attached as Annex B.

Summary

         This is the Project PerformanceAssessment Reportpreparedbythe Operations
Evaluation Department onthe above projects. The Transport Air Quality project,
approved inFY93, closed inFY99, two years late. The Highway project, approved in
FY93, closed inFYO1, six months late. The Infrastructure Privatization project, approved
inFY96, closed inFY99, on schedule. Morethan halfofthe transport air qualityproject
($128 million out o f $220 millionloan) and o f the infrastructure privatization project
($27.5 million out o f $46 million loan) was canceled. The $480 millionhighway loanwas
fully disbursed.

         The three projects addresseddifferentbutimportant dimensions o fMexico's
transport sector and were consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy for the country.
The Transport Air Qualityproject, a complex project that was the first Bankoperation
anywhere to integratetransport and air quality, aimed to reduce the highlevelo f vehicle
emissions inthe Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), develop a policy framework for
transport and air policy, and strengthen institutional capabilities. The Highwayproject,
which continued a series o fBank interventions supporting Mexico's highway system,
aimed to protect the federal road network, improve planning o fhighway maintenance,
improve road funding, and improve highway safety. The InfrastructurePrivatization
project, which supported the government's pushto accelerate privatization, aimed to help
designand implement privatization o f infrastructure, includingdevelopment o f a regulatory
fi-amework, rehabilitation andmaintenance o fthe federal roadnetwork, andthe
privatization of state-provided transport and other infrastructure services.

         All three projects largely achieved their objectives, despite significant initial
implementation problems inthe case o f the air quality and the highway projects.
Approvedjust before the onset o f the 1994/95 macroeconomic crisis, these projects
suffered delays and experienced serious problems with finance, use o f line o f credit inthe
case o f the Transport Air Quality project, and counterpart fundinginthe case o f the
Highway project, especially inthe early years. Incontrast, the Infrastructure Privatization
project was designed as a response to the crisis and escaped these problems.

         The air qualityproject, through policy instruments and relatedmeasures, ledto a
significant decrease inambient concentration o f pollutants originating invehicle
operations and emissions and affecting the populationo f the MCMA.Of significant
importance were the reductions over the project period o f lead (by 98 percent), ozone (by
49 percent), and carbon monoxide (by 27 percent), achieved despite increasing vehicle
population and traffic inthe area. Sulfur dioxide was also reduced (by 78 percent), but
this was mainly the result o fgovernmentprograms outside the project. One result from
the decline inozone levels was the reduction indeclaredpollution emergency days (from
103 days/year in 1993 to 13 in2001) calling for restrictions inthe use o f vehicles and
preventative healthmeasures. The decline inthe level o f air pollutants (although some
still exceed Mexico's n o m levels) has resulted in fewer respiratory illnesses and other
acute syndromes caused by poor quality air.

        The highwayproject's main outcome was an improvement inthe condition o fthe
federal road network, with roads in fair and good condition increasing from 43 percent in
1994 to 66 percent in2001.This was achieved, despite underfundingo f road

                                                   X



maintenance, by a fund-allocation policy that gave priority to routine and periodic
maintenance over rehabilitation.

         The infrastructure privatization project's most important outcome was the
privatization o f Mexico's railway system (the main lines were concessioned in 1996-97)
that has led to substantial improvement inefficiency, traffic, and quality o f service. At
the same time, the transparent privatization process, compliance by operators with service
and investment commitments, government social policy providing affordable passenger
services where there i s no road service, and appropriate protection to the railway staff
made redundant, allowed this privatization to avoid the negative public perception that
often besets privatization o f infrastructure. Privatization o f airports was also advanced, as
it was inother areas (although privatization o f the electricity sector was stalled). A
transport regulatory agency was proposedbutnot created.

         The outcome i s rated satisfactory for the three projects. Institutional development
i s rated substantial for the air quality and the privatization projects, andmodest inthe
highway project, since improvement o f maintenance planning andmanagement hadbeen
largely done under a precedinghighwayproject. Sustainability i s rated likely for the air
quality and the privatization projects and non-evaluable for the highwayproject, since the
road condition level attained cannot be sustained with present levels o f funding, and it i s
not possible to assess the fundingthe government will allocate inthe future. Bank and
borrower perfonnance i s rated satisfactory inall three projects.

         Three lessons emerge from these operations. First, muchprogress canbe achieved
inreducingthe impact ofroadtransport on air quality through a combination ofpublic and
private sector measures, starting with an adequate system o fincentives put inplace by
federal and state governments. Second, allocation of highway maintenancefunding
optimizes outcome when preference is given to routine and periodic maintenance over
rehabilitation, butnetwork condition is boundto deteriorate iffundingfor rehabilitation i s
not made available. Third, infrastructure privatization, to gain public acceptance, requires
as necessary (but not always sufficient) conditions, a transparent privatization process,
compliancewith commitments byprivate operators, and government provisiono f social
protectionto users o fnon-commercial services andto staffmade redundant.

Background

 1.       This PPARreviews three projects, addressing different dimensions o fMexico's
transport sector, that were approved inthe first half o fthe 1990s andclosed at the end o f
the decade. The Transport Air Quality Management Project (Loan 3543-Me) focused on
the reduction o f vehicular emissions inthe Mexico City Metropolitan Area. The Highway
Rehabilitation and Safety project (Loan 3628-Me) focused on the management o f
Mexico's federal roadnetwork. And the InfrastructurePrivatization Technical Assistance
project (Loan 39370-Me) assisted inpreparing and launching privatization in several
infrastructure sectors. The PPAR gives particular attentionto the transport components o f
this project.

2.        Inthe early 1990s, when the air quality andhighway loanswere beingprepared,
Mexico's economy was starting to recover from Latin America's `lost decade' o f the
1980s and from the worldwide debt crisis, which Mexico had led.' When Mexico
deepened its economic reform inthe late 1980s and early 1990s, growth resumed. After a
decade o f stagnation, GDP growth averaged 3.5 percent annually during 1989-92, and
inflation in 1993 reached its lowest level (8 percent) inmore than 20 years. The
government pursueda wide-ranging program of reforms to consolidate an open, market-
oriented economy. After years o f negotiations, inJanuary 1994, Mexico signed the North
American Free Trade Agreement.

3.        The World Bank supported the reforms with large adjustment loans duringthe
1989-91 period, but shiftedin 1992-94 toward increased project lending and associated
sectoral reforms, including transport andthe environment.

4.        In1994, acombinationofeconomic andpolitical factors brought about anacute
financial crisis and recession that lasted for most o f 1995. The crisis had a negative effect
on the implementationo fthe three transportation sector projects, which were underway at
the time. First, fiscal resources were scarce, restricting the government's ability to
provide counterpart funds andprovide funding for highway maintenance. Second, private
sector activity was severely curtailed, reducing traffic and investment innew vehicles.

5.        Inresponseto the 1994/95 crisis, the government pursuedits reforms, including
the privatization o f state-owned enterprises, especially inthe infrastructure sector. The
Bank supported these efforts, andthe infrastructureprivatizationtechnical assistance
project was part of this support.

Relevance andDesign

7.       The three projects supported government priorities andwere inline with Bank
assistance strategy to Mexico.

TransportAir Quality

8.       The relevance o fthis project was high. It responded to increasing central
government concern about air pollution inthe Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA),
andto a specific government request for Bank intervention inthis area. The Bank initially
responded byreallocating funds from an ongoing Urban Transport project to support the
government's Emergency Program, which aimed to reduce the highlevels o f air
pollution. Almost immediately after this move, the Mexicanauthorities started to prepare
a free-standing project.

9.       While the Bankhadno direct experience with transport air pollution inMexico, in
1982 it had approved a pollution control project (Loan 2154-Me) focused on industry,
which gave it some exposure to air pollution problems.

10.      Airpollution and health. Inits description ofthe project benefits, the S A R noted
the health effects of air pollution, and identified illnesses and other consequences that the
project could help reduce. However, the appraisal didnot present the impact on health as
a keyrationale for the project, nor did it include health impacts among the project
objectives. While at first sight this omission appears surprising, it is probably based on
the difficulty of directly linking reduced vehicular emissions, which the project aimedto
achieve, to improvements inhealth.

11.      The linkage problems are twofold. First, it i s difficult to assess how reducing
vehicular emissions translates into lower ambient air concentration o fpollutants. A
number o fphysical factors, includingwinds, temperature, andpressure can increase or
decrease the level o f ambient air pollution that results from the same level o f vehicular
emissions. Second, reliable statistical analysis that relates ambient concentration o f the
various pollutants to illness incidence requires a relatively large database including time
series on the level o f pollutants and on illnesses inthe relevant geographic area.

12.      Project Design. Two features o fthe project design helped enhance the relevance
o f the operation:

     e   Coordinatedfederal and state government work. The project involved the federal
         government as well as the governments o fthe Federal District and o fthe State o f

                                                 4


          Mexico. Central government authorities had long insistedthat Bankprojects
          should aim to work with subnational

      0   External advisory panel. An internationalPanel o fExpertswas established and
          membersrecruitedto assist periodicallyinreviewingimplementation o fthe
          project, and to contribute up-to-date knowledge on the subject. The panelwas
          valuable because o fthe complexity o fthe subject, the difficult environmental
          conditions o f the MCMA, and the needto provide the government with irrefutable
          expert advice, especially on sensitive policy and institutional measures.

 13.      Theproject design was less successful inestablishing usefulperfomance
indicators. The S A R tables showingthe amount o f emission reductions expected for 1995
-withbreakdownbytypeofmeasureandpollutant-containednobaselinedata,and
there was no mechanism inplace to ensure that the method o f calculation used inthe
S A R could be replicated.

Highway Rehabilitation

 14.      Theproject's aimto improve the conditiono fthe road system andcontinue the
shift inthe use o f funding away from new construction andtoward preservingthe
physical assets hada strong economic rationale. Efficient use o fthe substantial budgetary
resources requiredbythe highwaysystemwas highlyrelevant to Mexico's economic
situation, andgrew inimportance after the 1994 fiscal crisis. A well functioning road
transport infrastructure also was a prerequisite for the development o f trade under the
NAFTA agreement signed in 1994. Theproject was the first Bank operationinMexico to
focus directly on highway safety.

15.      The value o fthe institutional objectives -to improve planningo fmaintenance
ando froad funding-was limited, becausethe consulting assistance and
recommendations essential to carry out the improvements sought inplanning and
maintenance managementhad beenlaunched andpractically completed under the
preceding highwayproject.

16.      Inaddition, the project target regardingworks bycontract was unjustifiably
modest. The project committed the government to increase works by contract (as opposed
to force account) only for road rehabilitation, where a target o f (at least) 70 percent was
specified inthe SAR. N o commitment was required regarding periodic androutine
maintenance. The 70 percent target was modest because by 1993, when the project was
approved, Mexico had a well developed contracting industry that could easily carry out
the works and few countries inthe world continued to do any rehabilitation work o f the
national highway system by force account.

17.      The project missed an opportunity to encourage decentralization o f the highway
system. The S A R providedseveral reasons why the project hadno role in




2. As notedinthe 2001 CountryAssistance Review.

                                                5


decentralization, among them: (i) were requiring road rehabilitation prior to
                                     states
accepting transfer o fresponsibilityfor the management o froads currently under the
federal government; (ii) states lacked a qualified highway agency; (iii) was no
                           most                                                 there
clear mechanism inplace to provide financial compensation for the new responsibilities
the states would assume; and (iv) the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IDB) would
support road decentralizationunder a feeder roads project being prepared. Yet, the PPAR
finds that the project shouldhave attempted to carry out decentralizationpilots ina few,
well-selected states, that had good working highwaydepartments and reasonable
finances, where the chances o f success were greater. The highway project was clearly
better positioned for trying decentralization than a feeder roads project. Inclusion o f
some decentralization activity would have increased the project's value added.


Infrastructure Privatization

18.     Theproject was highlyrelevantto the government's privatizationprogram.
Mexico's privatization effort had startedinthe 1980s, initiallywith divestiture o f small
state-owned enterprises, and later o f larger companies operating insuch competitive
markets as manufacturing and banking. However, little progress had been achieved in
privatizing infrastructure. Inthis field, it appeared difficult to sell companies unless
issues involving the legal and regulatory frameworks were analyzed and addressed.

19.     Theproject document (Memorandumo fthe President, or MOP) stated as
rationale for the project: (i)supportto government's long-term objectives o ffurthering
development o f the private sector and (ii)  infrastructure bottlenecks and inefficient
services had contributed to a highcost o f doing business and to low growth. Yet, there
was no data supporting the second point. Inhindsight, with the knowledge that
privatization o f infrastructure has been highlycontroversial inmany countries (including
Mexico's own privately financed toll roadprogram that by 1994 was indisarray andin
need o f a govemment bailout), the MOP should have betterjustified its rationale. A few
well selected financial, fiscal, operational, and quality-of-service indicators could have
easily shown what was wrong ineach sector andhow privatization would improve the
situation. As it was, the MOP conveyed the misleading impression that infrastructure
privatizationwas promoted for its own sake.

20.     The sectors selected for assistance under the project covered a large spectrum
within infrastructure:

    0   Electricity and secondary petrochemicals;
    0   Transport, including ports, railways, and airports;
    0   Telecommunications, including basic telephone service, satellite operations, and
        radio spectrum management; and
    0   Cross-sectoral assistance, mainly insupport of the Interministerial Commission
        on Privatization.

21.    For railways and airports, the project's timing could not have beenbetter. In
February 1995, six months before the loan was approved, the Mexican Congress
amended the constitution to allow private investment inrailways, and a few months later
approved a regulatory law defining the conditions for private participation. For airports,

                                                6


 as reported inthe ICR, a new law passedinDecember 1995 opened the way for private
 participation, and, in 1998, after some study, guidance for private investments inairports
 were approved.

 22.     While at the time o f the appraisal the broadproject scope could have been seen as
 ambitious but feasible, inhindsight,it i s clear that not all areas had the same prospects for
progress. For example, port restructuringand privatizationwas already significantly
 advanced in 1994, while the long-standing, highpolitical sensitivity would make it
unlikely that much could be accomplished inthe electricity sector.

Project Cost

23.     Inretrospect, aproblemwithboththe air quality andthe highwayproject was the
definition o fproject cost. For the air quality project, total project cost was originally
estimated at $1.1 billion. Some $350 million (32 percent) was for the renewal o ftrucks
that private operators would be required to make as a result o fthe new emissions
standards to be put inplace duringproject implementation. Followingthe same approach
as inthe SAR, the ICR estimates that, byproject closing, the project had cost $7.2 billion,
with truck purchases amounting to $6.0 billion, or 83 percent of actual project cost.
Including truck purchases as a project cost was unwarrantedbecause: (i)       the large
majority ofthe purchases were not expected to be financed under the project, andwere
not inpractice, and (ii)was almost impossible to ascertain the percentage of truck
                          it
purchases that could be considered as beingtriggered by the project. The truck fleet in
M C M A at the start o f the 1990swas quite old; therefore, a large amount o frenovation
(plusnormal fleet expansion) wouldhavetakenplace inany case.

24.     The overall cost ofthe highwayproject was estimated at $1.56 billion, o fwhich
the 1993-96 Highway Rehabilitation, Resurfacing, and Maintenance (HRRM)program
accounted for $1.36 billion, or 87 percent of total project cost. Inpractice, as noted
below, the project also financed works under the 1997-2000 HRRM,blurringthe
definition of actual project costs. The borrower was unable to make a precise estimate o f
such costs, which are not presented inthe ICR.

25.     Inthe infrastructureproject, a largepart ofthe loan($17.9 millionout ofthe $30
millionloan) was cancelled. While some o fthis cancellation is explainedbythe fact that
some o f the areas expected to be addressedwere not, or only minimally so, the main
reason appears to be an overestimate o f the cost o f technical assistance to be provided
under the project.


Implementation

26.     The Transport Air Quality andthe Highwayprojects were preparedandapproved
before the onset o f the December 1994 macroeconomic crisis, but most of the
implementationtook place after that date. Consequently, implementation o f the two

                                                       7


projects was severely affected byrestrictedfiscal resources in 1994/95 and for several
 years thereafter,3 which was the main factor leadingto delays inthe closing of the
projects -two years for the air quality and six months for the highway project.
However, inview o f the severity of the economic crisis, the delays should not be
 considered excessive, especially the one for the highwayproject. Incontrast, the
Infrastructure TA, approved in 1995, and little dependent on fiscal resources, closed at
the expected time.

TransportAir Quality

27.       Implementation o fthis project was also affected by factors other than the
macroeconomic crisis, such as4

     0    Delays indeclaring project effectiveness, largely as a result o f conflicting views
          between the Federal andthe GDF on the transfer o f funds from the former to the
          latter on a grant basis, that concludedwith an agreement to make funding for the
          GDF available through a loanto the EnvironmentalTrustFund(ETF);
     0    Delays inprovidingthe funds after the project was approved;
     0    Limits sets duringimplementationonthe use ofcredit lineoperations through
          NAFIN,especially notto finance taxis;
     0    Changes ingovernment policies, changes inkeypersonnel, and restructuring o f
          key agencies; and
     0    The enormous complexity o f the project, with its wide range o f objectives and
          components, and difficult coordination amongthe three participating governments
          (Federal, GDF, and GSM) and agencies within each o fthem.

28.       An important effect o fthe 1994/95 crisis on this project was to severely curtail
financial intermediary lendingfor vehicles, since demand for credit from qualified
applicants dropped practically to zero for the years immediately following.

29.       Although nearly 60 percent o f the loan was cancelled, most o f the project
components were carried out, albeit some with considerable delays and some with
reduced scope, financed bythe private sector, budget funds, or grants. The annual
environmental audits stipulatedby the loan agreement were not carried out, andwere
replacedby a single environmental audit, completed in2001after the project had closed.

30.       The EnvironmentalTrust Fundcreated under the project andfunded with tax
surcharges on gasoline financed a number o fproject items that were later reimbursedby
the Bank loan. The ETFwas a convenient fundinginstrument, and helped buildup the
Metropolitan Environmental Commission (CAM). However, mission discussions with
FinanceMinistry(SHCP) officials indicate that the SHCP i s concerned about the



3. A subsequenthighwayproject, a $475 million loan approved in 1997, neverbecame effective. The govemment was
concemed it wouldnot be ableto providecounterpart funding, following afall of oil pricesand a costlyrescue of toll
roads built andfinancedby the private sector.

4. Most of these factors are well describedinthe ICR.

                                                   8


efficiency inthe allocation o f ETF's resources. Inthe end, the ETFwas underutilized.
Despite the suspension o f gasoline surcharges for several years, by 2002 the ETB still
hadhnds uncommitted. Byend-2002, the Finance Ministrywas chairing a committee
charged with deciding allocation o fthe available funds with a view to terminating the
ETF.

Highway Rehabilitation

31.       Inaddition to the hndingproblems stemmingfrom the 1994fiscal crisis, which
ledto a reductiono f40 percent inthe physicaltargets for 1995, early implementationo f
the project was affectedby (i)      difficulties inchangingthe role o f the unit responsible for
highway maintenance from managing force-account operations to planning andmanaging
contracts and (ii)   highturnover o fmanagement andtechnical staff.

32.       Outputs.The SAR estimate o f expected project outputs was based onthe project
period coinciding with the 1993-96 HRRMprogram. Inpractice, however, the project
also overlapped with, and financed investments from, the 1997-2000 HRRMprogram.
Therefore, a proper comparison o f targets and actual values needs to consider both
HRRMprograms.

33.      As notedinTable 1, the project exceeded the targets for resurfacing, routine
maintenance, andnumber ofbridges rehabilitated or improved, and fell short o f the target
for road rehabilitation.

thereafter under the regular HRRMprogram, andwere not separately accounted for. In
 Chiapas, the project financed contracts for some $21million.


Infrastructure Privatization

35.      Implementation moved fast inthree sectors: railways, airports, and
telecommunications (basic telephone, radio spectrum, and satellite) with the preparation
o f strategic studies. The privatization process inthese sectors was launched shortly
thereafter, and the project supported the process with the provision o f consultants to
prepare technical, financial, and valuation studies, andprovide advice during the process.
Rapidprogress also was made with the reform and partial privatization o f the port
system, but the project didnot provide any h d s since the process was well advanced by
the time o fproject approval.

36.      The project provided assistancefor the designo fregulatory agencies for
telecommunications and energy, and for the creation o f a regulatory body for the
transport sector as a whole. The component aimed to analyze cross-sectoral issues was
not carried out, however, since the government didnot assign priority to this work.

37.      The project also assistedwith strategic analysis o f the electricity sector, but the
privatization process was stalled for lack o f political support, and the constitutional and
legal reforms (including a proposed Electricity Law) needed to continue the process were
not approved. For similar reasons, the project didnot provide assistance to secondary
petrochemicals.



Outcome

TransportAir Quality

38.      The project's outcome can be divided into : (i)  a "hard" outcome, the reduction in
the level o f air pollution inthe MCMA, and (ii)"soft" outcome, the improvement in
                                                   a
policies, institutions, and information.

39.     Reduction in Air Pollution. Over the period o f the project, the level o f ambient
concentrations of several pollutants declined. The policies andmeasures that ledto this
improvement are discussed later inthis section.

40.     As shown inthe Table 2, vehicular emissions represent the largest source inthe
ambient concentrationo f carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), 98 and 80
percent, respectively. For the other pollutants, vehicular emissions are important, but
represent less than 50 percent o f the total, and inall cases there is one other source that i s
the largest origin o fthe pollutant. Ambient lead, which is not shown inthe table, is
produced exclusively by vehicular emissions. Ozone, also not shown inthe table, is
produced mainly as a combination o fvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), o fwhich
particulate matter less than 10 microns indiameter (PM-10) is a significant component,

                                                10


andNOx. Therefore, emissions o f ozone are also primarilycausedby vehicular
emissions.

41.     As Table 3 shows, the reduction inair pollution, effectedbyproject-supported
measures listed later inthis section, has been impressive for lead and substantial for CO
and ozone. The gains are even more important when consideringthat over the period, the
vehicular fleet and traffic on the M C M A increased significantly. The drop inthe levels o f
sulfur dioxide (SOz), has also beenimpressive, and, while someproject measures helped,
most o f the reduction i s the result of parallel government programs, since SO2 is mainly
generated by industry and other non-vehicular sources.6N o gains were achieved for NOx,
which infact increased duringmost o f the period, although its level dropped considerably
in2001. Also, no gains were achieved for PM10, althoughtotal suspended particles
(including PM-10 and larger particles) decreased by over 60 percent duringthe period.
N o data was available for the hydrocarbons (HC).

42.     The lack o fprogress inreducing the levelo fPMlO is likelydue to emissions from
other sources, and should be reason for concern, since a highlevel o f PMlOs is a main
cause o f air quality-related healthemergencies.

43.       Thereductioninthe ozone level ledto a drop inthe number o f emergencies
declared for highlevels o f air pollution (Table 4). Such emergencies triggered restrictions
to vehicle use inthe MCMA andpreventivehealth measures.

44.      The program for vapor recovery, financed inpartbythe Environmental Trust
Fund, was highlysuccessful, andledto all service stations inthe MCMA installing
modern equipment, with consequent beneficial health impact for service station
personnel, and for residents (especially children and older people) inthe vicinity ofthe
stations.

45.      Performance indicators in the SAR and ICR. As noted earlier, the S A R
performance indicators could not be replicated, nor was there a baseline. The ICR,
however, included two useful indicators relating to ozone andparticulates (PM-10).
Ozone andparticulates are well selected because these pollutants are the most important
interms ofexceeding their standards andbecausethey arethe ones for whichmost
relevanthealth-related information exists.' The ICRdata showed that, regardingozone,
the number ofdaysper year with extreme levels (IMECA 250) hadbeenreduced from 61
in1991to 2 in 1999, those withmoremoderate (IMECA100) hadbeenreducedless (353
in1991decliningto 309 in 1999), andregardingparticulates, that the level ofPM-10had
changed little duringthe period.

closing, should have helped confirm these findings, but the PPARmissionwas unable to

47.     Health impact. Table 5 shows the trend inacute and chronic exposure o fthe
different pollutants, and their health effects. The major reductions (inexceeding norm
values) inNOx, PM-10, lead, and CO were beneficial inreducing acute health effects,
mainly pollution-induced respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses and symptoms.

48.     Improvementsin Policies,Institutions,Information.Various policies
introducedunder the project resulted inmeasures that helpedreduce air pollution. These
included:

    0   Encouraging modernization o fthe vehicle fleet
             o Tax policies to reduce the price differential betweenleaded andunleaded
                  gasoline, therefore favoring newer vehicles usingunleadedgasoline
             o Exemption for modernvehicles from the once-a-week banonvehicle use
                  intheMCMA
             o Replacement policies and financing programs for high-use vehicles (taxis,
                  buses, trucks)
    0   Establishing upgraded emission standards for new vehicles
    0   Upgradingo f inspectiodmaintenance system and expanding testing for CO, HC,
        NOx.

                                                         13


 49.       Project-financedtechnical assistance and experts, includingfrom the Panelo f
 Experts, strengthened the Metropolitan EnvironmentalCommission, notably for planning
 andimplementation. The EnvironmentalTrust Fundwas valuable for buildingup the
 Commission. Important environmental laws and norms were passed under the active
 leadership o f the Commission. A comprehensive air qualityindex (called IMECA, hdice
 Metropolitan0 de Contaminacih Ambiental) was established.

 50.       Progress was made inintegrating transport andair quality with the preparation
 under the project o f a comprehensive report on the subject.' The report was the first
 attempt to integrate sectoral plansintransport and air quality programs inthe
metropolitan area o f the Valley o fMexico. The report made 31recommendations insix
 areas: demand management, road infrastructure, mass transit, vehicle and fuel
technologies, fi-eight transport, and concession o fpublic transport. Most o f the
recommendations were sensible and useful, and some are beingimplemented. However,
given the complexity o f the subject there are still important issues to resolve, notably: (i)
the most effective institutional setup to focus on integrating the two sectors (transport and
air quality); (ii)     selection ofproposed investments, since some showed a negative net
present value; and(iii)        the need to prioritize the pollutants to be further reduced, rather
than givingthem equal weight, as was done by the model usedinthe study.g

51.       The project-financedpilot program for alternative, cleaner fuels was launched,
andmore than 1,000 vehicles (principally police cars and garbage collection vehicles) are
operating with compressed natural gas.

52.       Air quality data improved considerably thanks to the upgradingandexpansiono f
the air quality monitoring network underthe project. This data is madepublic online on a
dailybasis through a Web site, whichis well organizedandkept current. Datais shown
for various pollutants and for different geographic areas within the MCMA. Preparation
o f this PPAR was greatly assisted by information available inthe Web site, including
bimonthly analytical reports and comprehensive annual reports.

Highway Rehabilitation

53.       Road condition. This i s the most important indicator o f outcome. The percentage
o fMexicanfederal highways ingood and fair condition increased from 43 percent at the
time of appraisal in 1994, to 57 percent in1999 as reportedinthe ICR, andto 66 percent
inthe mostrecent surveyin2001. This result is good and shows that fundingfor
maintenance was efficiently utilized, and focused on routine and periodic maintenance.
However, the result i s short o fthe HRRMtarget for 2000: to have 50 percent o f the

treated individual pollutantsequallywith respectto emission reductionpriority. Rather, the focus shouldbe on HC and
NOx, the ozoneprecursors, since ozone exceedsthe air quality standardofthe MCMA by amuch greater marginand
with muchgreaterfrequency than does CO. Further, CO levels are very low.

target would require enough fundingto carry out rehabilitation works on all the very poor
roads as well as on some o f the poor roads. An increase infundingwould be required
even to sustain the current condition of the network."

54.      Itis possible that newregulations onvehicle weights hada small impact on
reducing the number of overloaded trucks on the highways, a major cause o f road
deterioration. The impact should be greater once the system o f weight scales, currently
beinginstalled, is inplace and enforcingthe weight-limit regulations.

55.      Road safety. Improvements made to hazardous locations resulted ina decrease o f
19 percent inthe number o f accidents inthose locations." Further, as a result o f safety
campaigns (twice yearly), more stringent requirements to issue truck driver licenses, and
other measures institutedbythe SCT, the number o f accidents throughout the federal
roadnetwork was reducedby 24 percent. Unfortunately, lack o f data prevents a more
detailed analysis o f the reduction inaccidents, for example, decrease inthe number o f
fatalities and injuries.

56.      Institutional Improvements. Improvements in maintenanceplanning. The ICR
asserts that implementation o f a road management system (SISTER) and a bridge
management system (SIPUMEX) has allowed sectoral authorities to (i)               evaluate the
conditions o f the network, (ii) financial needs on a multiannual basis, and (iii)
                                       forecast
optimize budget allocations. Discussions with highway and central authorities inMexico
duringthe PPARmissionconfirmedthat the SCT has greatly improved its maintenance
management compared to the situation at the start o f the decade. However, the design o f
the management systems was begununder the preceding Second HighwaySector Project
(Loan 2428-Me), and the systems were fully implemented in 1994. Therefore, the project
underreview hadlittle direct effect on improvingthe planning ofmaintenance.

57.      Deconcentration of highway management. A useful outcome supported by the
project's technical assistance was the strengthening o f SCT regional centers, andthe
transfer to them o f responsibilities such as analysis o f unitprices and cost variations,
biddingfor studies, biddingfor maintenance works, and supervision o fworks.

58.      Road maintenance by contract. While under the project the govemment was
committed only to increase the percentage o frehabilitation (to at least 70 percent),
increases were achieved across the board inall categories o fworks. As noted inthe ICR,
by 2000, at least 95 percent o frehabilitation works inthe federal highway system was
carriedby contract. The SCT reported to the PPARmission that in2002, all
rehabilitation, andperiodic as well as routine maintenance works, were carried out under
contract. The SCT further reported that in2002 all the routine maintenance was done
under two-year, output-based contracts. Contracts average 80 kilometers per contract, and
are mostly carried out by microenterprises. These contracts will serve as a useful step
toward the preparation o fperformance-based contracts, which should further increase the
efficiency o f maintenance operations.

59.     Funding mechanismsfor highway maintenance. The project-financed studywas
carried out, but an outcome has yet to emerge. The study proposedcreation o f a Road
Fundthat wouldprovideresources both for the Federalandthe State networks. The
approach recommendedwould achieve two important goals: (i)         establish a reliable
mechanismto provide an adequate level o f funding for maintenance, and (ii)       by
providing funds to state roadnetworks, it would deliver the essential financing to permit
an effective and sustainable decentralization inthe management o f the road network. The
fundingsource recommended inthe studywouldbeuser charges, mainly a gasoline
surcharge. The SHCP is reluctant to endorse this approach, which it sees as a
fragmentation o f fiscal resources. Further, given the political sensitivities involved with
increasing gasoline prices, and legislative elections due in2003, it i s unlikely that any
hrther debate will take place untilat least 2004.

60.     Decentralization: attempt andfailure. While not required under the project, the
government duringthe project implementationperiod launched a highway
decentralization initiative. In1997-98, the SCT signed agreements with 11state
governments for transferring to them responsibility for maintenance o f the respective
secondary roadnetworks, untilthen under the SCT. This initiative was short-lived.
Within one or two years, the SCT, at the request o f all concemed states took back the
responsibility for maintainingthose roads. While this failure illustrates the difficulties
involved with the decentralizationo f the highway system, it also suggests that all the
necessary conditions and tools hadnot beenproperly assessedbefore the initiative was
launched.

Infrastructure Privatization

61.     The ICR's main findings on infrastructure privatization outside transport are
summarized below. The PPARmission found nothing that would cause it to question
these findings.

    a   Significant privatizationwas achievedinbasic telephone services (entry o fmany
        new operators thanks to liberalization), satellites and radio spectrum, andnatural
        gas. However, telephone services were inneed o f substantial further
        improvements (Box 2).

                                                       16


    0   Progress was made inlaying the foundation for privatizing the electric power
        sector (including a strategic study o fthe sector and recommendation on regulatory
        policy) but no privatization has taken place to date.
    0   Practically no progress was made under the cross-sectoral component o f the
        project, covering the privatization framework, the regulatory framework, and the
        general business environment for private participation ininfrastructure.


Box 2.Telephone Services: Key Indicators and Challenges

Documentation for a joint government-World Bank seminar in Mexico in April 2002 on
privatization o f infrastructure, complemented by PPAR mission discussions, provide insights
regardingthe situation with telephone services:

0   Main fixed lines had more than doubled over 10 years to 1999. However, at 11 lines per
    100,000 inhabitants, this was still low, compared to 20 in Argentina, 15 in Brazil, and 19 in
    Chile.
0   In contrast, the number of pay phones (at 3 per 1,000 inhabitants) was comparable to
    Argentina and Brazil, the highest inLatinAmerica.
0   Productivity remained low, at 179 lines per employee, compared to about 300 or more in
    Argentina and Chile.
0   Mobile phone service has increased dramatically, and, in its pre-paid modality, i s affordable
    by low incomepeople who do notneedto commit to monthly payments.
0   A challenge is to improve COFETEL, the Federal Commission for Telecommunications.
    While COFETEL i s competent and well staffed, some o f its procedures are neither
    transparent nor open. This happens especially with regard to pricing, where regulations are
    developed in secret bilateral negotiations on a case-by-case basis, instead o f open rule-
    malung procedures involvingall concerned stakeholders.

Transport

62.     Outcome on railway and airport privatizationprocess i s discussed below. The
project also intendedto assist the ports, but this didnot take place, since the restructuring
and launching privatizationo f the Mexico's port system was well advanced during
project preparation

63.     Transport regulatory agency. The study carried out under the project proposed
creation o f a Transport Regulatory Commission. While the government appeared to
approve the idea inprinciple, it was not implemented due to administrative and fiscal
constraints, namely resistance to the creation o f a new government entity. The current
administration appears to take the same view. Onthe other hand, central and sectoral
regulatory mechanisms do exist, such as the Federal Commission on Competitiveness
(FCC) and the SCT. The SCT's key regulatory roles have to do with provision o f
passenger services and with tariffs. This regulatory system, although a mix o f
independent (FCC, created in 1994 at the start o f privatizations) and non-independent
(SCT) regulatory agencies has worked reasonablywell, andhas provided an avenue for

                                                         17


resolving conflicts among services providers and/or between providers and clients to be
resolved.


Railways

64.        Practically the whole Mexican railway system(Ferrocarriles Nacionales de
Mexico, FNM) was privatized with assistanceo fproject-financed studies and technical
assistance (strategy formulation, asset valuation, financial advisors, Mexico city railway
concept). Based on the privatization process and performance o f the railway system to
date, the privatization o fFNMi s likely the biggest success ininfrastructure privatization
inMexico.

65.        Theprocess. Followingthe amendment to the MexicanConstitution inFebruary
1995,allowing participation o fprivate operators inmanagingthe railways, a project-
financed study reviewed restructuring and privatization options. The study recommended
creation ofthree large trunk freight lines and a railway terminal inMexico Valley to
provide connections among the lines." The study also recommendedcreation of short
line concessions for lightly usedbranch lines. Internationalbids basedwere called
startingin 1996.

trunk railways and the federal government.

67.        Operational results. Performance improved inall aspects (Table 7). Traffic
increased, equipment was better utilized, safety increased dramatically, quality o f service
improved substantially, and all concessionaires are generating income that covers
operatingcosts. Inaddition, concessionaires have carried out major investments.




12. The study rejectedthe option, followed in anumber of Europeanrailways, of separatingownership of infrastructure
and trains as unnecessarily complex.

68.        Avoidance of negativepublic perceptions. The privatization o fthe railways
managedto avoid negative public perceptions that have plaguedprivatization, especially
of infrastructure, inMexico and other Latin American ~0untries.l~                    This was accomplished
through the following:

     0     Theprivatization process: The process was transparent, with a clear criterion for
           selection o f concessionaire (net payment to government) andrenegotiation o f the
           concessions (common inrailway privatization inother countries) has not taken
           place.
           Compliance with commitments: Concessionaires have improved efficiency and
           carried out investments as expected.
     0     Passenger service: before privatization, FNM's passenger service was minimal.
           After privatization, for the few lines inoperation, SCT pays a subsidy under a
           Public Service Obligation (PSO) approach to private operators to runservices at
           low rates to isolatedcommunities. Such service is not discontinued untilroads
           being built by SCT allow market-based provision o froad transport services at
           affordable rates (Box 3). In2002, five routes received govemment subsidy.
     0     Protection of FNMstaff: Closing of FNMwas negotiatedwith FNM's staff and
           there were no strikes. Retirement o fredundant staff was advanced up to five
           years.
           Safer operations: Accidents, with and without loss o f life, have been substantially
           reduced.
           Ensuring competition: CFC, the national regulatory agency, has taken a strong
           stance, for example, denying mergers between concessionaires that could threaten



13. According to a 2001 poll by Latinbarometro, 50 percent of Mexicans and 63 percent of Latin Americans oppose
privatization. Cited on World Bank intranet (March 10,2003) presenting a seminar, prepared by the Bank's Latin
America region, labeled "Rethinlung Privatization: A Soul Searching Exercise."

                                                       19


          competitiveness.l4At the same time, while tariffs are unregulated, operators must
          publish them, and the SCT retains the power (which it has occasionally exercised)
          to refuse approval for publication.
      0   Open channels of communication: SCT organizes regular, frequent (twice a
          month in2001) meetingswith participationby a broad range o f stakeholders
          (providers, clients, academics, industry, NGOs) to discuss railway services.



Box 3. Policy Regarding Rail Passenger Service

SCT policy regarding rail passenger services can be described as prudent social protection. It
consists of:

0    Where no alternative road service exists, retain rail passenger service at highly subsidized
     rates. Passengers pay 60 pesos for 300 kilometers, while government provides the rail
     operator a subsidy o f 1,200 pesos per passenger.
0    For comparison, road transport rate for similar distance i s 120 pesos, and service i s faster and
     with higher frequency.
0    SCT launches construction o fparallel road.
0    When roadbuilt,rail service frequency initially i s reduced.
0    Thereafter, rail service i s suspended.
0    If community reaction to suspension of rail service too strong, subsidized rail service is
     restored.



Airports

69.       The Airport Law approved in 1995 made it possible to involve private companies
inthe management ofMexico's airports. Studies andtechnical assistance financedunder
the project, covering the regulatory system for the airports to be privatized, and including
economic and financial analysis, were instrumental inthe design o f the government
program to concession airports. To date, muchprogress has been achieved with
implementing the program.

70.       Thepvocess. The privatization design, laid out inthe Airport Development Master
Plan, called for identification of airports to beprivatized, and grouped them into
concession packages. Some 35 airports were identified. Privatizationwas to be carried
out infour concession packages, under a two-stage process. Inthe first stage, the strategic
partner wouldbe selected (the private investor, with international experience inairport
management), andwould hold 15 percent o fthe concession equity, with the government
retaining the remaining 85 percent. Inthe second stage, the 85 percent is offered to the
public. The strategic partner is responsible from the first stage for the operating, financial,
investment, commercial, andmarketing functions, as well as training andtransfer o f
technology. For each airport, the Master Plan established a compulsory investment




14. For example, as reportedinEL ECONOMISTA.COM.MX of December 10,2002, the CFC hadjust issuedaruling
refusingauthorizationfor the mergingofthe operatorsof the Pacifico-Norteand Sureste concessionaires.

                                                       20


program for the first five years o f operations, which included safety requirements, and an
indicative plan for the following five years.

71.        Concessions are subject to tariff regulations consisting o f a price-cap, with
adjustment for increases inefficiency, inflation, and for investment program additions
andmodifications. This tariffregulation is similar to the classic UnitedKingdommethod
o fprice cap. However, as applied to airports, the Mexican tariff approach i s different, in
that the regulation is limitedto the aeronautical services, while charges to commercial
services (landside) are unregulated. This system appears to be efficient, although there
have been complaints from airlines that charges for some services have gone up too much
and are out o fproportion with airports inother countries. At least one o f the groups has
agreed to reduce airport charges. However, airports not concessioned, managed bythe
government's Airports and Auxiliary Services, appear to have higher rates than those
managed by concessions. A review conducted by SCT concluded that Mexico's airports
were competitive, neither too expensive nor too cheap, when the services were properly
compared.

72.        Theconcessions. To date, three airport packages" have proceeded through the
first phase (Table 8). Altogether, these airports carried some 37 million passengers in
2001,accounting for 65 percent o f all Mexico airport movements. The second phase,
when privatization would be completed for these packages, has been deferred until
domestic and intemational economic prospects improve. Processing o f the fourth
package, the Mexico City airport, has not started the first phase, mainly because SCT's
preferred approach, the construction a completely new, privately operated airport, costing
an estimated $2.8 billion, has beenplaguedby controversy andnegative reactionbythe
area neighborhoods. Private investors are unlikely to bid untilthe government provides
assurancethat the new terminal would comply with all necessary environment and social
analysis.

relatedinvestments that government claims have proceededon schedule. Implementation
o f the secondphase, that is, sale of government 85 percent equity to the public, i s well

 Ratings

 Outcome

 74.       TransportAir Quality. Outcome is ratedsatisfactory. The project relevance was
 highandefficacy was satisfactory, since most project components were completed.
 Because there were no baseline performance indicators, no valid comparison canbe
 made, for example, of gains inreducingvehicular emissions relative to expectations.
 However, the project achieved substantial reductions inambient concentrationfor three
 pollutants, there was no change inthe level o f two other pollutants, and there was no data
 on another. Efficiency cannot be assessed, since the project provided no indication o fthe
 investments' economic retum, cost-effectiveness, or other measures o f efficiency.
 Measuring efficiency inthe reduction o fvehicular air pollution is difficult, and study
 methodologies are still experimental. One such study suggests that efficiency would have
 been high.16

 75.       Highway rehabilitation. Outcome i s rated satisfactory.While preserving road
 assets, and improving their management, was a relevant objective, the limited
 institutional objectives meant that relevance was modest. Yet, the other two dimensions
 o f outcome, efficacy and efficiency deserve a highrating: (i)               efficacy, because physical
targets were mostly achieved or surpassed androad condition overall improved, and (ii)
 efficiency, because the median unit cost o f works was 61 percent lower than appraisal
estimates, and the economic rate o fretum, as a result o f lower-than-estimated costs and
hightraffic levels, was estimated at 119percent for all sections (which compares to an
ERRo f 80 percent for a sample o froads inthe SAR).

76.       Infrastructure Privatization TA.Outcome is rated satisfactory. Privatization o f
infrastructure was a relevant government objective that stemmed from poor and declining
performance o fmany infrastructure services, poor quality o f service to infrastructure
clients, andneed to improve the fiscal situation. Efficacy i s rated satisfactory, since
significant assistance was provided infive o f the eight sectors targeted, and some more
limited assistancewas provided for another (electricity). Significant "real" outcomes
were reached inmost sectors where assistance was provided, since muchprogress was
made inadvancingprivatization. Insome sectors, such as railways, assistance ledto a
privatizationprocess that has proven a big success by any standard. Efficiency i s
considered satisfactory, since substantially fewer resources were usedto carry out the




16.This is not acriticism ofthe SAR. Economicanalysis of air quality improvementsis highly complex.The Bank
report Policy Research WorkingPaper 2785, cited earlier, estimates that reducingozone andPM-10by 10percent in
Mexico City would yield healthbenefits(avoidedillness andprematuremortality as well as reducedproductivity
losses) valuedat $760millionlyear.

 project, inpart because a good mix o f national and intemational experts allowed to
 reduce project costs.


 Institutional Development

 77.     TransportAir Quality. Institutional development is rated substantial. The
Metropolitan Environmental Commission was strengthened. The Commission led
preparation o f the 1995-2000 program to improve air quality inthe Valley o f Mexico
 (PRO-Am). Integrationoftransport andair quality was advanced bythe preparation o f
 a comprehensive report on the topic, and the broad discussions it spurred among
concerned agencies. Environmental laws and regulations were modernized, and norms on
air quality were established. Data collection and information on air quality was greatly
improved and made transparent to everyone through a well organizedWeb site.

78.     Highway Rehabilitation. Institutional development i s rated modest. The main
institutional gains cited inthe ICR, improvement inthe planningandmanagement o f
maintenance, was mainly the result o f activities financed under the precedingBank
highway project. While the SCT expanded maintenance undercontract for all types o f
works, the most valuable achievements were for periodic and especially routine
maintenance. Yet, the project only hadtargets for roadrehabilitation works. The target
was modest, 70 percent, considering that most comparable countries have long carried
out all rehabilitation o fthe national network under contract. Inthe case o f contracting, as
well as inother areaswhere the management o fthe road sector improved, supervision
reports anddiscussions duringPPAR preparationwith Mexican officials suggest that the
Bank team made a significant contribution inideas and knowledge o f international
experience. Yet, the rating o f institutional development i s based on the project's actual
achievements.

79.     Infrastructure Privatization TA. Institutional development is rated substantial.
The privatizationand structural reforms supported by the project were substantive and led
to more competition inseveral sectors.


Sustainability

80.     TransportAir Quality.Sustainability i s rated likely. Most o fthe project gains,
especially the measures taken to reduce vehicular emissions are irreversible, such as the
vapor recovery systems installed inservice stations, the vehicle inspection system, and
the renewalandretrofitting o fvehicles. The institutional set up, althoughit couldbe
improved, i s working reasonably well, and is unlikely to be dismantled. The
Environmental Trust Fundis probably unsustainable, since it is likely to be discontinued
after current funds runout. This may make it more difficult to finance future
environmental activities, but it should not negate gains under the project.

81.     Highway Rehabilitation. Sustainability i s non-evaluable. While road condition
improved over the project period, it was achievedthrough an effective allocation o f
resources that gave highpriority to routine maintenance inthe last years o f the project.
This approach cannot be continued indefinitely, andmore fimding for periodic
maintenance andrehabilitation will be required ifa new cycle o f road deterioration is to

                                               23


be avoided. Maintenance funding overall was a third less than originally targeted (and
probably two-thirdsbelow requirements according to one study)." There are no clear
ways to assess the risks that the required funding levels may not be provided inthe
future.The government under anongoinghighwayproject, is committed to provide
adequate funding for maintenance, and appears to be complying. Onthe other hand, the
government has deferred debate on recommendations for establishing a stable mechanism
for funding road maintenance. The modest institutional improvements are likely to be
sustained, although the maintenance planningmodel, SISTER (which i s based on visual
rather than instrument-recordedroad data), i s now considered obsolete and introduction
of more sophisticated models i s being considered.

82.     Infrastructure Privatization TA. Sustainabilityis ratedlikely on two counts. First,
overall, the quality o f advice provided under the project was highlyprofessional,
reflected frontier knowledgeininfrastructureprivatization and was well adapted to
Mexico, again thanks to the well-organized teams o f foreign andnational experts.
Second, the design o f the privatizationprocess, andits implementation, has been
successful. While small adjustments to the current privatization frameworks are likely to
occur, there are no obvious signals suggesting that substantive reversals could happen.

Bank Performance

83.     As notedinthe CAE,the value ofBankprojects inMexico depends greatly on the
qualityo fknowledge transfer they effect. While the Bankhadlittle expertise directly
available inthe field o f transport air quality, the project team managedto make available
for Mexico an impressive amount o f expertise via consultants that helped designthe
project andthrough the Panel o f Experts that accompanied the project during
implementation. Inthe highwayrehabilitationproject, the Bank assigned some o f its most
senior personnel, and their dedication andknowledge was praised particularly inregards
to their work with field offices o f the SCT. However, the Bank would have had a much
greater impact had the project covered states inaddition to the federal governments, since
the SCT has highlyqualified staff, which is not the case inmost ofthe states. Knowledge
transfer under the infrastructure privatizationproject was significant, largelybecause the
Bank allocated to this project highlyknowledgeable staff, with worldwide experience in
privatization, as required to deal with a country o f Mexico's sophistication. The project
team helped sectoral agencies prepare terms o f reference and identify top-quality
consultants for invitation to the various technical assistance tasks

84.     TransportAir Quality. Bankperformance is rated satisfactory. The Bankteam
prepareda highlycomplex andinnovative project that later served as a model for similar
projects inother countries. However, the project design had drawbacks: it lackeduseful
performance indicators, incorrectly formulated project cost, and reflected an inadequate
understanding o f the administrative difficulties insetting up the Environmental Trust
Fund(that delayed project effectiveness). Bank staffcontinuity throughout the project
cycle was remarkable, facilitating the dialogue and credibility with Mexican authorities

                                             24


 and counterparts. During supervision, the Bank team responded flexibly andrapidly
when required.

 85.     Highway Rehabilitation. Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The
preoccupation with efficient allocation o fhighwayfbnding was correct. The modest
institutional development objectives were, as implied by the SAR, the limit o fwhat could
be agreed with the government at the time. Duringimplementation, the Bank team took a
broader view and supported the efforts to decentralize management o fthe network.
Supervision missions were detailed. A supervisionmissionpreventedduplication o f
efforts at the SCT, when it detected that SCT's maintenance department was launching
development o f a geographic information system (GIs), a task that had already been
undertakenby SCT's Mexican Transport Institute and essentially completed. The Bank
team was at fault, however, inthe preparationo f an ICR that had incomplete data on the
cost o f the project.

86.      Infrastructure Privatization TA.Bankperformance i s rated satisfactory.
Preparation and appraisal were comprehensive, andhelpedwith the design o f legal
changes that were essential to implement the reforms andprivatization sought. The broad
sectoral coverage was justified, with the possible exception o fports, since there was
evidence at appraisal that the process was too advanced to require support from the
project. Inclusion o f electricity andpetrochemicals, probably the most politically
sensitive, was worth the effort, since they were highrisk, but also highreward. The
PPAR concurs with the ICR that given that Interministerial Commission on Privatization
(CID) didnot take the centralrole initially expected, it was appropriate for the
supervision missions to deal directly with the line ministries.

Borrower Performance

87.      Transport Air Quality. Borrower performance is ratedsatisfactory. The borrower
(NAFIN)andthe concemedfederal andstate agencies took strong ownership o fthe
project and worked closely with Bank staff inthe preparation and appraisal o f the project.
Despite delays inimplementing components due to fundingproblems, most were
implemented. Emission standards, the inspection system, andthe vehicle registration
system were installedwith little delays. Some organizational problems didoccur,
however, especially allocation o froles betweenNAFINand BANOBRAS, and there
were delays inproviding resources and inpreparing audit reports by the various
implementing agencies.

88.     Highway Rehabilitation. Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory. The
borrower andthe executing agencies took ownership of the project, from preparation
through implementation. Yet, overall funding for maintenance was less than targeted, in
partbecause ofthe 1994/95 fiscal crisis andits ripple effects. Allocation o fresources
with focus onmaintenance rather thanrehabilitation was correct, andphysicaltargets
were essentially achieved. Onthe whole, the ICR gives highmarks to the implementing
agency. The PPAR, however, finds that (i)   intemal coordination could have beenbetter,
as illustratedby the GIS issue noted above under Bank performance, and (ii)    project
records were not satisfactory, since the SCT's maintenancedivision was unable to

                                              25


provide the PPAR missionbasic data about the project cost at completion (inthe simple
cost table format o fthe SAR), which was lacking inthe ICR.

89.     Infrastructure Privatization TA.Borrower performance i s ratedsatisfactory. The
constitutional and legal changes made, some duringpreparation and some during
implementation, to permitprivatizationo f infrastructure, were remarkable, and showed a
strong ownership o fproject objectives. While CID maynot haveprovided the central role
that was expected as a project coordinating agency, it didprovide essential strategic
guidance for the privatization process, while leaving each sector to adopt an appropriate
privatization framework. The fact that, compared to most other countries where similar
privatization of infrastructurehas been launched, Mexico's program hadrelatively little
negative reaction from the major stakeholders attests to good design and good
implementation. As noted earlier, concessioning o f FNMdeserves to be considered a big
success, and continuing SCT attention to railway services, including frequent meetings
with a broad spectrum o fstakeholders hasbeenan importantvehicle to ensure that the
privatized operations remain competitive andprovide satisfactory service.



Lessons

Transport Air Quality

90,     An externalpanel o freputable, international experts to provide advice andreview
duringimplementationis especiallyuseful for projects addressing new areas, where
several sectoral agencies and levels o f governments needto be coordinated, andwhere
external experts can provide credible andunbiased recommendations on sensitive
matters.

91.     Muchprogress can be achieved inreducing the impact of road transport on air
quality through a combination ofpublic andprivate sector measures, startingwith an
adequate systemo f incentives put inplace by federal and state governments.


Highway Rehabilitation

92.     Decentralization in the management of the highway network, while generally
advisable especially inlarge countries, i s bound to fail ifrequisite conditions are not
obtained. Critical among these are ensuring that local governments receive adequate
finding corresponding to their new responsibilities for highway maintenance, andthat
they have the required expertise to manage the roadnetwork.

93.     Allocation of highway maintenancefunds optimizes outcome (measured as
condition o fthe network) when finding i s used for routine andperiodic maintenancein
preference over rehabilitation. However, this approach i s only valid for a few years, and
unless finding levels are increased to allow rehabilitation works to proceed, the condition
o fthe roadnetwork i s likely to worsen.

Infrastructure Privatization

94.    Infrastructure privatization, to gainpublic acceptance, requires as necessary (but
not always sufficient) conditions, a transparent privatization process, compliance with
commitments byprivate operators, and government provision o f social protection to users
o fnon-commercial services and to staff made redundant

95.    Establishing a regulatovyframework for the infrastructure sectordenterprises to
beprivatized should be considered early on inthe design o fthe privatizationprocess,
together with an assessment o f the capacity o f existing agencies with regulatory
functions, incase fiscal and administrative constraints make it politically impossible to
create new regulatory bodies.

    0   The number ofthe project onpage 1of Background is incorrect, it says 3623-

    0   We suggest that future reports bepresented separately, that is, per project, so
        as to allow a more expeditious review by the executing body.

    It is worth notingthat these commentswere sent to you be email of June 6,2003.
