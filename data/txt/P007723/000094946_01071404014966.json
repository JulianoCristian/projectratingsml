project outcome was, therefore, satisfactory.\n            Project sustainability is likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated satisfactory overall.\n            Lessons learned included the following: Although Mexico\n            suffered one of its most severe economic crises, the\n            Government decided to cut allocations for new construction\n            and thus concentrate funds available for maintenance of the\n            existing network--evidencing the Government's\n            commitment towards the project's objectives. The\n            project was fully satisfactory in introducing major changes\n            in institutional arrangements. These results were the\n            culmination of a long-term relationship between the Bank and\n            the country, with continuity of the Bank's staff\n            dedicated to Mexico, and enough time to prepare the project.\n            Planning for the use of resources should be based on\n            economic analysis that identifies the optimal choices of\n            road sections to be improved and the type of works to be\n            carried out, through the use of computerized road management\n            systems. Contracting of maintenance on a competitive basis\n            improves efficiency compared to force account operations; it\n            should be used for all routine maintenance and periodic\n            maintenance when there is sufficient knowledge regarding how\n            this can be done. A good design is important in a program\n            like this, in order to maximize the likelihood of a positive\n            output, and get sufficient experience to progressively\n            implement maintenance contracts based on performance."}, "docdt": "2001-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
