The three\n            projects addressed different, but important dimensions of\n            Mexico's transport sector, and, all three projects\n            largely achieved their objectives, despite significant\n            initial implementation problems in the case of the air\n            quality, and the highway projects. Three lessons emerge from\n            these operations. First, much progress can be achieved in\n            reducing the impact of road transport on air quality,\n            through a combination of public and private sector measures,\n            starting with an adequate system of incentives, put in place\n            by federal, and state governments. Second, allocation of\n            highway maintenance funding optimizes outcome, when\n            preference is given to routine, and periodic maintenance\n            over rehabilitation, but network condition is bound to\n            deteriorate if funding for rehabilitation is not made\n            available. Third, regarding infrastructure privatization\n            ,and in order to gain public acceptance, requires as\n            necessary (but not always sufficient) conditions, a\n            transparent privatization process, compliance with\n            commitments by private operators, and government provision\n            of social protection to users of non-commercial services,\n            and to staff made redundant."}, "docdt": "2003-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
