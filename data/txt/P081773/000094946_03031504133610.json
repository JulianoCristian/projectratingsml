{"cdata!": "The Emergency Drought Recovery Project\n            in Ethiopia, will enable the Government to help affected\n            families survive the emergency, retain productive assets,\n            and develop sustainable livelihoods, and in addition, will\n            contribute to stabilizing the macro-economy. Main project\n            outcomes will contribute to defend critical human\n            development expenditure by the Government during the first\n            year of the crisis; maintain the availability of critical\n            economic inputs (particularly in rural areas), and support\n            the economic recovery process; rehabilitate and create\n            communal assets, using community labor within affected\n            populations; and, provide income supplements, and protect\n            private assets of affected populations. The main indicator\n            of project impact would be reduced levels of out-migration\n            of affected families from their homes. While the project\n            will undoubtedly assist drought-affected populations through\n            cash inputs, and macroeconomic stabilization, risks include\n            weak management capacity, particularly at the community\n            levels, which as stipulated, the use of existing, simple\n            systems will be used to reach communities, and improve\n            program impacts. Moreover, taking into consideration that\n            the dependence on food aid among rural communities in food\n            insecure areas, may be deepened, project aid in the\n            provision of income, and infrastructure development, should\n            support regeneration of productive assets."}, "docdt": "2003-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
