Emergency Drought Recovery Project
The Emergency Drought Recovery Project in Ethiopia, will enable the Government to help affected families
survive the emergency, retain productive assets, and develop sustainable livelihoods, and in addition, will
contribute to stabilizing the macro-economy. Main project outcomes will contribute to defend critical human
development expenditure by the Government during the first year of the crisis; maintain the availability of
critical economic inputs (particularly in rural areas), and support the economic recovery process; rehabilitate
and create communal assets, using community labor within affected populations; and, provide income
supplements, and protect private assets of affected populations.
The main indicator of project impact would be reduced levels of out-migration of affected families from their homes. While
the project will undoubtedly assist drought-affected populations through cash inputs, and macroeconomic stabilization, risks
include weak management capacity, particularly at the community levels, which as stipulated, the use of existing, simple
systems will be used to reach communities, and improve program impacts. Moreover, taking into consideration that the
dependence on food aid among rural communities in food insecure areas, may be deepened, project aid in the provision of
income, and infrastructure development, should support regeneration of productive assets
