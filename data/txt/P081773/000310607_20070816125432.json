     Drought Recovery Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: 1) A clear results structure\n            is critical to facilitate effective project implementation,\n            monitoring and evaluation; 2) the community-driven\n            implementation approach has helped in significantly building\n            up local community capacities for project identification,\n            planning, and implementation; 3) there is a need to\n            proactively consider larger than normal limits to authorized\n            allocations in order to facilitate flow of funds in\n            quick-disbursing emergency projects; and 4) it is critical\n            to establish a robust monitoring and evaluation system,\n            including arrangements for data collection and use, during\n            the project design process."}, "docdt": "2007-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
