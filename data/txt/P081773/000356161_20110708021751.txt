                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Emergency Drought
Recovery Project (IDA Grant H0280-ET) for which an amount of SDR 43.5 million
(US$60.00 million equivalent) was approved in March 2003 to address the 2002/03
drought emergency.

The project became effective on May 30, 2003 and closed on December 31, 2006. The
report presents findings based on review of the project‘s implementation completion
report, program paper, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant material. In
addition, an IEG mission to Ethiopia in February-March 2011, made field visits and held
discussions with government officials and agencies, project staff, beneficiaries, key
donors, and academia.

The assessment has a two-fold purpose: (i) an accountability purpose to assess the project
to verify that the Bank intervention has achieved its intended outcome; (ii) a learning
purpose to draw lessons of experience to help inform future engagement in this area.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
Government of Ethiopia for comments. None were received.

Summary
Ethiopia is one of the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world. Between five to
seven million Ethiopians suffer from chronic food insecurity, and devastating recurrent
droughts greatly increase the number facing transitional food insecurity at any given
time. The economy is dependent on rain-fed agriculture and when there is insufficient
water to meet crop requirements because of erratic or failed rains, as often happens in
Ethiopia, harvests fail and droughts occur. Ethiopia has experienced at least five major
droughts since 1980 and several local ones. Droughts have been responsible for keeping a
large percentage of the Ethiopian population in poverty, constantly defeating efforts at
poverty alleviation and growth. The occurrence of a single drought is capable of
stagnating or even reversing overall economic growth achieved over a decade.

In 2002 Ethiopia experienced a major drought that affected about 44 percent of the
country. The failure of short term rains (belg) that year, followed by a prolonged dry spell
between the short and the main rains (meher) created severe food insecurity for millions
of Ethiopians. Following a joint Government/donor mission that assessed the severity of
the food insecurity in the country, the Prime Minister launched an appeal to the
international community for assistance in averting a humanitarian crisis. The Emergency
Drought Recovery Project (henceforth EDRP) emerged as one response.

The EDRP was a US$60 million IDA grant whose objective was to assist the Borrower in
responding to the drought emergency and enable it to help the affected families survive
the emergency, retain productive assets, and develop sustainable livelihoods, put in place
infrastructure and support mechanisms to mitigate the medium term effects of current and
future drought emergencies of vulnerable groups, and stabilize the macro-economy.
Almost 75 percent of the grant was for a quick-disbursing component to stabilize the
macro-economy by reducing the fiscal deficit and providing foreign exchange to support
the import of essential items on a positive list. The Birr equivalent of the quick-
disbursing amount was to be allocated for food security initiatives and human
development programs being implemented throughout the country. About 25 percent of
the grant was to support activities in 35 drought affected woredas (districts) in six regions
for improving coping capabilities, helping the affected population protect their assets and
recover their productive capacity.

US$12 million retroactive financing for imports was made on July 15, 2003 from the
quick-disbursing component after effectiveness and the balance from that component was
disbursed between Nov. 2003 and January 2004.

The project objectives were highly relevant to the emergency conditions. There were,
however, weaknesses in project design. The counterpart resources released from the
financing of essential imports through the quick-disbursing component were to be
allocated for food security initiatives and human development programs. However, there
was no agreement on which specific programs would be supported through the
counterpart equivalent of quick-disbursing funds, no expenditure targets for such
programs were agreed upon and no mechanisms were put in place to monitor their
contribution towards achieving two of the three project goals was. That said, national
expenditures on vulnerability and food security increased significantly between 2002/03
                                           viii


and 2003/04 and the quick-disbursing component may have contributed to this increase.
An IFPRI study found a significant impact of participation in the Government
Employment Generation Scheme and the Gratuitous Relief Program on growth in food
consumption. Increased government spending on key human development programs may
also have been facilitated by the quick-disbursing component. While difficult to isolate
the project‘s impact, as its resources were part of a larger stabilization support package
offered by donors, inflation did come down in the post 2003 period and real GDP growth
also came back from being negative in 2003 to 9.8 percent in 2004.

When the project was approved in 2003, it was anticipated that the community
intervention component would complement the relief and recovery efforts of the
government and other donors by providing cash and technical expertise, to increase the
development impact of community works paid for with food aid. However, instead of
putting the resources towards these programs, the project design provided for support of
separate sub-projects that used a community-driven development (CDD) approach in
which the regional and woreda officials had limited experience.

The implementation of the community interventions component was slow and
constrained by several factors such as poor working conditions in the project
management unit, staffing issues, inadequate understanding of the CDD approach among
government staff and communities and overlap with other activities at the regional and
woreda levels. Both M&E and financial monitoring were very weak and inadequate
documentation and poor record keeping was a common problem, and this component put
an additional implementation and reporting burden on the Government officials who
were as it is stretched during an emergency. Ultimately, though, the sub-projects financed
under the component did help improve local infrastructure, generate income and help
introduce improved soil and water management which could help beneficiary
communities better cope with medium term effects of the drought as well as future
droughts. On balance this assessment rates overall project outcome as moderately
satisfactory.

While the responsiveness of the Bank to the request for support from the Government for
the drought emergency is commendable, Bank performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory, due to the design weaknesses, lack of follow-up on the quick disbursing
component during supervision, inadequate reflection of implementation difficulties in
Implementation Status and Results (ISR) ratings and failure to notice a safeguard
violation. Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory due to fiduciary
weaknesses and a safeguards violation. Risk to development outcome is rated moderate.

Building on the project experience this assessment identifies three major lessons:

      Clearly identifying which specific programs will be supported with counterpart
       equivalent of balance of payment support, agreeing on expenditure, output and
       outcome targets and monitoring their progress is important if balance of payment
       support is expected to contribute to achievement of Project Development
       Objectives.
      An emergency response intervention may not be best suited to use innovative
       approaches for project implementation.
                                        ix


   Stronger Management oversight in ensuring that persistent and significant
    weaknesses in implementation are actually reflected in the ratings of ISRs is
    essential for ISRs to actually serve as a meaningful management tool.

1. Country and Project Context
Country Context
1.1     Ethiopia is one of the poorest1 and most vulnerable countries in the world and food
insecurity defined as the "lack of access to sufficient food for an active healthy life"2 has long
plagued the country's poor. Between five to seven million Ethiopians suffer from chronic3
food insecurity and devastating recurrent droughts, that occur every few years, lead to wide
variations in the number of those facing transitional or acute4 food insecurity at any given
time.5 Ethiopia is one of the world's largest recipients of food aid which bridges the gap
between available food supply and demand. Food aid has averaged about 700,000 metric tons
(MTs) annually over the past ten years (IFPRI 2007).

1.2     The economy is dependent on rain-fed agriculture6 and when there is insufficient
water to meet crop requirements because of erratic or failed rains, as often happens in
Ethiopia, harvests fail and droughts occur. Ethiopia has experienced at least five major
droughts since 1980 and several local ones (UNDP 2007). Droughts have been responsible
for keeping a large percentage of the Ethiopian population in poverty (Table 1), constantly
defeating efforts at poverty alleviation and growth. Survey data show that between 1999 and
2004, more than half of all households in the country experienced at least one major drought
shock (UNDP 2007). The occurrence of even a single drought is capable of stagnating or
even reversing overall economic growth achieved over a decade (IGAD/ICPAC 2007). In
fact, correlation between economic growth and rainfall variability is high in Ethiopia (Figure

 At US$350, Ethiopia's /capita income is significantly lower than the Sub-Saharan African average of
US$1,077 in FY 2009 (GNI, Atlas Method).

2 This shorter definition is derived from the following longer one: ―The commonly accepted definition of food
security is—when all people, at all times have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe, and
nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.‖ World Bank
2007b.
3 Chronic food insecurity arises because of the inability of poor people to produce or purchase sufficient
sustenance. In Ethiopia part of the challenge of chronic food insecurity emerges because of the subsistence
nature of the agriculture sector in the country.
4 Transitional or acute food insecurity arises due to catastrophic events such as droughts or food price increase.
5 The country has a tropical monsoon climate that is characterized by wide topographic-induced variations.
With highly erratic rainfall, Ethiopia is usually at a high risk for droughts as well as intra-seasonal dry spells
(von Braun and Olofinbiyi 2007). An agricultural drought occurs when water supply is insufficient to cover
crop or livestock water requirements (FAO 1996).
6 Agriculture is the major sector accounting for about 40 percent of Ethiopia‘s GDP, 85 percent of employment
and 90 percent of exports. The Government has prioritized the sector‘s development through its agricultural
development-led industrialization (ADLI) strategy that emphasizes national food self-sufficiency and
development through the acceleration of agricultural growth driven by the commercialization of smallholder
production and stronger linkages with Ethiopia‘s emerging industrial sector (Spielman and other 2009).
However, despite all the emphasis on the sector‘s development in the last two decades overall agricultural
productivity continues to be low, agriculture is largely rain-fed and Ethiopia‘s significant water resources
remain largely unexploited.

  1). The country‘s extremely low levels of hydraulic infrastructure and limited water
  resources management capacity undermine attempts at managing rainfall variability (World
  Bank 2006a).

  1.1     When droughts occur, problems associated with shortage of water are exacerbated by
  deforestation, soil erosion, and inappropriate land use (IEG 2006). Land degradation in
  Ethiopia has worsened over the years as the rapidly increasing population has put tremendous
  stress on the country‘s natural resource endowments and extensive agriculture has increased
  the pressure on fragile and marginal lands resulting in soil loss, mining of soil nutrients and
  deforestation (World Bank 2007).

  1.2    Though several bilateral and multilateral donors are active, the World Bank has been
  a key development partner for Ethiopia and has provided considerable support to the country
                                                     3


overtime.7 Over the years, emergency support for drought relief has been provided through
several projects: following the 1973/74 drought the Drought Areas Rehabilitation Project (Cr.
485); following the 1982/84 drought the Drought Recovery Program (Cr. 1576); and most
recently, following the 2002/2003 drought the Emergency Drought Recovery Project
(henceforth EDRP) (IDA-H0280). The latter project is the subject of this assessment.

    Project Context
1.3     In 2002 Ethiopia was hit by one of the worst famines the country has experienced.
The failure of short term rains (belg) in February-March of that year in the northern and
central parts of Ethiopia, followed by a prolonged dry spell between the short and the main
rains (meher) created severe food insecurity for millions of people in the country. About 44
percent of the country was affected by the drought and some traditionally food surplus
woredas (districts) suffered from rainfall irregularity and uneven distribution. Box 1 shows
the regional impact of the drought. The drought affecting Ethiopia in that year was part of a
regional pattern as there was delayed onset and deficient rain in other neighboring countries
as well: Eritrea, Sudan, Uganda, and parts of Kenya (USAID 2002). Both Malawi and
Zambia also experienced droughts in 2001/2002 which led to widespread starvation and
malnutrition in the affected populations.

 IEG‘s recent Country Assistance Evaluation for the period 1998-2006 reported that Ethiopia is among the
World Bank‘s largest IDA-eligible borrowers in Sub-Saharan Africa for a total net commitment of US$2 billion
as of end-FY07 (IEG 2008).

Box 1. Ethiopia 2002-03 Drought: Regional Impact

Crop Production
Tigray Region: Belg crops planted in Alamaata, Mehoni and Rayana Azebo woredas completely failed. Wajirat
woreda reported extensive production losses.
Amhara Region: Late plantation in several areas coupled with poor rains in the month of April severely damaged
crops. The woredas most seriously affected were Mekedela, Kutaber, Tenta and Ambassel in South Wollo. The
failure of the April/May rains seriously affected long cycle crops that had been planted in May, e.g., sorghum,
maize and a special variety of barley (ginbote). Areas seriously affected included Gishe Rabel in North Shoa.
Oromiya: Maize and sorghum planted in most low land areas of East and West Hararghe as well as Bale
completely failed. The performance of both crops in the rest of the region was also poor.
 SNNPR*: The failure of the Belg rains at a critical stage of crop growth coupled with hailstorms in some areas
caused widespread damage, particularly to maize and beans. Areas affected included the lowland areas of Wolayta,
Gomo Goffa, Kembata Timbaro, Sidama, Konso, Amaro and Alaba special woredas.
Livestock Condition
Afar: Serious shortages of water affected Abala, Berhale, Erebeiti, Koneba and Dalol woredas of Afar‘s Zone
Two, Amibara, Buremedito and Awash Fentale woredas of Zone Three, and Fursi, Artuma and Semurobi woredas
of Zone five. This led to extensive livestock deaths in Zones Two and Three such as the Halidege grazing area in
Amibara woreda. In addition to the water and pasture shortages, serious livestock disease was also reported in
zones three and four.
Oromiya: In the pastoral areas in Fentale woreda, the lowlands of Bale and in East and West Hararghe there was
considerable livestock death and unusual migration in search of water and pastures.
Somali: Serious shortages of rain were reported in Shinille zone, including Meisso, Afdem, East Danbel and
Shinille woredas, many of which border the equally affected areas of Fentale in Oromiya and Afar. Similar
problems were reported in Fik, Deghabour and Jijiga zones. Livestock were seriously affected in Shinille, Fik and
parts of Jijiga.

1.4     The drought led to not only decline in cereal and pulse production, but a shift of
production out of long-cycle grains, such as maize, into shorter cycle crops such as teff, a
decline in coffee production and livestock herds ((Box 1).8 The Central Statistical Authority
showed that production declined by nearly 26 percent compared to the previous year (Lautze
and others 2003). As reported in the Technical Annex, the drought halved the GDP growth
for Ethiopia, inflation increased along with a negative effect on the trade balance and on the
budget because of government spending in response to the drought. In addition, water
shortages interrupted hydro-power generation, and caused power cuts in urban centers.
Economic performance which was good in FY01, slower in FY02, collapsed in FY03 (World
Bank 2003). Nutritional surveys in some of the affected areas showed that malnutrition was
in excess of the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate of 10 percent—the critical level to
trigger an emergency response, with some areas (Afar Region Zone 1, for example) reporting

 Livestock provided consumption insurance during the drought, with 40 percent of households selling livestock
to pay for food during this period (IFPRI 2006).
                                                        5


GAM rates as high as 32 percent. Ultimately, the drought affected more than 14 million
people.

1.5     The Government responded quickly by purchasing cereals from the local market and
also providing about Birr 13 million to affected regions for the purchase of seeds to initiate
replanting of early maturing crops. It also supplied veterinary drugs, medical kits, water
tankers. As the situation worsened, it issued a special alert in July 2002 that requested
additional food relief, raising the January 2002 estimate of needed relief by about 40 percent.
In addition to food aid, the Government appealed for US$75 million in emergency non-food
assistance in December 2002. Following a joint Government/donor mission that assessed the
severity of the food insecurity in the country, the Prime Minister launched an appeal to the
international community for assistance in averting a humanitarian crisis. The EDRP emerged
as one response.

2. Project Objectives, Design and Implementation
Experience
Objectives and Design
2.1     According to the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President (MOP)9 the
objective of the Ethiopia EDRP was to “enable Government to help affected families survive
the crisis [2002/03 drought emergency], retain productive assets, and develop sustainable
livelihoods, as well as contribute to stabilizing the macro-economy (page 1).” The objective
was broader in the Grant Agreement: “The objectives of the project are to assist the
Recipient to respond to the Emergency and enable the Recipient to: (i) help the affected
families to survive the Emergency, retain productive assets, and develop sustainable
livelihoods, (ii) put in place infrastructure and support mechanisms to mitigate the medium
term effects of current and future drought emergencies on Vulnerable Groups, and (iii)
stabilize the macro-economy (pg.17).” The MOP did not include the second of the three
objectives. This report assesses project achievements against the broader objectives set out in
the Grant Agreement as was done in the ICR Review.

2.2      SDR 43.5 million (US$ 60 million equivalent) were approved in March 2003 for the
Ethiopia EDRP. Sixty percent of the grant (US$36 million equivalent) came from the debt-
vulnerability facility and the remaining 40 percent (US$24 million) from the natural disaster
facility.10 The total budget for the project was US$61.7 million with US$60 million
equivalent coming from IDA and US$1.7 million from the Government of Ethiopia. Actual
project cost was US$60.3 million in which the IDA share remained close to the appraisal

9
 In accordance with the relevant Operational Policy and at that time –OP and BP 8.50—on Emergency
Recovery Assistance, there is a MOP and a Technical Annex for the project no project appraisal document.
10
  Countries that are particularly vulnerable to longer term debt sustainability problems were eligible under the
IDA13 replenishment to receive grant support up to 40 percent of their IDA allocations. Ethiopia qualifies
because it is one of the world‘s poorest countries and faces long term debt sustainability problems. In addition,
grant funding for emergency recovery projects in IDA countries facing natural disasters is available under
IDA14.

amount but the Borrower contribution was US$0.30 million. About US$47,000 remained
undisbursed and was cancelled.

2.3       The project had three components:

         A Quick-Disbursing Component (Appraisal estimate US$ 43.5 million, Actual
          US$44.511) to stabilize the macro-economy by reducing the fiscal deficit, making
          additional budgetary resources available for key human development programs
          otherwise likely to be affected by fiscal constraints, and foreign exchange to support
          the import of essential items on a positive list. The Birr equivalent of this amount was
          to be allocated for food security initiatives being implemented throughout the
          country.
         A Community Interventions Component (Appraisal estimate US$16.5 million
          Actual US$15.0 million) to support activities in selected woredas to improve coping
          capabilities, helping the affected population protect their assets, and enabling them to
          recover their productive capacity. The component was to provide cash and
          complement payment provided in food through the Employment Generation Scheme
          (EGS) for sub-projects that met community needs such as reconstruction of roads,
          schools, communal ponds and irrigation or water harvesting systems. There were also
          sub-components for provision of supplementary enriched food packages for small
          children, pregnant and lactating mothers and food allowance for girls attending
          schools.
         A Project Management Component (Appraisal estimate US$1.7 million, Actual
          US$1.8 million) for program management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
          procurement etc. at the federal level, capacity building programs at the region and
          woreda level and for selected studies on program effectiveness and impact.

2.4     The World Bank received a request from the Ethiopian Government for assistance to
respond to the emergency on November 27, 2002. Negotiations for the project were held in
Addis Ababa on February 14, 2003. The project was approved in March 2003, became
effective on May 30th 2003 and closed on December 31, 2006.

Implementation
2.5     The project was coordinated by a Project Management Unit (PMU) under the Food
Security Department of the then Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). This department
later came under the Federal Food Security Coordination Bureau following the
organizational change that brought MoRD and Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) together to
form the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MoARD). The project was
officially launched at a workshop that included representatives from concerned ministries,
regions and woredas and donor and non-government organization (NGO) representatives
held at the Ethiopian Management Institute in Debreziet on August12-13, 2003.


11
  The ICR Annex 1 shows the actual amount for the quick-disbursing component to be US$43.5 million.
However, the project documents show that US$44.5 million worth of goods imported were financed through the
project.
                                                         7


2.6     The US$12 million retroactive financing for imports was made on July 15, 2003 from
the quick-disbursing component after effectiveness as per the Grant Agreement. The balance
from that component was disbursed between November 2003 and January 2004. Bank
supervision missions, the first of which was held in February 2004, focused only on the
community intervention component. This component used a community-driven development
(CDD) approach in which the rural community was seen as the main driving force, selecting
and managing the sub-projects and targeted 35 drought affected woredas and 412 kebeles
(sub-districts) in the 6 Regions of Amhara, SNNP,12 Somali, Oromiya, Tigray and Afar most
affected by the drought (see Box 1).

2.7      As part of the implementation process for the community interventions component,
regional launch workshops and TOT (training of trainers) sessions were undertaken from
November 27 to December 26, 2003 in Ethiopia. Despite these trainings, implementation of
the component was slow and constrained by inadequate understanding of the CDD approach
among both government staff and communities. Other factors constraining implementation
included poor working conditions in the PMU, inadequate staff, overlap with other activities
at the regional and woreda levels and weak reporting and record maintenance (Box 2). As
late as March 2005, supervision missions noted overall low disbursement under the
component and weak progress in addressing girls‘ school and child/maternal nutrition.
Project supervision reports also pointed to the need for additional training—to promote better
understanding of the CDD approach, community procurement measures, M&E for project
reporting, and compliance with safeguard requirements. Implementation picked up in the
post-MTR period, with improvement in the working conditions at the PMU (with provision
of needed office equipment), hiring/assigning of focal persons at regional levels, training and
technical support from concerned line officials at woreda levels and better understanding of
the project approach.

2.8     The Grant Agreement was also amended in August 2005 to increase the Authorized
Allocation from the Grant Account to the Special Account and to reallocate the proceeds of
the Grant under Schedule I Category 3 (consultants service, training and audit) and Category
6 (unallocated) to Categories 2 (Goods, vehicles and equipments), 4 (Community
subprojects) and 5 (operating costs) to further speed up project implementation.

2.9      Overall, however, the implementation of the girls' school attendance and nutrition
sub-components remained unsatisfactory throughout the project period because of poor
facilitation support from concerned regional and woreda offices, a concern among officials
that such interventions may create dependency and lack of coordination with line offices.
Lack of awareness about the implementation arrangement of these sub-components was also
an issue.

2.10 As noted in paragraph 1.3, both Malawi and Zambia also experienced droughts at this
time and the Bank supported EDRPs in both these countries. Both these projects were
assessed by IEG in 2007. In Malawi there was a project coordination unit for the EDRP but
the public work component of the project was implemented by the Malawi Social Fund
(MASAF) which had considerable experience with community level sub-projects. While

                                                      8


difficult to compare across countries, this may have led to less of an implementation
challenge than the Ethiopia EDRP. In Zambia on the other hand, the Zambia Social Fund
(ZAMSIF) was not selected to take the lead in implementing the safety net component
despite its long experience in implementing public work type projects and mobilizing
communities. The PPAR for the Malawi project found that

        ―a key factor for the efficacy of the project objectives is that the institutional arrangement was
        anchored on ongoing government programs and assigned to implementing institutions with a proven
        track record and approved procedures‖ pg. 21.

2.11 The PPAR for the Zambia project on the other hand, questions why ZAMSIF was not
selected as the implementing agency.13 Ethiopia too had a social fund operation which was
on-going when the EDRP was approved. The Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and
Development Fund was approved in April 1996 but closed in December 2004 after a three
year extension. As is normally the case with social funds it also aimed, among other things,
to increase community capacity to identify development priorities, manage project
implementation and maintain created assets. Supporting community actions beneficial to
environmental conservation and rehabilitation was a major goal of that intervention. The
Technical Annex for the EDRP project, while observing that the Social Fund project was
about to close in early 2003 and had limited resources available to respond to the emergency,
also noted that the EDRP ―proposed to draw on the institutional structure created in this
―social fund‖ experience, to support the woreda based programs planned ….‖ (page 14). Had
these networks and institutions established under the social fund been effectively used to
support the implementation of the CDD component, the project might have faced far less
implementation challenges.

Box 2. Ethiopia EDRP: Pre-MTR (February 2005) Implementation Challenges
CDD approach: Lack of clear understanding of the CDD implementation approach, including roles and
responsibilities of communities and lack of trust in community capacity to manage resources and project
activities was reported by early supervision missions. Despite the project‘s CDD nature, project
supervision missions found formal instructions from regional levels to beneficiary woredas about the use
of the project resources and the types of projects to be financed. Lack of clarity on project financial
management aspects and its reporting requirements was also an issue.
Staffing, equipment and logistics: After 18 months of project implementation the PMU still lacked
proper office facilities and equipments including internet and phone access which constrained its ability
to follow up on implementation and maintain regular contact with project implementation woredas and
corresponding regions. The mobility of PMU staff was also constrained by delay in the supply of field
vehicles. As per the Grant Agreement the PMU was to consist of a Project Coordinator, M&E Officer,
Financial Management Officer, Procurement Officer and a Rural Engineer. However the project
Coordinator and the Procurement Officer posts were vacant for an extended period of time. The PMU
also had limited operational decision-making capacity and depended on the Food Security Department
for most decisions. The regional and woreda focal bureaus offices also reported lack of transportation

   In both Zambia and Malawi however, there was delay in the implementation of the public work component.
In Malawi the district assemblies who were responsible for identifying the sub-projects were fully engaged in
implementing the on-going MASAF II project and therefore could not submit new sub-projects under the ERDP
in time. In Zambia delays were caused by poor coordination among the institutions involved in the verification
of the works and the long process of approval and disbursal of funds.

and inadequate operational budgets in addition to being inadequately staffed to provide the required
technical support for project implementation and financial utilization. Problems related to opening of
bank accounts at the woreda level, lack of proper documentation at kebele level and absence of adequate
skills in accounting and procurement persisted.
Overlap with activities at regional and woreda level: The implementation approach required that
communities get the required technical support to prepare proposals, implement, report in a timely
manner and perform beneficiary assessments. Woreda officials, in close collaboration with the PMU and
regional and zonal focal persons, were expected to contribute significantly to this process. Staff
turnover, overlapping responsibilities and capacity limitations were noted as issues that constrained the
ability of government staff to provide effective support to communities. Though a focal person was
assigned in each region to follow up on project implementation that person was not dedicated to the
project but also worked on other competing assignments and this made effective project management
difficult.

3. Relevance
Relevance of Objectives
3.1     The EDRP was to provide emergency support to the country in the wake of the severe
2002/2003 drought. Stabilizing the macro-economy by reducing the fiscal deficit and
providing balance of payment support (BOP) was a major project objective and was highly
relevant to the country situation. Given the importance of agriculture to the Ethiopian
economy agriculture-related shocks can create macroeconomic volatility via effects on both
output and food prices (World Bank 2007). BOP support following a natural disaster, such as
a major drought, was relevant to support the country‘s ability to maintain a flow of imports
for reactivating as many sectors of the economy as possible and thereby contributing to
stabilization of the macroeconomic conditions.

3.2     The project goals of helping affected families survive the crisis and put in place
infrastructure and support mechanisms were also in keeping with Government‘s Food
Security Strategy and the Bank‘s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). In fact, reducing
vulnerability and enhancing growth has long been a Bank goal in Ethiopia as reflected in the
CASs for the period 2003-2005 and 2008-2011. For example, in the 2003 CAS (that was
based on the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP)—the
Government‘s poverty reduction strategy) reducing vulnerability was one of the major pillars
of Bank assistance. The project was to help improve coping capabilities, reduce malnutrition
in children, protect productive assets of the affected population and support it more generally
in the overall recovery process. As already seen in paragraph 1.4 malnutrition levels were
high in the country and focus on this area was relevant. During droughts vulnerable
populations also consume or sell their assets (refer to footnote 8 for an example) lowering
their capacity to recover from the emergency in the future.14 Droughts also lead to stress


14
  Coping mechanisms used by farm households in rural Ethiopia include among others livestock sales, distress
migration, sale of wood or charcoal, small scale trading, selling cow dung (in central Ethiopia) and crop
residues, reduction of food consumption, consumption of meat from their livestock, consumption of wild plants,
                                                        10


migration because of limited opportunities in agriculture given the scarcity of water.15
Rehabilitating or creating communal assets using the labor of the affected population, as was
intended, was relevant for providing them with a source of income. Given the environmental
degradation and the poor connectivity of the majority of Ethiopian villages,16 soil and water
conservation activities and access roads, among the activities to be supported through the
project, could also contribute to building resilience against future droughts as was the project
goal.

3.3      Overall relevance of objectives is rated high.

Relevance of Design
3.4     The project was essentially two projects in one. About 75 percent of the project
resources were for a quick-disbursing component for stabilizing the macro-economy.
Retroactive financing was used to meet the emergency needs17 and the component was
essentially complete by January 2004 before the first supervision mission was fielded in
February 2004. A significantly smaller share (less than 30 percent), of project resources were
for the slower disbursing community interventions component. Overall, the design had three
serious shortcomings.

3.5     First, the project Operational Manual, Technical Manual, M&E Manual, the
Environmental and Social Management Framework and the Community Procurement
Manual were all prepared for the implementation of the significantly smaller community
intervention component on which all Bank supervision resources were also spent. It was
assumed that no follow up was required for the quick-disbursing component which was
essentially over by January 2004. However, counterpart resources released from the
financing of essential imports through the quick-disbursing component were to be allocated
for food security initiatives being implemented throughout the country. The project design

  ―Low density of all-weather road systems and low population density in the peripheral regions are major
factors influencing market access in Ethiopia. In 2007, between 23 and 98 percent of the population in every
region was further than 5 hours travel time from a major city.‖ IFPRI 2009.

  In retroactive financing the loan proceeds are used, in part, to cover expenditures already made by the
government. Often these are expenditures are related to reconstruction or recovery. According to Operational
Policy 8.50, BoP loan proceeds may be used for retroactive financing of expenditures, and the payments can be
made for any expenses that occurred after the emergency and before the expected date of loan signing. The
policy states, ―No more than 20 percent of loan proceeds may be used for retroactive financing of expenditures,
and the payments must have been made after the emergency occurred and within four months prior to the
expected date of loan signing. In exceptional circumstances, with the approval of the managing director,
operations, concerned the date of the first mission or the date of the emergency event may be used as the earliest
date for expenditures eligible for retroactive financing.‖ IEG 2004

did not clearly identify which specific programs were to be supported, nor did it establish
expenditure targets for such programs. No system was set up to monitor achievement of
outputs and outcomes of such programs to see to what extent they contributed to the project‘s
PDOs. The ICR also notes that:

       ―…….. (i) counterpart resources, released by providing foreign exchange support for imports under
       quick disbursement component, would be used to provide relief to affected families through the
       national Food Security Program - which the government‘s proposed national EDRP, mentioned several
       times in the TA, was apparently mainstreamed into - and/or defend critical human development
       expenditures; and (ii) support would be provided to selected families for nutrition and for schooling
       under the community interventions component.

       With regard to counterpart resources, as already noted in section 2.1., project design does not provide
       clear guidance – through, e.g., more explicit operational links, results framework or possibly an
       identifiable fund flow mechanism – on how the counterpart resources might be used to achieve this
       PDO.‖ Page 12.

3.6     In this regard, it is instructive to look at the experience of the Turkey Emergency
Earthquake Recovery Loan approved by the Bank in FY 2000. That project also provided
quick-disbursing support to finance a positive list of imports. The Government was to use the
Turkish Lira counterpart of the loan funds to finance priority components of its earthquake
recovery program that emphasized social protection for earthquake victims. The priority
programs to be supported under the Government‘s program through the counterpart resources
were clearly identified as was the administering agency and a results framework was
established to monitor use of funds and effectiveness. This was important for both
accountability and transparency.

3.7     Second, the community intervention component included an innovative (but
ultimately neglected) feature: the provision of cash allowances for the purchase of
complementary inputs in community sub-projects (e.g. material and technical expertise) that
could increase the relevance and effectiveness of public work programs being supported
through food-aid in an emergency period. The Board discussion in March 2003 when the
project was approved clearly recognized the advantage of including this feature when it noted
two concerns: one, community projects paid for with food aid often failed for lack of key
cash inputs such as for roofing or furniture for schools or culverts for roads; and two,
households working on public works schemes often prefer cash to food-based wages since
cash is more flexible and enables them to respond to the needs for livestock, purchase inputs
or cover health or schooling expenses.

3.8     However, instead of putting the resources towards existing public work programs
(e.g. Box 3), the project ended up providing for separate sub-projects to be implemented
through a CDD approach in which the Government officials had limited experience.
Discussions with various stakeholders reveal that separate community sub-projects may have
come about from the need to draw lessons under this project for the productive safety nets
                                                         12


program on which the Bank was engaging with the Government at that time.18,19 The 2008
CAS noted for the community intervention component confirmed that:

         ―The lessons from the latter component proved beneficial for the Productive Safety Net Program,
         which in its first phase provided predictable cash and in-kind resources to around 5 million chronically
         food insecure households in rural Ethiopia. The second phase of the APL expanded to cover 7.23
         million food insecure households eligible for the program.‖ Page 75, 2008 CAS

3.9    Ultimately the EDRP sub-projects put an additional implementation and reporting
burden on the government officials at the regional, woreda and kebele levels as noted in aide
memoires of supervision missions. It is hence not surprising that there were implementation
challenges arising from overlap in activities being supported by woreda and other level
government staff as discussed in Chapter 2.

Box 3. National Policy on Disaster Prevention and Management (NPDPM): The Ethiopian
Government’s Program
NPDPM was established in 1993 as a part of the effort to address the root cause of the
vulnerability to drought and famine. The policy discouraged free hand-outs to able-bodied
individuals. Under NPDPM the preconditions and guidance for disaster declaration and provision
of a relief response were defined. The NPDPM policy emphasized measures such as Employment
Generation Schemes (EGS), an employment-based safety net. EGS sought to reduce relief
dependence by providing labor income in cash or kind to affected people in disaster affected
areas while building productive assets in these areas to improve their resilience to future
disasters. The EGS program objectives and operational characteristics, as detailed in the national
guidelines, were closely fashioned on the India Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme.
The approach was adopted in recognition of the success of the Indian experience in containing
famine in the early 1970s in Maharashtra and prompted the senior political cadre in Ethiopia to
design a similar program, based on the specific Ethiopian context. A Gratuitous Relief program
provided for free food distribution for the aged, the very young, pregnant and lactating mothers
who could not participate in EGS.
NPDPM also provided for the management of a national Early Warning System, relief related
warehouse services, the establishment of a national Food Security Reserve, a National Disaster
Prevention and Preparedness Fund, and a transport fleet to carry goods where commercial
vehicles did not go.

  In 2003, the Bank helped the Government of Ethiopia design a broad national-level response to chronic food
insecurity designed to help the country move beyond appeals for food aid towards a safety net program
promoting natural resource management and development of sustainable livelihoods.
19
   The Africa Region of the World Bank in its comment on the assessment notes that the use of CDD under the
Productive Safety Net Program was a conscious decision by the donors in the New Coalition for Food Security
in Ethiopia and was an already agreed overall concept for building medium term drought resilience amongst the
development partners in the early stages of implementation of the Emergency Drought Recovery project.

                                                  3.10 Third, the results framework for the
                                                  community intervention component does not
                                                  make it clear how it was mapped into the
                                                  project development objectives. The
                                                  component could contribute only to the
                                                  second objective of ―putting in place
                                                  infrastructure and support mechanisms to
                                                  mitigate the medium term effects ……..” It
                                                  had little to contribute to the third objective of
                                                  stabilizing the macro-economy which was to
Source: FAO                                       be achieved mainly through the quick-
                                                  disbursing component. Nor could it contribute
to the first objective of ― helping affected families survive the Emergency….” as in the first
year of the project‘s implementation, capacity to implement the component was also to be
built. Further, ―helping affected families survive the drought‖ was not a relevant objective
for the second or third years of project implementation when the affected families have to
have already found a coping strategy to survive the drought. As demonstrated by the
FAO/WFP reports,20 2003 and 2004 meher rains were good and agricultural production had
picked up (Figure 2) and distress migration arising from the drought of 2002 was not an issue
in the post 2004 phase.

3.11       Given the significant weaknesses, relevance of design is rated modest.

4. Efficacy
4.1        Efficacy is assessed against the three objectives noted in Chapter 2.

Helping the Affected Families Survive the Emergency, Retain Productive
Assets, and Develop Sustainable Livelihoods.
4.2     As already noted in paragraph 3.5 above it is not possible to link the quick-disbursing
component with Government food security initiatives because of the weaknesses in design.
That said, the component may have contributed to this project objective. National
expenditures on vulnerability and food security increased significantly between 2002/03 and
2003/04 and continued to be high in 2004/05 (Table 3). An IFPRI report (para 4.8) found
significant effect of participation in the Employment Generation Scheme (EGS) and the
Gratuitous Relief program on growth in food consumption. It is also worth mentioning that
the recent Public Expenditure Review (World Bank 2008a) that reports these increasing
national expenditures also notes the weakness in capacity at the woreda level and the fact
that various food security interventions tended ―to swamp‖ whatever capacity existed. This
may have affected the quality of the support provided to affected families.

4.3     With regard to continuation of key human development programs as noted in
paragraph 2.3 under the quick-disbursing component, Table 4 shows that the government
resources allocated overall to social development activities increased in absolute amounts as
well as a percent of total expenditures. However, by individual sub-component, there was a
slight decline in absolute amounts devoted for public health and urban development and
housing between 2002/03 and 2003/04, though the amount marked for education increased
substantially (Table 4). Again, design weaknesses prevent knowing to what extent the Bank
supported protection of such expenditure and to what extent they may have contributed to
achieving the project development objective.

4.4    During the course of implementation, the community interventions component is
reported by the ICR to have directly benefitted 900,000 people, 37 percent of whom were
                                                    15


women. According to the ICR, these beneficiaries were paid an average income per
individual per sub-project of Birr 340 (US$39.6 at 2003 rates). The project is reported by the
completion report to have generated both income and employment and, as the end-user
evaluations carried out by the PMU between March and June 2006 found, the sub-projects
reduced ―seasonal migration‖ which normally occurs every year. The crucial issue in the
assessment of this component is when these benefits were received by the beneficiaries.
Seventy percent of the resources from the community intervention component were spent in
the post MTR period, i.e. after February 2005, nearly two and half years after the appeal from
the Government in November 2002. Supervision missions also report that payments to
community members after completion of works were often late as they required approval by
technical staff in each woreda. The families affected by the drought had until then already
found a coping strategy (which could involve among other things selling their productive
assets, accessing food aid, migration) to ―survive‖ the emergency.

4.5     The end-user evaluation shows that households put the labor income from the
community-intervention component to all kinds of uses: buying food, clothes or minor
livestock, paying off debts, sending children to school, or petty trade. Where beneficiaries
used the money to buy small animals the project did make it possible for them to ―recover‖
some of their assets or ―buy‖ new ones, but the resources from this component were not
available in time to help them ―retain‖ these assets during the emergency as was the
intention. In many woredas officials limited participation in sub-project construction to one
able-bodied person per household thereby maximizing the number of households that
benefited. In these cases the income was also limited and did not allow for purchase of large
animals which were often the primary assets lost during the emergency. Thus the Project
Status Report from the Food Security Coordination Bureau for May 2003 to October 2005
notes:

       ―Recovery of oxen is much lower than what was lost due to the drought. As the data in Annex 4
       indicates average percent loss of oxen in Dlifage, Kersa, Tselemt and East Belesa was 99, 92, 88, and
       83 respectively. But the current average percent of oxen is 1.29, 83.3, 12.5 and 50 for the same
       woredas respectively. This is assumed to be because of the insufficiency of the money a household
       earned to pay the market price of ox. Price of an ox varied from birr 800-1500 while the average
       income that a household earned from participation in community asset building activities is about 293
       (Table3). As the data in Annex 6 shows it is in Amhara and Tigray woredas where respondents
       claimed they bought oxen with additional money from other sources.‖

4.6     It is also worth noting that the largest percentage of the sub-projects supported (Table
Table 5) are likely to have generated environmental benefits (e.g. through soil and water
conservation etc.) and access to water which could in the long run contribute to sustainable
livelihoods, but not in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. The uptake of the targeted
nutrition and school attendance interventions was reported to be low by the completion
report. In the few instances that the targeted nutrition program was implemented it was
reported to be in the form of cash transfers to help selected families buy food. Similarly,
where implemented, the school attendance program provided for school supplies or clothing.

4.7    Overall, considering both the lack of information about the achievements under the
quick-disbursing component and timing concerns under the community interventions
components, efficacy for this objective is rated modest.

Put in Place Infrastructure and support Mechanisms to Mitigate the
Medium Term Effects of Current and Future Drought Emergencies on
Vulnerable Groups
4.8     The Government‘s Food Security Program [to which the quick-disbursing component
may have made a contribution as already discussed in paragraph 4.2 above] helped finance
construction of local infrastructure as noted by the recent Public Expenditure Review (World
Bank 2008a). An IFPRI report (IFPRI 2006) assessed the safety net role of the Government
supported EGS and Gratuitous Relief program (discussed in Box 2) in reducing vulnerability
and protecting assets into the future following the 2002 drought in Ethiopia.21. EGS
beneficiaries were found to experience a significant reduction in perceived famine risk
relative to five years ago, while famine risks increased over this period for the group of
matched non-beneficiaries. However, the study also found that the average growth in
livestock holding was smaller for EGS participants than non-participants. This finding was
reported to be consistent with reduced demand for precautionary savings as recipient
households gained greater confidence in food aid as an insurance against future droughts.
This may have a negative impact on the EGS participants‘ capacity to cope with future
droughts. For the Gratuitous Relief program the IFPRI study found a significant average
impact on growth in food consumption, but a negative impact on change in famine risk. The
study notes that improved targeting, especially in the EGS program, and larger, sustained
transfers may be required to increase benefits, particularly for the poorest households. Thus
overall, it is uncertain to what extent these programs helped build mechanisms to mitigate
medium term effects of current and future droughts among affected households.

4.9      A total of 2124 community sub-projects were implemented and the proportion of
various kinds of activities in these sub-projects is noted in Table 5. The major soil and water
conservation activities were those related to bund construction, terracing, check dams, cut-off
drains among others, mostly undertaken on communal lands. Water development comprised
activities such as pond construction, micro-irrigation, spring development, hand-dug well

21
  Using rural longitudinal household survey data collected in 1999 and 2004, IFPRI 2006 estimated the impact
of these programs on consumption growth, food security, and growth in asset holdings 18 months after the peak
of the drought, when food aid transfers had substantially or entirely ceased in most program villages.
                                                  17


construction, roof water harvesting. Access roads, rehabilitation of schools and health
institutions were the major infrastructure development activities.

4.10 As already seen, most of these activities under the community intervention
component came too late to mitigate the immediate effects of the current drought but were
likely to have helped with its medium-term effects [the project objective in this case] and
could contribute to tiding over future drought emergencies as was also intended by the
project objective. Roads and transport infrastructure particularly plays a major role in the
ability of local economies to adjust to localized crop failures as it allows areas with food
surplus to sell to areas in food deficit (World Bank 2006a). Soil and water conservation
activities can play a major role in reducing land degradation which exacerbates the effects of
a drought (see para 1.3).There were however, some weaknesses in the technical quality of the
constructions which are discussed in the section on risk to development outcome in chapter
6.

4.8       Overall, efficacy is rated substantial for this objective.

Stabilize the Macro-economy
4.9     It was primarily the quick-disbursing component which was to contribute to this
objective though it is not possible to isolate the project‘s impact as its resources were part of
a larger stabilization support package offered by donors. According to the ICR, the US$44.5
million provided through the quick-response component amounted to 6 percent of the current
account balance and 2 percent of the country‘s total import bill in 2002/2003. Available data
(Figure 3) shows that inflation did come down in the post 2003 period, though it began
increasing again in 2006 because of other reasons. Real GDP growth rate also came back
from being negative in 2003 to 9.8 percent in 2004 (Figure 4).

4.11 According to the Technical Annex for the project, the imports of goods under the
positive list were essential to support the recovery of the economy and the agriculture sector
in particular. The imports were completed in 2003 though only a very small percentage of
these were used for agricultural imports and seem to have been aimed at the general economy
(Table 6) rather than the agriculture sector.

4.12      Overall efficacy for this objective is considered substantial.

5. Efficiency and Outcome Ratings
Efficiency
5.1      About 75 percent of the project was the quick-disbursing component for which it is
impossible to say anything about efficiency of resource use because of the weaknesses in the
results framework. There is also no information on efficiency of resource use for the CDD
component. Cost effectiveness of sub-projects supported through the CDD approach against
those supported through other approaches is often carried out to assess efficiency but was not
undertaken. Poor M&E made it difficult.

5.2     An important aspect of efficiency which should be given importance in an emergency
is whether the project was able to respond in time to the needs of the client. In a cost-benefit
context then, costs would be the effort incurred in terms of resources put in but the benefits
would also include in addition to the income, employment created, the extent to which
further suffering was avoided (population saved from hunger, malnutrition, forced migration)
and how much the effort contributed to the ―resilience‖ of the economy in coming back to
pre-drought conditions. In the EDRP project the resources from the quick-disbursing
component were available in a timely manner, but design weaknesses make it impossible to
know how efficiently those resources were spent. However, as already demonstrated in the
section on efficacy, the timeliness was more problematic under the community intervention
component.

5.3     The PPAR made an attempt to get a sense of the effectiveness of resource use for the
community interventions component in comparison with other CDD interventions. In 2003
IEG reviewed CDD projects in the Sahel region. In the absence of cost-benefit analysis in
most CDD projects that report proposed some estimates of how much it costs to implement a
CDD operation: per beneficiary costs ranged from US$8.8 to US $35.75 (IEG 2003). The
cost per beneficiary for the EDRP project averaged US$16.59, which is within that range
                                               19


(Table 7). This crude measure however, does not take account of the technical flaws that
afflicted many sub-projects.

5.4    Overall because of the limited evidence on efficiency of resource use efficiency is
rated modest.

Outcome
5.5     Overall project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. Given that the project was
to support relief and recovery from a devastating drought the relevance of objectives was
high. However, relevance of design was modest based on the shortcomings noted in Chapter
3. There was no way to establish which specific programs the fast disbursing component
supported. It was therefore not possible to tell specifically how this component contributed to
the related PDOs. That said, national expenditures on vulnerability and food security
increased and the counterpart resources released may have made a contribution. The
community intervention component did not complement the relief and recovery efforts of the
government and other donors the way it was envisaged and the results framework was weak.
Much of the support from the community intervention component also came in too late to
help families survive the crisis and retain their productive assets as envisaged in the PDO.
However, the project did contribute to building a substantial amount of infrastructure and
generated both income and employment (see for example para 4.4 and 4.8). It also appears to
have contributed to stabilization of the macro economy. Inflation did come down and real
GDP growth did pick up. Efficacy of two objectives was substantial and one was modest.
Efficiency is also rated modest. Overall, outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Risk to Development Outcome
6.1     The imported items through the quick-disbursing component that were applied for
agricultural development, construction, machinery and other capital goods likely contributed
to medium-term growth (Figure 4). Ethiopia‘s improved economic situation overall helped
the economy recover from the drought though the vulnerability of the country to future
droughts still remains high since most agriculture continues to be rain-fed.

6.2     The smaller community interventions component created greater awareness of the
role that communities can play in their own development and helped create a large amount of
infrastructure and community assets. It may be easier to get the community mobilized in
similar relief and recovery effort, given their experience with the implementation of the sub-
project under EDRP, if needed in the future.
                                               20


6.3      As reported in the Borrower‘s ICR the sub-projects had technical shortcomings
largely because of the shortage of technical support and inadequate access to materials such
as cement. However, it is also reported that most of them met at least the minimum technical
requirements and have likely contributed to improvement in the lives of the affected
population. This was reported to be particularly true for the road sub-projects that have
improved access to markets for villages and the water development subprojects that have
provided for the provision of potable water near the living areas. In case of the latter, some
communities are also reported to have begun collecting money for future maintenance
through charging for drinking water. The soil and water conservation sub-projects are
reported to be contributing to regeneration of natural resources though the use rights for the
areas that have been conserved still remain to be defined. For the masonry dams, which were
constructed in contravention of the Environmental and Social management Framework (see
section on Bank Performance in Chapter 8) maintenance is a significant issue. Communities
lack the resources and the technical knowhow and no maintenance plan was put in place.
However, there were only three of these dams that were constructed and the Government can
draw on other on-going development programs to deal with some of the maintenance
challenges. For example, in the case of the dam at Digb (Figure 5), structures were built
under the productive safety net program to control silting (Box 4), even though their
contribution to improving the benefits of the original dam have been limited because the
initial design did not give adequate attention to stabilizing the surrounding soils before the
construction of the dam.

6.4    Overall risk to development outcome is rated moderate.

7. Monitoring and Evaluation
7.1    Overall M&E is rated negligible.

Design
7.2      The serious weaknesses in the results framework make it difficult to link project
resources to the outcomes they were expected to produce. Overall, the project log frame
listed three performance indicators: reduced distress migration, reduced student drop-out
rates particularly for girls, and lower inflation rate. For all three indicators—including the
one on reducing distress migration and student drop-out rates—there were no pre and post
project levels to allow for assessing the project‘s contribution. There were no outcome
indicators for the food security programs. There was also no way to clearly assess the
contribution of the quick disbursing component to the project objectives.

Implementation
7.3    The project M&E covered only the community intervention component. Although the
M&E manual with different reporting formats was sent by the PMU to the project regions
some woredas did not receive a copy, and reporting from others did not follow the format. In
fact, most woredas did not report on the basis of the M&E reporting manuals issued to them
because of time limitations arising from overlapping responsibilities for concerned staff.
There was also shortage of staff at the regional level to undertake regular monitoring and
                                                     21


provide technical support to the woredas on this aspect and there was inadequate monitoring
and implementation support from the PMU.22 End-user evaluations by PMU were used to
fill vital information gaps with regard to project performance and this assessment has also
drawn on these to some extent. The Bank also commissioned a qualitative beneficiary impact
assessment.

Utilization
7.4    Since M&E information was weak it could not be used effectively to monitor project
progress or effectiveness of resource use. Lack of relevant and timely information also
reduced the scope for effective supervision from the Bank. The fifth supervision mission
noted in August 2006, that M&E had been the weakest side of the project. Attempting to
design a full-fledged M&E system for an emergency operation is a challenge as the
implementation period is too short. The PPAR for the Malawi project offers an alternative

        ―The experience with Bank-assisted projects shows that after project start-up it often takes a minimum
        of two years to design a functional M&E system for a traditional project, and then collect and analyze
        baseline data. For a short-duration emergency operation, an appropriate M&E design should have been
        based on a set of case studies contracted to experienced researchers to supplement well designed
        progress reports. Case studies would have provided valuable lessons on the implementation, output,
        and outcome o f the project.‖


8. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

8.1      The responsiveness of the Bank to the request for support from the Government to
deal with the drought emergency is commendable. The Bank quickly put together the EDRP
project. The quick-disbursing component particularly was designed to provide immediate
relief to stabilize the macro-economy and critical foreign exchange resources for imports.
However, the Bank should have ensured that programs to be supported through counterpart
resources released from the quick-disbursing support were clearly identified and overall
expenditure targets, outputs and outcomes for each of these programs were agreed upon. It
should have ensured an appropriate results framework and M&E system to measure progress
towards PDOs including under the quick disbursing component. There were also some
serious weaknesses with the design of the community interventions component as already
discussed in the section on relevance. In addition, greater attention to the capacity of the
Borrower, particularly in an emergency to actually implement a new CDD approach before

22
   ―The MTR mission noted with concern that activities with regard to the M&E and reporting arrangement has
failed to generate the required information. Despite the distribution of the M&E manual, the provision of
training and follow up support by the PMU to project Regions and Woredas, M&E facilitation and reporting
arrangements continue to be weak. As a result, progress monitoring and analysis of project achievements is
proving to be difficult. The long awaited baseline data for key performance indicators is still not collected.
While capacity limitation at Woreda level and lack of follow-up support by the Regions are considered as major
factors, the reporting formats also appear not to be user friendly.‖ Aide memoire MTR.
                                              22


making it a formal part of the project design was warranted. Lack of an effective M&E was
also a serious shortcoming that has made it difficult to evaluate the project experience and
learn from it.

8.2    Overall quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

SUPERVISION

8.3     The Bank supervision missions were concerned mainly with follow up on the
community interventions component. While it is true that the resources from the quick-
disbursing component had all been disbursed by January 2004, supervision missions could
have followed up on progress of food security initiatives identified to benefit from the quick
disbursing component and monitored how they helped meet the project development
objectives. The Bank supervision missions gave feedback to the Borrower on issues that
needed attention for the proper implementation of the community intervention component
only. Shortcomings on M&E were highlighted and the team ―pushed‖ for timely preparation
of the Environmental Assessment and Resettlement Policy Framework which were due on
December 31, 2003. Given that the Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) was not prepared in time (the studies were completed and officially submitted to
IDA only in June 22, 2004) and recognizing the environmentally sensitive nature of the
investment proposals coming from beneficiary communities, the Bank appropriately advised
that as a short term measure the environmental mitigation plan and the resettlement policy
framework for the Food Security project be utilized.

8.4     Despite the serious implementation challenges that the community intervention
component was facing implementation progress ratings in the ISRs continued to be
satisfactory. This may have given the impression to Bank management that the project was
doing much better than it actually was. A safeguard violation went unnoticed (Box 4).
Overall, compliance with environmental requirements was generally weak. The end user
survey found that environmental review forms were not complete for any of the sub-projects
examined.

8.5     Based on the shortcomings noted above, including the safeguard violation (Box 4)
Bank supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Based on both moderately
unsatisfactory quality at entry and supervision, overall Bank performance is moderately
unsatisfactory.
                                                         23


Box 4. EDRP and a Safeguard Violation
The EDRP project was classified as a category B. The World Bank‘s Operational Policies OP 4.01 –
Environmental Assessment, OP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement and OP 4.09 Pest Management—were the
key policies that were triggered by the project. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was also to be
submitted as a separate document to address potential land acquisition within the project. An
environmental assessment for the project was to be carried out by December 31, 2003 to assess the
potential environmental and social impacts of livestock management, including water points; small,
community-level infrastructure; the level of environmental assessment and management capacity at the
woreda level and potential training needs. The ESMF that was prepared for the project clearly noted that
under the project there will be ―no funding for the construction or rehabilitation of any dams.‖ Pg. 48. Yet,
in violation of the ESMF, three masonry dams were constructed in the East Belessa woreda of Amhara
region at costs exceeding the amount allowed for each community sub-project grant i.e. US$100,000 each.
The ICR reported that relevant documents concerning the construction of these dams, including use of
generic safety measures, could not be found. The IEG mission attempted to get information on the dams
from the Food Security offices at the federal, regional and woreda level but with limited success. At each
level IEG was told that the information would be available at the next lower level but no avail. IEG also
visited Guhala, the head quarter for East Belessa, and found no records on the dams. The only information
that the regional level could provide was the location and Birr cost of each of the three dams which was as
follows:
Masonry Dam at Arbatsegual kebele built at a cost of Birr 923,150.00 (US$107, 593 at 2003 exchange rate)
Masonry Dam at Terfarwa kebele built at a cost of Birr 895,000.00 (US$104,312)
Masonry Dam at Digb kebele built at a cost of Birr 886,000.00. (US$103,263)
With the help of regional staff IEG was able to visit the Digb dam (Figures 5a and 5b), the smallest of the
three. The dam was built in an eroded area lacking completely in vegetative cover. No attempt was taken to
stabilize the land and soils surrounding the dam so that siltation would not occur and there is no
maintenance plan. Runoff from the exposed surfaces, particularly on the hillsides, led to siltation. The
villagers told the mission that the dam silted up after the first rain. More recently four structures such as the
ones shown in Figures 5c and 5d were constructed through the safety net program to prevent the silting of
the dam but have not been able to stop the silt accumulation. Since no assessment was available on the dam
it is impossible to know whether it classifies as a ―high‖ dam according to the Bank‘s OP 4.37 on Dam
Safety. There was no information available on the contractor who helped build the dam.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

8.6    The government moved quickly to access the funds available for retroactive financing
and under the quick disbursing component. There was delay, however, in fulfilling the
various requirements for implementation of the community interventions component. For
example, the Environmental Assessment and Resettlement Policy Framework studies for the
Community Grant Component were due on December 31, 2003, and were not complete by
April 2004. There were also issues related to inadequate training, limited staff with
overlapping responsibilities, and frequent transfers because of which the earlier trainings
were rendered useless as new staff required training all over again that handicapped
implementation of this component.

8.7    M&E and financial monitoring was very weak and inadequate documentation and
poor record keeping was a common problem. The final audit showed several internal control
weaknesses, among others, expenditures incurred after the closing date in several woredas,
                                                     24


variance in records on advances to regions between the federal and regional levels, lack of
reconciliation of bank statements, expenditures made without following adequate procedures,
lack of proper accounting, among others. A large number of these problems may have arisen
because the capacity in the Government to implement a demanding CDD approach was
lacking. The project documents show that there was reluctance on the part of the Borrower to
borrow for anything other than the quick-disbursing component.

8.8      Overall Government Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY

8.9     The implementation of the community intervention component was formally under
the Food Security Department of the then MoRD (later MoARD), and was coordinated by a
PMU. Because of its CDD nature, communities were expected to identify, prioritize and
formulate viable projects and propose for funding and implementation based on a
participatory approach. Various levels of government (kebele, woreda, regional and federal)
were to provide implementation and technical support which made for a very complex
implementation arrangement in an emergency. These different levels were unable to
adequately provide the communities with such support because of overlapping
responsibilities, limited budgets and high staff turnover at regional and woreda levels. The
PMU did what it could but was handicapped for a significant part of the project
implementation period because of inadequate phone/internet access and transportation
means. The wide geographic spread of the project woredas across the six regions did not
make coordination easy.

8.10 There were many internal financial control issues also as discussed in paragraph 8.7
and a safeguard violation. The Borrower had limited capacity to implement a CDD kind
intervention and an emergency situation did not make things easier. In the absence of
adequate understanding of CDD procedures there was a tendency among woreda officials to
stick to traditional government procurement regulations, consideration of communities as
incapable of executing.

8.11   Implementing agency performance is also rated moderately unsatisfactory.

8.12   Overall, Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory

9. Lessons
9.1    Building on the project experience this assessment identifies three major lessons:

9.2     Clearly identifying which specific programs will be supported with counterpart
equivalent of balance of payment support, agreeing on expenditure, output and
outcome targets and monitoring their progress is important if such quick disbursing
components are expected to contribute to achievements of specific PDOs. The
counterpart resources released from the financing of essential imports through the quick-
disbursing component were to be allocated for food security initiatives and human
development programs. However, there was no agreement on which specific programs would
be supported. No expenditure targets for such programs were agreed upon and no
mechanisms were put in place to monitor their contribution towards achieving two of the
three project goals was.

9.3     An emergency response intervention may not be best suited to use innovative
approaches for implementation. The EDRP design for the community intervention
component gave the community a central role in preparing proposals, submitting requests
and implementing sub-projects. Various levels of government (kebele, woreda, regional and
federal) were to provide implementation and technical support which made for a very
                                             26


complex implementation arrangement in an emergency. While this could be an effective
longer term strategy to deal with droughts, it was not appropriate to introduce CDD for
responding to the immediate emergency as it required considerable understanding of the
approach and substantial upfront investment in training and awareness raising activities. With
the weak Borrower and community capacity, not only did the use of the innovative approach
delay the response to the drought it also put an additional implementation and reporting
burden on already stretched Government staff.

9.4     Stronger Management oversight in ensuring that persistent and significant
weaknesses in implementation are actually reflected in the ratings of ISRs is essential
for ISRs to actually serve as a meaningful management tool. While project
implementation faced considerable challenges the ISRs continued to have satisfactory
implementation progress ratings. This was a major weakness in Bank supervision and
reporting and raises concerns about the usefulness of ISRs as a management tool.
