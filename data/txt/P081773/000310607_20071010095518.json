Project had the following ratings: outcome was satisfactory;\n            risk to development outcome was significant; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            from this assessment included: in disaster prone countries,\n            regular monitoring and reporting of rainfall patterns, food\n            balances (domestic consumption, production, imports\n            including informal cross border trade), and crop prices is\n            critical for timely mitigation and emergency response\n            measures; Bank assistance should pay particular attention to\n            food security issues in countries with chronic food\n            insecurity and vulnerable to natural disasters; reducing\n            food insecurity requires inter alia broad-based sources of\n            livelihood including non-farm incomes; effective management\n            of a strategic grain reserve requires the management of both\n            in-kind and cash resources; and to address food insecurity a\n            regional approach which promotes regional trade is needed."}, "docdt": "2007-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
