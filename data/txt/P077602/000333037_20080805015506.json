         follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: all tax\n            administrations are information-based; information is their\n            input and their output, and the organization needs to be\n            structured around integrated, automation-based processes.\n            The extremely complex process of modernizing any tax\n            administration requires strong, committed leadership,\n            convinced fully of the need to modernize, enthusiastically\n            championing the reform process; it also requires\n            managerially knowledgeable senior staff, experienced in\n            management in both public and private sector institutions,\n            very familiar with the intricacies of complex project\n            management. The traditional public sector is not well versed\n            in any of these skills. This operation demonstrates the\n            importance of having several phases to the reform. It would\n            have been possible to address the human resource aspects of\n            the reform, as well as, in this case, Customs. Leaving both\n            to a later phase shows a keen awareness of the\n            implementation capacity of the institution as well as its\n            absorptive capacity, and this strategy has proven successful\n            in permitting management to concentrate on the possible."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
