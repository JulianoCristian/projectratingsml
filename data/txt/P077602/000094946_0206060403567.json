objective of the Tax Administration\n            Institutional Development Project for Mexico is to improve\n            tax compliance and reduce evasion of internal national taxes\n            to increase government revenues by increasing the efficiency\n            and effectiveness of the Government's Tax\n            Administration Service (SAT). There are seven project\n            components. The first component supports better taxpayer\n            service by simplifying tax return filing using more advanced\n            electronic means, upgrading taxpayer surveys, creating\n            permanent focus groups, carrying out studies, and\n            establishing service standards. The second component\n            improves management by assessing SAT's staff,\n            documenting the results in a Human Resource Management\n            System, upgrading training, and introducing performance\n            management policies and systems. The third component\n            established an information hub by appointing a Chief\n            Information Officer and implementing a series of databases\n            that will be optimized for access and security. The fourth\n            component finances consulting assistance to devleop an\n            information and communication technology strategy aligned\n            with SAT's business strategy and goals, develops\n            strategies for information security and integrity, and\n            introduces more efficient automated administrative systems.\n            The fifth component supports the compliance process. The\n            sixth component supports compliance control and enforcement.\n            The seventh component supports strategic planning and\n            quality control."}, "docdt": "2002-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
