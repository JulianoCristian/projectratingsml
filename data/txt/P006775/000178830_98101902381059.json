project is a first phase pilot\n            scheme to form a basis for major watershed protection\n            efforts in the future. It aims at developing viable\n            technical and organizational programs for: (a) slowing the\n            erosion of agricultural land and water catchment areas and\n            siltation of hydropower reservoirs; (b) maintaining aregular\n            water supply for irrigation and domestic use; and (c)\n            controlling runoff to alleviate flooding. To achieve these\n            goals, the project consists of pilot investments in three\n            subwatersheds of the Magdalena River designed to introduce\n            soil conserving cropping patterns, improvement of livestock\n            management, reforestation of marginal or extremely\n            vulnerable areas and construction of minor structures to\n            reduce erosion. The project also includes research and\n            evaluation components to provide the basis for preparing a\n            follow-up project covering the entire Upper Magdalena\n            Watershed. The project's major risk involves the\n            Borrower's capability to mobilize and lead the\n            activities of the various institutions participating in the\n            project. To minimize this risk, the appointment of qualified\n            managers to lead the project and the execution of subsidiary\n            agreements defining responsibilties of key participating\n            agencies would be conditions of effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1981-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
