Physical implementation of\n            the project was generally good. Equipment and furniture are\n            generally appropriate, although some unsuitable equipment\n            has apparently been procured for the vocational training\n            centers, perhaps because of a lack of consultation with\n            employers on equipment lists. While both the vocational\n            training centers and the project teacher training centers\n            were fully staffed, adequately funded, and operating at\n            capacity at the time of the completion mission, there is\n            still a need to ensure that all such facilities,\n            particularly those supported by the Bank, are properly used\n            before further capacities are financed by the Bank. Finally,\n            the pre-investment studies financed under the project have\n            had little impact, as the operating ministries did not\n            follow up the recommendations. Overall, the project has not\n            fully achieved its main objectives. This report also\n            inlcudes the Project Completion Report."}, "docdt": "1981-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
