          of the Government's adjustment program for addressing\n            key macro-economic and sectoral issues facing Togo over the\n            medium term. The objective of the program would be to\n            achieve a sustained level of growth of close to five percent\n            per annum by the early 1990's. The major elements of\n            the program are flexible agricultural producer pricing in\n            response to world market conditions, a new industrial\n            incentive system complementing the enterprise privatization\n            effort and a new legal framework for the parastatal sector.\n            Further to this, the program would promote transparency in\n            public enterprise accounts, reforms in fiscal policy to\n            replace structurally the agricultural and phosphate taxation\n            of former years, and a strengthened public investment\n            program. To achieve these objectives, detailed action\n            programs for agriculture, industry and commerce, parastatal\n            sector management and public resource management would be\n            implemented. Further, the Government would seek debt\n            rescheduling on favorable terms as a pre-condition for\n            mobilizing non-project concessional aid to meet its external\n            financing requirements."}, "docdt": "1988-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
