                                    Lessons from the One Window Service Office initiative in Cambodia

           Citizen Outreach is a key part of the One Window Service        community to explain the new services. After the launch,

           by the OWSO and District Ombudsmen (DO) and raise
           awareness about the quality of service delivery they can
           expect. Outreach activities held after the OWSO opening
           then focus on getting feedback on the quality of services,
           which is important to ensure continued high performance
           of the OWSO. Increasingly, outreach has drawn on the
           support of local non-state actors to partner with the
           OWSOs for greater impact. This DFGG Learning Note
           describes the efforts and challenges of outreach and
           communication in the newly launched citizen service
           centers in Cambodia.

           Efforts to Date
           In the first year of the project, OWSO and district officials
           organized traditional Khmer events as public awareness
           campaigns at the launch of each OWSO site. In each district
           center, this consisted of a street parade, with music and       Launch Campaign of the OWSO in Oddor Meanchey
           flags, announcing the opening of the OWSO over
           loudspeakers. This was followed by a large public forum to
                                                                           Following this positive experience, in 2013, NCDDS/DST
           explain the new services in more detail. At these outreach
                                                                           engaged 4 NGOs to help OWSOs conduct this new model
           activities, promotional materials were distributed. At the
                                                                           and expanded set of public outreach and social

           campaign on national and local TV and radio to advertise
                                                                           What works?

           After the OWSOs were launched, the district                     indicates that brochures with detailed information, such as
           administration organized monthly ‘citizen hours’, during        supporting documentation requirements and price lists,
           which a group of 20-30 citizens meet and talk with the          help customers come to the OWSO prepared and
           District or Municipal Governor on any topic. This allowed       potentially eliminate extra trips to the OWSO to obtain this
           citizens to ask questions about the OWSO or raise any           kind of information. As a result, the national team has
           concerns they may have about operations. Corrective             developed brochures that are distributed in each district.
