           Setting the Stage for Partnerships 1
           One of the important contributions of the DFGG project
           was to establish a network of practitioners among state
           and non-state actors.        Prior to implementing social
           accountability tools, organizations introduced language on
           social accountability and associated principles and
           mechanisms at shared workshops. Such events established
           a platform on which to develop partnerships, introducing
           particular governance principles, such as accountability,
           which traditionally has not been employed in the local
           discourse. In some instances, activities fostered joint
