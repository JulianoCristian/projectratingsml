                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Achievement of the PDO is considered moderately satisfactory. Under the Support to State Institutions component 1A, the project enhanced demand for good governance by
                         strengthening the role of the Arbitration Council which has performed well. Since 2009, it has handled over 1300 cases, (cf. target of 514), involving over 835,000 workers, 90% of
                         which were women. 75% were resolved (cf. target of 73%). An expert audit determined that the quality of awards handed down was 86% (cf. 83% target). The level of confidence,
                         credibility and effectiveness in the Council increased to 74% (cf. baseline of 41%). Under Component 1C, the One Window Service Office (OWSO), thirty-six OWSOs now deliver
                         194 services delegated by 10 ministries. Government ownership of OWSO activities is significant, with 19 OWSOs having been constructed with counterpart financing. The OWSOs

                         period. Client awareness and understanding of the OWSO initiative improved with scores ranging from 57-97% (cf. target of 60%). District Ombudsman offices provide a channel for
                         communicating complaints about services received. Continued monitoring and oversight will be needed to ensure sustainability of transparency and accountability standards, as will

                         Under the Non-State Actors component 2 (NSAC), demand for good governance was enhanced as activities by 35 NGOs triggered changes in local service delivery and governance
                         practices among participating institutions: citizen monitoring with project grants exceeded targets: over 226 communes (cf. target of 100), 330 schools (cf. target of 175) and 153
                         health centers (cf. target of 80) have been engaged in civil society monitoring processes, with 75% reporting positive impacts on governance, and over 95% of those state institutions
                         monitored (e.g. health centers, schools) improving performance and services delivered.

                         A Social Accountability Framework (SAF - The Strategic Plan for Social Accountability in Subnational Democratic Development) which provides a platform for subnational social
                         accountability activity with reciprocal efforts by government, was endorsed by the Deputy Prime Minister and civil society representatives in July 2013, and will become the primary
                         vehicle for ongoing social accountability activity by non-state actors after project closure. "Information for Citizens" materials have been completed by the government, and guidelines
                         and resource materials for Civil Society Organizations (CSO) completed by The Asia Foundation (TAF), with support from the World Bank. The SAF promotes change at the local
                         level. It requires the public display of rights, standards and performance information, open budgets and budget literacy, and citizen monitoring, through an agreed community
                         scorecard process. These social accountability activities will be rolled out to rural primary schools, health centers and communes. Both CSOs and government will carry out defined
                         activities for effective implementation.

                         Under component 3, the Project Coordinating Office increased demand for good governance by managing the Governance Learning and Resource Center and a series of learning
                         events on governance, and conducted a Social Accountability Forum for over 400 state and non-state actors. Learning program events have been reoriented to support the
                         forthcoming implementation of the Social Accountability Framework.
