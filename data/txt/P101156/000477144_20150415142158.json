"theme": "Other accountability/anti-corruption,Participation and civic engagement", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Demand for Good Governance Project\n            for Cambodia received a moderately satisfactory outcome\n            rating with substantial risk to development outcome. Both\n            the Bank and Borrower received moderately satisfactory\n            ratings for their performances respectively. The PDO was not\n            revised. Following the mid-term review (MTR), the project\n            was restructured by dropping sub-components 1B and 1D and\n            amending the results framework (RF) as follows: (a) targets\n            related to the dropped sub-components were also dropped; (b)\n            all self-assessments were removed, as the measure had proved\n            unreliable; (c) all compiled indicators were removed as they\n            were aggregating different units; (d) qualitative indicators\n            were introduced where quantitative data collection was\n            distorting activities; (e) targets were increased to\n            appropriate levels. As a result, the original 90 indicator\n            results framework was reduced to 27 indicators. There were\n            also two restructurings that resulted in an additional 18\n            months of the project. Several lessons were taken from this\n            project including the following: (1) what is not possible\n            nationally, is possible locally. State/non-state\n            partnerships were stronger and more concrete at local level\n            than at the national level, (2) when citizen voice is\n            constrained, collective mechanisms are more successful than\n            individual. Component 2 provided useful lessons on the\n            levels of empowerment needed to fully utilize individual\n            grievance redress mechanisms, (3) information on its own\n            does not stimulate change; information plus monitoring makes\n            a marked difference, (4) social accountability requires\n            capacity and action on both the demand and supply sides.\n            Action by both civil society and government, matching demand\n            and supply-sides, is necessary for systemic change in the\n            voice-accountability-responsiveness process, (5) alternative\n            labor dispute resolution can be an effective substitute for\n            formal forms of conflict resolution, (6) don\u0092t expect\n            consistency or uniform improvements in governance.\n            Potentially transformational programs to enhance citizen\n            engagement and social accountability, administrative\n            accountability and transparency can take place in a\n            challenging governance context, (7) build in flexibility,\n            utilize operational management tools and enable government\n            to resolve its own issues, and (8) different aspects of\n            governance, can be successfully incorporated within one\n            project and produce significant achievements, but\n            cross-fertilization should be allowed to emerge naturally."}, "docdt": "2015-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
