1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At appraisal, Cambodia had achieved impressive growth and poverty reduction for over a decade. The
importance of strong governance was recognized in key policy and planning documents, including
broad engagement and multi-stakeholder partnerships. However, in practice, despite its being critical
for sustaining and ensuring equal benefits of high growth, the governance environment remained weak.
Efforts to strengthen governance were uneven and slow, the state lacked responsiveness, and
expanding the role and engagement of non-state actors in governance was challenging. Civil society
organizations were generally uncoordinated. Non-state actors’ (non-governmental organizations,
community-based organizations, the media) had limited understanding of the transparency and
accountability of government systems, performance and standards, the interface between civil society
and the state was undeveloped and all actors had limited experience of demand-side interventions. In
this context, the proposed project brought together “supply-side” with “demand-side” approaches for
good governance.

At the time of preparation, the opportunity for enhancing governance was nevertheless improving,
especially at the local level: a system of sub-national government with elected commune councils and
local budgets was established and a ten-year National Program for Subnational Democratic
Development being developed, the engagement of citizens in decision-making processes was
mandated and there was opportunity for improvement. Although the Royal Government of Cambodia
(RGC) had committed to significant Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets in social services,
the capacity of public administration and accountability institutions was weak. Progress on key
reforms was slow; corruption was constraining development assistance and outcomes.

The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (2005-2008, extended to 2011) aimed to help remove
the governance constraints affecting progress towards the MDGs. To provide a critical foundation for
improved pro-poor service delivery and reducing corruption, the CAS included a governance pillar
designed to strengthen private sector development (PSD), natural resource management (NRM), public
financial management (PFM), and to promote decentralization (D&D) and citizen partnerships. In the
CAS Progress Report dated April 17, 2008, the Demand for Good Governance (“DFGG”) Project was
specifically featured (see CAS report, Box 3) to provide support to non-state actors and state
institutions to help tackle governance challenges and support country reforms. The project would
expand and consolidate existing ‘islands of good governance’ in order to increase voice, transparency,
accountability and responsiveness. Given the challenges, it was noted that a long-term approach was
needed to strengthen institutions and mechanisms on both the demand and supply-sides. At appraisal,
the Bank was already providing leadership on supply-side and local governance reform and was
considered well placed to work with a broad range of state officials, non-state actors and reformers to
underpin efforts with demand-side activity. Bank support would also fill knowledge gaps, transfer
global best practice, and support adaptation to Cambodia.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO was to enhance the demand for good governance in priority reform areas by strengthening
institutions, supporting partnerships, and sharing lessons. The state and non-state institutions and
partnerships to be supported were those that promote, mediate, respond to, or monitor to inform
DFGG, and the PDO was to be measured through these sub-objectives. The PAD also referred to the
priority reform areas defined in the CAS governance pillar (PSD, NRM, PFM and decentralization/
citizen partnerships for better governance).



                                                  1
The key outcome indicators were grouped in four areas, each compiling a set of sub-indicators from
the six IAs. The composite indicators are shown in the table below. See also Annex 2.

                         performance and actions.


1.3       Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The PDO was not revised. Following the mid-term review (MTR), the project was restructured by
dropping sub-components 1B and 1D and amending the results framework (RF) as follows: (a) targets
related to the dropped sub-components were also dropped; (b) all self-assessments were removed, as
the measure had proved unreliable; (c) all compiled indicators were removed as they were aggregating
different units; (d) qualitative indicators were introduced where quantitative data collection was
distorting activities; (e) targets were increased to appropriate levels. As a result, the original 90
indicator results framework was reduced to 27 indicators, each specific to a PDO sub-objective and an
accountable Implementing Agency (IA) (See Annex 2).

1.4       Main Beneficiaries
The project was intended to support five state institutions as well as an unquantified number of non-
state actors, and the citizens of Cambodia generally. The original and revised beneficiaries are shown
in the following table.

mediating and monitoring processes. Five state institutions and 12 other        were to be targeted.
public institutions (such as local administrations and service providers)
would also benefit through actions that enabled their responsiveness.
Component 3: Project Coordination and Learning
Through the coordination and capacity and awareness building activities of      No change.
Component 3 the support to the Ministry of Interior was intended to benefit
an unquantified number of state and non-state participants of the Learning
Program and other public dissemination events, and to reach other national
ministry and subnational officials in the RGC.

1.5       Original Components
The project was structured in three components as follows.
Component 1: Support to State Institutions Support to state institutions covered three of the four
priority sectors defined in the CAS (PSD, NRM and Decentralization/citizen partnerships), operating
at the national and local level of governance, through the following sub-components/IAs:
     Component IA. Support to the Arbitration Council (AC) (US$2.34 million IDA implemented by
      the ACF). Labor disputes between workers and firms were a key blockage to PSD, reducing
      productivity and affecting poor workers’ livelihoods. The sub-component was intended to
      promote, mediate and respond to the demand for good governance in PSD by supporting a rule-
      based, predictable, fair and transparent process and institutional structure for resolving labor
      disputes thereby helping the RGC fulfill its responsibility for justice and dispute resolution.
     Component IB. Support to Ministry of National Assembly-Senate Relations and Inspection
      (MONASRI) (US$2.41 million IDA, implemented by MONASRI) was intended to promote and
      mediate DFGG by strengthening MONASRI’s capacity to inform citizens of their rights under the
      Land Law and provide an effective channel for citizen complaints and concerns to be expressed.
      The component intended to enhance DFGG in NRM.
     Component IC. Support to the One Window Service Office and District Ombudsman (OWSO/DO)
      (US$3.53 million IDA, implemented by the NCDD-S), was intended to strengthen DFGG in target
      districts by responding to the needs of citizens/small businesses for efficient, transparent and
      accountable administrative services; by providing an avenue for mediating complaints and
      concerns of citizens and small businesses regarding the district administration; and by promoting
      awareness and participation of citizens in decisions, policies, and programs of district governments.
      The component intended to enhance DFGG in the priority area of decentralization and citizen
      partnerships.

                                                         3
      Component ID. Support to Radio National Kampuchea (RNK) (US$2.38 million IDA,
       implemented by RNK), intended to strengthen public radio broadcasting as a mechanism to
       promote and mediate DFGG through an expansion of governance content in talk-back radio,
       public interest programming and audience share. The Component also envisioned continued
       technical assistance (TA) from the Ausaid-funded Australian Broadcasting Commission for the
       overall organizational capacity building of RNK. The PAD notes that it was intended to support
       citizen partnerships but the focus was on PSD, PFM, NRM and D&D issues.
   Each subcomponent intended to: (a) improve and scale up the existing operations; (b) pilot new
   initiatives (c) enhance communication and partnerships to support and extend functions; (d) build
   capacity; (e) improve facilities; and (f) provide merit-based pay initiatives (MBPI) to government staff
   and strengthen project management. The project financed TA and operating costs, as well as minor
   works to sub-components 1C and 1D, which led to its categorization as a category ‘B’ Environmental
   Assessment project.
   Component 2: Support to Non-State Institutions (US$4.27 million IDA implemented by TAF)
   intended to complement Component 1 by providing grants and assistance to non-state actors to scale
   up and pilot new social accountability activities enhancing DFGG, strengthen institutions and build
   capacity. Using constructive engagement principles, grants were envisioned to improve the
   responsiveness of state institutions with a number of sub-objectives relating to efforts to promote,
   mediate, respond and monitor.
   Component 3: Coordination and Learning (US$2.43 IDA, implemented by MoI Project
   Coordinating Office (PCO)) supported TA and operating costs for the overall project coordination of
   diverse themes and multiple institutions and efforts to enhance continuous learning, awareness-raising
   and capacity building on DFGG sub-objectives. The effort to bring together experiences and lessons
   was expected to facilitate the adoption of DFGG approaches and practices within and beyond the SIs
   and NSAs participating in implementation. The component included activities to support capacity-
   building, lesson-learning and communications.

   1.6 Revised Components
   The project retained the same three components; however, subcomponents 1B and 1D were dropped in
   the second restructuring due to poor performance. The resulting savings were reallocated to the well-
   performing components to expand their activities (see Section 1.7 and Annex 2).

   1.7 Other significant changes
   The project was restructured five times as detailed below. Changes in financing allocations are shown
   in Annex 1.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

   Preparation. The process of preparing the project was inclusive and consultative, including five large
   stakeholder workshops and a political economy assessment. Key local experts acted as advisors
   throughout preparation and the process considered promising, best practice initiatives. The scope and
   focus of the original design of the project were highly innovative and ground-breaking. While there
   were lessons to inform the individual aspects of the project, there was little experience of how they
   could be combined into a stand-alone demand-side project design. The rationale for a project that
   would tackle key issues of governance in Cambodia was strong, and consistent with RGC’s
   Rectangular Strategy, the five-year National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), and the CAS, and
   did not depend on efforts outside the scope of the operation. Although, there may have been some
   hesitation in some parts of the RGC during preparation, there were committed and visionary
   government counterparts that recognized the importance of improving governance in Cambodia. At
   the same time, some parts of the NGO community initially viewed the project with skepticism at the
   outset, unsure of the RGC commitment to the social accountability aspects of implementation.

   Design
   PDO. Although the PDO was aligned with key strategy documents, it employed newly emerging,
   Bank-centric terminology (DFGG) and may have been clearer if ‘enhanced DFGG’ had been spelled-
   out (as described by the DFGG definition), clarifying the four areas of action/sets of PDO measures –
   promotion, mediation, responding and monitoring – identified in the RF. At the outset at least, the idea
   of ‘demanding’ governance was unfamiliar in the country context, and in Khmer, the project adopted
   the title ‘local governance’ to emphasize the objective of reaching out to citizens and the weighting
   given to decentralization and citizen partnerships as a priority area.

   The PDO also referred to the broad priority areas of governance outlined in the CAS – PSD, NRM,
   PFM and Decentralization and citizen partnerships. The decentralization and citizen partnerships
   agenda fit very well with the primary counterpart (the MoI), the local focus and the development of
   state-non-state relations. Within the other priority areas, the design also included actions that were
   high risk and challenging: industrial relations, awareness-building and complaints handling regarding
   the Land Law and state broadcasting media, although these priority areas were not given the weighting
   (either by CAS outcome or by disbursement). It was prudent that a significantly higher proportion was
   applied to the area of decentralization and citizen partnerships, which was both able to deliver impact
   and had lower implementation risk. A counterpart was not found to pursue PFM so no PFM sub-
   component was included. A four year implementation period to achieve the objectives was rightly
   described as short for such a long-term governance change, but enabled the agenda to move forward
   with the opportunity for expansion and targeting after the project period. The RF was extremely
   complex with some 90 indicators at multiple layers. Compiled targets were not defined, and
   component targets were set very low (See Section 2.3 for additional details).


                                                      5
The DFGG project design rightly focused on three components: state, non-state and
coordinating/cross-cutting. DFG aimed to strengthen four ministries and an independent council, and
civil society actors. However the state component included four subcomponents, each with a different
IA undertaking a different priority area of activity, making a dense and cumbersome design. Given the
innovative nature of the project, the PAD provided significant leeway for restructuring to follow well
performing components at different decision-points in the project, but this would inevitably affect
efficiency. More in-depth analysis of these subcomponents could have reduced the project’s
complexity and narrowed its focus. Details by component follow:
Component 1
 Subcomponent 1A (AC) was well conceived in terms of objectives, stakeholders, capacity and
   structure, and built on earlier work financed by the International Labor Organization. The need for
   effective labor arbitration in the expansion of the garment industry, which represented 80% of
   exports (35% of total GDP growth) was well-predicted and of critical importance for PSD. The
   selection of an independent institution delivering alternative dispute resolution services was highly
   relevant, as was the AC’s potential to increase its capability and scope. The indicators identified
   for measuring progress were well selected, and the TA packages included in the component
   enabled the AC to carry out its functions effectively. Risks were also well identified and correctly
   rated. Two assumptions in the design of the AC component lay outside AC control: (i) that the
   structure of industrial relations would enable expansion beyond the garment sector and (ii) that a
   user-financing model involving unions, government and private organizations (which required
   stable industrial relations and had not been achieved elsewhere in the world) would be possible in
   four years.
   Subcomponent 1B (MONASRI). Land Law dissemination was important to promoting awareness
    and voice in a problematic area of governance, but these activities were very high risk in
    Cambodia, the IA did not have a track record, and there was no existing initiative to be replicated.
    In hindsight, the selection of MONASRI as an IA was inadequately investigated, and the state –
    non-state partnership approach, central to the DFGG objectives, was too ambitious for a new
    ministry working in unknown territory. Although the problems that arose early in the project in
    respect to civil society partnerships could not have been known during design, a more rigorous
    institutional assessment may have pointed to the issues of RGC ownership and capability, and
    questioned the inclusion of this sub-component in the project.
   Subcomponent 1C (OWSO). The highly innovative OWSO subcomponent was appropriately
    designed, built on a successful pilot (by the European Union AsiaUrbs project), and implemented
    by an IA with a strong Bank track record in local government and development (through the Rural
    Investment and Local Government project 2003-2011). The expansion of the one-stop-shop model
    of delivering transparent and customer-oriented administrative services to 24 districts was
    challenging, but doable. The project rightly prioritized the financing of this component, given high
    level commitment and RGC ownership. The planned expansion in each province was well justified,
    and attracted counterpart financing for construction further illustrating RGC ownership. The
    District Ombudsman (DO), already part of the piloted OWSO model, was included and rightly
    tested further, although integration with other subnational grievance mechanisms at the design
    stage may have helped embed it in subnational systems.
   Subcomponent 1D (RNK). The inclusion of a media component in a demand-side governance
    project was well justified. The identification of an IA which had the ongoing institutional
    strengthening support of the Australian Broadcasting Company provided a sound basis for
    launching a new area of work with the media, and the inclusion of an advisory committee to guide
    content and oversight had potential. However, given that RNK had no track record with the Bank,
    and had not controlled project finance, the inclusion of a large procurement (for the transmitter)
    was ill-advised. In hindsight, a deeper assessment of leadership and political ownership of the


                                                   6
    demand-side reforms may have led to a decision to consider other lower risk institutions with track
    records (e.g. Provincial radio), or to mainstream media activities across all components. The
    support from Aus-AID, identified at appraisal, was parallel TA with a broader institutional
    strengthening purpose, and should not have been identified as co-financing. Although risk
    mitigation measures were identified, the risk of RNK support was high.
In Component 2, the support to non-state actors (NSAC) was well structured to meet the PDO. The
effort to put in place a capable managing NGO (TAF) prior to appraisal was prudent, and the inclusion
of a multi-stakeholder grant-making committee to make decisions on NGO proposal selection lent
credibility, and addressed concerns of NGOs at appraisal. The emphasis placed on constructive
engagement was highly relevant, and the earlier Project for Enhancing Capacity for Social
Accountability (PECSA) (See PAD para 59) provided a sound basis for starting implementation. The
staged approach to grant-making was appropriate, with small learning grants leading to larger grants.
This approach – to building broad-based knowledge and capacity and creating political willingness
first and then transitioning to larger grants later – was the right one, allowing for significant and
incremental increase in awareness and understanding of social accountability, and reduced political
risk, albeit with the trade-off that the initial grants were small in size and duration. The key design
issue was a lack of budget for capacity building.
In Component 3, the MOI was the right ministry to coordinate project activities. Its high level
leadership was committed to DFGG principles, able to lead RGC in the development of civil society
partnerships, and had the mandate to promote sub-national change which was critical to the focus on
direct citizen engagement. While the political leadership and guidance of MOI was well identified, the
design overestimated the authority and capacity of a new PMU, the project coordinating office (PCO),
and the convening power of a newly appointed team in the hierarchies of government. Moreover, the
Research and Training Organization (RTO), the core consultancy designed to support the MOI for
delivery of the learning program was severely under-budgeted. The anticipated levels of coordination
and cross-over learning between very dissimilar activities were unrealistic and impractical, diverting
attention from component goals at the early stages. The idea of a PCO identifying synergies and
communicating generalized lessons for the other agencies was not appropriate given the context and
capacities.

Government commitment. Key reformers in the RGC reformers were directly engaged in the project,
were highly committed to the project goals and strong advocates for the change process envisaged.
This leadership commitment had depth in four institutions. In two ministries, however, (those
subsequently dropped) this ownership lay with individuals. A more thorough institutional assessment
would have flagged the need for broader and deeper institutional commitment. A second weakness
was the reliance of the state IAs on a performance incentive which was terminated by the RGC only
one year after the project started (later reintroduced as the Priority Operating Cost).

Assessment of risks. The overall appraisal risk rating rated substantial, should, in hindsight, have been
rated high. More substantive risk mitigation measures should have been included for those components
that were eventually dropped. As above, the risk of including two IAs without a track record could
have been considered more. Although the lack of capacity was flagged as a risk, the budgets and
mechanisms for retaining and developing sustainable capacity were insufficient. A number of risks
were underestimated: project complexity, project length, corruption, IAs without track records
working on the highest risk areas of the project, and the capacity of state institutions. On the other
hand, the risks associated with political will, partnership development, elite capture and political
sensitivity were much lower than envisaged. The PAD foresaw the potential need for reorientation
during implementation, but in hindsight, in order to promote governance innovations with state
institutions, a (strengthened) PCO could have managed an innovation fund for state institutions and
those without a track record (such as MONASRI, RNK, etc.) could have put forward proposals and
explained their commitment to DFGG objectives. This would have consolidated PCO’s role vis-à-vis

                                                   7
other ministries, enabled the flexibility envisaged in the design, and reduced project complexity and
risk.
Overall, (i) high level leadership in government was sound and visionary, (ii) the AC, OWSO, NSAC
initiatives were well chosen with clear objectives and a clear path to the PDO, (iii) the MoI was the
right Project Coordinator, but (iv) there were moderate shortcomings in the coordinating arrangements
and design of the learning program, and (v) two subcomponents and their IAs were inadequately
assessed.
Given the varying assessments of design and IAs of varying capacities and degrees of ownership, and
the complexity of the initial Results Framework, Quality at Entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

2.2       Implementation

Over the five and a half year implementation period, the project was restructured five times – two
restructurings lay outside the project control, and the project was twice extended (for a total of 18
months). An outline of the project’s key factors is presented below.

Termination of MBPI (1st restructuring). In December 2010, the RGC canceled the MBPI for staff
working on World Bank and other donor projects, in order to address imbalances in civil service pay.
Until this was replaced, after a one year gap, by the Priority Operating Cost (POC), effective January
2012, this removed incentives for consistent performance, and slowed project implementation. Several
factors affected capacity and staffing, and the components were able to resume their focus and meet
project targets. The effect of the cancelation on the project was tracked by the project and Bank teams,
but it was not possible to quantify.

Mid-Term Review (2nd restructuring). By the time of the MTR in June 2011, the project had
experienced implementation delays and was a potential problem project, at 34% disbursed. The MTR
thoroughly assessed progress and reached agreement on a Level 2 restructuring to: (a) delete
subcomponents 1B and 1D (thereby reducing the project’s complexity and the burden of coordination
required by MOI); (b) reallocate grant savings to expand the roll-out of OWSOs under subcomponent
1C, and to build capacity, institutionalize M&E, and reorganize the learning subcomponent in 3B; and
(c) revise the RF to improve reporting and focus on results. These changes are described below:

     Discontinuation of subcomponents. In sub-component 1B, MONASRI became non-compliant
      when it would no longer execute its activities according to the project principles of promoting
      demand for good governance through state-non-state partnerships and engagement with civil
      society. Subsequently, the new leadership of MONASRI notified the PCO that its activities should
      be dropped. This U-turn created a potential risk for the other well-performing areas of the project.
      At the time, it had disbursed US$460,000 (19% of its budget), resulting in Grant savings of
      US$1.96 million. In sub-component 1D, RNK was non-compliant due to a series of fiduciary
      issues (See Section 2.4), had veered away from the planned governance radio content, and was
      unwilling to work with the advisory committee created to ensure that the radio-programming
      stayed on the appropriate governance topics. As a result, this sub-component was dropped with
      US$750,000 (29%) disbursed, resulting in grant savings of US$1.93 million. The above deletions
      resulted in total savings of US$3.5 million.

     Expanding the OWSO (Sub-component 1C). Savings of US$2.5 million were reallocated to
      subcomponent 1C to expand the roll-out of the OWSOs from 24 provinces to 36 OWSOs
      (including five in Phnom Penh), thus increasing the number of beneficiaries at district level from
      1.3 million to 2.7 million.



                                                     8
   Expanding the Learning Program (Component 3). Savings of US$1.3 million were reallocated to
    Component 3, which was delayed due to weak staff capacity and the burden of coordinating this
    complex project. Moreover the Learning Program was badly delayed due to the failure of the
    procurement for a Research and Training Organization (RTO) (see section 2.1) and the lack of
    progress thereafter. It is unclear whether this outsourced arrangement, which may have resulted in
    better quality inputs, would have been preferable to the in-house, collaborative model finally
    implemented. Deleting two subcomponents reduced the coordination burden and the additional
    funds increased budget flexibility to address these capacity constraints.

   Revision of the RF. As subcomponents 1B and 1D were dropped, the relevant indicators were also
    dropped. With the reallocation of savings, some of the other subcomponents were expanded and
    their targets adjusted. The MTR also greatly reduced the complexity of the RF to improve
    monitoring, clarify and simplify results, and set appropriate targets (see Section 2.3).

Repayment of PPA (3rd restructuring) The project underwent a third restructuring in June 2012 due to
factors outside its control. Preparation of the planned LEAP project was delayed, and the RGC
requested that the US$0.97 equivalent (Advance Q7100) borrowed from the Bank’s Project
Preparation Facility, be repaid by the DFGG project grant. Although a contingency was available to
finance this repayment, the reduction in nearly US$1 million for DFGG activities tightened the budget
for all components and removed funds that could have been used to create a more robust foundation
for the project at closing.

Closing date extensions (4th and 5th restructurings). The Grant closing date was extended by a total of
18 months to provide IAs with more time to complete ongoing activities, enhance M&E, and finalize
post-project sustainability arrangements. This was necessary in part due to the lingering effects of
early delays, but also due to the effects of the 2013 election and the post-election unrest throughout the
country. The fourth restructuring reallocated funds to non-state actors so that they could consolidate
learning from the grants in the context of the newly signed Strategic Plan for Social Accountability in
Subnational Democratic Development (the SAF) the project had helped to bring about. The fifth
restructuring enabled the ACF to bridge financing and to enable the PCO to complete the learning
program, focused on capacity building for the I-SAF.

Factors supporting implementation. Despite the restructurings, and the removal of two subcomponents,
in overall terms, a complex and challenging governance project at appraisal was implemented by IAs
very effectively in the remaining areas, and without significant disruption or negative consequence.
The primary factors enabling this implementation were: (a) the senior MOI leadership, ownership and
commitment, which ensured project difficulties were resolved promptly and effectively, mobilized
additional funds for the roll-out of OWSOs, and ensured local NGOs were supported in the field; (b)
the collaborative and stable partnerships formed by the AC and TAF with the MOI. Both IAs
performed with independence, credibility and capability, made possible due to capable staff, robust
systems and structure, and adherence to governance principles. In the non-state actors component, (c)
the constructive engagement approach (designed into the project) was taken-up effectively by local
NGOs, (d) the non-state actor grants were managed by TAF effectively, and (e) the post–MTR
targeting of the non-state grants focus produced more measurable impacts in communes and local
service delivery, and produced a foundation for the next stage of action – the Social Accountability
Framework (discussed in section 2.5).

Factors affecting implementation. Three primary factors affecting DFGG implementation were: (a)
capacity constraints in state IAs (OWSO and PCO). The OWSO subcomponent suffered from national
level capacity issues created in part by the expanded roll-out and the partial loss of key staff.
Difficulties in recruiting competent staff, appointing/ managing consultants, as well as the RTO
(discussed above) slowed PCO start-up and overall implementation. The final co-production approach,

                                                    9
introduced to utilize the expertise of other project IAs, resulted in greater ownership, a more solid
foundation, and increased PCO capacity. Nevertheless the Learning Program started to succeed only in
the final 18 months of the project with more intensive state-non-state partnerships; (b) the space for
dissemination and communication through large public events was narrowed during implementation
due to strained RGC-Bank relations;; (c) the 2013 elections and post-election uncertainties diverting
attention and affecting the environment for governance activity in the post-election period (e.g. large
dissemination events).

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. In 2008, the measurement of social accountability was new and the RF sought to describe
project achievement through composite results. The RF was extremely complex and burdensome on
the IAs. It included 90 indicators (37 PDO indicators and 53 intermediate indicators), compiled sub-
indicators of different types, and required extensive monitoring on the part of each IA. The
measurement of partnership development was quantitative. The measurement of capacity included IA
self-assessments. The strengthening of M&E capacity was rightly included in the design, but M&E
budgets at appraisal were too low for the task and the lack of appropriate expertise in the marketplace
to formulate baselines was not sufficiently considered. Details are provided in Annex 2.

Implementation. M&E was rated unsatisfactory 18 months after effectiveness. IA baselines were
problematic due to low budgets, the limited capacity local firms, and the complexity of measuring
changes in governance in the short term. Early in implementation a number of methodological
problems emerged: (i) because the composite indicators aggregated units of different types, misleading
and meaningless information was being produced, (ii) the use of self-assessments for IAs to each
measure capacity improvements was resulting in unreliable intermediate information and was
impossible to calibrate across the range of actors, (iii) counting concepts such as ‘partnerships’,
created significant distortions (superficial short-lived actions rather than longer-term commitments)
affecting quality; (iv) some quantified indicators were quantifying the unquantifiable (e.g. trust,
constructive engagement policy change); and (v) targets were too low on a number of indicators.

The complexity, length and distortions in the RF, largely beyond the control of the IAs, were
addressed in the second restructuring following the June 2011 MTR. The RF was simplified: the
number of indicators was reduced from 90 to 27; the aggregation of dissimilar data was discontinued,
and the accountability of each IA for achieving results was clarified, and most targets were increased
to higher levels. The revisions allowed IAs to report qualitatively on concepts such as partnerships and
trust to encourage more depth. The instruments for measurement for each IA were clarified. This
reorganization, simplification and clarification led to improved IA capability and commitment to the
measurement of results, and the achievement of targets. The reallocation from the two dropped
subcomponents also made room for more appropriate M&E budgets and ensured higher quality
technical inputs for M&E and learning. M&E improved as revised results were intensively monitored.
Noteworthy were the ACF’s retrospective audits, and a baseline, midline and endline evaluation
reporting on client satisfaction; the transaction data and lessons learned by OWSO, the qualitative
reporting on non-state actors in Component 2, and sound final evaluations by OWSO and PCO. By
closure all results were reported with only minor shortcomings.

Utilization. The sub-indicators of the RF helped to identify problems with the two dropped
subcomponents. For the remaining components, although most indicators showed incremental progress,
ongoing monitoring enabled the use of results to enhance a number of decisions specifically regarding
gender participation, OWSO outreach, and non-state grant size. Some PCO indicators relied on an
independent evaluation commissioned towards the end of the project, so this information was only
available for the final forum. However, this did not have an impact on sustainability arrangements
because lessons were identifiable and transparently discussed and reflected in post-project

                                                  10
arrangements. More critical was the use and documentation of lessons learned discussed in section 6.
The process of collecting data for the ICR was straightforward and accurate. All IAs were familiar
with their (revised) indicators, and had results documented. Gaps in results reporting had been
identified well before the end of the project and were resolved in IA end evaluations. Therefore,
although M&E design was problematic, M&E implementation and utilization after the second
restructuring improved considerably and the data available for the ICR is considered robust.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards. The project was categorized as Category B, partial assessment. One safeguard was
triggered, Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) due to the construction of a broadcasting mast by
RNK and offices (on government land) for the OWSO and Governance resource and Learning Center
(GRLC). The EIA assessment was disclosed on January 7, 2010. No safeguard issues arose during
project implementation. The broadcasting mast was discontinued in the second restructuring, leaving
only office construction. Procedures (screening, design, and compliance) were included in the project
implementation manual and generally understood. Supervision checks on civil works found that the
project was compliant but with gaps in the safety aspects of implementation of the environmental
management plan at two of the 24 OWSO construction sites. ISRs noted these gaps were rectified.

Financial Management. Overall, financial management performance was acceptable through early
2012 and then improved to satisfactory until closing. Two financial management issues arose: (i) an
exchange loss of about US$312,000 which caused uncertainty in the IAs; and (ii) slow disbursements
in the first two years of the project. The auditor’s opinions for the financial statements for each fiscal
year (up to FY 2013) were unqualified. The submission of the audit report for the first three fiscal
years was slightly late but on time thereafter. Some interim financial reports were submitted late in
2009 but timeliness gradually improved after the second restructuring. There were no complaints from
contractors, consultants or suppliers for late payments until early 2014 when the PCO encountered
some liquidity issues, but these were satisfactorily resolved.

Procurement. Procurement was generally well done, although processing was slow early on due to
low budgets, especially for consulting firms with international expertise. This highlighted the
importance of budgets being relevant to the task and required expertise. Concerns were also raised
with regard to the lack of understanding of and capacity for procurement and non-compliances within
the RNK subcomponent before its discontinuation. This problem was openly discussed and
government coordination and resolution was commendable. Despite this, and the necessity to use the
Independent Procurement Agent for large procurements, all the standard procurement activities were
successfully implemented without serious issues. However, the need to procure NGOs as firms was a
problem. In a project where partnership development with civil society organizations was central to
achieving the PDO, establishing relationships which are contractual and require competitive selection
as though they were firms, was inappropriate. This could have been avoided through more flexibility
in procurement processes, but all NGOs were procured competitively as firms and affected the way
‘partnerships’ were established with PCO and OWSO.

Good Governance Framework. Like other projects in Cambodia, DFGG utilized a Good
Governance Framework (GGF) as a management tool to enhance and track project governance (PAD
Annex 11). The GGF matrix was formulated around eight categories: procurement; financial
management; disclosure; civil society role; complaints and remedies; code of ethical conduct;
sanctions; and other project-specific elements. Compliance with the project GGF was managed by the
Project Coordinating Office, and it was a used effectively as a tool for the project to track and act on
issues arising in the project. The non-compliance with the GGF by RNK was immediately resolved (as
mentioned above) and illustrated the effectiveness of the GGF as a tool to take action and resolves
problems within the project. All other IAs complied with the GGF throughout the project.

                                                   11
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The arrangements for the post completion operation of each IA are as follows:
   Arbitration Council. The AC adopted a financial sustainability plan and established a multi-
    stakeholder financing facility for future financing of its operations which reduced reliance on any
    one donor, and enables primary stakeholders (employers, workers, government) to opt in to
    operational financing over a defined period. Although most institutions similar to the AC (in
    upper-middle or high-income countries) are fully-funded by government, in Cambodia, that
    particular financing model could undermine the AC’s independence and credibility. Therefore the
    AC rightly pursued a model that will rely on multiple external sources of financing for at least a
    decade The AC has committed to use the financial management arrangements and the project
    principles to ensure fiduciary and governance standards (see DFGG LN 10).
   One Window Service Offices. The OWSO has strong high level political support and thus robust
    post-project sustainability. The MoI institutionalized the Office of One Window Service Affairs
    (OOWSA) under its General Department of Local Administration (GDLA). OWSO is included in
    the three-year and annual budgets of the decentralization reform, financed by RGC and the multi-
    donor basket; staff and budgets have been established for daily operations. At the district level,
    sustainability arrangements: (i) integrated the OWSO in the District Administration and budgeted
    for all DOs; (ii) required OWSOs to operate under (very low) budgets of the District Municipal
    Fund; (iii) a joint MOI-MEF regulation that permits the district to withhold about 35% of OWSO
    revenue to pay staff bonuses. All the standards for transparency and performance established under
    the project are government standards, and are not expected to change. National capacity issues are
    part of the NCDD capacity building under the government reform.
   Non-state Actors Social Accountability. The DFGG project IAs and the Bank took steps early on
    to create a more sustainable platform for social accountability activity that would draw on best
    principles and lessons – including coordinated government and civil society action. The landmark
    agreement between CSOs and NCDD led to the signing of the Social Accountability Strategic
    Plan for Subnational Democratic Development in July 2013. This strategic plan, known as the
    Social Accountability Framework (SAF) recognizes that social accountability is an important
    instrument for the strengthening of local democratic governance, highlights the vision, objectives
    expected outputs and key principles, and defines key strategies that will change the scope of local
    governance processes, namely: information for citizens, open local budgets and citizen monitoring,
    as well as the defining the key role of civil society in facilitating these processes. Through a
    collaborative process involving three DFGG project IAs, an Implementation Plan (known as the I-
    SAF) (2015-2018) was developed for its operationalization, and it was integrated into RGC’s
    second implementation plan for the decentralization reform, and included in the government’s five
    year National Strategic Development Plan. The joint implementation of this multi-sector
    Implementation Plan, which will be implemented in all rural communes, health centers and
    primary schools, began in early 2015 in 20 districts, while the large tranches of financing were just
    or still being mobilized. Stakeholder capacity development was started in the final stages of
    DFGG and will be taken forward in component 3 of the Implementation Plan.
   Project Coordinating Office and GRLC. The PCO transitioned to the Governance Resource and
    Learning Center (GRLC) in early 2013. The GRLC now provides facilities for the learning
    program and future state–non-state learning and dialogue, and the PCO shift to the GRLC
    organizational structure. The MOI allocated budgets to cover operational costs in 2015, but the
    final departmental status of the GRLC is pending the restructuring of the MOI in 2015. The GRLC
    is slated to become the hub of I-SAF capacity building and was included in the capacity building
    plan. Until this part of the I-SAF funding is in place in mid-2015, utilization has declined.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives. The objective of enhancing governance remained relevant in Cambodia where weak
governance is of critical concern in the three CAS priority areas tackled by the project. The
governance approach promoted by the AC in mediating labor disputes in the garment industry
remained relevant throughout the project period and will remain of paramount importance to the
national economy considering this industry’s prominent (80%) share of exports. The decentralization
efforts promoted by the OWSOs were expanded and are being replicated and expanded further. The
PDO was consistent with the Bank Group’s Cambodia CAS (2005, extended to 2011) and remains
consistent with the more recent RGC’s Rectangular Strategy (2013-2018) and the NSDP (2014-2019).
The PDO could have been more specific as to the areas of intervention to be addressed by the project.
On balance, the relevance is rated substantial.

Design. The project was highly innovative and sought to tackle weak governance in PSD, NRM and
decentralization and citizen partnerships, employing a combination of state and non-state actors and a
large NGO to mitigate risk of failure. Although disparate in nature, the three project components were
appropriate to contribute to achieving the PDO. However, project design involved six IAs in five
ministries, some of whom had no prior experience with donor financing. The project scope was too
complex for a four-year project, the coordination requirements were excessive, and capacity building
and resourcing were insufficient. As mentioned in Section 2, the RF was too elaborate for the IAs,
affecting an effective assessment of project achievements. In view of these shortcomings, project
design is rated modest.

Implementation: During implementation, the number of IAs and subcomponents was reduced to
focus on the better performing activities. The relevance of the remaining components was recognized
by RGC and non-state actors in their efforts to sustain operations after closure: the operationalization
of the SAF as a part of a national program, the ever-increasing reliance of the garment industry on the
Arbitration Council, and the expansion and institutionalization of the OWSO and GRLC in the
MOI/NCDD. This relevance was confirmed in ICR consultations as a wide range of stakeholders –
ministries, civil society, unions, employers, and civil society organizations – were very concerned by
the closure of the DFGG project.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

        Rating: Substantial/High
The PDO sought to enhance DFGG (the extent to which citizens and other non-state actors voice their
concerns and hold the state accountable, making it responsive to their needs) in priority areas. The
measures of this enhanced voice-accountability-responsiveness are changes in promotion, mediation,
monitoring and responsiveness. The original priority reform areas addressed by the project were PSD
through Component 1A; NRM through Component 1B; and promoting decentralization and citizen
partnerships through Components 1C and 1D and Component 2.

The three priority areas were not equally weighted. The CAS outcomes (to which DFGG was to
contribute to) and the percentage of project financing both indicate that the decentralization and
citizens partnership agenda was the dominant priority area, and the three sub/components (OWSO,
RNK and NSAC) focused on it. Including proportionate amounts for coordination and learning, the
relative weighting of the priority areas at appraisal (by financing) was: PSD – 16%, NRM – 16%, and
D&D – 68%. By CAS outcome it was: PSD – 17%, NRM – 17%, and D&D – 66%.

Achievement of the PDO is measured through outcome indicators in each priority reform area (i.e.,
strengthening PSD, NRM, and D&D) in four broad categories: promoting DFGG, mediating DFGG,
responding to DFGG, and monitoring to inform DFGG.

Private Sector Development (17% appraisal budget, 19% revised total)

                                                            14
   Promoting DFGG: Awareness among unions and employers of the role and benefits of labor
    dispute resolution in the private sector increased from 41% to 75% (against an original target of
    61%).
   Mediating DFGG: By closure, the AC had heard 1331 cases, supporting 835,117 workers to
    access labor resolution services (against an original target of 210 cases, and a revised target of 721
    cases), of which 75% were resolved (against an original target of ‘actual’, and a revised target of
    73%), reflecting both increased awareness of the services offered plus the credibility of the
    organization. The percentage of union /employer representatives reporting a high confidence in the
    independence, credibility and effectiveness of the AC reached a high of 86% in 2013 (against an
    original target of 60% and a revised target of 76%).
   Responding to DFGG: The project target for policy responsiveness (‘actual’ in the original RF)
    was assessed qualitatively. Overall the policy response was highly satisfactory – the successful
    negotiation and implementation by ACF of a ‘MoU for Binding Arbitration’ signed by employer
    associations and unions.
   Monitoring DFGG: no indicator at appraisal. An independent assessment of the quality of arbitral
    awards (called a quality audit) showed that 86% were considered to be satisfactory or above
    against international standards (no original target, revised target 85%). The AC utilized this
    information to improve performance - increasing the quality of awards from 76% to 86% over the
    life of the project. The AC successfully engaged with NGOs to promote awareness early in the
    project.

Based on the above, achievement of the objective of enhancing DFGG in the priority area of PSD is
rated high.

Natural Resource Management (16% appraisal budget, 3% revised total)
 Promoting DFGG: Enhanced awareness of land law was dropped
 Mediating DFGG: Mediating land law was dropped
 Responding to DFGG: N/A
 Monitoring DFGG: Dropped

Based on the above, achievement of the objective of enhancing DFGG in the priority area of NRM is
rated low.

Decentralization and Citizen Partnerships (70% appraisal budget, 77% revised total)
 Promoting DFGG:
   ‒ The level of awareness and understanding of accountable and transparent OWSO services
       increased from a baseline of 24% to an average of 77% (against an original target of 30% over
       the baseline and a revised target of 60% for an OWSO operating for three years).
   ‒ Enhanced awareness through RNK was dropped.
   ‒ Awareness and understanding of citizens to the benefits of local social accountability activity
       increased from 60% to 78.62% (awareness) and 78.95% (understanding) between 2011 and
       2013 (against an original target of 10% over baseline of zero, and a revised target of 70%).
 Mediating DFGG:
   ‒ The DO received and processed 151 complaints about OWSO services, and resolved 90% of
       these (against an original target of 90 complaints/40% resolved, and a revised target of
       865complaints/73% resolved). The percentage of DO clients who report a high confidence in
       the independence, credibility and effectiveness of the district complaints handling system
       reached 95% for independence, 85% for credibility and 89% for effectiveness in a sample of
       19 OWSOs in 2014 (against a target of 60%). The lowest rating in the range was 70%.
   ‒ Complaints and feedback through RNK radio programming were dropped.
   ‒ 75% of citizens participating in social accountability activities reported positive results
       (revised target 70%). The non-state actors’ grantees mostly used collective rather than
                                                   15
       individual methodologies for complaints resolution. The independent midline/endline for
       NSAs noted enhanced capacity of NSAs to mediate between citizens and local state actors,
       and the utilization of innovative forms of mediation (citizens hours, forums).
   Responding to DFGG:
    ‒ OWSOs carried out 435,562 transactions for citizens and small businesses (against an original
       target of 22,000 and a revised target of 250,000 transactions). On average, 90% of clients and
       96% of elected officials were satisfied with these services in the new OWSOs. The cost and
       time of processing transactions for citizens was reduced by 42% (cost) and 54% (time) on
       average for a basket of services (against a revised target of 50% time and cost; no target for
       this responsiveness was included at appraisal). The extent of broader government
       responsiveness in OWSO was also measured: 10 ministries delegated 194 functions (against
       an original target of 7 ministries/undefined number of functions, and a revised target of 10
       ministries/125 functions).
    ‒ The D&D/CP policy response was highly satisfactory and triggered a number of key changes
       embracing transparency, accountability and partnerships in national policy. The development
       of a national SAF and Implementation Plan, signed by RGC and civil society, its inclusion in
       the Five-Year National Strategic Development Plan, and incorporation in government budgets
       (mentioned above). SAF encompasses wide ranging new policies on citizen information on
       performance, displaying local budgets and civil society partnerships to build awareness and
       conducting annual monitoring of local services in all schools, health centers and local
       governments. Policy changes resulted in the posting of fees in public agencies, the regulation
       to establish one-windows in all districts and the institutionalization of the national office of
       one window service office affairs. In addition, there were a number of changes to transparency
       and partnership in communes, as well as more specific or local changes in policy and practice
       (e.g., pay no-bribe signs, posting of budgets).
   Monitoring DFGG:
    ‒ NSAC – A total of 226 communes, 33 districts, 153 health centers, 330 schools and 5 OWSOs
       were monitored (against an original target of 17 and revised targets of 100 communes, 20
       districts, 80 health centers, 175 schools and 6 OWSOs). Both the state institutions and non-
       state actors’ components engaged in monitoring. The percentage of SIs which utilized
       monitoring to take corrective actions to improve performance (and for which this was reported
       to have a positive impact) was measured in communes, health centers, schools, achieved 99-
       100% in each (against the original target of 33% and the revised target of 70%).
    ‒ OWSO – Five NGO partnerships were formed and funded to both promote and monitor
       performance in 17 OWSOs. Various actions were taken to improve performance: removal of
       staff, posting of informal payment signs, sanctions against lateness etc. Prior to being dropped
       the RNK sub-component engaged in an effective monitoring (listener feedback) survey.
Based on the above, achievement of the objective of enhancing DFGG in the priority area of
decentralization and citizen partnership is rated substantial.

        3.3 Efficiency

        Rating: Substantial
An economic analysis of the benefits anticipated from the project investments was not carried out at
appraisal. The project was expected to generate economic benefits because poor governance impedes
growth in critical areas of the economy. It specifically referred to the contributions of the ACF and
OWSO/DO components as improving governance relating in the domestic private sector by improving
labor relations and improving the registration of small businesses respectively. An analysis of each
follows.

Arbitration Council. (Appraisal cost: US$2.76 million; Completion cost: US$2.86 million). The
benefits of the AC stem from the ability of workers and employers to access accountable labor dispute
resolution services that provides a channel for their voice, adjudication of disputes and responsive
action. The AC exceeded key targets for the number of cases heard, and their resolution. By closure,
project financing had helped resolve about 280 disputes annually (1331 total) between employers and
unions/workers, 78% of which had resulted in strikes. The economic benefits of the AC are measured
in terms of: (i) the net daily profit to employers, and (ii) the value of workers’ wages for the number of
days when strikes were averted. Based on conservative figures for average wages, average profits and
accurate annual data on strike return-to-work orders and case resolution rates, the net present value
(NPV) of the AC component for the period 2009-2014 is US$13.1 million and the ERR is 258%. A
retroactive calculation of the economic benefits at appraisal, using the same methodology and
appraisal targets was US$2.46 million and an ERR of 150%. The reason for this remarkably high
return is the productivity and importance of the garment sector as an employer and producer in the
Cambodian economy, and the confidence in the AC as the preferred means of arbitration. With regard
to financial efficiency, there are no unit rate norms available for arbitration in Cambodia, but the
appraisal (2009) cost of arbitrating a case was US$2,095 which declined to $892 per case by
completion in 2014 (41% of appraisal cost). The reduction in cost per beneficiary was approximately
the same (42%). As required at appraisal, the AC raised funds from stakeholders (mostly international
firms) in support of its activities. During the project period, this amounted to 15% of its incremental
operating costs. The efficiency rate of this subcomponent is rated High.

One Window Service Office. (Appraisal cost: US$4.67 million for 24 OWSOs; Completion cost:
$6.62 million for 36 OWSOs). As foreseen at appraisal, the OWSOs brought economic benefit to
citizens and small businesses seeking licenses and registration to conduct business and livelihood
activities. These benefits included the opportunity cost of waiting for the provincial ministry to process
requests (i.e. the consumer not operating their business or vehicle), and the reduced cost of obtaining
these services. Using client feedback data, the following were calculated: (a) the value of the reduction
in time taken to obtain services (that affect livelihoods); and (b) the savings on transactional payments
(including lower informal fees). Based on conservative assumptions, the net present value for the
OWSO component is US$6.38 million, and the ERR is 95%. A retroactive calculation of the
economic benefit at appraisal, using the same methodology and appraisal targets was $US -790,519
and an ERR of -9%. With regard to financial efficiency, the unit cost per OWSO at completion was
US$183,888, which included higher cost OWSOs in Phnom Penh. This is marginally lower than the
US$194,583 estimated at appraisal. The appraisal cost per transaction (including the financing of the
buildings) in 2009 was $105. This had declined to $45 in 2013 due to the far higher number of
transactions. The average cost recovery ratio of OWSOs (i.e. service fee revenue as a proportion of
operating costs), reached 273% in the last quarter of the project, against an appraisal target estimate of
80%, although this varies substantially according to the coverage population: 22 of the 24 OWSOs
passed the 80% target by closure, and 17 OWSOs generated over 150%. The efficiency of this
subcomponent is also rated High.
Economic benefits are summarized below and detailed in Annex 3.

With regard to the other components, the PAD highlighted the difficulties in measuring the economic
benefits of land law dissemination (component 1B), governance radio programming (component 1D),
or capacity building (components 2 and 3). A qualitative description of the benefits of the other
sub/components is provided below.

Non-state Actors Component (Appraised cost: $4.27 million; Completion cost: $4.90 million).
These benefits were not calculated at appraisal as a grant-making process does not allow the nature of
the investments to be predetermined. It was anticipated, however, that five SIs (plus 12 other SIs) and
an unquantified number of citizens/service users would benefit from the voice-accountability-
responsiveness activities that promoted, mediated, responded to and monitored good governance. The
enhancements in voice-accountability-responsiveness (detailed in Annex 3) brought about by the
project were: (i) improvements in local officials /service providers performance; and (ii) needs-based
allocation of commune resources. Both of these result in more efficient use of public resources. The
second round of large social accountability grants (in local services and communes) brought benefit to
health centers (longer opening hours, more reliable emergency response, more availability of
medicines) and to schools (improved teacher attendance and timeliness, improved communication with
parents, improved cleanliness). Each improvement was achieved within the existing mandate and
budget of the facility/service, by improved performance of the service providers.

With regard to efficiency improvements, by example, in Cambodia, students are meant to receive 228
days tuition per year. However, assuming that students actually receive only 80% of those teaching
days (20% of the time teachers are not present), this is an accountability, not a quality, problem
affecting the efficiency of school resources. In the 330 schools where DFGG monitoring activities
were carried out, 79% parents reported improvements in teacher attendance, i.e., about 200 students
(per school) received between one and 56 days more teaching time. If we assume a low proportion of
this change was sustained for one year, for instance five days more teaching time per teacher, for the
four teachers in a primary school, for 260 schools, this resulted in 5800 more teaching days. With
regard to financial efficiency the $3.2 million in grants were provided on a competitive basis; 38
NGOs were selected according to quality and cost criteria. The management overhead for the grants
was 6%. Typically, social accountability activities are low cost (the cost of facilitated meetings and
travel time), but they are new to Cambodia and require a supportive learning process. The costs of this
capacity building, facilitation, supervision, monitoring, dissemination and other administrative costs
incurred by TAF amounted to 23%. Component 2 also contributed $400,000 (8%) to the design,
development and testing and training for the nationwide roll-out of the Social Accountability
Framework. This opportunity was unforeseen at appraisal, as the policy framework was not in place or
predicted and funds were reallocated for the first extension. This represents the cost of transitioning
from an ad hoc social accountability initiative to a nationwide framework in one generation. The
component design was also cost effective in so much as it drew in and built on the resources of
participating organizations. NSAC efficiency is considered substantial though not quantifiable.

Component 3: Coordination and Learning (Appraised cost: $2.43 million; Completion cost: $3.39
million). The benefits of the coordination and learning component were not considered in economic
terms at appraisal. Consistent with other capacity building aspects, activities were expected to bring
both economic and non-economic opportunities that come about as a result of improved governance.

                                                     19
Component 3 specifically aimed to increase the capacity of state institutions and non-state actors for
enhanced voice-accountability-responsiveness, by developing skills for promotion (communication),
mediation (dispute resolution), responsiveness (performance improvements) and monitoring (third
party and citizen monitoring), by enhancing state–non-state actors dialogue, by enhancing cooperation
with non-state partners, and disseminating knowledge.

At appraisal Component 3 was expected to support an array of coordination activities. At the MTR
these largely administrative activities were not considered to bring cost-benefits to the participating
IAs. Subsequently project coordination was streamlined, allowing the PCO to focus staff on the
Learning Program. The coordination of the project was carried out at a cost of US$1.6 million, or 9%
of the total cost (cf. 8% at appraisal). Component 3 also constructed a Governance Resource and
Learning Center (GRLC) at a cost of $300,000, this was included in the PAD, but not budgeted. The
Learning Program was carried out at a cost of $1.62 million, 50% of the component cost (cf. 38% at
appraisal). The Learning Program developed new modules for replication during and after the project,
and 50% were delivered with international expertise. The development of each thematic module
piloted with an average of 100 participants, cost approximately US$70,000. Due to early reported
inefficiencies in coordination and the slow progress, the efficiency of Component 3 is rated Modest.

Changes during implementation affecting efficiency
   Component 1A and 1D: Support to MONASRI and RNK. At the time of completion, the IDA
    expenditures of these two subcomponents amounted to US$0.45 million and US$0.75 million,
    respectively, covering operational costs, training and consultants, goods purchased were
    transferred to government, together representing 6% of total costs. The benefits of these
    expenditures are negligible.
   Project financing was also used to repay expenditures amounting to US$0.97 million made from
    the Project Preparation Advance for the proposed LEAP (5% of total costs). The benefits of
    this expenditure are negligible.
   Extensions. The project extended for 18 months (all four components for 12 months and two
    components for an additional six months). This meant that the project management and
    administrative costs continued for longer than anticipated. However 36 OWSOs were built rather
    than 24, the AC averted strikes in the final two years than in the first four years. The NSAC
    component used the extension effectively to support the Social Accountability Framework post-
    project implementation.
Consolidating the efficiency assessments of the individual components into a single efficiency rating is
difficult due to the vast variations in performance. Overall, the two biggest components (ACF and
OWSO) had high efficiency (representing 49% of total project costs), NSAC was substantial (25% of
project costs) and the PCO component efficiency was modest (15% of project costs). Dropped
subcomponents were low/negligible (6% of the project costs, and 5% (spent on another for another
project). Based on these sub/component efficiency assessments and weighted against proportionate
costs, the efficiency rating for the project is Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall outcome rating combines the relevance rated modest, efficacy rated substantial, and
efficiency rated substantial and is rated Moderately Satisfactory. It is noted, however, that some
priority areas (private sector development and decentralization) vastly exceeded this rating on all sub-
objectives, and that in overall terms, the decentralization and citizen partnership priority area was more
heavily weighted at appraisal and completion. It is also noted that action was taken early to resolve

                                                   20
relevance and inefficiencies, but the cancellation of two sub-components and the slow start of the
learning program, accounts for the moderately satisfactory overall rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development
Poverty Impacts. A lack of government accountability and responsiveness, and corruption
disproportionately affects poor households from linking into economic growth and improved services.
While difficult to measure, better governance and citizen engagement in development processes
impact on poor communities; the project alleviated these losses. Through the ACF activities, over
700,000 female workers (who send remittances to poor rural families) earning approximately
$2.20/day, were able to access dispute resolution services that improved their overall wages and
working conditions. Through the OWSOs, the project enabled citizens/small businesses to obtain
services more quickly with less opportunity cost. Through the NSAC component, the project improved
the services delivered in 226 communes, 153 health centers, and 330 schools, thus supporting HHs
experiencing services poverty, to access better schooling and health care. Each of these examples –
justice services, administrative services, health and education services, as well as the services delivered
in the communes – impact on the poor’s livelihoods, their marginalization and their ability to function
within the formal sector.

Gender Aspects. The Arbitration Council’s services were highly beneficial to women and girls: 90%
of the workers involved in cases heard were young rural women working in the garment industry. The
AC has a strong track record of responding to the voice of women, hearing and upholding disputes on:
unfair dismissal (11% of cases), allowance and entitlement disputes (45%), working conditions, health
and safety (18%), as well as maternity leave. The ACF employs an unusual number of women in
technical and managerial roles, showing that gender equity is possible in Cambodian institutions (see
DFGG LN14). The Non-State Actor’s Component measured and created mechanisms to improve the
participation of women, seeking to shift from passive to active mechanisms of engagement (see DFGG
LN 4). Although project timeframes were too short to demonstrate and quantify the impact of lessons
on project activities, lessons on the roles of women have been adopted in the nationwide roll-out (SAF
Policy Note 3). Component 3 also made efforts to improve equity in the skills development of women
through the Learning Program, holding a high-level roundtable. Overall, significantly higher
attendance of women was not achieved because the latter I-SAF events were considered the most
important and attracted more senior, and therefore male participants. Nevertheless, the project paid
very careful attention to gender results, and this intensive exposure strengthened hands-on experience
of IAs in managing the issue. Gender lessons of social accountability, applicable elsewhere, have been
documented in learning and policy notes, and have been incorporated in the nationwide I-SAF.

Social Development. Empowerment and inclusion of beneficiaries was achieved through awareness-
building, community mobilization, citizen engagement, and civil society strengthening. Factory
workers were empowered to engage in the AC’s predictable and fair dispute resolution system (the
willingness of workers/unions to use the services of the AC doubled by closure, indicating increased
awareness and mobilization). The OWSO engaged with CSOs in third party monitoring, enabling new
levels of citizen feedback on government performance. Efforts to build client awareness and government
systems to break the normal informal payment trends empowered citizens. Citizens showed they preferred
facilitated, collective feedback systems to individual complaints handling mechanisms. In Component 2,
74% of citizens reported enhanced engagement in decision-making processes of communes/districts, health
centers and schools (see Annex 3). Capacity of 45 CSOs was built to mobilize citizens to understand and
seek better governance, and to develop the skills to deliver the nationwide I-SAF in the next stage. Trust
between non-state actors and community groups with local government agencies improved during
implementation, through the processes of constructive engagement, mainly with commune councils
and participating IAs. However, short timeframes affected the degree to which these impacts could be

                                                    21
transferred to other parts of government, and the sustainability of local social impacts will require
follow-up in the planned rollout of the SAF.

B. Institutional Change/Strengthening

Strengthening institutions was included as a means to achieving the PDO and is an intermediate
outcome. The institutions strengthened were both state and non-state, and included those associated
with the AC and OWSO subcomponents, as well as the ministries hosting components (NCDD, MOI,
MOLVT) and a large number of NGOs made-up of grantees and those that contributed directly or
benefited from the project indirectly. Although the project reached most of the targets, the indicators
do not fully capture types and levels of institutional strengthening. The ACF now describe its
institutional integrity in terms of the principles of good governance (see DFGG LN10). The level of
transparency achieved in the OWSOs was unprecedented in the Cambodian context and triggered
change across other ministries (see DFGG LN12). Third party monitoring was adopted as a
mechanism to monitor performance for change, but aspects of the OWSOs, such as functional
delegation, staffing and complaints handling, are still sub-optimal (see all OWSO LNs). The
strengthened skills and attitudes of the MOI to partner with non-state actors was recognized in the
feedback for this ICR. The development of partnerships in 2015 for the I-SAF will indicate if skills
and attitudes have been transferred and strengthened organizational capability, or was limited to
individuals. As for RNK and MONASRI, both organizations learned from participating in the project,
but did not benefit from the institutional strengthening originally intended and have not been targeted
subsequently by other initiatives.

C. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
There were no unintended negative consequences. Perhaps the primary unintended positive outcome
is the joint agreement on a Social Accountability Framework in which both the state and non-state will
work together to improve the performance of local level institutions. The inclusion of the SAF in the
RGC Five-Year National Development Strategic Plan is a significant policy outcome. This
collaborative process of civil society, DFGG IAs and the World Bank has triggered significantly more
financing for social accountability in Cambodia, the adaptation of CSO budgets and programming to
enable their immediate participation; and the inclusion in NCDD annual work plans financed by a
basket of donors. A second positive consequence is the enhancement to the efficiency and quality of
local services in health and education – the multi-sector local initiative for citizen engagement has
provided the structure for nationwide engagement with teachers/principals and doctors/health workers,
and set up a multi-ministry platform that was not possible before the DFGG project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

        Rating: Substantial
Looking forward, the likelihood and impact of external changes that would affect the development
outcome are largely the same as those encountered during the second half of the project. They include:
unpredictability and politicization of industrial relations, the possibility of a new NGO law that could
affect state/non-state relations, divisions between ministries, and weak middle-level government
capacity. However the project has already experienced each of these constraints and successful
outcomes were achieved nevertheless. On balance, because the enabling framework for these project
governance activities is improving, but country governance is still problematic and a number of
components will continue without external support, the external risk is assessed as substantial.
With regards to internal factors, due to the cancellation of the problematic subcomponents, the project
was more robust at closure than it was at appraisal, and ownership and understanding of demand-side
governance in PSD, D&D (and PFM), was significantly higher than at appraisal. This ownership in
three of the four remaining IAs, significantly reduces risk. The follow-on structures and systems are in
                                                  22
place for the ACF, OWSO and NSAC, moving activities out of project and into program/government
budgets. Decisions and actions taken prior to completion ensured practical mechanisms were in place.
The risk of the project investments not being used is assessed as follows:
   The agreement and commitment to implement the SAF to enhance the enabling environment for
    civic engagement (CAS outcome 3) that provides a platform for action, have mainstreamed
    Component 2, and created a new platform for coordinated financing. A range of donors including
    USAID, SIDA, EU, SDC are engaged directly or indirectly, and large international NGOs (Save
    the Children and World Vision) have started long-term programmatic commitment to reach 70%
    of districts in three years. The MEF has endorsed Bank efforts to seek Japan Social Development
    Fund grants to support CSOs facilitate local level implementation and this process is well
    underway. The risk is currently moderate.
   To improve mechanisms for decentralization (CAS outcome 2), the institutionalization of the
    OWSO office as a department in the MOI and significant ownership by the Deputy Prime Minister
    should ensure the continuation and expansion of OWSO activities. Regulations for national level
    staffing and budgeting are in place and directives sent for all districts to set up similar windows for
    MOI services, using their own financing. The model has already been copied to a number of other
    ministries illustrating broader change processes. The risk that OWSO activities will end is low, but
    there is a risk of slippage in quality of staff performance. This risk is therefore moderate.
   To continue to alleviate industrial relations constraints through the AC, establishment of a multi-
    stakeholder financing facility for AC operations has resulted in new tranches of financing and an
    institutionalized mechanism for development partners to continue support (SIDA and SDC signed
    agreements in late 2014). The process of establishing, in the longer term, a user-financed initiative
    will continue, backstopped by this predictable donor support. Risk of slippage in the quality of AC
    services is negligible; financing risk is low for the next two years, but moderate for the medium to
    long term.
   The capacity built through component 3B is fully utilized for SAF implementation. Participants
    are already engaged in this process. The risk for sustaining knowledge is linked to the risk of SAF
    implementation. Although the GRLC has been institutionalized in the Ministry of Interior and is
    included in the SAF capacity building plan, donor financing is still being discussed. The risk is
    substantial until this is completed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

A demand-side governance project was strategically relevant, aligned with the RGC policy and the
CAS, and addressed a significant weakness in Cambodia’s development. A number of important
reformers were identified. The project had significant gender and social development aspects as it
sought to enhance the voice and empower citizens, workers, users of services. During the preparation
and design phase, client interaction and cooperation led to a long list of potential areas of investment
and then a final shortlist formed a joint and mutually agreed project design.

Although the vision was innovative, the selection of six implementing agencies each with very
different objectives within this governance arena, created a set of activities that were only integrated
through a complex conceptual framework and a mandate to compile results and exchange lessons. In
hindsight, the use of a Bank-centric acronym ‘DFGG’ may have been better spelt out using the key

                                                    23
words in its definition (voice-accountability-responsiveness) and the use of the word ‘demand’ was
inappropriate in the Cambodian context, as it was translated as ‘local’, but there was solid
understanding among key project stakeholders by appraisal. The reference to key priority areas in the
title was not adequately specific (and one was dropped before appraisal). The magnitude of the results
framework in the PAD (90 indicators) was unmanageable, with indicators compiled to produce
confused measures, and some indicators quantifying difficult concepts such as partnerships and trust.
An M&E framework was well-defined, but budgets were set too low to accomplish the intended task
(see Section 2.3 for further elaboration).

Risks were identified and mitigation measures introduced but, in hindsight, the risk rating of
substantial should probably have been high. Risks caused by the selection of two implementing
agencies without a track record were underappreciated, as were the risks relating to project complexity
and project length.

Components 1A (AC), IC (OWSO), and 2 (NSAC) were innovative, well designed and appropriate for
the context. Components IB and ID were well justified but contained design features, such as the
inclusion of the purchase of an expensive piece of technical equipment, that were well not well-suited
for inexperienced IAs. MOI was the right ministry to be responsible for component 3 (capacity
building) but the burden placed on a new PMU to create cross-learning in a disparate project was
impractical, and the difficulties in coordinating were underestimated. No quantitative economic or
financial analysis was performed to inform project design (see section 3.3 for further discussion). The
team did undertake FM and procurement assessments for each IA and a Good Governance Framework
was put in place to provide additional fiduciary risk mitigation measures. Implementation
arrangements relied on a salary performance incentive for government staff (which was cancelled by
the RGC in 2010).

Preparation was undertaken by a large, experienced team with an appropriate skill mix. The team
identified key stakeholders in government who championed innovation and reform and carried out
extensive stakeholder interviews and some analytical background work to support technical design.
The team was well aware that it was operating in unchartered territory in Cambodia and in the Bank,
and sought and received guidance on project design from leading members of the Bank’s Governance
community. Aware that implementation might not be straight-forward, the team attempted to build into
the PAD the flexibility to modify implementation arrangements during the course of the project. The
overall approach to project development was pragmatic and appropriate.

Due to the design shortcomings of two of the six IAs, and the complex and difficult RF, as well as
some lack of clarity around the PDO, the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

        Rating: Satisfactory
Project management was initially exercised from Washington DC. The Bank team was active and
engaged during the start-up phase of the project, conducting three supervision missions before the end
of 2010, working with government on difficult procurement processes and tackling start-up challenges
across six IAs. The decentralization of team management to experienced international staff in the
country office in late 2010 was timely, enabling more in-time support and problem solving, especially
to address the issues emerging during the early stages of implementation which put the achievement of
the development objective at risk. Working with the Project Coordinator, intensive Bank supervision
inputs and processes proactively identified, resolved and helped mitigate emerging risks. Consistent
with best practice in operations, the 2011 MTR was used effectively to: (a) take action on the two
subcomponents that were not performing; (b) reduce the complexity of the project systems, especially

                                                  24
the M&E and coordination; (c) focus the remaining activities on achieving the development impact
intended within their priority area. Given the sensitivity of dropping two subcomponents that were
non-compliant and the context in Cambodia, the team received the EAP Turn-around Award for
project supervision in 2012 for getting the project back on track.

In addition to the use of the MTR to reduce the risk in a changed country context and focus on impacts,
four aspects of technical supervision are noteworthy: (a) rigorous use of project management tools to
manage and resolve project risks (especially the results framework and good governance framework);
(b) thorough monitoring of results, and the tracking of the quality and availability of IA reporting of
each indicator following a simplification and rationalization of the results framework; and (c) intensive
inputs to support the challenging project content, and (d) thoroughness and candor of the ISRs.
Fiduciary oversight was in place throughout and FM support was timely and supportive; procurement
support and capacity building was made available, although procurement processes were not always
consistent with project objectives (see section 2.4 above). The response to fiduciary issues when they
arose in the RNK component was rapid, forceful, and appropriate and enabled MOI, as project
coordinator, to take appropriate action. The team’s attention to monitoring the implementation of the
GGF across all components of the project reflected the extent to which fiduciary matters were
approached and was essential for a project focused on improving governance.

The team restructured the project three times to ensure effective implementation as noted in Sections
1.7 and 2.2. (Two others lay outside project control.) There was significant Bank oversight due to
restructurings and early project governance issues, and a high degree of reliance on Bank technical
inputs, advice and dialogue. The end evaluation noted that the Bank’s role was intensive, but critical to
ensure quality. The attention given to post-project sustainability to ensure transition arrangements after
project closure was highly commendable, especially given the uncertain conditions in Cambodia. The
support focused on institutionalizing the state initiatives (AC, OWSO, GRLC) and ensuring social
accountability (NSAC) became embedded in country systems through the Social Accountability
Framework (SAF), an arrangement not achieved in other countries. Synergies (particularly with
health/education) were developed in project implementation that had not been possible at appraisal.
Noteworthy was the embedding of PFM through open local budgets in the SAF, an idea which had not
been included in the design, but which contributed to reaching a priority area in the CAS.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The overall bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory on the basis of rating Bank
performance in ensuring quality of entry as moderately unsatisfactory and quality of supervision as
satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
        Rating: Satisfactory
Government ownership and commitment at entry were positive among key reformers, involving six
ministries, although the project was developed during a period of concern about governance in
Cambodia. Although the enabling environment for a demand-side governance was not clear in overall
terms, the regulatory framework for the various parts was largely in place or to be put in place through
the project, and remained consistent for the project activities, largely sustained through the post-
election unrest in 2013, and concerns regarding a restrictive NGO law. Early consultation was broad
and stakeholder engagements relatively open. However it took five months to fulfil the conditions of
effectiveness, largely due to the various subsidiary agreements, which in hindsight reflected project
complexity. The final appointment of key staff suffered from the weak middle level management

                                                   25
characteristic of the Cambodian civil service, and was affected by the cancellation of the MBPI, soon
after effectiveness. These shortcomings were, nevertheless, only moderate at entry.

With strong commitment to the PDO from a senior Deputy Prime Minister, the relationships and
coordination at the higher levels were consistent and open, with government willing to take the steps
needed to rectify and ensure smooth implementation. Except for the change in the status of the MBPI
early in the project, counterpart financing was provided on time including the transition to government
financing during the extension period. Government performed well in swiftly and amicably managing
the resolution of the non-compliance of two IAs (see below). The resulting project scope was
preferable, with high levels of ownership in all aspects, and lower risk with a more predictable set of
ministries. The high-level leadership and ownership in the MOI consistently supported project
implementation. Leadership support enabled the increase in IDA and counterpart funds for an
additional 50% OWSOs than originally planned. Transition arrangements were addressed seriously
(see section 2.5). The endorsement by the MEF of Bank financing for ongoing social accountability
was a critical signal of improved government understanding of the importance of demand-side
activities to enhance local development and service delivery. The RGC made laudable efforts to
maintain the focus on the PDO and to resolve issues emerging in implementation, shortcomings were
minor, making the rating for government performance in implementation satisfactory. Overall, a
complex and challenging governance project was implemented without significant disruption or
negative consequence resulting in a strong satisfactory rating. These two ratings (for entry and
implementation) are combined to a satisfactory rating.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The IA performance rating was overall, moderately satisfactory. This reflects an average of the hugely
different performances by the different IAs.
   The Arbitration Council’s performance was highly satisfactory due to committed, sound
    understanding of the PDO and take up of good governance principles in operations. The AC was
    ready and well-staffed for implementation. Engagement with key stakeholders was maintained
    throughout with significant success in binding partners to arbitration. Implementation was smooth.
    M&E was well-executed and utilization triggered adjustments. The AC effectively traversed a
    difficult period of post-election industrial unrest in late 2013. Although the election created a more
    difficult context for dialogue, and it was resolved prior to completion, earlier finalization of the
    financial sustainability would have been preferable.
   MONASRI performance at the time of discontinuation in 2011 was moderately unsatisfactory.
    The lack of commitment to the PDO was recognized quickly, and the subcomponent was dropped
    thus avoiding an unsatisfactory rating.
   The OWSO performance was satisfactory overall, meeting most of the targets with significant
    ownership from the MOI. Greater expansion took place than was originally planned. The OWSO
    team had a significant challenge to set up new forms of transparent/accountable administration. It
    delivered what was required, met nearly all targets, and adapted the functions to suit the context.
    However vastly adapting the OWSO model being replicated was a challenge. In hindsight, this
    requirement was too ambitious for the capacity and the timeframe available. A number of minor
    shortcomings affected the potential of the component: a lack of strategic capacity in the national
    team, slow resolution of problems and weak communication between the IA and the PCO and the
    Bank – although these did not significantly hinder the project team reaching targets.
   RNK performance was also rated moderately unsatisfactory prior to being dropped. In 2010,
    fiduciary non-compliance was exacerbated by a decline in the commitment to the PDO, and

                                                   26
    unwillingness to action mitigation measures. This would have resulted in an unsatisfactory rating,
    however timely action was taken to discontinue the subcomponent by RGC.
   The Asia Foundation performance was satisfactory. TAF commitment and ownership of the PDO
    were high throughout, with strong engagement with other non-state actors, and generally good
    relationships and coordination with key partners. TAF was ready to implement, and cooperative
    with RGC in establishing a hitherto untested relationship. There were no significant fiduciary
    issues. Commitment to the follow-on stage was exemplary and inputs were of a high quality
    despite funding constraints. Minor shortcomings were the slowness to complete M&E, linked to an
    unsteady transition to new management during implementation.
   The PCO performance was moderately satisfactory overall. This is justified by the strong
    commitment by MOI leadership, effective high level coordination and project to the PDO and
    consistent management of all relationships, flexibility of implementation, quality and candor of
    M&E, and adherence to project governance and fiduciary compliance. PCO ensured Component 2
    NGO grantees were supported in the provinces and implementation blockages were resolved. The
    shortcomings in implementing the learning program were moderate by completion with a very
    strong finish that was key to sustainability. In hindsight, the candor of the MTR process, the
    willingness of the RGC leadership to address problems, and the actions subsequently taken by the
    RGC and the Bank to restructure the project under difficult country circumstances were key to
    effective implementation.
Consistent with the approach taken through implementation, these component ratings were weighted
based on percentage project financing giving an overall rating of moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
On the basis of the justification provided in (a) and (b) above, the borrower’s overall performance was
rated moderately satisfactory. At the time of project closing, the borrower had complied with the
covenants and agreements needed to achieve development outcomes.

6. Lessons Learned
(a) Key lessons for demand-side governance and social accountability
   What is not possible nationally, is possible locally. State/non-state partnerships were stronger and
    more concrete at local level than at the national level. Despite hierarchies in communities, and
    exclusive decision-making spaces, there are common aspirations for improved livelihoods, and
    better services. The success in the citizen monitoring of local services in Component 2 illustrated
    what can be achieved within the local framework of implementation. Even in a weak governance
    environment, structured social accountability processes, can be undertaken effectively, produce
    results, and be relevant to state and non-state actors and citizens in a community.
   When citizen voice is constrained, collective mechanisms are more successful than individual.
    Component 2 provided useful lessons on the levels of empowerment needed to fully utilize
    individual grievance redress mechanisms. These were rarely used and far less effective than
    collective platforms for of social accountability, which enabled different community groups to
    communicate in safe spaces with more honest and complete feedback. This kind of collective
    monitoring and reporting, when facilitated by independent actors, with established local
    relationships to the people and the officials, can be quite successful in addressing local concerns
    and bringing about local level service improvements (Component 2).



                                                  27
   Information on its own does not stimulate change; information plus monitoring makes a marked
    difference. Information-only activities conducted in Component 2 were not effective as a
    mechanism to hold government to account or improve responsiveness in low-capacity contexts.
    However combined information (promotional) and monitoring processes that adopt structured,
    pre-designed tools, can have an immediate and tangible impact. To enhance the usability of
    information, selectivity of information is as important as facilitation. If information (e.g. on
    specific rights and standards) is targeted to inform and empower citizens, they can better engage in
    a feedback and accountability loop. The quality of feedback in monitoring processes improves
    dramatically, and the responsiveness of officials takes on a more concrete form.
   Social accountability requires capacity and action on both the demand and supply sides. Action
    by both civil society and government, matching demand and supply-sides, is necessary for
    systemic change in the voice-accountability-responsiveness process. The project’s joint action,
    joint capacity building efforts in which state and non-state actors learn about the processes
    together, underpinned and strengthened results. Developing skills to convene multiple stakeholders
    and to facilitate dialogue are extremely important to the success of social accountability
    approaches, especially where the political space has been historically limited. Non-state actors
    grants showed it was possible to bring about significant change (responsiveness) within the
    mandate of the organizations engaged (e.g. schools, communes).
   Alternative labor dispute resolution can be an effective substitute for formal forms of conflict
    resolution. Arbitration systems, adapted to context, can be a viable, productive and reliable option
    to address industrial relations. The Arbitration Council component showed how an independent,
    adjudicative institution that provides accessible, cost-free labor dispute resolution services, can
    flourish if it is independent, credible and effective. Given that its value and confidence have been
    maintained even within the volatility and politicization of Cambodian industrial relations, the
    Cambodian model might be replicated in other countries with weak judicial systems and
    unpredictable governance.

   Don’t expect consistency or uniform improvements in governance. Potentially transformational
    programs to enhance citizen engagement and social accountability, administrative accountability
    and transparency can take place in a challenging governance context. The project triggered
    changes in policy and practice that were not predicted and not consistent with the generally weak
    governance context in Cambodia. Both the Social Accountability Framework and the steadiness of
    the Arbitration Council illustrate that governance change can come about one bit at a time, not all
    changes are uniform or consistent across the whole governance arena.

(b) Key lessons for wider application

   Simplicity in design, scope and measurement. The DFGG project design (with six IAs at appraisal)
    and a results framework (with 90 indicators) was too complex for a governance endeavor.
    Innovations or engagement with new counterparts can be prepared and carried out under
    innovations fund, reducing risk and making the project structure simple and manageable. The RF
    should have been defined and organized to clearly attribute PDO results to IAs, unlike units should
    not have been compiled, and the number of indicators reduced to promote ownership and
    familiarity with results.
   Build in flexibility, utilize operational management tools and enable government to resolve its own
    issues. DFGG illustrates how a project can be restructured en route to refocus on achieving the
    PDO. When two components could no longer meet the PDO, the team utilized management tools
    (RF, GGF, legal covenants and risks matrix) to enable intra-governmental action to resolve
    complex operational issues. Understanding the dynamics of multi-ministry projects, supporting
    government leaders with time for dialogue and action, taking incremental steps, and delivering on

                                                  28
    agreements reached, empower governments to resolve problems themselves. Risks could be
    decreased and ownership enhanced.
   Different aspects of governance, can be successfully incorporated within one project and produce
    significant achievements, but cross-fertilization should be allowed to emerge naturally. Given the
    lower costs of governance projects, combining implementing agencies under one umbrella can
    make sense for efficiency. IAs of differing types can coexist in a single operation if they are
    allowed to focus on their goals. However, the need to force unnatural cross-learning and sharing
    should be kept in check. DFGG showed that cross-fertilization was better achieved around
    concrete tasks, than compilation and coordination of unlike lessons and results. This was
    impractical and time consuming and did not have discernible benefits to the project teams.
   Demand-side governance needs the engagement of government reformers, constant and intensive
    supervision, and appropriate time horizons to make a sustainable difference . The commitment of
    government reformers, and close implementation support was key to the project achieving the
    results. Commitments made at appraisal, i.e. that the project was a part of a long term engagement
    – needs to be backed up with Bank and government commitment that survives changes in
    government and Bank leadership. Without follow-on it is necessary to focus the end stage on
    (possibly premature) institutionalization and independence, risking longer term effectiveness.

    Annex 2. Outputs by Component


    Component 1: Support to State Institutions

1A. Support to the Arbitration Council

    Brief description/relationship to PDO. At appraisal the Arbitration Council (AC) support was intended
    to enhance the development of a credible mechanism for resolving disputes between employers and
    workers. The component aimed to contribute primarily to the ‘mediating’, ‘promoting’, and
    ‘responding’ elements of the PDO, specifically relating to enhancing voice, accountability and
    responsiveness in private sector development. The indicators measure the achievements of the AC in
    resolving cases (mediation), building awareness (promoting), and satisfaction (responding).

    Appraised activities, and implemented. To this end, financing for four sets of activities were appraised
    in the AC component,: (a) to enhance institutional integrity and sustainability, (b) to hear and make
    awards over labor disputes, (c) to support outreach and communication about the role of the AC, and
    build capacity of supporting organizations and representatives, and (d) to support recurrent operating
    costs and project management. Each of these activity sets were implemented as planned.

    Appraised estimates and expenditure incurred. At appraisal the budget for the component was $US
    2.34 million IDA ($US0.2 million Ausaid). The final revised allocation was US$2.61 million (IDA),
    and the final expenditure (including the revenue raised from other sources) was US$2.86 million. This
    represents an increase in 5% as set out in the minutes of negotiation, drawn from unallocated funds at
    midterm. The estimates and expenditures for these activity sets are shown in table 2.1.

    Appraised outputs/intermediate outcomes and achieved outputs/intermediate outcomes.

    Output 1: AC Institutional Integrity and Sustainability. Under this subcomponent, the appraised
    outputs intended for the AC to establish a Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group (AG), support and train
    arbitrators, develop an interface between stakeholders, and generate finance to contribute to operating
    costs.

    Actual outputs. In line with these intended outputs, the AC formed and facilitate an Advisory Group
    (with membership from MOLVT, ACF, unions and employers’ associations) which functioned
    effectively as a platform for dialogue; conducted 16 arbitrator roundtables, 18 board meetings, 14
    working group events; carried out a study of the economic value of the AC services in 2012; and
    carried out a market study regarding sector expansion. At closure, the ACF had generated over


                                                                                   32
$250,000 in contributions from large garment manufacturers as well as sporadic contributions from
ILO totaling approximately 15% of incremental operating costs. Signaling multi-stakeholder
confidence in the AC as an independent dispute resolution, a key unintended positive outcome of this
sub-component was Memorandum of Understanding on Improving Industrial Relations in the Garment
Industry (MoU) signed by employers and unions. This MoU committed the members of the Garment
Manufacturers Association (GMAC) and six key federations of unions to binding arbitration of all
rights-based disputes. This MoU was then re-signed in 2012, signaling continued confidence and
strengthening the AC role in monitoring and reporting on compliance with the binding awards.

Outcome and explanation of outcome. The achievement of the AC, recognized by government, the
private sector and the unions, was measured by the independence and credibility of the AC as a
mediator as shown in Table 2.2. The success of the AC as an institution that provides predictable fair
dispute resolution was achieved due to an adherence to their principles of good governance: integrity,
independence and neutrality, equity, participation, transparency, predictability and responsiveness (see
DFGG LN10). It is noteworthy that this indicator dipped during the post-election violence (76%), but
recovered within six months to 85% during the cases that resulted from the strikes and lock outs.

Lastly, the appraisal required and the project financed a financial sustainability strategy (2012). This
was followed by a high-level think tank in 2014. The subsequent decision to establish a multi-
stakeholder financing facility was instrumental in securing short and medium-term support (from
bilateral donors in 2015), and put in place an agreed roadmap for key stakeholders to contribute to
joint financing arrangements in the long-term.

Output 2: Labor Dispute Resolution: At appraisal, financing was planned to resolve 210 labor
disputes (35% over a baseline of 148) at a resolution rate of 68%, ensuring that 94% of awards were
issued within the 15 day period required by law. The AC also planned to publish and disseminate
arbitral award decisions. Another output of the AC was the publication and dissemination of arbitral
award decisions. AC arbitrators are expected to adhere to guidelines aimed at maintaining consistency
of legal decisions, and the arbitral awards create precedent for future reference. A further output was
the study of the economic value of the AC.

The actual outcomes for this labor dispute resolution which contributed to the mediation element of the
PDO are shown in table 2.3. From January 2009 to September 2014, the AC adjudicated 1331 cases,
reaching about 300 cases per year (330 in the last 12 months of the project). The increase in the rate of
cases heard per month over the life of the project, occurred mainly in the garment sector, which
comprises 80% of Cambodian exports. The case resolution rate peaked at 83% in 2012, and reached a
consistent level of about 75% (exceeding the 70% target). When compared internationally, 75% is
considered to be a sound achievement and the case resolution rate varies according to the profile of
cases heard. The increasing use of the Arbitration Council indicates that the resolution rate is
acceptable to the stakeholders. The project financed the publication of AC decisions which led to
increased predictability of award decisions. This predictability in turn provides guidance as to how
employers and unions might settle a case before arbitration, and employers amended internal rules to
ensure conformity with the AC’s arbitration decisions on industry standards.

** By Sept 2010, 8.33% of cases came from outside the greater Phnom Penh area, and 16.35% of cases outside the garment sector, (cf. target value of 12% for
2010, and 6% baseline). In addition, the AC piloted a mobile AC, conducted five mobile hearings
#
  275 cases from Jan-Sep 2014; 330 cases in the 12 month period.
Case resolution rate is determined by factors well beyond the AC control, especially when there is significant industrial unrest, and the profile of the cases
includes those that have a lower resolution rate.


A market study financed by the project showed that, with the exception of the garment industry,
Cambodia industrial relations were still very immature, posing challenges for mediation. Although the
unions in the garment industry are highly fragmented, they are sufficiently organized to enter into a
mediation process. At closure, about 12% of cases come from outside the garment sector, mostly
focused around Phnom Penh in the garment industry belt.

Output 3: Partnerships and Stakeholder Outreach and Training: At appraisal, the AC planned to
build awareness and understanding of workers/unions and employers for improved promotion, to
establish platforms of dialogue for better mediation.

Accordingly, the project financed outreach, training and dissemination for stakeholders. Over 72
trainings (2800 participants), annual workshops (600 participants) and two Industrial Relations
conferences were held. The AC also built an interactive website, financed annual worker-focused
outreach efforts (including talk back radio and soap operas), and conducted Commune Councilor
training in conjunction with the PCO Learning Program. The outputs of these events focused on
promoting DFGG are shown in Table 2.4 (no specific targets were provided at appraisal).

The outcomes of these promoting DFGG activities were monitored by measuring improved awareness
over the duration of the project. Data collected from union representatives and employer feedback
averages over the last 3 years of the project at 78% against an appraisal target of 61% and a revised
target of 81%, as shown in Table 2.5. The 150% increase in case load (shown in table 2.3) is a more
concrete indicator of awareness.

Output 4: General Operations and Project Management. At appraisal the project also intended to
finance about $975,000 for administration of legal and administrative staff, salaries and benefits, rental,
equipment and supplies, vehicles, consultants and M&E, for a period of 4 years.

The actual project financing of AC operations and management cost $US1.15 million for 5.5 years.
M&E was conducted regularly from 2009-2014 using three instruments agreed at appraisal: (i) surveys
of enterprises and unions to measure awareness and understanding, stakeholder confidence and
corruption (promotion); (ii) expert audits to measure quality of the awards/decisions; and (ii) internal
recording of cases and resolution data (responsiveness). A retroactive audit of the quality of awards in
2008 was introduced during implementation to provide a baseline of quality.

Overall assessment. The Arbitration Council reached all appraised and revised targets, significantly
exceeding targets for the cases heard, resolution, confidence, and quality of awards, while meeting all
integrity standards. The AC surpassed appraisal expectations, as a credible, independent and effective
institution mediating DFGG by providing labor dispute resolution services to over 800,000 workers in
Cambodia, underpinning private sector development by resolving disputes quickly and predictably,
and thus bringing significant economic benefit to firms and workers who utilize its services. The AC
managed periods of significant industrial unrest, providing a solid non-political foundation behind
politicized disputes. Within the arena of collective labor dispute resolution, using labor law and
national industrial jurisprudence with minimum legal technicality, Cambodia's Arbitration Council is
considered a center of excellence. It reached a rating of highly satisfactory at closure and retains this in
this ICR assessment.


Component 1B: Support to the Ministry of National Assembly-Senate Relations and
Inspection (MONASRI)

Brief description/relationship to PDO. At appraisal, support to the MONASRI subcomponent was
intended to promote and mediate DFGG by increasing citizens’ awareness of their rights and
obligations under the Land Law and helping channel and address citizens’ complaints through an
enhanced CH mechanism. It was further expected to contribute to the RGC’s and the Bank’s CAS
higher level objectives of improving governance in natural resources management, promoting citizen’s
partnerships for better governance and improving the rule of law. At the same time, the subcomponent

                                                                               35
will strengthen the institutional capacity in MONASRI for carrying out LD and CH functions on a
nationwide scale (which is their legislative mandate) using a combination of its own staff and
partnerships with other SIs and CSOs. The subcomponent aimed to enhance DFGG in NRM.

Appraised activities. To this end, financing for two sets of activities were appraised: (a) Law
Dissemination and Complaints Handling –new communications tools and strategies for land law
dissemination; annual business planning and monitoring system; technical assistance and mentoring;
setting up partnership arrangements to assist in LD and CH work; and conducting a review of existing
CH mechanisms available to citizens for land disputes. (b) Capacity Building and Institutional
Strengthening to strengthen the capacity of MONASRI at the national and provincial levels to
coordinate and manage law dissemination and complaints handling activities using a combination of
its own staff and partnerships.

Activities implemented. MONASRI held 14 Public Forums (PFs) in 2010, but in October 2010
progress toward the PDO slowed as they were unable to engage in activities with civil society to meet
their project development objective. MONASRI’s commitment to engagement with civil society was
featured at all levels of the sub-component documentation – the approach was set out in the MONASRI
Law Dissemination Strategy and DFGG Project Proposal (both of which were incorporated into the
Financing Agreement and was further established through MONASRIs’ own Law Dissemination
Strategy. MONASRI’s change willingness to establish partnerships for these key activities meant it
was non-compliant with the DFGG Financing Agreement.

Appraised estimates and expenditure incurred. At appraisal the budget for the component was $2.42
million (IDA) and $0.09 million (RGC). The final expenditure was US$0.45 million (IDA) $0.0
million (RGC). This represents 18% of the component cost and 3% of the project cost.

Overall assessment. This subcomponent was dropped due to the lack of progress toward the PDO.
Funds were reallocated to well performing aspects of the priority area of decentralization and citizen
partnerships. The last ISR rating was moderately unsatisfactory.

Component 1C. Support to One Window Service Office/District Ombudsman (OWSO-DO)

Brief description/relationship to PDO. At appraisal, support to the OWSO/DO subcomponent was
intended to strengthen voice-accountability-responsiveness ‘in the targeted districts by responding to
the needs of citizens and small businesses for certain administrative services to be delivered in an
efficient, transparent, and accountable manner; by providing an avenue for mediating complaints and
concerns of citizens and small businesses regarding the district administration; and by promoting
awareness and participation of citizens in decisions, policies, and programs of district governments.

                                                        36
Accordingly, the district OWSOs contributed primarily to the responding element of the PDO but with
supporting activities promoting and monitoring; and the District Ombudsman to the mediating element.
This financing specifically supported the priority area of decentralization and citizen partnerships by
getting services closer to Cambodian citizens – an outcome was specifically defined for this in the
CAS. The indicators relating to component 1C measure the achievements of the OWSO in providing
responsive and accountable service (transactions in new districts OWSOs and satisfaction of clients,
broader government commitment and improved performance (responding); building awareness and
understanding (promoting); and DOs efforts to handle complaints (mediation).
Appraised activities, and implemented. To this end, financing for four sets of activities were appraised
in the OWSO component: (a) Expansion and strengthening of OWSO, (b) extending and strengthening
the capacity of the DO, (c) implementing new forms of citizens participation and outreach, (d) M&E
and learning; and (e) supporting recurrent operating costs and project management. Each of these
activity sets were implemented as planned at appraisal, but expanded to achieve the higher targets.
Appraised estimates and expenditure incurred. At appraisal the budget for component 1C was $US
$3.53 million (IDA) and $US1.23 million (RGC), see table 2.7. The final revised allocation was
US$5.32 million (IDA) and $1.23 million (RGC). The final expenditure was $5.16 million (IDA),
US$1.58 million (RGC), and actual cost of $6.74 million. This increase to 146% of IDA appraisal
financed the expansion of the OWSO to 50% more districts, improved M&E and citizen participation.

    a. Expansion and Strengthening of OWSO
At appraisal, the main output of the OWSO subcomponent was planned to be the construction/
renovation of 24 OWSOs in each province of Cambodia and the various actions required to make them
into functional citizen service centers. This required financing of the office buildings, the development
of the regulatory framework for each OWSO, furnishing and equipping offices and recruiting and
training staff, information and communication campaigns to raise public awareness on OWSO/DO
services, as well as negotiations with line ministries to delegate relevant functions to the needs of each
district and municipality. The design also envisaged a pilot in one rural district.
At midterm, reallocation within Component 1 resulted in substantial expansion to the OWSO
subcomponent. $1.8 million IDA was made available for nine OWSOs (5 in Phnom Penh and 4 in
rural areas), and subsequently, the RGC also made financing available for another four additional
OWSOs in Phnom Penh.


                                                              37
  By completion, the planned 24 OWSOs were completed and functioning including the one rural
  OWSO using an outreach model in Battambang province. Another 12 OWSOs were completed
  (including eight OWSOs in Phnom Penh) and started functioning on April 1, 2014. One OWSO from
  the additional set was dropped due to the lack of availability of land before closure. As planned, each
  OWSO establishment included a context-specific regulatory framework that suited local commercial
  activities, capacity building, facilities/equipment procurement, and staff appointment/training. The
  national project team also conducted the required feasibility studies for rural and urban models to
  ensure that the design responded appropriately to citizens and context. The mandate of the OWSOs
  was strengthened: the scope of delegation by other ministries exceeded the appraisal target (7
  ministries) with ten ministries delegating over 76% more services than originally planned, and 62%
  more than the revised target. Transaction numbers were 600% higher than planned at appraisal and
  184% higher than the revised targets. These outputs are set out in Table 2.9.

  # MTR to establish 5 OWSOs in Phnom Penh was reduced to 4 due to unavailability of land in one Phnom Penh district.

  In order to attain target levels of responsiveness, each new set of OWSOs required the recruitment of
  staff and training in principles of governance. Although staff were recruited from the civil service, the
  design also envisaged that they would receive a salary-supplement (a standardized program called the
  MBPI/PMG) to incentivize high standards of performance.

  To ascertain if the OWSOs were meeting the accountability and responsive dimension of the DFGG
  objective, client satisfaction rates were set at appraisal to increase 5% over the baseline for clients, and
  for 60% of targeted experts. Results from surveys conducted in 15 provinces indicate that, of the
  sample, 90%-99% of OWSO clients and 96% of elected officials were satisfied/very satisfied with the
  services provided by the OWSOs in their Municipality/District (see table 2.10). The level of
  responsiveness of these new OWSO services was also measured through an indicator that measured
  the reduction in the time taken and the cost incurred by citizens. The results of citizen and small
  business surveys (which exceed targets) are set out in table 2.11.

*Average data for 17 OWSOs
** One provincial OWSO was significantly slower on selected services. Similarly in two out of 194 services, it was found that the OWSO
service cost more. As this occurred in a marginal number of cases, the figures are not included in the average data.


Implementation arrangements changed in late 2009 when the RGC cancelled the MBPI/PMG for IDA-
financed projects. A new scheme was reinstated in January 2011 (the Priority Operating Cost) and paid
to eligible staff until the original closing date (March 2012). It should be noted that decisions regarding
the changes to these salary supplements lay outside the project. In total, 681staff benefited from
training and cross-learning events at a cost of about $580,000, with $726,400 for salary
supplementation. Although efforts have been made to ascertain the impact of the temporary cessation
of the performance incentive, and the closure of this incentive on the original closing date, the story is
mixed: the lack of an incentive in the short-term reduced work hours and commitment in some
OWSOs, but in the long-term the situation triggered a more sustainable local arrangement.

     b. Extending and Strengthening the Capacity of the DO
In order to provide an avenue for citizens to voice their views about OWSO services, the OWSO
component included for an avenue to mediate complaints through a District Ombudsman (DOs) in all
OWSO districts. This required a transparent system for democratically electing DOs, their training,
equipping DO offices near OWSOs, and providing capacity building and other support to the DO to
perform their functions.

As required, the project appointed and trained DOs in the 24 operational districts (and 24 Deputy DOs).
The DO appointments followed the agreed procedures. The DOs handled 865 comments/complaints of
which 151 were complaints (against an appraisal target of 90, and a revised target of ‘actual’) ; 91% of
these were considered ‘resolved’ (against an appraisal target of 40%). Of the complaints managed, five
led to the firing of staff including a manager, effectively sending a message to OWSO staff that
integrity was paramount. At the midterm restructuring, to strengthen institutional arrangements, it was
agreed that attention would be paid to the alignment of the DO with the other subnational complaints
handling systems. This was only partially carried out before closure, as it became part of the overall
decentralization reform, and was beyond the OWSO control. It was also agreed that reporting on the
forms of complaints and resolution would be improved, and indicator was added to measure any lack
of accountability (i.e. citizens making informal payments), and to measure responsiveness (reduced
cost and time). Implementation arrangements were affected in 2013 when the DO salary was
mistakenly stopped by the OWSO team. This was resolved during a supervision mission and
retrospective payments made by the RGC as a part of operational costs.

     c. Implementing New Forms of Citizens Participation and Outreach
In order to assist citizens better understand what to expect from good governance in OWSOs (and thus
to hold them to account for the services they provided) the project intended to finance various events
and information campaigns in the 24 districts that launched the OWSO/DOs.

The subcomponent outputs are shown in table 2.12, and the outcomes of these efforts to promote
awareness and understanding are shown in table 2.13. Over the course of the project the IA revised the

                                                                   39
approach to communication and outreach to improve results. The independent surveys conducted in
nineteen districts by NGOs for both old and new offices, indicated that awareness of the DO increased
from a baseline of 4% in 2011, to a range of 44-95% in 2014 (against a target of 34%). Understanding
of DO services improved from 2% in 2011, to 52-56% in 2014 (against a target of 22%).

*The same OWSOs were surveyed 2 and 4 years later by the same NGO. Over the 17 OWSOs surveyed, the range is significant, but all met
or exceed appraisal and revised targets.
** Revised targets also disaggregated results to track improvement over time so that OWSOs in Y1, Y2, Y3 OWSO targets were set at 30%,
50% and 60% respectively.

     d. M&E and Learning and Project Management
The M&E for OWSO agreed at appraisal included: (i) an internal M&E and reporting system, (ii) an
independent baseline and end evaluation, (iii) external periodic surveys of OWSO /DO clients; a client
scorecard of OWSO/DO services; focus group discussions with key stakeholders and cross-peer
learning events to track the achievements in promoting, mediating, responding and monitoring to
inform DFGG. The MTR and PIM revision clarified the instruments to meet these monitoring goals,
adding: (iv) a study of lessons learned, and dissemination of learning notes, and (v) an independent
evaluation of the DO.

By 2014, all instruments had been completed: the internal monitoring system was producing useable
data, independent baseline and midlines were completed, lessons learned study to provide qualitative
learning and an end evaluation were carried out before project closure. The lessons learned report of
the OWSO provided a basis for dialogue on key issues and the final evaluation noted the take up of
these lessons including: posting processing times as well as fees; incorporating the OWSO under the
District administration and providing authority for more efficient staffing arrangements, as well as
changes to outreach to better reach key populations. This was disseminated in the form of 5 Learning
Notes on key aspects of the supply-side administrative reform: staffing, functions, systems,
transparency, attitudes and communications and outreach. In addition, responding to the original
indicator for NGO monitoring partnerships in the original results framework, the OWSO worked in
partnership with five NGOs to conduct independent third party monitoring in 19 districts (exit surveys
of OWSO customers, focus group discussions; and a scorecard of OWSO-DO performance).


                                                                  40
As anticipated at appraisal, the NCDD OWSO District Support Team managed the development of the
regulatory framework, capacity building, construction, procurement, financial management and M&E
activities, and provided oversight to the District Offices. This included establishing an inter-ministerial
technical advisory group (TAG) to provide policy and legal support. While the national office project
team met the results anticipated at appraisal, exceeding many of the core indicators, capacity
constraints, common to the Cambodian civil service, affected (i) the pace of action and (ii) the strategic
dialogue on post-project roll out.

Overall assessment. The OWSO reached all appraised and revised targets, significantly exceeding
targets for effectiveness, number of transactions, awareness and understanding and complaints
resolution. The OWSO met appraisal expectations to establish offices and deliver efficient,
transparent and accountable administrative services. Although it is still developing effectively, the IA
established the proposed District Ombudsman to provide an avenue for mediating complaints and
concerns of citizens and small businesses; and effectively launched and adapted efforts to promote
citizen engagement in district level administrations. Moreover the OWSO initiative enjoys significant
high level ownership in government, is now institutionalized in the Ministry of Interior. The 12
additional OWSOs (50% more than planned) are now operating, with highly positive media reports.


Component 1D. Support to Radio National Kampuchea (RNK)
Brief description/relationship to PDO. At appraisal, support to RNK was intended to promote/ mediate
DFGG by providing balanced, accurate and up-to-date radio programs which inform, and facilitate
dialogue between citizens, CSOs, businesses and government. It also envisaged strengthening the
capacity of RNK to increase its public interest programming and audience share, and thereby begin its
transition into a public radio broadcaster delivering quality programs. The subcomponent contributed
to a media dimension of the CAS outcome to promote citizens’ partnerships for better governance.

Appraised activities. To this end, financing for two sets of activities were appraised: (a) Program
Content Development – expanding talk back radio programming; introducing feature stories and
weekly wrap-ups on topics of interest; renovating the news services of RNK to provide accurate,
timely and independent information to listeners; introduction of the editorial policy and code of
conduct; and developing partnerships between RNK and CSOs, SIs, and donors to share experiences,
develop content and monitor and provide feedback on RNK programming. (b) Capacity Building:
strengthening RNK organizational capacity to produce/broadcast quality information services; training
staff in managerial departments; developing a sustainability strategy. International technical assistance
was to be provided by the Australia Broadcasting Commission funded by Ausaid.

Activities implemented. In late 2009, RNK began the implementation of the program development
satisfactorily, with increased numbers of talkback programs in the first year and some improvement in
news bulletins, and a draft editorial policy. A listener survey was produced. However these activities
started to slow and/or diverge from the project objective in 2010, efforts to implement a corrective
action plan were unsuccessful, and following the MTR, activities were discontinued effective July 1,
2011. Four reasons justified this discontinuation: (i) non-compliance with the good governance
framework (specifically non-compliances in procurement); (ii) non-compliance with the RNK agreed
editorial policy that supported DFGG programming; (iii) non-compliance with the requirement for an
advisory committee; and (iv) withdrawal of external TA from Ausaid (a risk mitigating measure).

Appraised estimates and expenditure incurred. At appraisal the budget for the component was $2.38
million (IDA) with $0.09 million (RGC contribution to the MBPI) and parallel Ausaid TA valued at
$3.42million, for a total estimated cost of $5.89 million. The final expenditure was US$0.75 million
(IDA) $0.0 million (RGC), and $1.53 million (Ausaid). This represents 32% of the component cost
and 4% of the project cost.

Overall assessment. This subcomponent was dropped due to the lack of progress toward the PDO and
non-compliance with legal covenants. The withdrawal of Ausaid TA and the lack of traction of the
advisory committee were key risk mitigation measures to the component. The RGC requested that
funds be reallocated to well performing aspects of the project.


Component 2: Support to Non-State Institutions
Brief description/relationship to PDO. At appraisal the support to non-state institutions was intended to
provide grants and capacity building assistance to non-state actors (NSAs) to strengthen their ability to
engage in DFGG (voice-accountability-responsiveness) activities.. The component aimed to contribute
primarily to the promoting, mediating, responding and monitoring elements of the PDO, specifically
relating to enhancing voice, accountability and responsiveness in the CAS priority area of
decentralization and citizen partnerships. The indicators measuring the achievements of the NSAs in
promoting awareness, mediating feedback, undertaking monitoring that was responsive. At appraisal
the component was intended to be implemented independently through The Asia Foundation. All
NSAs receiving grants were expected to commit to a set of constructive engagement principles.

Appraised activities. At appraisal, funding was to be provided to various NSAs to support their own
proposals for scaling-up ongoing or piloting new activities to strengthen DFGG and contribute to
specific development or sector objectives. Grants were provided for: (a) funding to scale up the scope
and coverage of existing operations and successful pilots; (b) financing of NSA partnerships programs
with one or other of the SIs in Component 1; (c) funding for pilot or small-scale activities designed to
take DFGG approaches into new areas; (d) institutional strengthening, capacity building support and
guidance to new or potential grantees; and (e) robust and participatory monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) activities, in particular those designed to draw lessons of social accountability experience in
Cambodia that will be valuable for the capacity building activities.

Activities implemented. To this end, financing for three subcomponents were appraised: (a)
partnership grants, (b) thematic grants, and (c) capacity building and learning.

(a) Partnership and Thematic Grants were provided as foreseen at appraisal in different priority
areas, and in three different sizes to allow for seed funding and piloting, innovations and scaling up.
Grants were managed by The Asia Foundation as foreseen at appraisal. For the first round, a
development marketplace event involving 800 participants and 32 organizations was held; training,
coaching and other capacity building support was provided to grantees through an internal
implementation support system. Summary of grant details is provided in table 2.16.

Outcomes of the grants – links to PDO.
 Monitoring – public sector institutions monitored and taking corrective actions. The monitoring of
   local authorities and service delivery agencies strengthened the institutions and facilitated state –
   non-state partnerships in 226 commune councils (against a target of 100); 20 district councils
   (against a target of 20); 153 commune and district level health centers (against a target of 80); 330
   schools (against a target of 175); 9 districts OWSOs (against a target of 6). In health centers and
   schools, the most significant improvements were staff professionalism and timeliness (80%), hygiene
   and cleanliness of clinics (69%) and better staff communication (66%), better access to emergency
   services (49%) and transparency of fees (44%). In schools, staff attitudes and turning up for work on
   time (79%), hygiene and cleanliness (74%), teacher communication (63%) and small physical
   infrastructure improvements) 57%. Focus group discussions held 12 months after the completion of

                                                                 45
    activities in 124 HCs, 134 schools and 6 OWSOs, showed positive results on SI performance in all
    cases: health centers - 99%; schools – 100%; OWSO – 100%. The end-line evaluation notes, due to
    short time frames, most service improvements were generally within the existing resource capabilities
    of each SI – mostly with regard to the performance of staff.
   Improvements in citizen engagement in decision-making (strengthened institutions/ partnerships). Data
    obtained from 18 focus group discussions with 274 citizens in seven districts, 12 months after the
    completion of activities, indicated that 75% of citizens indicated that engagement in decision making
    processes of communes/local service delivery agents (clinics, schools, communes / districts) had
    improved as a result of grant activities, against a target of 70%. The qualitative assessment noted that
    higher results were associated with the community scorecard (cf. the citizen report card) and
    participatory and interactive monitoring methods.
   Policies and practices changed (accountability and responsiveness). The project assessed policy and
    practice changes that came about as a result of project activities. Strategic policy change due to the
    NSAs component was highly significant, affecting the regulatory environment and included in
    national development plan; this was unforeseen at appraisal. Grants also triggered changes in local
    level practices and procedures: In communes – citizen-govt. interface, transparent council budgets,
    mobilization of citizen-committees, participation in council meetings). In schools –implementation
    of codes of conduct, teacher attendance survey systems, warnings regarding informal payments,
    and proper treatment of children. In health centers – better management /oversight, display of fees,
    observance of internal rules, sanctions for taking informal fees.
   Promotion of DFGG. The social accountability processes adopted by NSAs varied considerably.
    Across the grants surveyed in the second round, when skills and experience of implementing
    NGOs had improved, awareness of citizens reached 78.62% (against a target of 70%),
    understanding reached 78.59% (against a target of 50%), and of these 75% reported positive
    results on governance (against a target of 35%).

(c) Capacity Building, Monitoring, Learning and Management. TAF put in place the structures,
systems, capacity building and M&E needed to manage the grants and development of skills for
implementation. With regards to M&E the NSAC component produced (i) a midline independent
review of the first round of grants involving 20 sub- grantees (225 participants – 53% women); (ii) an
end line participatory evaluation of the second round, involving 13 grants (165 participants – 62%
women); (iii) a 12 month post-grant check of 13 grants (290 participants – 66% women); (iv) detailed
lessons and case-studies on NSAC activities. During the extension period, TAF designed and carried
out a series of learning round tables with key grantees from round 2. The lessons learned from this
structured reflection process were a set of case studies and learning notes. This interactive process
audit fed into the design of the demand-side of the Social Accountability Framework (I-SAF).
Utilization was tracked by inclusion of lesson in specific capacity building or design I-SAF. TAF also
became more intensively engaged in the PCO learning component and organized a second marketplace
in association with the final Social Accountability Forum. See table 2.19.

Appraised estimates and expenditure incurred. At appraisal the budget for the component was $4.27
million IDA. The final revised allocation was US$5.01 million, and the final expenditure was US$4.90
million. This represents an increase in 6%, provided during the first extension period to strengthen the
reflection, capacity building and documentation of lessons to feed into the design of the Social
Accountability Framework (described in section 2.6).

Overall assessment. The outputs of this component were central to the overall DFGG project outcomes,
contributing to each aspect of DFGG and to each priority area. The results indicate that grants
strengthened institutions, established partnerships (particularly at the local level), and created lessons
for enhanced promotion, mediation, responsiveness and monitoring. The activities followed the critical
principle of constructive engagement established at appraisal, and brought about a significant change

                                                               47
in policy and experience in implementation in the development of state-non-state social accountability
partnerships in Cambodia. There were trade-offs in this process (breadth versus depth), that in
hindsight brought benefit -- breadth in activity provided broader awareness of innovative approaches
and the later depth provided solid lessons for the future. The component was rated satisfactory for
progress toward the PDO and implementation progress.


Component 3: Coordination and Learning
Brief description/relationship to PDO. At appraisal support was intended to enhance coordination and
learning through a supportive component that aimed to: (a) ensure effective implementation, consistent
with agreed management guidelines and best practice, and timely progress in the direction of achieving
the PDO; and (b) promote learning about and facilitate adoption of DFGG approaches and practices
within and beyond the SIs and NSAs that participate in the DFGG project. The fundamental outcome
expected from Component 3 was a successfully implemented project, undertaken to schedule, with
efficient use of resources. In addition, the component was expected to ensure: (a) increased capacity
within the participating agencies for both project implementation and DFGG activities in general; (b)
strengthened collaboration among project agencies; (c) broader govt. and civil society awareness and
understanding of DFGG principles, approaches and roles/responsibilities; and (d) increased trust
between government and civil society. The component was therefore envisaged to support other IAs.
The appraisal results did however indicate a role for Component 3 in triggering policy responses.

Appraised estimates and expenditure incurred. At appraisal the budget for the component was $US
2.43 million IDA ($US0.03 million RGC for MBPI). The final expenditure was US$3.57 million
(IDA); 0.05million (RGC). This represents an increase in 30%, agreed at the second restructuring to
enhance capacity building and establish the Governance Resource and Learning Center.

Appraised outputs/intermediate outcomes and achieved outputs/intermediate outcomes The primary
output was the development of capacity in governance matters for both state and non-state actors. The
approach to the implementation of component 3B (described above) was evaluated and reorganized at

During the extension period PCO adapted the learning program to focus on the I-SAF (and thus the
sustainability of subnational social accountability activity). This also provided the opportunity to
provide training of trainers and intensify learning-by-doing training around knowledge areas that were
focused on direct implementation of the Social Accountability Strategic Plan.

Intermediate outcomes appraised and achieved (qualitative indicators required).
 Increased DFGG knowledge and resources (IO3.2). The project sought to develop networks,
    resource centers and a local social accountability community of practice including a cadre of
    trainers, networks, who are able to undertake ongoing training and capacity-building.
    ‒ 3 national NGOs and TAF supported Learning Program.
    ‒ A Coalition for Integrity and Social Accountability trained by learning program.
    ‒ Cadre of trainers developed through training of trainers for I-SAF.
 Lessons and experiences (IO3.3) documented, and used in capacity building programs.
    ‒ 2 studies and 2 learning notes on Partnerships
    ‒ Learning events held on Partnerships and Local Conflict Resolution.
    ‒ 1 Learning Note on project disclosure.
    ‒ I-SAF learning reached 20 districts.
 Increased trust and constructive engagement (IO3.5) between NSAs and government agencies.
    Qualitative evaluation. 70% target, revised to a qualitative indicator to promote critical assessment.
    ‒ PCO noted increased trust in NGOs, and the constructive engagement has become a central
         principle of engagement. NGOs also note the support provided by PCO to unblock local level
         implementation problems. PCO is “praised for responsiveness to their partners”, and they “are
         considered more “approachable” than other line ministries.
    ‒ The trust and constructive engagement also improved through a shared learning platform. All
         learning events were joint (state and non-state).
    ‒ End evaluations noted that (when compared with a qualitative baseline) trust has been built
         through (i) creating space, (ii) constructive engagement; (iii) creating consensus.
    ‒ Overall, this result is considered positive.
 Effectiveness of partnerships (IO3.6) to the project development objective.
    ‒ All end evaluations note a positive evaluation of partnerships contributing to the PDO.
 Establishment of the Governance Resource and Learning Center (IO3.1) established and in the
    Ministry of Interior, functioned as a hub for DFGG learning and CSO coordination up to
    September 2014, conducting 101 days of training involving 2500 participants. Three national
    NGOs and one TAF were engaged to support Learning Program, to enable replication of trainings
    and resource partners to PCO after project closure. Five staff are assigned to the GRLC, and the I-
    SAF capacity building plan includes the GRLC as the future hub of learning activities.

Overall assessment. Overall Component 3 suffered from delays at the outset of the project but
recovered these with the extension and the clarified purpose of delivering capacity building for SAF
implementation. Capacity was an ongoing issue for the PCO for government staff, and finding
qualified national and international consultants. Established as a PMU, PCO was affected by the
cancellation of the MBPI, the reinstatement of the Priority Operating Cost brought some improvement.
Most importantly, PCO developed the capacity to deliver the next stage of governance learning, and
managed a difficult project without significant blockage. In view of these strengths and weaknesses,
the component was rated moderately satisfactory.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
At appraisal the project was expected to generate economic benefits because poor governance impedes
growth in critical areas of the economy. It referred to the contributions of the ACF and OWSO/DO
sub-components in improving governance in the domestic private sector by improving labor relations
and the registration of small businesses respectively. However, a quantitative assessment of economic
rates of return (ERR) or net present value (NPV) was not carried out.

The ICR carried out an economic and financial analysis of two quantifiable components of the project:
Component 1A, support to the Arbitration Council (AC) and Component 1C, support to the One
Window Service Office (OWSO).

Component 1A: Arbitration Council
(Appraisal cost: US$2.76 million; Completion cost: US$2.86 million).

         Economic analysis (AC)

Benefits. Economic benefits of the Arbitration Council stem from the ability of workers and
employers to access accountable labor dispute resolution services (providing a channel for their voice),
and adjudication and responsive action on behalf of the parties concerned. These benefits can be
measured in terms of: (i) net profit to employers from the days when strikes were averted; and (ii)
wages of workers for the days when strikes were averted.

Methodology. Data is used to calculate: (i) cost of a strike over the period 2009-2014, based on the
net annual profit of garment firms in Cambodia, the number of workers and the minimum wage paid to
garment workers; and (ii) cost of strikes averted, utilizing accurate AC data on the number of cases
issued with a return to work order each year and the percentage resolution of cases. Based on a
conservative estimate of five days per strike, and limiting the cases only to those with a return to work
order, the services of AC over the period 2009-2014, averted over 183 strikes. Set against a total
overall cost of $2,963,699 (IDA $2,546,170), the NPV of the AC component is about US$13 million
and the ERR is 258%. Table 3.1 provides more details.

Data and assumptions used in calculating the EIRR for the AC are summarized below:
   The NPV is only calculated for the period 2009-2014. The benefit of the jurisprudence produced during this period,
    which creates precedent for the resolution of cases, is not considered.
   Conservative estimates have been used. The number of strikes per year are limited to those with return to work orders.
    The actual number of strikes in arbitration cases is significantly higher. (249 strikes over the project period cf. 183 return
    to work orders). The length of the strike that is averted is assumed to be 5 days. 10% of workers earn over the minimum
    wage and they earn 10% more.
   The annual net profit $8,638,932 of an average sized company in 2012. Revenue generated per worker per day is $1709,
    based on the productivity of an average sized firm. The weighting of firm sizes according to no. employees is as follows (10
    - 99 employees represents 1% of firms, 100 - 499 employees represents 19%, 500 - 999 employees - 33%; 1,000 -2,499
    employees - 29%; 2,500 - 4,999 employees - 15%; 5,000- 10,000 employees - 3%).
   Net profit increases by 5% annually, +/-5% (on 2012).
   The EIRR is calculated on the overall total cost, which includes the cost of consultants and training as well as the
    operational cost of the AC.

  Efficiency. The cost per case for the Arbitration Council to conduct labor arbitration services
  decreased from US$2,095 in 2009, to $892 per case in 2014 (43%). The cost per beneficiary decreased
  by a similar percentage (42%).

  Revenue generated. At appraisal the AC component included: (i) an examination of the relevance
  and appropriateness of revenue generation from private and public sources (including trade unions,
  employers’ associations and government), and (ii) a target revenue generation of 15%.

  The study examined the decisions to seek contributions from stakeholders in the context of
  Cambodia’s governance, especially if these were not equally available from the private sector,
  unions/employers and the government, and noted the paramount importance of the AC maintaining its
  independence and credibility. Given volatile industrial relations, the ACF prioritized this
  independence and only sought and accepted contributions that did not compromise its independence
  and integrity. The total revenue generated, including all non-IDA funds, totalled over US$293,000 by
  closure,, mainly from international firms and the ILO. These funds contributed to the basket and were
  subject to the same FM procedures as IDA funds. Overall, the ACF generated just over 15% of all
  operating costs during the implementation period, thus meeting the appraisal target.

  Component 1C: One Window Service Office
  (Appraisal cost: US$4.76 million for 24 OWSOs; Completion cost: $6.74 million for 36 OWSOs).
            Economic Analysis (OWSO)

  Benefits. OWSOs established with DFGG financing brought economic benefits to citizens and small
  businesses seeking licenses and registration to conduct business and livelihood activities. These
  benefits included the opportunity cost of waiting for the Provincial Ministry to process requests (i.e.,
  the consumer not operating their business or vehicle), and the reduced cost to the citizen/business of
  obtaining a service.

  Methodology. The ICR calculated: (i) value of the reduction in time to obtain services (that affect
  livelihoods); and (ii) savings on transactional payments (including lower informal fees). The third
  benefit is that these services are located at the district, closer to residences and businesses, thus
  reducing travel cost and time. This benefit was however not included in the calculation.

       (a) Reduction in time taken to obtain service:
  Client feedback surveys conducted in 19 of the 24 OWSO districts show that clients spent 33-75% less
  time obtaining an OWSO service than a standard government service. Table 3.4 summarizes the
  calculations of the difference in waiting time (average number of days a client saves by using OWSO),
  the cost per day to the client of not having the license (i.e., lost net profit or cost of alternative rental
  etc.) and the total number of OWSO transactions.

                                                                    54
Assumptions:
  OWSO clients operate in a legal economy, and waiting for an administrative service means they cannot
    operate their business or vehicle.
  The average time taken by OWSOs varied across services, e.g., 26.5 working days for a building license;
    24.8 business days for a motorbike license; 10.3 business days for a restaurant permit; and 10 business days
    for other business permits. It is conservatively assumed that on average an OWSO provides services eight
    to nine days faster than the province.
  Time savings do not include notarization services, as these are low cost, low time, and do not have a
    measurable economic value.

     (b) Reduction in the cost of obtaining the service:
Client feedback surveys in the same 19 districts show that citizens are paying an average of 40-44%
less for an OWSO service than a standard government service. The cost benefit of the OWSO has
been obtained by calculating the difference in the cost of the transaction at an OWSO district and a
non-OWSO district (i.e. for a citizen before and after an OWSO was established).
Assumptions:
  Reduction in cost is 40%, which is the lowest result obtained in the surveys, and is applied to all districts.
  Cost savings of 40% occur on all transactions, large and small.
  Cost savings include the lower payment of informal fees, and the lower formal cost of the service. However,
    savings on informal fees have not been estimated.

Based on these conservative assumptions, the net present value for the OWSO component is
US$6.38million, and the ERR is 95%. Details are provided in table 3.4.

           Financial analysis (OWSO)

Revenue Generated. At appraisal cost recovery targets for OWSOs were set at an increasing
percentage, from 50-80% from service fee revenue as a proportion of operating costs (Year 1 – 50%,
Year 2 – 60%, Year 3 – 70%, and Year 4 – 80%). By closure, the average cost recovery ratio of
OWSOs was 273%, exceeding the appraisal target of 80%. 22 of the 24 OWSOs exceeded the 80%
target by closure, and 17 OWSOs generated over 150%. The additional 12 OWSOs established in
Phnom Penh, are not included in this calculation as they started operations only at project closure.
Table 3.5 provides details on the cost recovery of OWSOs.

As anticipated at appraisal, cost recovery of OWSOs improved over time (with the number of years
established), and with increased awareness and understanding of the OWSO services, but is highly
contingent on the size of the target population.1 Currently, the opportunity for a citizen/business to use
an OWSO is limited to those clients resident in that district. This regulation lowers the potential
utilization of the OWSO. The cost recovery of the operating 24 OWSOs reached 273% in 2014, and is
shown by year and OWSO in the table below.

 RGC legislation requires that all citizens obtain the same level of service, irrespective of their location. It was not possible or
appropriate to target only high population areas in the project.

                                                                     56
RGC Financial Contributions. The financing agreement set out the requirements for RGC
contribution, including: contribution to the salary supplement (MBPI and POC); handover of
operational costs in the later years of the project; and contribution to the construction of OWSO offices.
These planned contributions changed during the life of the project due to: (i) cancellation of the MBPI
(the POC did not require a government contribution); (ii) extension of the project (which required an
extension to operational costs); and (iii) commitment of RGC to finance five additional OWSOs, and
to take over financing of those that may not have met the (first) closure date. At closure the RGC
contribution was $1.63 million, compared to the appraisal estimate of $1.44 million.

  Summary of revisions to the original Results Framework

  a. Changes to Indicators
     Of the original 97 indicators:
        15 composite and aggregated indicators were dropped
        19 RNK and MONASRI indicators were dropped
        12 self-assessment indicators were dropped
        7 indicators were changed into 4 qualitative indicators (lessons, trust, partnership, policy changes)
        2 indicators were added to measure corruption
        1 indicator was added to monitor progress on institutional establishment
        8 were included in, or covered by another indicator.
       The project retained 27 indicators: 15 Outcome and 12 Intermediate Outcome indicators (of which
       5 were qualitative).

  b. Methodological changes
     The following methodologies were removed or revised:
           All compilation of dissimilar indicators
           All self-assessments by individual IAs or project stakeholders (the measure was unreliable).
       For the remaining 27 indicators, each of the quantifiable indicators were assigned to an IA and a
       verifiable instrument was established to measure:
           Citizen / client surveys
           Expert evaluations / audits
           Management information system
           Beneficiary feedback mechanisms
           Third party monitoring
           Independent evaluations
       Independent evaluators provided qualitative write ups for those indicators which: (i) could not be
       measured quantitatively, (ii) required more than IA to contribute, and/or (iii) benefited from
       qualitative description. Five qualitative changes were reported in end evaluations (policy change,
       partnerships, trust/constructive engagement, lessons, and institutional establishment and
       alignment).

Annex 5: The Social Accountability Framework and Implementation Plan

At appraisal, Cambodia’s experience of social accountability was limited. The Bank had provided
technical assistance through a Bank-executed Program to Enhance Capacity Building for Social
Accountability (PECSA), and the DFGG project included for a specific component to support non-
state actors establish voice and accountability processes. Grant activities were largely undertaken at the
local level, and although spread-out, helped to improve local services and create partnerships between
citizens and the local government. During the project period, through discussions and negotiations
with the NCDD (responsible for the decentralization and partnerships agenda), and civil society actors
it became possible to take the social accountability agenda forward in Cambodia and to put in place a
more structured long term process. This Annex provides more details on this agenda.

A Social Accountability Strategic Plan for Subnational Democratic Development was endorsed by
the Royal Government of Cambodia National Committee for Sub-national Democratic Development
(NCDD) and signed by the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Interior, in July 2013. Under the
umbrella of the DFGG project and supported by three of the project implementing agencies, this policy
framework (known as the Social Accountability Framework – the SAF) was developed through a
consultative process involving the government, over 80 NGOs/NGO networks and development
partners. The core purpose of the SAF is to empower citizens to hold government to account for local
service delivery and resource allocation. The framework sets out the principles, elements, strategies
and outline roles and responsibilities of sub-national administrations, local service providers and local
and national civil society. The agreed social accountability objectives and targets were subsequently
included in the RGC 5-year National Strategic Development Plan (2014-2018).

The policy context for subnational democratic development places importance on enhancing citizen
engagement, transparency and downward accountability, and strengthening the quality and
effectiveness of public service delivery. It notes the need for information sharing, accountability to
citizens and mechanisms for service user feedback. The Strategic Plan is grounded in both broad and
specific policy documents such as the Organic Law, the Rectangular Strategy III, National Strategic
Development Plan (2014-2018), the National Program for Subnational Democratic Development (and
its 3-year implementation plans), Education Sector Strategy, and Health Strategic Plan. Social
Accountability in the context of sub-national democratic development (decentralization) reform has
the objective to improve citizen engagement, transparency and accountability as a means to: (i)
improve service delivery, (ii) ensure budget allocation is based on local needs; (iii) empower citizens;
and (iv) enhance social capital and trust.

During 2013-4, an Implementation Plan for the Social Accountability Framework (I-SAF) was
endorsed by civil society and government and was included in the second sub-national development
reform 3 year implementation plan (IP3-II) 2015-18. The I-SAF defines the scope and content of joint
action by government and civil society around three areas of activity, which lie at the core of the I-
SAF: (i) access to information, (ii) open local budgets and (iii) citizen monitoring. These activities
will be carried out in three local agencies/service providers: communes, health centers and primary
schools.

Development process and outputs. This step forward for citizen engagement and social accountability
in Cambodia emerged from detailed analysis of citizen engagement challenges in local government
and service delivery and on-the-ground efforts to identify the common ground between civil society
and government on priority areas of action. The process has been taken step by step, in parallel with,
and learning from non-state activities of DFGG Component 2.

 In the first phase, the Bank was able to provide the analytical foundation for dialogue among project
  partners through a series of AAA products (Voice, Choice and Decision (I) in Local Governance and
  (II) in Local Service Delivery (2011-2), and a review of community empowerment mechanisms from
  community driven development initiatives elsewhere (2012). Thereafter joint state-non-state action
  resulted in the draft Social Accountability Framework (SAF) for consultation, stakeholder discussion
  (2012) and final formal endorsement (July 2013).
 In a second phase, an implementation plan (an appraisal document) was jointly drafted by key
  stakeholders and then went into a design and testing phase engaging six NGOs and districts. The
  design builds on lessons from DFGG project implementation, and includes: ‘Information for
  Citizens’ (I4C) materials and processes developed by NCDD with support from the World Bank;
  citizen monitoring guidelines (and a demand-side operations manual) were developed by the
  demand-side team, supported by The Asia Foundation (TAF). Training of trainers was developed,
  launched and tested with TAF in partnership with PCO/GRLC, training about 400 state and non-
  state participants and providing in-depth training to 65 trainers to move forward with cascade
  training in late 2014.
Scope and content. The implementation plan currently covers three sets of social accountability
activities in three local level institutions. It also encourages broader action based on local needs.
      Information for Citizens (I4Cs). Public displays will inform citizens of their rights, required
       standards, performance and finances of communes, health centers and schools. This will be
       supported by awareness building and budget literacy activities.
      Community Scorecards (CSC). Citizen engagement in monitoring local services and resources
       will be carried out through a community scorecard process for all three sectors.
      Joint Accountability Action Plan (JAAP). JAAP will establish actions that will be taken to
       respond to the problems identified in the scorecard process.

Approach. The I-SAF will be implemented jointly by civil society (NGOs, CBOs and citizens) and
government. It sets out the roles and responsibilities of this joint process and partnership – to ensure
that government is providing the necessary information and participating in processes, and that civil
society has the space and capacity to conduct awareness building, information/budget literacy,
facilitation and monitoring activities in such a way as to hold government to account for service
delivery and local resource allocation. NCDD and subnational officials will develop I-SAF guidelines
and regulations, develop information on rights and standards (national), generate performance and
budget information (local), publish and post information and budgets, support and participate in the
citizen monitoring process, especially in interface meetings, support and oversee implementation of
the Joint Accountability Action Plans, and strengthen the oversight role and capacity of councilors.
The role of civil society is to: create and mentor a cadre of community accountability facilitators; build
capacity of both state and non-state local actors; build citizen awareness of information; develop the
budget literacy of communities; facilitate the citizen monitoring process, including the preparation of
Joint Accountability Action Plans; assist commune chief with monitoring of JAAPs; and document
and share lessons for collective learning.

Lessons adopted. The I-SAF has been designed taking into account to lessons of social accountability
both in Cambodia and across the world. This includes, inter alia: (i) information on rights, standards
and performance when carried out in conjunction with citizen monitoring improves the quality of
citizen feedback; (ii) citizens are more empowered through broader multi-sector activities that expand
choice and options, than single sector social accountability which restricts voice and local linkages;
(iii) SA works best when the state and non-state act together, and learn together; (iv) effective
community facilitators are a critical factor, they need substantial training and subsequent management;
(v) responsiveness improves with links to administrative processes and government cycles of decision-

                                                   64
making. (vi) links between social, electoral and administrative accountability enhance impact and
relevance; (vii) structured tools (such as community scorecards) have a greater impact than ad hoc
approaches; (vii) starting with simple core processes and building in flexibility so local actors can
respond to local needs.

Current status and roll out plan. In the first three years I-SAF will cover 70% of the 150 rural districts
in Cambodia (with a Year 1 target of 20 districts, Year 2 targeting another 50 districts, and Year 3 a
further 50 districts). In each district, rights, standards performance information and budgets will be
displayed, citizen monitoring will be conducted, and Joint Accountability Action Plans will be
implemented by local actors. Reaching all rural districts in Cambodia depends on financing for civil
society activities. By 2017, it is anticipated that these I-SAF activities will have reached about 120
districts, 1000 communes, 1000 health centers and 8,000 primary schools.

NCDD has included government activities in the 2014 budget and work plans, donors (USAID, EU
and the WB) are mobilizing financing for civil society, and a number of NGOs and local implementing
partners have started a first roll out of joint activities. Although implementation has started,
implementation arrangements are still emerging: CSOs are ‘opting in’ to implement I-SAF activities
by nominating districts where they propose to work (e.g., where they have staff and offices, a track
record, local partners); the plan is to build on existing programs and avoid separate projects. NCDD is
signing a Memorandum of Understanding with each CSO to deliver agreed activities in nominated
districts, and will include those districts in their annual work plan, ensuring instructions are in place
and empower officials. A training provider (not yet in place) will work with GRLC to provide training
of trainers and district officials, and a separate and independent platform will support cross-district
monitoring, learning and policy development.

Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results

     A. ACF Client Feedback Results

The ACF conducted baseline, midline and endline surveys to track client perceptions of AC
services, specifically on awareness (of the AC and the labor arbitration process), on the
independence, credibility and effectiveness of the AC, and on the payment of informal fees.
The survey adopted a mixed methodology – a combination of survey-based quantitative
assessment as well as interview-based qualitative assessment of public awareness and
confidence in AC’s operations. In the endline 169 clients and non-clients were interviewed
from unions, federations, and employers. Detailed data on perceptions of
independence/credibility/effectiveness shown earlier in this report (tracked for the RF)
illustrates the problem with that indicator (losers of a dispute will automatically respond
negatively). Closer analysis shows that both employers and unions rate this approximately the
same – indicating a lack of bias, and the tables below are more reliable as illustrations of the
confidence in the credibility of the AC.

     B. One Window Service Office Client Surveys

At the close of the project, five NGOs conducted independent customer satisfaction surveys (exit
surveys and citizen rating reports) in 17 districts where OWSOs were operating. This monitoring was
conducted by local NGOs as an effort to enhance partnerships with OWSOs and introduce third party
monitoring in a relatively low capacity environment; methodologies varied and comparisons with early
surveys has limitations. Nevertheless the results for customer satisfaction were consistently high: 82 to
97% of OWSO users reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied, except for one site (65%), and
qualitative feedback from users and citizens) triangulated the finding that there was marked
improvement over obtaining services directly from the provincial line department, because of proximity
to their residences/businesses, lower informal fees and more welcoming customer service. This is
consistent with a survey conducted in 2012 NGO, which found satisfaction rates of 88% (on average for
three sites).

With regard to the satisfaction of locally-elected officials (whose feedback represents broader local
perception), the 2011 survey found that among 61 District Councilors, 97% expressed satisfaction with
OWSO. Subsequent surveys of 51 Commune Councilors in five Districts found similar results, with
95% of Commune Councilors being satisfied or very satisfied with the OWSO service in their area.
While it is noted that customer surveys on cost and time taken also show marked improvement over
other (provincial) services, in those 3-18% of cases where a level of dissatisfaction was reported with the
performance of the OWSO, the main reason was absenteeism of staff, and related to this, failure to
process transactions on time. Both of these issues would then necessitate more than one visit to the
OWSO, representing opportunity (and travel) costs to the customer. Tardiness in arriving to work is
reported in a number of the surveys and is corroborated by field visits. The problem of staff not working
full work days has tended to be more of a problem in some OWSOs than others and this is notable in the
beneficiary surveys across different districts.

PCO End Evaluation (2014)

Annex 9. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

      A. Summary of Borrower's ICR
The Borrower’s Completion Report was compiled from the agreed end evaluations and feedback from
the final Project Forum. Much of the content has been included throughout this ICR. The following
summaries are taken from these reports.

The overall conclusion of the end evaluation is that the four sub-components contributed positively to
enhancing demand and supply of good governance in Cambodia by bringing actors (State Institutions
(SI) and CSO as well as workers and employers) together to engage constructively and build a better
understanding of each other’s roles and responsibilities. At the start of the project there was little
experience of institutionalized interaction between Cambodian CSOs and the state, and in general the
environment was characterized by mutual suspicion and distrust, and very few spaces where citizens
and especially communities in rural areas felt safe enough to criticize or protest against government
policies and practices outside of elections.

The AC and OWSO/DO have continued to be islands of integrity, which are perceived as welcome
alternatives to e.g. the Courts, line ministries and other sub-national complaint mechanisms. The
Project has impacted positively on their effectiveness and has scaled up OWSO/DO from a pilot
project to a standard service delivery mechanism with 36 OWSOs around the country. The AC has
continued to be an institution characterized by adherence to key governance principles, such as
integrity, accountability and transparency. OWSOs also have fewer informal fees and are more
transparent administrative services than any other institutions in Cambodia, although there are still
informal fees and staff absenteeism in some OWSOs. The Non State Actor Component (NSAC) has
made the most direct and significant contribution to the PDO by giving local communities the
confidence to increasing demand for improved accountability and transparency from local government
and giving local government improved knowledge and skills on how to respond to such demands. The
learning program struggled to find its form until late in the project when the I-SAF activities started,
and was less efficient at the start. Despite this, the learning program contributed a great deal to
building trust between civil society and the Government, and the lessons learned through
implementation of the learning program have fed into the formulation of the Social Accountability
Framework/Strategy (SAF).

The key achievements of the DFGG Project were:
(i)   Contribution to raising citizens’ awareness of the all institutions involved and their work and
      thereby promoting demand for good governance.
(ii) Contribution to mediating industrial disputes, with the AC and its labor arbitration process having
      been remarkably effective in solving an impressive number of disputes, and thereby contributing
      to growth and private sector development.
(iii) Contribution to creating islands of integrity, with the DO, OWSO and the AC all considered more
      effective and responsive and with a higher level of integrity than their alternatives, e.g., the sub-
      national complaint system, the line ministries and the Courts.
(iv) Contribution to improved transparency, with the AC operating as a model institution of
      transparency and accessibility. OWSOs and health clinics have also, to a larger extent, been
      transparent in displaying fees and processing times and commune councils have to a larger extent
      shared information at notice boards and at public forums/commune meetings. Disclosure
      practices of the ACF and PCO also improved.
(v) Contribution to enhancing demand for good governance at the local level, as citizens have
      increasingly gained the confidence to speak out against illegal and unethical practices (e.g., staff
      not performing in health clinics or schools).

                                                    75
(vi) Contribution to the Government, especially at commune level, being more responsive to citizens’
      demand and the Government at the national level being responsive
(vii) Contributing to the design, development , testing and training for the implementation of the SAF
      (2015-18).

There is a limit to the structural changes that can be expected within the short time frame of a project
like DFGG. Five years is a short time in the Cambodian context, where the idea of social
accountability was relatively new; and at some point project impacts will hit a ceiling if project
interventions are not supplemented by implementation of broader reforms e.g., civil service reform and
judiciary reforms.

Arbitration Council Independent Evaluation Summary
Cambodia’s Arbitration Council (AC), more than ten years old, was established in 2003 to provide an
independent, credible, and effective institutional mechanism for resolving disputes between employees
and the employers. AC has helped resolve many thorny labor disputes in the last decade or so. As a
relatively young and upcoming legal and developmental institution in the country, a continuous
assessment of the public’s awareness and confidence in the AC is important to enable it to function
effectively in the rapidly changing industrial landscape.

The final study of the DFGG project utilized a mixed methodology: a combination of survey-based
quantitative assessment, as well as interview-based qualitative assessment of the public’s awareness of,
and the confidence in, AC’s operations. In general, there is a very high awareness of the AC. It is
perceived as a corruption-free institution, with no reports of the payment of informal fees to use its
services. The AC, as an institution responsible for resolving industrial and labor disputes, has held up
well despite the difficult environment that prevailed in recent times with widespread labor strikes and
employer-employee conflicts. The quality of the process continues to improve, which is unusual for a
Cambodian legal institution. The perception of credibility far exceeds any other part of the legal and
judicial sector.

Despite good and improving results, there is still scope for strengthening systems, including better
dissemination of AC’s role and functions, stricter enforcement of its decisions and awards, and
managing public perceptions of its independence, credibility, and effectiveness. All this is challenging
in a political climate in which people have little trust in the decision-making of formal institutions,
particularly legal institutions, given the country’s weak record of governance and the rule of law. It is
worth reiterating that perceptions of AC will be determined by each client’s experience during the
dispute resolution process. An award favoring one side is very likely to lead the other to conclusions
doubting AC’s credibility and impartiality, and this explains the variations in the levels of confidence
in AC’s independence, credibility and effectiveness across the baseline, midline and end line studies.
This data shows that employers and unions had similar responses, that there is little to no bias. In
future AC will need to continue strengthening its capacity, professionalism, efficiency and decision-
making quality.

One Window Service Office Independent Evaluation Summary
The relevance of the OWSO sub-component was high in terms of development challenges and it is
well aligned with RGC priorities. The decision to focus OWSO/DOs in provincial centers was
appropriate given concentrated populations and business activity. The sub-component was designed to
address clearly identified weaknesses in government service delivery, including opaque and
conflicting requirements and payment of informal fees. The level of ownership demonstrated by RGC
over OWSOs is extremely high, as demonstrated by the contribution of State funds, their expansion,
and passage of a large number of decrees to institutionalize the OWSO/DO model. RGC’s priority was


                                                   76
clearly on strengthening the structure of the institutions. Problems with the services delegated are still
to be resolved, especially for small businesses.

The sub-component was largely effective in achieving intended results. OWSOs/DOs are increasing
citizens’ expectations of service delivery and OWSOs/DOs are serving as a model across government
in the provision of administrative services. All deliverables were completed. Partnering with NGOs
was more effective than government-only efforts to disseminate information. Although partnerships
were less of a focus than in other components, Government and NGOs agreed that partnerships made
under the sub-component contributed positively to results. Learning focused on implementing and
sustaining the OWSO rather than on experimenting with different modalities. The most important
learning has been the replication of the model within government to increase transparency. This is one
of the main achievements of the sub-component. Efficiency of the sub-component was satisfactory.
New construction of offices, rather than rehabilitating existing government offices, was justified. The
efficiency of the OWSO model itself could be improved by removing the requirement to have separate
back office staff assigned from each line department.

No major concerns were noted regarding financial management. The key implementation challenge
was the level and quality of staffing. This is reflective of weaknesses in RGC administration at a
whole. At the national level, challenges were encountered in monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and
procurement staff capacity. Upper management and the technical advisory group (TAG) were effective
at reaching agreements across ministries and between levels of government, within existing political
constraints. This was critical to the achievements of the sub-component.

Sustainability. RGC has made a large number of policy and budgetary changes required to
institutionalize the OWSO activity as a standard model for government service provision. However,
certain activities, such as training and partnerships with NGOs, have already lapsed with the
withdrawal of project support. The financial sustainability of individual OWSOs is still in question, as
MOI/MEF have not yet issued a clear plan for subsidizing or otherwise supporting loss-making
OWSOs. Steps taken by MOI/MEF to increase service fees as a way to cover operating costs need to
be considered carefully for their impact on the poor. Sustainability of results is jeopardized by the
withdrawal of salary incentives, resulting in absenteeism of OWSO staff and reports of increased
demands for informal payments.

Non State Actor’s Component Independent Evaluation Summary
The evaluations of the non-state actors component investigated the results and changes as a
consequence of CSO interventions made with support from the NSAC component. Some of the main
findings are summarized below.

Substantial changes in policies and practices, improvement in trust, partnership and collaboration,
improvement in the performance of state institutions, enhanced capacities of CSOs and enhanced
participation and capacities of citizens, improvements in accountable and transparent functioning of
commune councils. The gradual opening up of monthly commune council meetings and public forums
to citizens, increased interaction with councils and citizens. Enhanced participation of citizens and
facilitation from CSOs have also resulted in increased information sharing with regard to the budget
and development plans. Similar interventions are needed to scale up transparent and accountable
practices in governance institutions. The evaluation also noticed discernible changes in the practices of
various line departments and service providing agencies, (particularly primary schools and health
centers) actively participating in SA and citizen engagement activities and acting upon citizen
feedback. The evidence of positive changes is more prominent in second round projects, as compared
with the first round, indicating an increase in capacity.



                                                   77
Growing trust and mutual respect between CSOs and state institutions. The increase in interaction,
collaborative activities, and mutual support have helped in overcoming the hesitation of government
representatives to attend CSO organized events and meetings, as learners or resource persons. The
practice of joint planning and implementation of various social accountability tools have improved the
relationship to a great extent, and feedback sessions were fruitful in planning corrective actions.
Although examples of partnership and mutual support were evident across various spheres of
governance institutions, the depth of relationship between commune councils and CSOs was the most
prominent gain.

Improvements in the performance of local institutions - increased citizen access to civil registration
(birth, death, marriage certificates), improved performance and responsiveness of public service
delivery agencies, e.g., primary education authorities, health centers, irrigation water authorities,
fisheries authorities. Planning processes at the commune level have also become more consultative,
and in many instances included issues faced by communities and need to be taken forward in the
implementation of commune plans. SIs monitored in the second round, particularly health centers and
primary schools, showed marked improvements in performance and willingness to change, compared
to the overall impact of the first round of projects. Many of the project activities have contributed to
the preparation of service improvement plans for health centers and primary schools in consultation
with citizens. Improvements in performance of state institutions were mostly, but not always, limited
within the existing resource capacities of state institutions, if there was no access to or leveraging of
additional resources to provide services to citizens. Project activities and the engagement between state
institutions and CSOs have instilled enthusiasm among the government officials, which has helped in
shedding off the ‘institutional inertia’ and to check corrupt practices. This has, in turn, contrib uted to
better service delivery to citizens.

Enhanced capacities of Non-State Actors (Intermediary CSOs). Institutional capacity of CSOs to
create public demand for good governance has been strengthened in almost all CSOs. This included
enhanced knowledge and awareness for conceptualizing and designing promotional activities and
acquiring skills to facilitate. In nearly all CSOs, there has been considerable capacity enhancement to
facilitate mediation and interface between citizens and state institutions, which in most cases were the
local commune/sangkat councils and service providers. The mediation function focused more on
sharing the needs and concerns of the citizens, with not enough attention on grievance redress. Further,
in at least seven CSOs in the first round and at least eleven CSOs in the second round, capacity to
facilitate citizen monitoring of government programs has been enhanced.
Enhanced capacities of citizens. The level of awareness among citizens and their ability to organize
and engage constructively with state authorities was enhanced considerably, e.g., through collective
interventions to promote monitoring and engage citizens in stakeholder dialogues. In some project
locations, citizens participated actively and their capacities to organize and take collective action had
reached an advanced stage as compared to others where it was still being strengthened. In some cases,
the capacities of citizens and their collectives to negotiate and interface with the authorities resulted in
influencing them to take decisive actions. These differences can be attributed to various factors, e.g.,
length of the project, approach, depth and spread of geographic focus of the project, local context, and
local dynamics.

The completion of the SAF and its implementation Plan are the primary means to take these results
forward. The NSAC component has played a strategic and practical role in its design, development,
testing, development of training materials, and the first round of training trainers.

Project Coordinating Office and Learning Program Independent Evaluation Summary
PCO has been very process-driven in its approach to both coordination and the learning program. This
is understandable as it has been under obligation to deliver a number of project outputs. Most
importantly, it had to deliver the consolidated financial and narrative reporting and had to ensure that
                                                    78
IAs followed rules/procedures. It had to establish the GRLC and deliver a number of training programs
as per the CTP. The PCO has delivered these outputs, though it has not been efficient

An unintended - or at least not explicitly intended - outcome of the deliberations of the PCO has been
the contribution to building trust and constructive engagement between MOI and its CSO partners, as
well as the broader group of CSOs and SIs that participated in advisory groups and training events.
MOI has built credit and trust with CSOs that will contribute to the sustainability of GRLC as a
platform for continued constructive learning and engagement between Government and CSOs. A
number of the objectives of the PCO has however not been fully achieved. The PCO was supposed to
ensure coherence and synergies between Project components, to harmonize with other donor projects
and to build capacity of other IAs. This has not been within the capabilities of the PCO, and there were
no other similar donor projects to harmonize, and it was not relevant or realistic to expect the PCO to
take on these responsibilities. PCO staff did not have the technical capacity until late in the project to
be pro-active and steer the learning program. PCO was willing to improve approaches, e.g., the way
training themes were carried out, but it did not have the capacity to work out the details of a new
approach or the ability to mobilize others early enough. In hindsight it may have been preferable if the
Research and Training Organization (RTO) had been procured with technical expertise in M&E,
learning, communication and SA, as originally envisaged. However, this would have reduced the
ownership developed by PCO when it took over GRLC.

The PCO rightly focused on running the project and delivering as per the Financing Agreement.
Moreover, it has been very flexible and solution oriented in project management and has managed to
solve implementation issues as they arose, including reorienting training towards implementation of
the SAF. The evaluation notes that GRLC can continue to function as a formal venue for training and
constructive engagement between Government and civil society, but not as a center for ‘getting
together’ or for research. The sustainability of the learning program on social accountability depends
on Government’s continued commitment to social accountability principles. The fact that SAF has
become a part of NSDP 2014-2018 is a promising start.


    B. Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR

         Cambodia has undergone many phases of development since the general elections in 1993.
During each phase, the Royal Government set different key strategies, priorities and in-depth reforms
to respond to new information and the needs of society, with the long-term vision of moving towards
being a middle-income country by 2030. For the Rectangular Strategy implementation to demonstrate
its strong commitment for the five-year socio-economic development ahead, the Royal Government of
Cambodia has adopted comprehensive national strategic development plans one after another. Many
policies, national programs, and activities have been carried out to strengthen and expand economic
infrastructure for growth and employment. Action has been taken to strengthen social infrastructure for
equity and democratic infrastructure for efficiency. The principle of democracy is not defined only by
elections, but also needs mechanisms of good governance including decentralization and
deconcentration reform, strengthening human resources capacity, strengthening of social
accountability, public service and public administration and local alternative disputes resolution.

       Good Governance is crucial to strengthening democratic infrastructure in Cambodia. This can
be improved through participatory and comprehensive approaches, enhancing information sharing,
accountability and transparency and equality.

         The DFGG project financed by the World Bank and the RGC, for five years (Jun 2009-Sep
2014) aimed to enable citizens to access to good governance in public services through state and non-
state actors, in order to bring about better performance, more transparency and accountability, and

                                                   79
services that are more responsive to the people’s daily needs in a more timely manner. It also aimed to
help to reduce corruption and poverty and keep the economy growing. DFGG’s achievements in
supporting the Royal Government’s reform policy in the field of good governance were achieved
through each of the key components.

         By completion, the DFGG Project contributed to the development of Cambodia’s human
resources by developing institutional capacity building, creating opportunities for partnerships between
the government and civil society, creating an environment of mutual trust, settling labor disputes
between employees and employers changing policy on decentralization and deconcentration and
improving the quality and effectiveness of public service delivery. The DFGG project has also made
citizens aware and empowered them to exercise their rights and obligations to hold the government to
account by being more open, transparent and inclusive. This ultimately leads to improved democratic
development in Cambodia.

         Given these higher level achievements, the RGC believes that the project has had satisfactory
results. The evidence from the various components is as follows:

   One Window Service Offices and District Ombudsman. The Ministry of Interior in
    collaboration with Ministries installed 36 One Window Service and District Ombudsman Offices
    (OWSO/DOs) across the country. They delivered 435,562 services by delegated power and
    functions from eleven Ministries, many new to this process. The OWSOs received over US$ 1
    million – and this money went towards the national budget, and saved everyday customers time
    and money as they volunteered to opt in to a more transparent regulatory framework. The
    OWSO/DO component actively contributed to enhancing the quality of public administration to be
    more competent, transparent, accountable and responsive than in the past. It showed to all
    institutions in Cambodia how things can be done differently, and helped to change the mindset,
    behavior and values of officers and district administrators about the standards of conduct expected.
    This is a very satisfactory result both in the OWSO districts and in its ripple effect in government.
   Arbitration Council. The Arbitration Council has dealt with collective labor disputes swiftly and
    transparently, adhering to the rule of law and international norms to create a good environment for
    investment and economic growth, promote good industrial relations and build trust in institutions.
    The 1320 cases heard by the Arbitration Council have contributed to improved labor practices,
    compliance with the Labor Law, reducing industrial action and fostering more collaborative and
    constructive negotiations. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Employers and
    Unions on Improving Industrial Relations in the Garment Industry led to binding arbitration, (and
    later monitoring) was a milestone in Industrial relations in Cambodia. Without the Arbitration
    Councils, strikes could have resulted in prolonged work stoppages, income loss and potential
    violence. This would have had a significant impact on Cambodia’s economy. The ICR financial
    and economic analysis shows how important this contribution was. The component was highly
    satisfactory, highly relevant and efficient.
   Non-State Actors Component. NSAC supported 35 CSOs to engage in governance reform and
    develop innovative social accountability approaches. These approaches enhanced the promotion of
    access to information, monitored government action and mediated engagement between the state
    and citizens. As NGOs learnt about social accountability, together with government officials, they
    strengthened citizen demand for good governance – supporting access to information, capacity
    building for community based organizations, and formal and informal opportunities for citizen
    participation in sub-national governance. Impressive results were those obtained by the grants that
    facilitated citizen monitoring processes of hundreds of schools and health centers, resulting in
    better services, and improved the efficiency of local service providers. These satisfactory results
    have led the Royal Government to a strong commitment to a new nationwide Social
    Accountability Framework.

                                                   80
   Governance Resource and Learning Center. Under the DFGG project, a Governance Resource
    and Learning Center (GRLC) was established in the Ministry of Interior and provided short-term
    training for national and sub-national public officials and civil society representatives on
    governance, democratic development, decentralization, social accountability, public administration,
    dissemination of laws and legal instruments. It was unanticipated that the project would reach over
    1800 government officials (of all levels) and civil society organization representatives. In addition
    to the training, the GRLC learned and shared experiences and good practices from the
    implementation of projects and built new collaborations with NGOs partners to increase
    effectiveness of work and minimize negative aspects or possible risks. The end of the project
    forum in which all stakeholders – government and civil society – endorsed the success of the
    DFGG project, was a satisfactory result.

Reorienting the project midway enabled the Royal Government to support the higher performing
components and this resulted in greater benefit for Cambodia. The Bank and Royal Government were
flexible in making these changes, and as a result the project was highly relevant to RGC policy.

Despite these achievements, the ICR correctly assesses that the project was too short. Four years is a
short time to achieve significant governance reform, and many of these components reached their peak
as the project was closing. This was identified as a risk at project appraisal, and the project was
extended as a result. Bringing service delivery closer to the people and enabling civil society to have a
greater voice in how services can become more responsive and effective will require time and great
effort but the process has begun and will move forward. This requires a transformation of attitudes and
practices as well as the development of individual and collective capacities across the country. The
project was also set up as a learning-by-doing project because much of the activity was new to the
country and to key stakeholders. This learning is a key project result that will also be of benefit.

The new paradigm for development has been shifted and 2015 will see the next stage in this
transformation in subnational governance:
   The Policy on Human Resource Management and Development at Sub-national Administration
    adopted by the Royal Government in April 2014, provides a long-term roadmap and guiding
    principles to establish the sub-national HR system for sub-national democratic development and
    national development.
   To implement the HR development policy, the Ministry of Interior of the Kingdom of Cambodia
    will establish schools of local administration at the provincial level. This will help to address the
    capacity issues which slowed the DFGG project at times, and build on the GRLC initiative. In the
    future, the MOI GRLC ‘School of Governance’ will provide responsive training services and
    training of trainers to underpin this subnational capacity building program.
   One of the key objectives of the decentralization reform program is to institutionalize a new
    accountability framework at sub-national level including the administration’s accountability to the
    elected councils and the councils’ accountability to their electorate and civil society. The Second
    Phase Three-Year Implementation Plan (2015-2017) of the National Program on Sub-National
    Democratic Development, in short “IP3-II”, was approved by NCDD on 31 December 2014 and it
    includes, for the first time, a platform for enhancing citizen engagement and social accountability
    – a product of the DFGG project.

         The ICR assessment of post-project sustainability should be emphasized, in most cases new
institutional arrangements have been established. The project has triggered significant policy and
institutional changes. The Ministry of Interior institutionalized the structures that will manage and roll
out One Window Services at the District level in Cambodia, and set up a new transparency in district
administrations, and the Governance Resource and Learning center is embedded in the structures of


                                                   81
the MOI to improve governance knowledge and dialogue between government and civil society. The
Arbitration Council will continue to provide a reliable forum for mediation trusted by employers,
unions and workers, and has maintained its independence for the foreseeable future. In 2013, the
Strategic Plan for Social Accountability in Sub National Democratic Development, signed by the
Deputy Prime Minister, H.E Sar Kheng, was introduced after broad consultation with civil society, and
its implementation is included as a key goal in the 5 year National Strategic Development Plan
(NSDP) (2014-18). Learning from the DFGG project activities, it is now starting implementation and
signals a new stage in citizen engagement in Cambodia, which will enable a new closely integrated
partnership approach to building better basic services and commune performance.

        The achievements and outcomes of the project on promoting, mediating, monitoring and
responding to DFGG, should have a rating of satisfactory as they will form part of the RGC and
relevant Ministries’ ongoing reforms, especially as it is closely aligned with the third phase of the
Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Effectiveness. The project was
implemented under the leadership of H.E Sar Kheng, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior
and Chairman of National Committee for Sub-national Democratic Development (NCDD) with the
support of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. These achievements have been accomplished due to
the state-non-state partnerships that the project planned for, with active participation of relevant
Ministries and staff of the Royal Government, sub-national administrations, Cambodian civil society
organizations and citizens.

Annex 10. Comments of Other Partners/Stakeholders

Arbitration Council Foundation

The Arbitration Council Foundation agrees with the overall assessment of the AC subcomponent of
the project documented in this ICR. ACF recognizes that World Bank’s financial and technical
supports were of significant benefit because they made possible achievement of greater transparency
and accountability of AC processes. This technical advice was valuable not just for the implementation
period but has residual fiduciary and governance impact. Being a World Bank beneficiary helped build
capacity and broader understanding of governance norms and helped ensure that internal processes and
public disclosure support the development of accountable systems. ACF also acknowledges the
default benefits of being part of a larger governance project. It has provided the opportunities for
strengthening relationships across government, inter-governmental communications, while conducting
the normally quite narrow function of an Arbitration Council. Without the Arbitration Council’s
services, disputes are likely to continue escalating without resolution and economic and social progress
is unlikely to be sustainable. Support for the Arbitration Council’s services will also contribute to
enhancing a more positive image for Cambodia’s private sector development and ensuring increased
labor productivity by effectively dealing with disruptive industrial conflicts. The Arbitration Council is
the only institution supplying Cambodia’s demand for quick, fair and competent arbitration of labor
disputes. A thriving private sector, strong export competitiveness and healthy, stable industrial
relations will continue to rely on a strengthened Arbitration Council, achieved through the DFGG
project. To that end, ACF considers the DFGG funding of dispute resolution core services critical to
the development of the Arbitration Council over the last five years. Without significant stable support
to this technically specific service, the ACF may have struggled to build stakeholder capacity and
engagement critical to the take up of labor mediation and arbitration.

The Asia Foundation

The Asia Foundation agrees with the ICR’s descriptive and rated assessments of the NSAC
subcomponent. Being a World Bank beneficiary, and joint research partner, helped build broader
understanding of governance systems and helped ensure the development and testing of community
level accountability mechanisms. As a subset of the overall array of achievements of the DFGG
program, TAF also benefited from the linkages the program created between the IAs. As a result of
the program as a whole, TAF’s engagement with the PCO and ACF has led to the initiation of other
joint interventions with those partners which are ongoing. The World Bank’s technical leadership was
valuable in bringing together advisory support for social accountability methodology and practice
while leveraging its strong institutional partnership with RGC to promote policy uptake. The time
frame that was envisioned to achieve all DFGG program objectives was too short, but the Foundation
recognizes this will now be developed through the I-SAF platform. Continued support to civil society
organizations to fully transition the I-SAF from being dependent on external resources to being
locally-owned by both government and civil society will be necessary. Robust citizen-commune
engagement, whether under the I-SAF or through any other mechanisms, will continue to benefit from
the focus on local leadership, problem solving, and improved access to public information. TAF also
acknowledges the important role the World Bank played in ensuring transparency, access to critical
program-related information, and adherence to partnership principles. TAF recognizes that World
Bank support was of significant benefit for establishing the framework of social accountability at the
policy level and for ensuring the administrative space to implement the framework at the local level.
