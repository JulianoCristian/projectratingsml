           Introduction
           Community scorecards (CSCs) provide a mechanism to
           monitor the services that are provided by, inter alia,
           schools, health centers, communes and districts. A variety
           of approaches were developed through the grants to non-
           state actors. Being able to compare and contrast this
           experience has been very useful for lesson learning and
           moving forward with those lessons in mind.
           One of the commonalities found in the implementation of
           the CSCs developed in DFGG was that the committees
           established to carry out the scorecard were mixed.
           Research1 conducted over the same period in baseline
           communities was illustrating the limitations of these groups
           (e.g. the school support committee, and health center
           management committee) in enhancing citizen voice. During                             The VHSG is comprised of village volunteers and state
           DFGG implementation, a key concern of technical                                      actors often including the village chief and deputies. The
