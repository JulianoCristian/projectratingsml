Achieving this requires a\n            significant change in the mindset of government staff at\n            central and sub-national level as they learn to share\n            licensing authority and re-orient themselves from an\n            attitude of administrator to one of service provider as\n            explicitly called for in Cambodian government policy. This\n            implies a whole new mindset around transparency,\n            accountability, customer-orientation and of course, rent\n            seeking. At the same time, customers, whether individual\n            citizens seeking civil registrations or small businesses\n            obtaining commercial licenses, must also change their\n            expectations and attitudes, becoming more willing to demand\n            better services, avail themselves of complaint mechanisms\n            when necessary, and comply with regulation voluntarily.
