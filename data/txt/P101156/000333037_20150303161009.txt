           What changes are required?

           For OWSO staff, there is an adjustment from the low
           expectations common in most government offices to an
           attitude of professionalism and customer service
           orientation being fostered in the OWSO (One Window
           Service Office). In contrast to common practices in the civil       Local leadership must also display a willingness to engage
