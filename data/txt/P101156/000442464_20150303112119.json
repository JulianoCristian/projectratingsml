As a part of\n            an initiative to provide transparent and accountable\n            administrative services at the district level, a DFGG grant\n            stimulated a partnership between the One Window Service\n            Office (OWSO) and a provincial NGO. This partnership is\n            unique in so much as it supported government in promoting\n            awareness of citizens through outreach and mobilization\n            activities. At the same time the arrangement provided an\n            important monitoring and feedback mechanism. Although this\n            dual role creates a complex set of activities and a\n            multi-sided relationship with the One Window Service Office\n            (OWSO) and District Administration, it has been very\n            effective in improving accountability and responsiveness.\n            The approach is now being replicated to OWSOs in 24\n            provinces, not only through grants to NGOs, but also by OWSO\n            directly contracting NGOs."}, "docdt": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
