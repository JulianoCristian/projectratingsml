                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress toward the PDO is moderately satisfactory. Under the Support to State Institutions component 1A, the Arbitration Council continues to perform well. It has handled over
                         1100 cases, far surpassing the target of 514, involving over 700,000 workers, 90% of which are women. An expert audit determined that the quality of awards handed down at 86%.
                         Under Component 1C, the One Window Service Office (OWSO) has 36 OWSOs delivering 194 services, delegated by 10 ministries. Nineteen OWSOs were constructed with
                         counterpart financing demonstrating government ownership. The OWSOs operate all offices in accordance with good standards of accountability and transparency, and have
                         undertaken over 420,000 transactions (cf. 250,000 target). Continued monitoring and oversight will be needed to ensure these standards are continued after Bank financing is

                         complete. The average reduction of cost for OWSO customers is 43% (cf. what they report to have paid previously for the same service). Awareness and understanding of the OWSO
                         initiative have improved with client awareness and understanding scores ranging from 57-70% against a target of 60%. District Ombudsman offices provide a channel for
                         communicating complaints about services received. On average, 89% of clients perceived the Ombudsman to be effective in handling complaints. Under the Non-State Actors
                         component (NSAC) 2, activities by 35 NGOs have triggered changes among participating institutions such as posting budgets and disclosing performance information and commune

                         decisions. Citizen monitoring with project grants has exceeded targets: over 226 communes (cf. target of 100), 330 schools (cf. target of 175) and 153 health centers (cf. target of 80)
                         have been engaged in civil society monitoring processes, with about 70% reporting positive impact.

                         Following the endorsement of the Social Accountability Framework (SAF- The Strategic Plan for Social Accountability in Subnational Democratic Development) by civil society actors
                         and the RGC in 2013 (see www.ncdd.gov.uk/ SAF), the project supported the development of the guidelines and resource materials for implementation. The implementation of the
                         SAF requires the public display of rights, standards and performance information, open budgets and budget literacy, and citizen monitoring, through an agreed community scorecard
                         process – in all rural primary schools, health centers and communes. Both CSOs and government will carry out critical activities for effective implementation.

                         Under component 3, the Project Coordinating Office continues to manage the Governance Learning and Resource Center (GRLC). Learning program events have been reoriented to
                         support the implementation of the SAF.
