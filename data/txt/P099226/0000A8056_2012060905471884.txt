                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Six of the seven components of project closed by December 31, 2009. All the closed components were rated Satisfactory except the procurement component which was rated
                         moderately satisfactory. Currently, there is only one outstanding component on the support to commissions. This component is financing the construction of the Head Offices of the
                         the Southern Sudan Anti Corruption Commission (SSACC) and the Southern Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC). The life of the MDTF was scheduled to close on December 30, 2011;

                         and the Government and the key donors agreed to extend by another 12 months the life of the MDTF to allow the full completion the South Sudan MDTF portfolio. In preparation for
                         this extension, therefore, the project was restructured in June 2011, and PDO revised as follows: "to put in place critical government infrastructure at national and state level; and
                         provide basic pharmaceutical stocks and learning materials to bridge the emergency situation". In addition, project indicators were also revised. After completion of the designs by
                         the supervising consultant, and the bidding process finally completed, two contractors were selected in September 2011. This was almost a year after the selection of the supervising
                         consultant. The current closing date for the project is June 30, 2012. However, donors and the Government have agreed to a six-month extension of the MDTF-SS to allow for
                         smooth completion of all activities. Therefore, projects will be extended and the proposed closing date for this project is now December 31, 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The two buildings for SSAC and SSACC are not likely to be completed by the current closing date of June 30, 2012. With the proposed extension of the MDTF-SS to June 30, 2013,
                         there is a likelihood that the SSACC building could be completed by December 31, 2012. However, the SSAC building will not be completed by the proposed new closing date of
                         December 31, 2012.
