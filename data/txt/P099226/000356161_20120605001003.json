This\n            is a level one restructuring which includes the revision of\n            the project development objective (PDO), and the results\n            framework; and extension of the closing date from June 30,\n            2011 to June 30, 2012.  The extension is necessary to make\n            up for the initial loss of time while waiting to obtain\n            proof from Southern Sudan Anti - Corruption Commission\n            (SSACC) of documentation for its allocated land.

The project extension is to\n            facilitate completion of one component of the project\n            (component F) at a cost of US$7.5 million. This will be the\n            third extension of the project, and the cumulative extension\n            for this project will be 51 months."}, "docdt": "2011-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
