                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Six of the seven components of project closed between March 2008 and March 2010. All the closed components were rated Satisfactory except the procurement component which

                         was rated moderately satisfactory. The outstanding component is the support to commissions, which is financing the construction of the Head Offices of the the Southern Sudan Anti
                         Corruption Commission (SSACC) and the Southern Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC). The life of the MDTF was scheduled to close in 2011, and was likely to affect the successful
                         completion of this component, but the Government and the key donors have agreed to extend by another 12 months the life of the MDTF to allow the full completion of this and other
                         similar projects. The project has selected a consulting firm which will finalize the designs and supervise the construction of the head offices. On completion of the designs, two
                         contractors will be selected for the buildings. Given the critical nature of the activity and the time limit of the MDTF, there is need for Government and beneficiaries to work effectively
                         with the consulting firm and the contractors, when they are on board, for the smooth completion of the project.

                         The consulting firm responsible for finalizing the preliminary designs of the SSACC and SSAC is on board. They started work November 1, 2010. Two contractors will be selected,
                         one for each building to ensure effective and timely completion of the buildings. SSACC and SSAC are to work effectively with the consulting firm and ensure that all their needs are
                         taken into account in the finalized designs, as changes after this stage is likely to cause delays and cost overruns to the project.
