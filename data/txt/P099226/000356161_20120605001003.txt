      SOUTHERN SUDAN RAPID IMPACT EMERGENCY PROJECT (TF055976)

                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER




A. SUMMARY

1.      This is a level 1 restructuring which includes the revision of the project development
objective (PDO), and the results framework; and extension of the closing date from June 30,
2011 to June 30, 2012. The cumulative extension for this project would be 51 months from the
original closing date of March 31, 2008.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The project was prepared in an emergency situation and the original grant agreement for
RIEP was signed in November, 2005 for $20 million. It was funded through the Multi-Donor
Trust Fund for Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS). In order to respond to the dynamic and growing
needs of the GoSS, the grant agreement has been amended six times as follows: (i) November
17, 2006; (ii) April 4, 2007; (iii) August 11, 2007; (iv) June 12, 2008; (v) September 15, 2009;
and (vi) March 31, 2010.

3.      The performance of the original project (P099226) is rated satisfactory; and six of the
seven components closed on December 31, 2009. As of May 31, 2011, 100 percent of the
original US$ 20.0 million grant amount was fully disbursed. In 2009, an additional financing of
US$7.5m was approved to strengthen one of its components. The additional financing supported
the construction of office space for newly created commissions of GoSS; namely, the Southern
Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC), and the Southern Sudan Anti - Corruption Commission
(SSACC).

4.      Lack of evidence of title to the land where the offices were to be constructed caused
delays in construction work and the project was extended from March 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011
in order to facilitate completion of the construction of the commissions. Furthermore, the
recruitment of a firm to design, tender and supervise construction work only became effective in
October 2010. Currently, GoSS is in the process of engaging a consultant to construct the
buildings and the bids for the constructions of these building were opened May 5, 2011. It is
anticipated that award of the contracts would be made in late June, 2011 and construction is
planned to commence in July, 2011 and is expected to take about ten months.

5.      The inclusion of construction work as part of restructuring in November 2009 triggered a
modification of the Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS). Therefore, the ISDS was updated
in March 2010; and the environmental rating of the component stated as B- partial assessment.
This rating remains valid.


                                                1
6.     There are no outstanding audit reports and financial rating is satisfactory.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7.      The proposed changes are: (i) revision of the PDO, (ii) revision of the results framework;
and (iii) the extension of the closing date from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012. The original
PDO is being streamlined as the project was prepared in an emergency situation with a broad
PDO aimed at addressing several evolving emergency needs. In addition, activities were
expected to be delivered quickly.


8.      The Original project development objective is: to restore livelihoods resulting from the
long term civil unrest; restore basic services to the affected population; jump start the recovery
process in Southern Sudan through the emergency provision of goods and services to improve
government functionality. The revised PDO is: to put in place critical government
infrastructure at national and state level; and provide basic pharmaceutical stocks and learning
materials to bridge the emergency situation.

9.     The Results Framework has been revised in line with a revised PDO to allow better
measurement of the performance of the project. The revised Results Framework is attached in
annex 1.

10.    In order to facilitate completion of the construction, an extension from June 30, 2011 to
June 30, 2012 is being requested. This will be the third extension of the project and the
cumulative extension for this project will be 51 months.

                                    Extension of Closing Date

               SOUTHERN SUDAN RAPID IMPACT EMERGENCY PROJECT
                                  P099226
                                 (TF055976)


1. The closing date for Southern Sudan, Rapid Impact Emergency Project (TF055976),
   P099226 will be extended from June 30, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2.     The project extension is to facilitate completion of one component of the project
(component F) at a cost of US$7.5 million. This component focuses on construction of
permanent offices of the Southern Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC), and the Southern Sudan Anti-
Corruption Commission (SSACC).

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to make up for the initial loss of time while waiting
to obtain proof from SSACC of documentation for its allocated land. Further, recruitment of a
firm for design, tendering and construction supervising was delayed. The Government has
prepared a procurement plan to complete the remaining component of this project and is in the
process of engaging a consultant to construct the buildings. The bids for the constructions of
these building were opened on May 5, 2011. It is anticipated that award of the contracts would
be made in late June 2011. The construction is planned to commence in July 2011 and is
expected to take ten months. Therefore, the sole activity of the remaining component will be
completed within the requested extension period.

4.      This will be the third extension of the project, and the cumulative extension for this
project will be 51 months.
