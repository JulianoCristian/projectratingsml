                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There is only one outstanding component on the support to commissions as six of the seven components of project closed by December 31, 2009. All the closed components were
                         rated Satisfactory except the procurement component which was rated moderately satisfactory. This component is financing the construction of the Head Offices of the the Southern
                         Sudan Anti Corruption Commission (SSACC) and the Southern Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC). The project was restructured in June 2011 for a one year extension of closing date to

                         June 30, 2012. The PDO was revised to: "put in place critical government infrastructure at national and state level; and provide basic pharmaceutical stocks and learning materials to
                         bridge the emergency situation". Further, project indicators were also revised. In May 2012, donors and the Government agreed to a six-month extension of the MDTF-SS to allow
                         for smooth completion of all activities. Therefore, all projects were extended and the closing date for this project is now December 31, 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It was anticipated that with the extension of the project closing date to December 31, 2012, the SSACC building could be completed. However, it was recognized that the SSAC
                         building would not be completed by the closing date even though MDTF-SS funds would be utilized in full. Currently, the SSACC building has not been completed and about 25% of
                         the total MDTF-SS resources are yet to be spent. In addition, only 50% of the total MDTF-SS resources have been spent on the SSAC building. The government will continue with
                         the works' contracts beyond the closing date using its own resources already provided for the two buildings (about $1.2 million and $2.9 million for the SSACC and SSAC,
                         respectively). Unspent amounts from the MDTF-SS resources on December 31, 2012 will be canceled and the government is planning to seek alternative funding from other
                         sources on a bilateral basis.
