Public Services\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) Program document proposes\n            policy-based budget support to assist the Government of\n            India (GoI, 'the government') in implementation of\n            its National e -Governance Plan (NeGP). The ambitious goal\n            of this government-wide initiative is to make all government\n            services accessible to the common man (citizen) in his\n            locality, through common service delivery outlets and ensure\n            efficiency, transparency and reliability of such services at\n            affordable costs to realize basic needs. NeGP was approved\n            in May 2006 as a national program, coordinated at the\n            cabinet level, to replace an ad hoc array of e-governance\n            initiatives across individual agencies and states that had\n            developed throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The program is\n            expected to have significant social benefits for the poor\n            through expanded access, and improved citizen engagement in\n            e-services. GoI recognizes that the uneven progress of NeGP\n            has not been primarily due to funding constraints or the\n            absence of specific investments, but rather to cross-cutting\n            policy and coordination issues at a program level. The\n            development objective of the proposed series of DPLs is\n            'to increase access to online services by citizens in\n            their localities.' thus supporting a major part of the\n            NeGP's overall goal. It will assist the government do\n            this through supporting policy and institutional actions\n            that constitute a higher emphasis on coordination in the\n            NeGP, and increased outreach to citizens."}, "docdt": "2011-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
