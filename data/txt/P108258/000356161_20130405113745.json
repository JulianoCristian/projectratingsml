moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            India's National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) is a useful\n            governance-oriented model for countries modernizing their\n            service delivery processes. The citizen-centered approach of\n            the NeGP is a vibrant and relevant model for countries or\n            sub-national governments which are designing or implementing\n            Information and Communication Technology (ICT) reform\n            programs. An innovative and creative approach is needed for\n            engaging with a sophisticated client like the central\n            Government of India. Low-income state engagement is\n            well-aligned with the Bank's poverty and shared\n            prosperity mission; in the area of e-governance, it is also\n            a strategy which reflects a 'good fit' between\n            client needs and the Bank's traditional products and\n            services. Engagement with the Government is most beneficial\n            when it remains focused on substance and flexibility. A\n            structured and strategic approach to risk management should\n            be considered when programmatic interruption is a\n            significant possibility."}, "docdt": "2013-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
