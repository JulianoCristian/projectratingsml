        and Assessment Framework (SESAF) has been developed\n            specifically for the proposed sub-projects under the Bam\n            Earthquake Emergency reconstruction Project in Iran, to\n            ensure due diligence, to avoid causing harm or exacerbating\n            social tensions, and to ensure consistent treatment of\n            social and environmental issues by project authorities, and\n            those involved with the project. The framework shall assist\n            in the selection of sub-projects, to avoid or minimize as\n            possible, any likely social and/or environmental impact,\n            identify mitigation, and enforce compliance. In most cases,\n            mitigation will be inherent in standard engineering design\n            and construction practices. Investments considered to impose\n            unacceptable negative environmental impacts will not be\n            approved for financing. Checklists have been prepared to be\n            submitted with each subproject prior to approval. Any\n            subproject causing potential damage to cultural heritage\n            sites, will not be financed, as neither will any subproject\n            concerning construction of new primary roads or highways.\n            Subprojects eligible for project financing include (subject\n            to environmental screening approval): provision of equipment\n            and construction material for housing and commercial\n            buildings; repair of transport infrastructure (airport\n            facilities, highway repairs, and village streets);\n            telecommunication networks; retrofitting works of the key\n            strategic buildings in the Province of Kerman. As part of\n            the social framework, the report also addresses\n            resettlement, and indigenous population issues."}, "docdt": "2004-10-01T16:30:02Z"}
