1. 
Country and Sector Background
 
Iran is known to be one of the most earthquake prone countries in the world.  With two major 
seismic belts, the entire country faces moderate to very high seismic risks.  One runs along the 
Zagros Mountains in southern Iran, along the Persian Gulf, while the other runs through northern 
Iran around the Caspian Sea.  In the 20th century alone, twenty large earthquakes have claimed 
more than 160,000 lives, destroyed many villages and cities, and caused extensive economic 
damage to the country.  
 
Recurrent earthquakes, which have broad economic and fiscal consequences, destroy on average 
over one percent of the national housing stock annually.  From 1999 to 2001 alone, government 
subsidies to homeowners affected by natural disasters were in excess of annual average of 
US$1 billion, which amounts to 1.3 percent of GDP. 
 
2. Objectives 
 
The objectives of the Bam Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction Project (BEERP) are to: 
(a) restore the living conditions of the communities affected by the earthquake;  
(b) improve emergency preparedness in the Province of Kerman and the District of Bam and;  
(c) strengthen the planning and management capacity under the reconstruction program.

Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
The IBRD has significant global and country-specific experience in post-disaster emergency 
reconstruction.  In Iran, between 1992 and 2002 three reconstruction projects have been prepared 
with the total lending of US$487 million
1
.
The projects covered both reconstruction investments 
and technical assistance programs aiming at integrating disaster mitigation measures into 
country’s development efforts and thus contributing to reduce social and economic risks of 
natural hazards to which Iran is highly prone.  Given the magnitude of the damage and the 
comprehensive nature of reconstruction efforts needed in the present case, the IBRD is in a 
unique position to assist the Government of Iran to benefit from the worldwide experience and 
mobilize additional resources for sustainable reconstruction of Bam. 
 
4. Description 
 
The project objectives will be met through five components that are described below: 
 
Component-A-
 
Provision of Construction Material and Equipment for Housing and 
Commercial Buildings: 
This component will finance the procurement of: (i) construction 
material (steel bars, steel components for frames and Portland cement) for housing and 
commercial buildings; (ii) construction equipment, and (iii) design and supervision activities. 
 
Component-B-
 
Repair of the Transport Infrastructure: 
This 
component will finance:    (i) the rehabilitation and preventive 
works for the main highway linking Bam with the provincial 
capital city of Kerman; (ii) the rehabilitation and reconstruction 
of the Bam Airport facilities; (iii) the rehabilitation and paving of 
village streets and; (iv) design and supervision activities. 
 
Component-C-
 
Repair of the Telecommunications Infrastructure: 
This component will 
finance: (i) the reconstruction of telecommunication center buildings; (ii) the reconstruction 
of the transmission networks; (iii) reconstruction and expansion of mobile and data services 
and; (iv) design and supervision activities. 
 
Component-D-
 
Improved Emergency Preparedness in the Province of Kerman and the 
District of Bam: 
This component will finance: (i) retrofitting works of strategic emergency 
response buildings in the Province of Kerman; (ii) the provision of emergency response 
vehicles for the District of Bam (fire fighting trucks and ambulances) to replace equipment 
lost during the earthquake and; (iii) risk assessment and design and supervision activities. 
 
Page  3
Component-E-
 
Project Management and Technical Assistance: 
This component supports (i) 
project management through the establishment of the Bam Reconstruction Office (BRO) and; 
(ii) technical assistance to the BRO, aimed at assisting project implementation and improving 
project management capacity through the procurement of consultants for Procurement 
Advisory Services, Monitoring Advisory Services and Technical Advisory Services.

6. Implementation 
 
The project will be implemented by the Housing Foundation (HF), line ministries and other 
specialized Government agencies. Support to project management will be provided through the 
Bam Reconstruction Office (BRO) that will be set-up under the Reconstruction Planning Sub-
Committee at the HF. The BRO will be responsible for the overall contract management, 
coordination and procurement assistance to project implementation agencies; as well as the 
supervision and monitoring of implementation progress. The BRO will play an oversight 
function to ensure the adherence of the implementing agencies to the safeguard policies and to 
the implementation of relevant mitigation measures.
 
7. Sustainability 
 
The principal benefits of the Project are the reconstruction of the physical assets and the 
resumption of services to the earthquake-affected communities.  The overall environmental 
impact of the proposed project is expected to be positive in that it supports the restoration of 
necessary infrastructure in areas heavily damaged by the earthquake. Potentially negative 
environmental impacts are primarily associated with the construction works, such as land 
clearing, disposal of debris and worker safety. Investments identified under the IBRD financed 
project will not involve major expansion of space nor invasion into green areas. 
 
To ensure full compliance with the IBRD’s environmental and social safeguard requirements, 
and based on the best-practice models in similar earthquake recovery operations, a Social and 
Environmental Screening and Assessment Framework (SESAF) was prepared by the Borrower. 
A
Monitoring and Advisory Services Consultant (MASC) will be financed under Component-E 
of the Project to provide monitoring support to BRO throughout project implementation. During 
Project implementation, all projects would be screened to ensure that environmental and social 
risks, if any, are adequately addressed through the application of the standardized guidelines 
provided for under the SESAF.

The participation of earthquake affected communities (especially the most vulnerable groups and 
women) and the involvement of local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) is incorporated 
into the project Communications Strategy that will implemented by BRO. The strategy will serve 
as a policy framework for implementation agencies on flows of information and consultation 
processes among different levels (project implementation agencies, local governments, 
community leaders, NGOs, women, youth, the disabled, and children). Also, a Sr. Social Officer 
and Sr. Legal Officer will be hired at the Bam Reconstruction Office in order to implement the 
Communications Strategy and the SESAF.  They will ensure: (i) the timely consultation of the 
affected population; (ii) the early identification of social safeguard concerns and; (iii) the sound 
implementation of relevant mitigation measures . 
 
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
The Project has simple design and relies on existing institutions. Project activities are simple and 
independent from pre-investments. They involve limited land expropriation and resettlement.
