Considering the complexity of the\n            reconstruction efforts and taking into account the\n            Bank's country and international experience in\n            earthquake projects, the project will be implemented over a\n            four-year period. The funding of the reconstruction program\n            relies primarily on Government financing as well as support\n            from the World Bank, the Japan Bank for International\n            Cooperation, the Islamic Development Bank and countries from\n            the Persian Gulf and Europe. There are five project\n            components (some with multiple subcomponents): 1) provision\n            of construction material and equipment for housing and\n            commercial buildings; 2) repair of the transport\n            infrastructure; 3) repair of the telecommunications\n            infrastructure; 4) improved emergency preparedness in the\n            province of Kerman and the district of Bam; and 5) project\n            management and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2004-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
