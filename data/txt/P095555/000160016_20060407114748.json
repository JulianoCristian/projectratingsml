"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Ecuador Second Rural and Small Towns\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project targets rural water and\n            sanitation investments to the rural areas of cantons with\n            populations of up to 50,000 inhabitants, and provides\n            technical assistance to delegate these services and improve\n            sustainability of solid waste investments in urban and rural\n            areas. Given the presence of Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian\n            peoples in the project area, an Indigenous Peoples Plan (the\n            Plan) is triggered. The main objectives of the Plan will be\n            (a) to coordinate the supply and demand of water and\n            sanitation investment in Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian\n            communities, (b) to coordinate efforts of the Sub Secretary\n            of Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste (SAPSyRS), the health\n            ministry (including the Indigenous Health Dept), and the\n            education ministry (including the National Directorate of\n            Intercultural Bilingual Education) to standardize training\n            contents and strategies to train water and sanitation users\n            and water boards in Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian\n            communities, in order to improve the health conditions and\n            achieve sustainability of the water systems by optimizing\n            their financial administration, (c) to coordinate the\n            promotion and dissemination of information on the project\n            with Consejo Nacional de Nacionalidades y Pueblos Indigenas\n            del Ecuador (CODENPE), the Coordinadora de Desarrollo Afro\n            Ecuatoriano (CODAE) and \"alternative municipalities and\n            'mancomunidades'\" to ensure the information\n            reaches the poor and isolated. The Plan also discusses a\n            promotion campaign through the media in Spanish but with an\n            intercultural focus, and in indigenous languages as needed;\n            training of indigenous cabildos and water boards in\n            financial, administrative, technical, and social management\n            of water and sanitation systems with an intercultural focus;\n            regional workshops with alternative municipalities and\n            juntas parroquiales at the national level; and mid-term and\n            ex-post evaluations of sewerage and solid waste projects\n            benefiting indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities."}, "docdt": "2006-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
