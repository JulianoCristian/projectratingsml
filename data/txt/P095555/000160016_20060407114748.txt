ECUADOR Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project  II 
(PRAGUAS)
 
Social Assessment and Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) 
 
DRAFT 
 
1. Overview 
 
The Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Program was presented to the 
World Bank’s board in 2000 as a 10-year initiative supported by a 3-stage Adaptable 
Program Loan (APL) with loans of US$32 million (APL-1), US$48 million (APL-2) and 
US$50 million (APL-3). The APL-1 loan is now fully committed and is expected to close 
on 30 April, 2006. APL-2 (PRAGUAS II) is presently under preparation. 
 
The development objective for phase II of the APL program (“the project”) is to (i) 
provide sustainable WSS infrastructure for approximately 405,000 rural beneficiaries and 
to promote its effective use; (ii) provide sustainable WSS services to approximately 
325,000 beneficiaries in cantonal capitals; (iii) promote sustainable solid waste services 
in cantonal capitals; and (iv) improve overall sector performance by the national 
government by promoting performance-based investment financing for the urban WSS 
sector. 
 
PRAGUAS II’s targeting of rural WSS investments to the rural areas of cantons with 
populations of up to 50,000 inhabitants, as well as the provision of technical assistance 
for the delegation of WSS services and improved sustainability of solid waste 
investments in cantonal capitals responds to growing demand for these interventions in 
urban and rural areas. This is consistent with the phenomenon called “urbanization of 
poverty” at the turn of the century. According to the World Bank Poverty Assessment of 
Ecuador (April, 2004), between 1990 and 2001, the number of poor increased in Ecuador 
from 3.5 million to 5.2 million classified under “severe and high poverty” by the System 
for Selection of Beneficiaries of social programs –SELBEN). Poverty, remained constant 
in coastal rural areas, and increased by 15% in the rural highlands. The highest increases 
took place in urban areas of the coast and highlands where the poverty rate increased by 
up to 80%. Thus, the number of poor living in urban areas increased from 1.1 million to 
3.5 million. Also, according to the 2001 census, 12.1 % of Indigenous and 36 % of Afro-
Ecuadorians live in the main cantons of Quito and Guayaquil. The above phenomenon is 
noteworthy for the provision of water and sanitation, and particularly to respond to the 
demand of sewerage and solid waste services of the urban and rural poor.

The Demographic Mother-Infant Health Survey ENDEMAIN 2004 underscores the 
direct impact of clean water in the household on the health and nutrition of indigenous 
and non-indigenous families, as well as the community at large. Water-born diseases may 
be preventable with proper water treatment and sanitation. Some 22% of surveyed 
children 0-5 yrs old had diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the survey and prevalence was 
similar in urban and rural areas, but higher for indigenous (27%) than non-indigenous 
people (19%).  
 
According to the survey, about 80% of Ecuadorians have access to piped water: 48 % 
inside the household; 29 % outside the household, and 3 % from public standpipes. 
Another 7 % use public/ private well water; 5 % purchase water from trucks, and another 
5
%
use river or spring water.

The situation of Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorians differs greatly from the national 
averages. According to ENDEMAIN only 23% people self-identified as Indigenous and 
Afro-Ecuadorian have access to piped water inside and 37% outside the household; 13% 
use public standpipes or wells; 28% use river or creek water; and 2.2% purchase it from 
trucks. 
 
A
similar service gap between the national average and autochthonous people is apparent 
for sewerage. Only 19% of domestic sanitation solutions for indigenous people are 
connected to a sewer system, as opposed to 44% for the national average; 34% of 
autochthonous people’s sanitation is connected to a septic tank or soak-away pit; and the 
remaining 47% have no sanitation facilities at all.

In terms of solid waste disposal, 65% of Ecuadorians have public trash collection, but 
only 39% of autochthonous do. Some 25% of Ecuadorians in general burn or burry trash; 
but approximately 40% of autochthonous dispose of it in rivers, over cliffs or in empty 
lots.

2.2. T
HE DEMOGRAPHICS OF 
PRAGUAS I 
 
PRAGUAS is demand-driven. So far, PRAGUAS I has benefited 94,800 families 
distributed as follows: 66,157 families with both water and sanitation systems; 13,800 
families only with water, and 14,845 families only with sanitation. The baseline in the 
SINSOC system gives demographic results: 58% are mestizo, 15% are indigenous, and 
0.7% is Afro-Ecuadorian. In terms of occupation 77% of beneficiaries are small farmers 
and only 3% are traders. 20% have other occupations. One third of beneficiaries were 
children: 32% are between 0 and 5 yrs of age, and school-age children.  
 
3.  
Evaluations and Stakeholder Consultations 
 
The results of the following evaluations are being/have been used to improve the project 
design of PRAGUAS II: 
 
(a) The evaluation of 16 pilot projects of PRAGUAS I was used in 2003 to improve the 
original social, technical and financial design under APL-1. 
 
(b) The ex-post evaluation
of a purposeful sample of 40 projects was carried out in 2005 
by the Quinteros, Rojas & Dueñas consultants association. The sample included the pilot 
projects (completed in 2002) and 24 new projects completed at least 18 months prior to 
the evaluation. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the technical, social and 
economic efficiency and sustainability of the WSS systems provided by PRAGUAS and 
to evaluate the efficacy of the technical and financial processes, procedures and norms of 
the projects located in small municipalities with cantonal capitals of less than 10,000 
inhabitants. A total of 190 focus groups and interviews with mayors and EMS teams, 
water boards, community leaders and WSS male and female users were implemented; a 
1,752 household baseline survey instrument was applied, and 36 schools were used for 
observation. Some 38 water systems were assessed, and 237 water samples were 
analyzed in laboratories. Evaluation results and lessons learned are reflected below.

(c) An evaluation of water boards was carried out by NOLASCO Associates and financed 
by the Canadian Consultant Trust Fund in 2004. 
 
(d) In 2005, the institutional arrangements for the two largest components (WSS 
investments in rural areas (component 2) and small towns (component 3), respectively) 
were assessed by independent international consultants. 
.
The Ex-post Evaluation
The main conclusions and recommendations of the ex-post evaluation are: 
 
General Conclusions: 
a) As a result of PRAGUAS intervention, 90% of municipalities have 
institutionalized a Municipal WSS Team (EMS) as part of the Public Works Unit, 
Water and Sewerage Unit, Planning Unit, and Community Development of the 
municipality. The inclusion of the EMS has significantly improved the technical 
capacity of the municipal teams.  
b) The PRAGUAS participation scheme in the design as well as in the 
implementation phases of each WSS project was applied in 100 % of 
communities evaluated, however,  results show a demand for a more standardized 
hands-on training of EMS, OITS (Technical and Social Intermediary 
Organizations), water boards, and communities. 
c)  The financial scheme of PRAGUAS I have proven to be socially acceptable. Ex-
post evaluation results indicate satisfaction of municipalities and communities 
with the established contributions. Moreover, experience in Ecuador shows that 
communities are more likely to maintain projects where they made some 
investment, and neglect maintenance of donated projects. Therefore, contrary to 
other institutions’ paternalistic approach, PRAGUAS II will continue its tripartite 
financial policy: PRAGUAS (50 %), municipality (20 %) and community (30 %: 
10% in cash and 20% in kind).  
d) The selection criteria for rural water should remain: municipalities and 
communities willing to (i) co-finance 20% and 30% of RWSS investments, 
respectively, (ii) adopt rural tariffs that cover the cost of O&M and some 
equipment replacement; and (iii) agree to a demand-driven approach. Under these 
circumstances, the PRAGUAS program will provide TA for engineering designs, 
community development (including training and hygiene education) and 
supervision of works at no charge. 
e)  The ex-post evaluation indicated that the targeting of PRAGUAS I was pro-poor: 
92% of the beneficiaries of the pilot program and 72% of beneficiaries of WSS 
systems in 2002-2004 were small rural farmers, 5.6% were artisans or worked in 
small-scale industry; 5.3% in trade and only 0.5% own micro-enterprises.  
 
General Recommendations: 
Page  5
-
15 -  
a)  Provide an integrated vision of PRAGUAS to include water and sanitation of 
economically viable and sustainable systems. Provide water boards and 
communities with the skills and tools to protect their water sources. 
b)  Promote sustainability by pre-selecting municipalities that have: (i) a technical, 
social and financial team; (ii) municipal Plans that include WSS and watershed 
protection plans; (iii) a capable administrative/financial team; (iv) are up-to-date 
in tax payments. 
c)  Include in the criteria for selection of beneficiaries for piped systems, those 
organized communities of 100 or more households willing to pay tariffs. Smaller 
communities with less than 100 household connections may be offered water 
pumps instead. Projects with lower number of connections may not be 
economically viable. 
d)  The emphasis of PRAGUAS II should be on strengthening of EMS and water 
boards. Plan a periodic strengthening scheme of the Municipal Technical-Social-
Financial Teams (EMS) to ensure adequate skills of staff that have turned over.   
e)  Improve the PRAGUAS Monitoring and Evaluation systems, with user-friendly 
information systems that allow the utilization of the baseline and diagnostic data 
for monitoring of the Social Plan by the OITS, Municipality, Water Board and 
community.   
f)  A more participatory hands-on, training scheme (away from lecturing) of EPAS 
(Provincial Water and Sanitation Teams, subunits of the Ministry of Urban 
Development, Housing and Territorial Development (MIDUVI)), EMS 
(Municipal Sanitation Teams), OITS, Water Boards, systems operators and 
communities is needed across the project. Promote internships and workshops to 
learn-by-doing.  
g)  Assist Water Boards and communities in the formulation of Social Plans that 
include community planning, tax payment, assessment of natural resources, 
management of water sources. Social Plans should be implemented by both Water 
Board and community.  
h)  Disseminate more extensively PRAGUAS Operational Manuals for financial and 
technical operations, administration, social control and auditing in general. 
PRAGUAS procedures should be standard and universally known. 
 
Technical 
Conclusions
 
(a) In general, designs meet SAPSyRS norms. No technical problems were detected 
in hydraulic calculations for transmission mains and water distribution.  
(b) Quality of civil works and operation of the WSS units. The overall quality of the 
civil works, choice of construction materials (PVC-P pipes, ferro-cement), valves 
and accessories is satisfactory. All the WSS systems evaluated are in acceptable 
working conditions. Problems found are related to choice of technical option and 
community organization to manage the system. A considerable number of water 
meters in unsatisfactory condition were found.  
(c) Water quality. Insufficient attention is given by water boards and users to water 
quality. People seem to be content with having piped water, disregarding water-
Page  6

born health problems. Water tests show only 53 % of water systems have potable 
water, which reflects poor training of water boards and communities. 63 % of 
communities disinfect raw water in treatment plants, but 29 % make technical 
errors in preparing disinfectants and measuring residual chlorine in the network. 
In a few cases, a poor choice of surface water source (prone to contamination or 
high in turbidity) results in high costs of disinfection. 
·
Water meters. 100 % of families in most provinces, except for Manabi (67%), 
Sucumbios (22%) have water meters, however not all of them operate well. Some 
83.4% of users pay by water volume, and the other 16.6 % pay fixed tariffs.  
(d) Training. The results of community and water board training by OITS and EPAS 
respectively are not satisfactory. Water boards do not have/make use of the 
operational manual. Water boards are expected to show managerial expertise but 
they have not been trained and lack the technical assistance they should receive 
from the EPAS. 
(e) Protection and conservation of water sources. Some 74 % of water sources 
evaluated may be prone to contamination and water volume reduction in coming 
years due to unprotected catchments, deforestation, farming, excessive use of 
pesticides/fungicides. Only a few municipalities and water boards implement 
watershed protection plans. 
(f) Sanitation. Basic Sanitation Units (
“Unidad Básica de Saneamiento”, (UBS), 
comprising a toilet, sink, and shower) is a great success in communities assessed, 
as it has significantly contributed to improve the living conditions and self-esteem 
of users. Several families have improved the UBS with ceramic tiles, hot water, 
etc. In sum, 37 % of users have selected UBS, 40 % selected only toilet and sink, 
and 23 % improved their pour flush latrines.  
 
Social 
Conclusions
 
In general, results show high satisfaction in beneficiaries as well as positive impact on the 
improvement of hygiene habits and maintenance of water systems in rural communities, 
through the development of Social Plans. 
 
·
Beneficiaries. Both mestizos and Indigenous population benefited from 
PRAGUAS I: over 70 % of users in Azuay, Bolívar, El Oro, Imbabura, Loja and 
Manabí are mestizos, and 74 % of users in Cotopaxi, Chimborazo and Sucumbíos 
are Indigenous. Both groups were equally served in Pastaza (Amazonia).  
·
Coverage. Between 90 and 99 % of people in participating communities in most 
provinces were connected to the WSS system; 100 % in Cotopaxi, 70 % in Loja 
and 25 % in Sucumbíos (Amazonia). On average, systems operate 20 hrs/day, 
except for Manabi (12 hrs/day). 
·
Water quality and quantity. The perceived water quality of 75 % of interviewees 
in most provinces, and 100 % of Cotopaxi and Tungurahua is “good”. However, 
60 % of Pastaza users, 30 % of Manabi, 24 % of Loja and 21 % of Imbabura users 
believe the water quality is ‘so so’. Some 85 % households overall, and 20 % in 
Cotopaxi rate water quantity as ‘sufficient’ for their needs.   
Page  7

15 -  
·
Health. Prevalence of diarrhea in the 15 days prior to the survey was of less than 
10 % in Azuay, Bolivar, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, El Oro and Manabi, but between 
17 and 23 % in Sucumbios, Loja, Imbabura and Pastaza.  
·
User’s satisfaction with WSS systems. Over 75 % of surveyed users are ‘fully 
satisfied’ with water systems in all provinces, except in Pastaza (69 %). However, 
the level of satisfaction with sanitation is mixed.  Over 90 % of families in Azuay, 
Imbabura, Loja and Manabi are fully satisfied, but between 50 and 80 % in 
Pastaza, Sucumbios and El Oro, and between 90 and 100 % in Bolivar and 
Cotopaxi are not satisfied with the systems. Almost 100 % of families having 
UBS used them. 
·
Environmental impact. Insufficient work has been done towards conservation of 
water sources. Community participation for reforestation was evident only in 
Chimborazo, Loja and Sucumbios (60 to 100 % participation). The majority of 
beneficiaries have no trash collection, except for Bolivar, Pastaza and El Oro 
(between 42 and 65 %). Use of chemicals for agriculture is high in all provinces, 
i.e. in Cotopaxi (99 %), Imbabura (91 %), Pastaza (66 %).  
·
Hygiene. The majority of families do not disinfect water, except for Imbabura and 
Loja. However, more than 70 % of users “wash hands before meals”, “wash foods 
before eating them”, and “wash hands after using the latrine”. Water boiling is 
more uneven: it ranges from over 50% of families in Chimborazo, Pastaza and 
Sucumbios to 25% in Azuay and Cotopaxi. The number of liters boiled ranges 
between 3 (Azuay) and 8 (Sucumbios), mostly with gas (wood in Chimborazo). 
Direct observation of water storage indicates that 80% of receptacles were 
covered, although receptacles are often unclean.   
·
Utilization of W&S systems in schools. Most problems were found in schools in 
the highlands and Amazonia. Sanitation items such as soap, are rarely available. 
·
Community Contributions. Beneficiary participation in preparation and 
implementation of WSS processes, and labor is high (over 80 %) for men and 
women. Participation in monetary contributions was highest in Azuay, Cotopaxi, 
Chimborazo, El Oro, Loja and Sucumbios (over 90 %) and contributions ranged 
between US$12 and US$120 (Chimborazo).  
 
Technical and social 
Recommendations 
a)  Technical Supervision. Improve the technical supervision of construction contracts 
and enforce quality controls. 
b)  Reinforce the requirement that communities have title to water sources before 
works commence. 
c)  Enforce the use of Operational Manuals for water boards and EMS. 
a)  Verification of demand. Ensure the selection criteria used for municipalities, 
communities, water sources and number of connections responds to demand, and 
not to political pressures. Consider contracting this activity independently. 
b) PRAGUAS should assist communities in fixing water tariffs to maintain 
economically sustainable systems. At the moment, tariffs adopted by the 
community are not economically viable to provide quality water. 
Page  8
-
15 -  
c) Social Control/supervision. More involvement of the water boards and 
community members is needed during the processes of technical supervision of 
civil works, to promote beneficiary awareness of materials used, agreed 
implementation timelines, costs and contractual terms, to empower them with the 
knowledge and skills needed to demand efficiency from the EMS, OITS, 
contractors and PRAGUAS. 
d)  Enforce the protection of water sources under the environmental protection plan 
of each project that includes prevention and mitigation measures.  
e)  Community training. Evaluation of community training results highlight the need 
to adjust training to the local needs with more efficient focus on gender and 
interculturality of beneficiaries (language, world view). 
f)  Community Social Management Plans should include a module on community 
planning for Operation and Maintenance of the systems.   
g)  Communities request that the community contribution in cash and in kind be 
calculated and also advertised on the project signs, next to that of the municipality 
and PRAGUAS.  
 
Water Boards. Strengths Index 
Conclusions 
 
a)  In general, Water boards are more efficient in water systems operation than in 
maintenance, administration and financial management. Some deficiencies may 
be due to the low schooling, i.e. 20 % of Presidents, 42 % of Secretaries, and 47 
%
of
Treasurers only have primary education.  
b)  The most efficient water boards are those of the coastal region, administrating 
new water systems, and serving non-indigenous populations. The 27 water boards 
administrating new systems show significant improvements over the 11 Boards of 
the Pilot PRAGUAS program in all areas, except for Local Planning, Performance 
and Products. The Water Boards located in Parish capitals (5) are found to be 
more efficient than the 32 boards serving disperse rural communities. Likewise, 
boards serving non-indigenous communities are found to be more efficient than 
the 12 boards serving the Indigenous. 
c)  The Social Management Plans do not have separate strategies for (i) community 
and (ii) water board training in management and administration of the systems.  
d)  Training of water boards. Only 53 % of present water boards interviewed have 
been trained by the EPAS in financial management (turnover of boards every two 
years). Evaluation results show deficiencies in training to operate, maintain, and 
administer systems and protect water sources. Training of water boards is the 
responsibility of EPAS. At the moment, low cost recovery does not allow 
capitalization /reinvestment on maintenance of systems and water sources.  
e) Water boards have not participated in the operation, maintenance and 
administration of on-site sanitation systems. 
f)  In some communities, neither the WSS systems nor the water sources are 
accounted for as assets. 
g)  Participatory Planning. Only 25 % of water boards included community leaders 
and civil society in operations planning, and only half of those include monitoring 
Page  9
-
15 -  
and evaluation mechanisms. The other 75 % lack a plan (operational, financial, 
management, maintenance), and a budget.  
h)  Legal and tax issues. Only 8 % of assessed water boards have tax-payer ID (RUC) 
and pay taxes, the other 92 % don’t.  
i)  Tariff collection. Some 81 % of Water Boards have revenues from tariff 
collection. Collection is regular in 50 % of communities, but the other 50 % 
refuse to pay for non-potable water.  
 
W
ATER 
B
OARDS 
--R
ECOMMENDATIONS
 
a)  Increase education standards of water board members. Arrange literacy training 
particularly for treasurers and secretaries.  
b)  Provide hands-on training of water boards on basic accounting (control of inputs 
and outputs), administration (calculation of real costs of tariffs, and differential 
tariffs for commercial, industrial and household use), use of stationary for billing, 
payment registration, etc. Avoid ‘lecture style’ training.  
c)  Provide “intercultural” training for water boards serving Indigenous communities. 
d)  Ensure water boards are aware of tax administration procedures, and comply with 
the legal requirements. 
e)  Train operators to ensure water quality is acceptable. 
 
4.  
Participation and Gender Strategy of stakeholders and civil society in 
PRAGUAS II 
 
The successful social participation scheme of PRAGUAS I will be enhanced in 
PRAGUAS II for WSS investments in rural areas as well as for the delegation of WSS 
services and the strengthening of solid waste management. 
 
A
key element of success of PRAGUAS I is its participation policy on team composition 
of technical, social and financial staff in the PMU, at the provincial (EPAS) and 
municipal (EMS) levels, as well as with OITS and contractors.   
 
A
comprehensive communications strategy will be applied for the promotion of 
PRAGUAS II components, and proper dissemination of information and standard 
procedures and rules will take place at the provincial, municipal and parish levels. 
Promotion materials will be carefully designed to convey program goals, procedures, 
requirements, gender focus and participation opportunities in the different project 
components and phases. Materials will be designed with a linguistic, intercultural and 
gender focus. 
 
Participation in the Rural WSS Program
.
The participation arrangements for the rural 
water component will continue as in PRAGUAS I, however, hands-on training of EPAS, 
EMS, OITS and communities will be improved, as suggested by the ex-post evaluation. 
Capacity building of water boards in administrative (tariff calculation and collection), 
technical (system maintenance) and operational skills will be implemented, as well as 
Page  10
-
15 -  
community training for water systems maintenance. Participatory monitoring and 
budgeting will be important items of the Social Plans. Training of Water Boards is a 
building block for the creation of the associations of water boards, under component 2C. 
 
An improvement over PRAGUAS I is that training at the community level will be a 
coordinated effort of new, larger Social Consultants (hired at the national level) with 
other stakeholders dedicated to hygiene education and health promotion, i.e. local schools 
and health posts. To this effect, an “Intersectoral Commission of Water, Health and 
Hygiene Education” has been formed by PRAGUAS/ SAPSyRS, and will be led by the 
PRAGUAS Social Team. Commission members are the Ministries of Health (including 
the Indigenous Health Unit) and Education (including the 
Dirección Nacional de 
Educación Intercultural Bilingue
,
DINEIB), and the World Bank Water and Sanitation 
Program (WSP). The goal of the Commission will be (a) to standardize concepts, 
guidelines and contents of hygiene and health education through proper use of water and 
sanitation, including concepts based on the world view of indigenous and afro-
Ecuadorian peoples; (b) to standardize the materials used for training, and materials left 
with the community at schools and health posts, including materials in indigenous 
languages -Kichwa and Shuar; (c) to monitor, sustain and reinforce health practices from 
schools and health posts after the Social Consultants are gone; (d) to evaluate changes

A
new 
social communication scheme for this component  is being prepared. It includes (a) Phase 
1: informed consultations, social and financial feasibility studies of the demand; (b) 
Phase II: the consultants hired to advise municipalities on options for service provision 
models (

,
CAD) will carry out a diagnostic, 
baseline collection, and planning of the technical, social, administrative, financial and 
commercial aspects of delegation of WSS etc. to allow stakeholders and beneficiaries to 
make informed decisions. Periodic informed consultations of Board members and 
beneficiaries of the newly-formed enterprises are planned for disclosure of information 
and financial status.  
 
A
mid-term impact evaluation as well as an ex-post evaluation is planned for PRAGUAS

5. Demographic profile of Ecuador 
 
Given that Ecuador is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and pluri-lingual country, the ethnic 
stratification of the population is difficult. Estimates of Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian 
population range from as low as 12 % to 40 % (National Indigenous Council of Ecuador, 
CONAIE). Based on “self-identification”, the resulting ethnic desegregation is as 
follows: 6.8 % (830,418) of the population is Indigenous; 5 % are Afro-Ecuadorian (2.3 
%
black and 2.7 mulatto); 10.5 % (1,271,051) are white; and 77.4 % (9,411,890) are 
mestizo
.
Thus, the official total of Indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian and mulatto is 
approximately 12 % of the total population. In “Ethnicity and Exclusion in Ecuador”, M. 
Leon points out that the “self-identification” question in 2001 census is useful to

characterize the socio-economic inequities of population, rather than to quantify ethnic 
groups. That is achieved by the 
Sistema de Indicadores Sociales de las Nacionalidades y 
Pueblos del Ecuador
 (SIDENPE), agreed on by the STFS and CODENPE, and included 
in the Integrated Social Indicators System (SIISE).  
 
In terms of geographic distribution, the Central Highland provinces are home to almost 
50 % of the Indigenous Peoples of Ecuador: Chimborazo (17.6 %), Pichincha (12.2 %), 
Imbabura (10 %), and Cotopaxi (9.8 %). The provinces with the highest Indigenous 
population are in Amazonia and the Central Highlands: Napo (56.1 %), Morona Santiago 
(41.3 %), Chimborazo (38.7 %), Pastaza (38.4 %), Orellana (31.4 %), Imbabura (25.8 %), 
Cotopaxi (24.8 %), Bolívar (24.4 %), Cañar (17.3 %), Tungurahua (15 %), Zamora 
Chinchipe (12.8 %), and Sucumbíos (11 %). The provinces with the highest number of 
Afro-Ecuadorian peoples are Esmeraldas (39.9 %), Guayas (6.6 %), Carchi (5.4 %), El 
Oro (5.4 %), Sucumbios (5.2 %) and Imbabura (4.8 %). However, 75% of Afro-
Ecuadorians live in Guayas (35.9 %), Esmeraldas (25.5 %), and Pichincha (13 %). In 
general, 12.1 % of Indigenous and 36 % of Afro-Ecuadorians live in the main cantons of 
Quito and Guayaquil.

There are 36 “Alternative Municipalities” and 4 “
Mancomunidades
”
(Rio Chanchan-
Chimbo, Pelileo-Patate, Plaora-Pablo VI y Wamboya, and Jubones River) in the 
Highlands and Amazonia whose mayors are Indigenous. Alternative Municipalities are 
financed by the Project for the Strengthening of Alternative Municipalities (FORMIA) 
with Spanish funds. An important goal of the municipalities is to coordinate with other 
GOE institutions and with NGOs, and to exercise social controls for the efficient 
implementation of development projects. In the case of PRAGUAS II, alternative 
municipalities would coordinate (a) the supply and demand of WSS in Indigenous 
municipalities to ensure that PRAGUAS II is accessed by those who meet the eligibility 
criteria; (b) promotional and training activities under the umbrella agreement of 
CODENPE-PRAGUAS/SAPSyRS.. 
 
7. Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Plan  (IPP) 
 
Given the presence of Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian peoples in the project area, the 
O.P. 4.10 is triggered. An Indigenous Peoples Plan for the project has been discussed 
with the 
Consejo Nacional de Nacionalidades y Pueblos Indígenas del Ecuador
 
(CODENPE) and the 
Coordinadora de Desarrollo Afro Ecuatoriano
 (CODAE). The 
main objectives of the Plan will be (a) to coordinate the supply and demand of water and 
sanitation investment in Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities, (b) to coordinate 
efforts of SAPSyRS, MOH (including Indigenous Health Dept), MOE (including the 
National Directorate of Intercultural Bilingual Education) to standardize training contents 
and strategies to train WSS users and water boards in Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian 
communities, in order to improve the health conditions and achieve sustainability of the 
water systems by optimizing their financial administration, (c) to coordinate the 
promotion and dissemination of information on PRAGUAS II with CODENPE, CODAE 
and “alternative municipalities and mancomunidades” to ensure the information reaches 
the poor and isolated. 
 
The present IPP is being discussed with CODENPE, CODAE, DINEIB, Indigenous 
Health (MOH), and should be approved by all the parties involved by project appraisal. 
Once approved, it will be sent by the GOE to the Bank. It will be disseminated in the WB 
Infoshop (English) and through the SAPSyRS/ MIDUVI Webpage (Spanish) in Ecuador. 
Page  14

15 -  
A
letter signed by the GOE reflecting its commitment to implement the IPP and to 
include it in the operational manual should be submitted to the Bank. 
 
The IPP items being discussed are:  
 
1. Cooperation agreements between CODENPE and SAPSyRS and CODAE and 
SAPSyRS should be developed and signed by these institutions. Moreover, the 
agreements between DINEIB (MOE) and SAPSyRS and Indigenous Health (MOH) and 
SAPSyRS are based on existing umbrella agreements between the institutions. Some 
agreement items may include: 
 
(a) Coordination of PRAGUAS supply and demand with CODENPE and CODAE at 
the central level on a monthly basis.  
(b) Coordination for the promotion of PRAGUAS II components and technical 
assistance at the provincial, municipal (particularly Indigenous Municipalities), and 
community level. PRAGUAS will provide promotional materials in Spanish, Kichwa 
and Shuar. 
(c) Coordination for the dissemination of information on PRAGUAS rules and 
regulation, procedures, financing scheme and participatory budgeting, social controls 
and monitoring. 
(d) CODENPE may provide (i) financial suppo
rt to “extremely poor” communities 
which would otherwise not be able to pay the 10% cash contribution required to 
participate in PRAGUAS; (ii) financial support to strengthen the water boards or the 
WSS systems needing repairs or rehabilitation; (iii) technical assistance to small 
communities to achieve the level of organization required by PRAGUAS to meet the 
eligibility criteria to participate in the Program. 
(e) PRAGUAS will continue to honor local traditional “cabildos, associations” (water 
boards) instead of enforcing the creation of new water boards. 
(f) Socialization of WSS experiences in alternative indigenous municipalities 
(Pallatanga, Guano, Chunchi) or mancomunidades  
(h) Coordination in the training of water boards and communities to present 
proposals. 
(i)  PRAGUAS Workshops with Alternative Municipalities and Juntas Parroquiales.  
 
2. Program promotion campaign through the media, in Spanish but with an intercultural 
focus. 
 
3.Dissemination of information in the Indigenous languages of the beneficiaries (Spanish, 
Kichwa, Shuar) as needed. 
 
4. Training of Indigenous Cabildos and Water Boards in financial, administrative, 
technical and social management of W&S systems with an intercultural focus. 
5. Regional Workshops with Alternative Municipalities, and Juntas Parroquiales, at the 
national level.
