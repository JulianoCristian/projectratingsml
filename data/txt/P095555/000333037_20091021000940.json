"Ratings for the Second Rural and Small\n            Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (PRAGUAS) for\n            Ecuador were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the impact of political\n            transitions on project implementation can be significant, in\n            particular when the new administration disagrees with\n            significant aspects of project objectives and design. The\n            Bank teams must be alert to changes in administration\n            priorities and consider a restructuring of the project early\n            on to make the necessary adjustments if common ground can be\n            found on sound technical principles. This is particularly\n            true in the case of Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) or\n            projects prepared by one administration but implemented by\n            another. In addition, rushing through initial implementation\n            shortly before an administration change, despite allowing\n            for more expedite implementation, poses risks especially\n            when it can be expected that the incoming administration\n            might have different priorities from the one preparing the\n            project. Finally, the Bank should not shy away from\n            sustaining high-level, frank discussions with incoming\n            administrations on the scope and technical principles of\n            on-going or new projects, and consider a mutually agreed\n            cancellation as an acceptable option if no agreement can be\n            found. In the case of a deteriorating project\n            implementation, it is important for the Bank team not to\n            alienate the Borrower's goodwill towards the project.\n            Tradeoffs must be made between the need to maintain or\n            improve the quality of project implementation, and the need\n            to maintain working relationships with the client so as to\n            reduce the risk of having to close a project without the\n            support and engagement of the client."}, "docdt": "2009-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
