1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design:

1.1   Context at Appraisal:

Country Background

1.      Continuous changes characterized Ecuador during the preparation and implementation of
the PRAGUAS I and PRAGUAS II projects. Real GDP growth averaged 4.7 percent per year in
2000-2006, compared to 1.7 percent annually in the 1990s. Annual economic growth increased
to a high of 8 percent in 2004, then fell to 2.6 percent in 2007 and 2.5 percent in 2008. High oil
prices and improvements in tax collection permitted significant increases in Government
spending in 2008, but fell again in 2009, leading to budget constraints.

2.       During PRAGUAS I implementation and PRAGUAS II preparation, no president
finalized his mandate; Ministers (including the line Minister for the project) changed regularly,
and the Vice-Minister for Water changed even more often. Although the various administrations
generally promoted consistent policies, there was an important turnover in staff and public
institutions were weakened by constant and sometimes arbitrary rotation and re-assignments of
technical staff.

3.      In January 2007, President Correa took office after winning the November 2006 election.
Under President Correa, a Constituent Assembly prepared a new Constitution that was approved
in a referendum in late September 2008. President Correa was reelected in early 2009 under the
new Constitution, and his two administrations have been characterized by increased stability in
key public office positions, including in the PRAGUAS line ministry.

Sector Background
4.      Ecuador's water and sanitation (WSS) sector is characterized by (i) low coverage levels
(particularly in rural areas); (ii) low service quality and efficiency; (iii) limited cost recovery
through tariff and a high level of dependence on financial transfers from national and sub-
national governments; and (vi) an incomplete legal and regulatory framework that failed to
provide incentives for improved sector performance and lead to overlapping responsibilities both
within the national government and between different levels of government.

5.     Coverage: In 2001, water supply coverage stood at 82 percent in urban and 39 percent in
rural areas while sanitation coverage reached 73 percent of urban and 29 percent of rural
households1. In addition, water supply coverage varied greatly by income, reaching about 90
percent for the top three income deciles in urban areas compared to levels of only about 60
percent for the bottom three income deciles2.

6.     Service quality and efficiency: In many small and medium size cities, water supply
services were intermittent and water pressure was well below standard, particularly in poor

outlying areas. Many municipal water companies in medium size cities had between 5 and 14
employees per 1000 connections, a number well in excess of regional best practice (below 3
employees per 1000 water connections).

7.       Limited cost recovery through tariffs: A study commissioned by the government under
the first stage of the PRAGUAS APL, concluded that nationwide, tariffs covered only about two
thirds of system operation and maintenance costs in 2001. National and sub-national (provincial
and municipal) subsidies were required to cover the operation and maintenance (O&M) gap and
finance coverage expansion.

8.      Incomplete legal and regulatory framework: While Ecuador had a National Water and
Sanitation Policy (Política Nacional de Agua y Saneamiento, under Executive Decree No. 2766
of July 30, 2002), it was vague and avoided a clear position on issues such as WSS investment
subsidies and their allocation. Many national and sub-national actors provided financing for
urban and rural water supply investments under different terms and with little regard for the
policy setting role, legally vested in the Sub-Secretariat of Water Supply, Sanitation and Solid
Waste (SAPSyRS) of the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Territorial Development
(MIDUVI). In addition, there was neither a regulator of WSS services nor a clear definition of
roles and responsibilities between various national and sub-national actors.

Rationale for Bank involvement
9.     The Bank's Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (APL-
1/PRAGUAS I) was the government's primary vehicle for addressing the sector's main
challenges from 2001 to 2006.

·    In terms of coverage, PRAGUAS I provided new water supply systems for 252,000 people
     and on-site sanitation for 127,000 people, approximately 5 and 3 percent, respectively, of
     Ecuador's total rural population of 4.7 million. As technical designs for systems to increase
     WSS services to over 600,000 people had been prepared, coverage expansion was expected
     to increase rapidly under the new project (APL-2/PRAGUAS II).

·    To address service quality, efficiency and cost recovery issues, PRAGUAS I provided
     technical assistance and financial incentives to municipalities interested in delegating their
     municipally-run WSS services to autonomous operators. Out of 219 municipalities
     nationwide, 32 were in the process of delegating and 14 had completed the transition, well in
     excess of the APL-1 target of 5 municipalities as established by the Bank and the
     Government of Ecuador (GOE) in 2000. An initial evaluation showed that the initial group
     of municipalities who delegated their WSS services, had increased their operational
     efficiency and raised their tariffs to cover at least O&M costs3.

·    The GOE took an important step towards improving the incentive framework for WSS
     investments by adopting an Executive Decree4 to distribute earmarked government transfers
     to municipalities for WSS investments under a special tax on telephone calls (Impuesto

        model, and municipal poverty indicators.

10.     The Bank's experience in rural water supply in Ecuador under APL-1, as well as in other
South American countries such as Peru and Paraguay under similar projects5, provided a solid
basis to support Ecuador with the second stage of its Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and
Sanitation Program (APL-2/PRAGUAS II).

Higher level objectives to which the Project contributed
11.     The APL-2/PRAGUAS II was intended to support Ecuador's 2003-2007 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) 6 , which stated that a "concerted fight against poverty, through
coordinated advances on the economic and social fronts" would require "improved basic
infrastructure". To this end, the CAS aimed to "strengthen governance by helping the Authorities
build an accountable and efficient government whose services are accessible for all
Ecuadorians". The project (APL-2/PRAGUAS II) also supported progress towards the drinking
water and sanitation targets contained in Millennium Development Goal No.7 ("Ensure
Environmental Sustainability").

1.2       Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators:

Program Development Objective
12.     The project development objective for APL-2/PRAGUAS II was to: (i) provide
sustainable access to WSS services for approximately 285,000 new rural beneficiaries and to
promote their effective use; (ii) provide improved and sustainable WSS services to
approximately 205,000 beneficiaries in cantonal capitals; (iii) promote sustainable solid waste
services in cantonal capitals; and (iv) improve overall sector performance by the national
government by promoting performance-based investment financing for the urban WSS sector.

1.3   Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

13.    PDO and key indicators were not revised during the implementation phase. Attempts at
project restructuring following the cancelation of a significant share of the loan did not
materialize and the project was eventually cancelled ahead of time.

1.4   Main Beneficiaries:

14.     According to the PDO, the main beneficiaries were populations living in rural areas and
small towns in municipalities that were to gain access to improved WSS services. The Project
was targeted to eligible municipalities (the 174 municipalities with a population of 50,000 or less
according to the 2001 census). It aimed to reach communities by targeting municipalities with
low service coverage rates and high community demand for improved services. The Project was
expected to provide sustainable access to WSS services for approximately 285,000 new
beneficiaries in rural areas and 205,000 beneficiaries in the capitals of eligible municipalities. In
rural areas the Project would invest in infrastructure to provide access to improved water supply
to 200,000 people and to provide access to improved sanitation to 85,000 people. In small
cantonal capitals, the Project was intended to benefit 165,000 inhabitants with access to
improved water supply and 40,000 with access to improved sanitation. In addition, PRAGUAS II
was designed to support sustainable access to improved solid waste services to 100,000 people
living in cantonal capitals.

Component 2:                               Focused on expanding coverage of WSS services with an integral
Water Supply and Sanitation in Rural       approach, including: (i) promoting community development, hygiene
Areas                                      education, designs and supervision of WSS projects; (ii) investment in
                                           rural WSS infrastructure; (iii) strengthening existing water and

                                           washing initiative.
Component 3:                               Focused on promoting the delegation of municipal WSS services to
Promotion of New Management Models         autonomous service providers in cantonal capitals through three sub-
for Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste in   components: (i) technical assistance for the delegation of water and
Cantonal Capitals                          sewerage and the sustainability of solid waste services in cantonal
                                           capitals; (ii) water and sanitation investments in cantonal capitals
                                           using incentive payments in eligible municipalities that have
                                           successfully delegated their WS and/or sanitation services to
                                           autonomous operators; (iii) solid waste investments in cantonal
                                           capitals to promote effective solid waste management using an
                                           incentive payment policy.
Component 4:                               Focused on financing: (i) the cost of salary, travel and general
Project Administration                     operating costs of the PMU, (ii) the cost of a strategic communication
                                           program; (iii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities; and (iv)
                                           audits and other project management activities.

1.6   Revised Components:

15.    There was no formal revision of components during project implementation. However,
following a decision of the GOE in January 2008 to cancel 36M USD (out of a total loan amount
of 48M USD), it became clear to all parties involved that many of the project's components and
subcomponents could not be implemented in the form and to the extent originally planned.
Despite the changes and several attempts by the World Bank team, the GOE did not seek a
formal restructuring of the loan.

16.    Sections 2 and 3 of this Implementation Completion Report present the Bank team's
understanding on why there was no formal restructuring, as well as the level of implementation
achieved under the various components and subcomponents.

1.7   Other significant changes:

Note: Annex 10 includes a detailed timeline of the project implementation.

17.     The PRAGUAS II project became effective shortly before the Correa Administration
came to power. The Bank's Country Management Unit (CMU) held informal consultations with
the incoming administration, which confirmed that the PRAGUAS II project should go ahead
(four other projects were canceled shortly after the new administration took office, while the
PRAGUAS II project remained in the portfolio until recently). Soon after effectiveness however,
it became clear that the new administration had concerns with some of the project's activities,
such as the organization of a national hand-washing campaign or the provision of technical
assistance for policy discussions. In addition, around November 2007, serious concerns emerged
with the design of key project components, including the contracting of a few large companies to
implement most of components 2 and 3.




                                                      5
18.    In January 2008, the GOE decided to cancel 36M USD out of the total loan amount of
48M USD, without formally specifying which components or disbursement categories would be
maintained. The remaining 12M USD were to be used to complete on-going activities and
commitments, under what the Bank understood would be a generally unchanged implementation
model.

19.     In subsequent months, the implementing agency and the Bank agreed on a procurement
plan reflecting the much reduced scope as well as some changes in the implementation modality
for rural WSS works. In this procurement plan, the Bank and the government (SAPSyRS) agreed
that:

          Most of the activities under component 1 (policy) would not be completed, except for
          some renovations of offices and a limited solid waste study.
          Under the rural WSS component (component 2), sanitation sub-projects for which
          designs were ready would be completed with individual consultants to carry out the
          necessary social and technical interventions. Water sub-projects for which designs were
          ready would be implemented once local consulting companies with the responsibility of
          carrying out technical and social activities were hired.
          Most of the activities under component 3 (small town investments) would not be
          implemented, except for a few activities that were already committed.

20.    In the end though, this revised Procurement Plan was not fully implemented and the
Government decided further unilateral changes to the implementation scheme, including the
replacement in the summer of 2008 of local consulting companies with individual consultants to
carry out technical and social activities on water sub-projects under component 2.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1      Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry:

21.     At the time of Project preparation, the GOE was interested in addressing important issues
such as service coverage, quality of service and efficiency and cost recovery to improve long
term sustainability. The Project represented the second phase of a three stage APL. PRAGUAS II
was designed based on the experience of the first phase and experiences from projects in
Ecuador and other countries in the region. The design considered risk factors and appropriate
measures to mitigate all major risks. It included a participatory framework for stakeholders and
direct beneficiaries to the decision-making process.

A. Lessons Learned and reflected in the project design

A.1 Ex-post Evaluation of the First Phase Project
22.    An ex-post evaluation of a sample of 36 water supply systems and 23 sanitation systems
was carried out after PRAGUAS I and complemented by a survey of 1,752 households. The
lessons learned helped in the design of the second phase of PRAGUAS.



                                                  6
A.1.1. Rural Areas
  PRAGUAS II was designed to provide long term technical assistance, training and
    operational and management services to existing Juntas through the creation of Associations
    of Juntas at the provincial level to promote sustainability.

  The inclusion of Municipal Sanitation Units (EMS) improved the technical capacity of the
  municipal teams.

  The financial scheme of PRAGUAS I proved socially acceptable. Ex-post evaluation results
  indicated municipal and community satisfaction with the established request for
  contributions. Therefore, PRAGUAS II continued its tripartite financial policy: PRAGUAS
  50 percent, municipality 20 percent, and community 30 percent (10 percent in cash and 20
  percent in kind).

  Monitoring and evaluation of completed projects and those under construction in
  PRAGUAS I was weak, in part because of the fragmentation of responsibility over a great
  number of individual consultants doing the technical and social interventions. It was
  intended that the monitoring and evaluation systems would be improved under PRAGUAS
  II as they would include user friendly information systems allowing the use of baseline and
  diagnostic data to monitor the social plan by consultants, municipalities, water boards and
  communities. The Management Information System (Sistema de Información Gerencial,
  SIG) and Social Impact Information System (Sistema de Información de Impacto Social,
  SINSOC) would be upgraded and integrated under PRAGUAS II into an Integrated
  Management Information System (IMIS) to ensure better monitoring of inputs, outputs and
  outcomes. This type of M&E would be supplemented by an impact evaluation carried out
  for a sample of projects and control communities. The program's impact evaluations would
  be based on baseline surveys developed under PRAGUAS I and ex-post surveys to be
  carried out at different points in time during implementation.

  The on-site sanitation alternative of basic sanitation units (UBS), comprising a toilet, sink
  and shower, was a great success in communities assessed, as it had significantly contributed
  to the improvement of living conditions and self-esteem of users. PRAGUAS II was
  designed to finance mostly UBS under its sanitation activities.

  An enabling social context existed for promotion of hand-washing with soap. Findings from
  the ex-post evaluation demonstrated a high level of awareness of hand-washing as a socially
  approved practice. A hand-washing component was incorporated into the second phase of
  PRAGUAS.

  Under PRAGUAS I, procurement processes and contract administration by local
  municipalities for essential community organization, engineering designs and construction
  of water supply and sanitation systems by the local private sector, was found to be
  cumbersome and time-consuming. For the second phase of PRAGUAS, all designs,
  supervision and community development/training services would be contracted at a national
  level through large engineering design and supervision firms (Consultorías de Diseño y
  Fiscalización, CDF) and NGOs/Social Consulting firms (Consultorías de Intervención


                                              7
      Social, CIS) . This was intended to limit procurement carried out by municipalities for the
      rural component to goods and works and maintain municipal procurement of investments.

A.1.2. Municipal Capitals
  The combination of technical assistance and financial incentives for service delegation were
    effective in creating autonomous operators in a large number of municipalities. However,
    the range of models actually rolled out was quite limited. For PRAGUAS II a revision of the
    financial incentive framework for the delegation of cantonal WSS services to more
    autonomous models was conducted. PRAGUAS II would provide delegation assistance to
    larger municipalities and technical assistance to new operators, and use larger, more
    experienced consulting companies to provide TA on a broader range of models.

  PRAGUAS II would incorporate the development of a communication strategy to garner
  consumer support for sustainable tariff levels and models to ensure the sustainability of
  infrastructure investments and public services.

B. Risks and mitigation
23.    During the design stage, several critical risks were identified along with mitigation
measures to be taken to protect Project implementation and its outcome.

24.   Risk: Political instability at the ministerial and sub-secretary level affect project
implementation.

Mitigating measures: The Project would be executed by a Project Management Unit (PMU)
staffed by consultants with long term contracts hired through a competitive process carried out
by a special management firm.

25.     Risk: Institutional issues resulting from rivalry between SAPSyRS and the PMU.

Mitigating measures: Several sub-components (such as solid waste management) were managed
by SAPSyRS staff assigned to the PMU where they would work under the responsibility of the
PMU Coordinator. A training plan for SAPSyRS staff as well as physical upgrades to the work
environment in the SAPSyRS was also expected to smooth interaction between PMU and
SAPSyRS staff.

26.     Risk: Municipalities do not contribute counterpart funds.

Mitigating measures: The Project introduced a financial policy linked to the financial
performance of each municipality and its compliance with the Ecuadorian Fiscal Responsibility
Law (Ley Orgánica de Responsabilidad y Transparencia, LOREyT).

27.     Risk: Municipalities are not willing to delegate services.

Mitigating measures: The communication strategy targeted different decision makers at the
municipal level to ensure grassroots support for the Project in a more systematic way. Larger
investment incentives in PRAGUAS II as well as the option of investing in both sewerage and


                                                 8
expansion of water services was expected to enhance municipal interest in delegating service
provision.

28.    Risk: Inherent financial management risk due to decentralized implementation set-up,
counterpart funding requirements for municipalities and communities and overall political and
budget uncertainties.

Mitigating measures: Participating municipalities would receive financial management support
from large social consulting firms recruited at the national level as well as PRAGUAS/PMU
staff. Project staff was to be recruited under multi-annual contracts to reduce turn-over.

C. Adequacy of participatory processes

29.     The Project design considered participatory processes as the central element in Project
implementation as it incorporated stakeholders and beneficiaries in the decision-making process
and in the construction, community development and local capacity building activities. Activities
were planned to be executed systematically in a sub project cycle that considered the
participation of communities, municipalities and the central Government.

30.     Based on experience with PRAGUAS I, participatory processes were carefully designed
for different stages of the Project cycle, including promotion and community selection;
community demand verification; preparation of technical, economic, social and environmental
profiles; participation agreements between MIDUVI, municipalities and communities;
community organization; technical studies and designs; training for municipal staff; community
water user boards (juntas); and communities.

31.     PRAGUAS I and PRAGUAS II were both built around the principles of Demand
Responsive Approach (DRA) whereby the beneficiaries of the project are active protagonists in
its development, construction and operation. A detailed project cycle was elaborated to ensure
adequate participation during each step of the project. Technical assistance and social support
were provided to the participating municipalities and communities to make informed decisions
on applying for Project support, technical and financial options and service levels available.

32.     An important strategy of PRAGUAS II was the use of large consulting firms (called CDF
for technical work, and CIS for social intervention), which would provide continuous close
support to municipalities and communities to guarantee their active and knowledgeable
participation.

2.2   Implementation:

33.    PRAGUAS II was designed for an implementation period of 4 years; but actual
implementation lasted only 2 years due to the Government's decision to cancel part of the loan
and the Bank's subsequent suggestion to advance the closing date.

34.    The following factors affected Project implementation:




                                               9
a. Change in the political context and new administration priorities. The implementation of
PRAGUAS I and the design and preparation of the second phase were done by previous
administrations that prioritized active participation of the communities and upfront social
intervention to ensure local empowerment and capacity building, and eventually greater
sustainability. This led to a project cycle that was relatively long and complex. In contrast, the
new administration strongly emphasized the importance of achieving rapid and visible impacts
and gave less importance to local empowerment and participation.

b. Lack of effective dialogue between PMU, ministerial authorities and the Bank team. Because
of a history of frequent political turnover in Ecuador, the project design called for a strong and
relatively insulated PMU for implementation. The technical staff of the PMU was contracted for
a long-term period, following a rigorous evaluation process conducted in part by an independent
personnel recruiting firm, with exception of the general coordinator. This model, which had
served PRAGUAS I well, meant that most senior staff ­ which were appointed before project
effectiveness ­ could not be easily removed or changed once the Correa administration came in.
There were disagreements between the new administration and the PMU over the project's
approach, conceptual design and implementation strategy.

These differences led the Minister to unilaterally revoke the agreement governing the staffing of
the PMU in November-December 2007 and to dismiss high-level staff of the PMU shortly
thereafter. The decision to dismiss key PMU staff reduced its operational and management
capacity, created a lack of coordination and negatively affected sub-project implementation.
From January 2008 onwards, the PMU operated with only limited staff and was characterized by
high staff turnover in a number of key positions (project coordinator, social director). In the
months before project closing, the PMU consisted only of an administrative coordinator and
some low-level technical and administrative staff.

c. Slow implementation and changes to the project cycle. Implementation progress was slow in
the early stages of the project. The project cycle established initial phases previous to the
implementation of WSS works, including: (i) marketing the innovative concepts and convincing
community members and municipality authorities to accept them, (ii) conducting processes for
selecting municipalities and projects to be developed, (iii) preparing or revising designs, (iv)
preparing work plans at the local levels, (v) signing formal arrangements for participation, and
(vi) raising funds from beneficiary communities and municipalities as counterpart contributions
for project works. Most of these activities were to be conducted by a few large consulting
companies or NGOs, as this would make implementation easier and would create fewer
procurement delays, but initially it meant that the PMU had to carry out several large
procurement processes before implementation could begin. Although the procurement processes
were underway even before effectiveness, differences between the PMU, the Ministry and the
Bank on the soundness of the approach meant that delays materialized, and by the time the GoE
decided to cancel most of the loan none of the companies had been contracted even though some
of the contracts were negotiated.

Following the partial cancelation of the loan, the Government rejected the agreement previously
reached with the Bank to hire consulting firms and instead decided to hire individual consultants.
In addition, MIDUVI eventually decided to proceed with the construction works without the



                                               10
prior hiring of social consultants. This situation resulted in: (a) work overload in procurement,
contract supervision and administrative payment processes; (b) lack of coordination between
works, supervision and social support activities; (c) less effective technical and social
interventions to support the implementation of water and/or basic sanitation projects; and (d)
construction of works without the necessary social or technical intervention in some cases.

d. Delay in payments to contractors and consultants. Time consuming payment processes and
delays in payment to contractors and consultants were factors that negatively affected the
construction of works, technical assistance, supervision and social support to the projects. Delays
were significant in part due to the partial dismantling of the PMU. Advance payments for
contractors and consultants were made with average delays of 3 months and regular payments
had delays from 3 to 5 months from the date of their approval. These delays came on top of the
delays typical of RWSS projects in agricultural areas where community labor contribution are
often available only during parts of the year. These factors extended the construction time of
works.

Another factor affecting contract payments in the final phase (after October 2008) was the
Bank's decision to carefully review disbursement requests from Ecuador, given the
Government's intention to accelerate project closing to December 2008, and following the
publication of the conclusions from the Debt Commission Report that declared all external debt
in Ecuador illegitimate. At that moment, there was uncertainty with regards to the capacity of the
implementing agency to justify the eligibility and provide supporting documentation of certain
expenses under the project 7 . In this context, the Bank's cautious assessment of further
disbursement requests in the fall of 2008 was an attempt to protect both the Government of
Ecuador and the Bank against unnecessary disbursement advances to the project's special
account, which would have had to be reimbursed by the Borrower to the Bank at project closing8.
A revised disbursement letter limiting the types of disbursements available to reimbursements
and direct payments was communicated to the Government in January 2009. This situation
created a liquidity issue for the PMU, which had to obtain national budget funds in the order of
more than USD 1M to bridge the gap.

2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a) M&E Design: Project design for M&E considered an extensive and innovative set of tools
developed under PRAGUAS I: (a) Management Information System - SIG (physical and
financial processes), (b) Social Impact Information System - SINSOC (baseline and diagnostic
data and ex-post social information), and (c) Integrated Water and Sanitation, Sewerage and
Solid Waste Monitoring - SISASAR (technical, socio-economic and administrative data of
investments on delegated service providers). The first two systems were to be upgraded and


7
  The process of establishing eligibility of expenses and documenting the use of loan proceeds was made more
complex by the fact that the execution of Components 2 and 3 ­ the most significant in terms of spending ­was
decentralized. In the absence of a strong PMU, the Bank feared effective control mechanisms could not be
maintained, or the information could not be obtained from municipalities in a timely manner.
8
  At the time of closing of the ICR, the Special Account still holds about 164,000 USD of undocumented expenses
which will have to be reimbursed by the Government to the Bank unless they are documented by the end of the
Grace Period on September 30, 2009.


                                                       11
integrated under PRAGUAS II into an Integrated Management Information System - IMIS to
ensure a better integration of monitoring inputs, outputs and outcomes.

Tracking key operational and process monitoring indicators were to be primarily based on inputs,
outputs and intermediate outcomes recorded in the IMIS and through participatory rapid
appraisals, focus group discussions and sample consumer satisfaction surveys of beneficiaries
through the associations of water boards (juntas) and EPAS to ensure direct feedback. M&E
would be supplemented by an impact evaluation for a sample of projects and control
communities, based on baseline surveys developed under PRAGUAS I as well as ex-post
surveys carried out during mid-term and final reviews of PRAGUAS II. Management of the
M&E system would be carried out by the PMU (for IMIS system) and SAPSyRS (for
SISASAR). These teams would be responsible for upgrading the systems, daily oversight,
operation and maintenance of databases and generation of periodic reports.

(b) M&E Implementation: During implementation, information management systems were not
upgraded and tools previously developed under PRAGUAS I were not used. There was generally
a lack of information and specifically a lack of information on projects and contracts. Collecting
data from the field was an issue because of the reduced staffing of the PMU and the absence of
contracted consultants in the regions. Overall project monitoring was weak. No baseline, mid-
term or ex-post survey was completed.

(c) M&E utilization: Because of the lack of information and the early closing of the project,
appropriate data were not evaluated and used to inform decision-making and resource allocation.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance:

35.    There were no significant deviations or waivers from Bank safeguards, fiduciary policies
and procedures during the implementation of the Project, although, as mentioned above,
financial management procedures were sometimes found not to adhere to good practices and the
Bank made a number of recommendations that were not systematically implemented.

36.     Given the presence of Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian peoples in the project area, and in
compliance with Operational Policy 4.10, the GOE included an Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian
Peoples Plan (IPP) in the project design after due agreement with the Consejo Nacional de
Nacionalidades y Pueblos Indígenas del Ecuador (CODENPE) and the Coordinadora de
Desarrollo Afro-Ecuatoriano (CODAE). Cooperation Agreements between SAPSyRS and both
entities were signed during the first quarter of project implementation. However, staff turnover
within the UGP did not allow continuity and results.

37.     Regarding Fiduciary Compliance, overall project financial management performance has
been rated as moderately unsatisfactory due to moderate shortcomings related to: high turnover
of key financial management staff; delays in submission of interim financial reports and audits;
lack of quantification of communities' contributions in financial reports; lack of a systematized
monitoring process of transfers made to municipalities; and delays obtaining timely support
documentation. All of these issues have jeopardized the capacity of the project to provide timely
and reliable information required to manage and monitor implementation.



                                               12
2.5   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase:

38.    No post-completion operation or a next phase of PRAGUAS is foreseen with Bank
resources, as the last Country Assistance Strategy with Ecuador lapsed in FY07 and the
prospects of developing a new one in the near future are still unclear. The Government continues
to invest in rural water and sanitation activities, in part with resources from the IDB-managed
Spanish Water Fund.

39.   In parallel the Government has indicated to the Bank that its new policy is to avoid
borrowing for so-called "social" projects, focusing instead on projects that can generate the
income needed to repay the loan.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

40.     In the absence of a new sector strategy or policy, Project objectives appear to continue to
be relevant to the country's development priorities. National needs for improving water and
sanitation services remain large. The country requires increasing water supply and sanitation
coverage, especially in rural areas, to improve the quality of services as well as long term
sustainability with and adequate cost recovery through tariffs in small towns. All of the above
require new institutions and/or strengthening of the existing ones to ensure that they work under
an adequate legal and regulatory framework.

41.     Interest shown by participating rural communities confirms their willingness and
commitment to collaborate in the implementation of sub-projects to gain access to improved
WSS services. During the short period of implementation, local governments (municipalities)
also demonstrated their interest in participating as partners or stakeholders to make sub-WSS
projects viable both in rural areas and cantonal capitals. Although the social component was
weak in several subprojects due to the absence of social consultants, communities and local
governments were usually eager to participate in every step of the project cycle.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives:

42.    The Project was unsuccessful in achieving its objectives. The most significant factors for
not achieving the Project objectives were (i) the cancellation of several project components at the
Government's request; (ii) the failure to restructure the project despite several attempts by the
supervision team; (iii) the decision by the Government to complete only the on-going subprojects
with simple implementation schemes. As a result, the project had a partial implementation with
an outcome far from achieving the PDO.

43.    The following project sub-components were canceled:

Project Administration


45.     Project objectives and results of the implementation:

(i) Provide sustainable access to WSS services to approximately 285,000 new rural
    beneficiaries and to promote their effective use.

46.    Measuring this objective requires a baseline and ex-post surveys, in particular because of
the PAD's definition of "sustainable" access. These surveys were never completed; therefore,
this ICR cannot provide reliable information on the actual completion of this objective.
Nevertheless, the project directly benefited 31,400 people with access to improved rural water
supply services and 44,500 people with access to basic sanitation for a total of 75,900
beneficiaries. This figure represents 26.7 percent of the target population for this objective.

47.     The lack of effectiveness in social intervention during implementation affected the
effectiveness of services and their sustainability. Components such as the strengthening of
existing WSS user boards and the WSS sector reform and institutional strengthening (particularly
municipalities), were key for long term technical assistance and support to rural services, but
were canceled.




                                                       14
48.    Independent technical reviews, organized by the Bank, of dozens of sub-projects
concluded during a period covering the last 9 months of implementation uncovered deficient
technical supervision, poorly finished works and insufficient or inexistent empowerment and
capacity of the beneficiary communities. All of these factors might affect negatively the
sustainability of the investments.

(ii) Provide improved and sustainable WSS services to approximately 205,000 beneficiaries in
     cantonal capitals.

49.     Component 3 was largely canceled. PRAGUAS II developed rehabilitation and efficiency
improvements of water supply and sanitation systems in only 3 cantonal capitals. The total
population of these cities is 220,000 inhabitants, but the share of the population directly affected
by the project's activities is unclear in the absence close technical involvement by the PMU.
These municipalities had participated in a similar component under PRAGUAS I and were
therefore eligible to receive incentive payments to be used for water and sanitation investments;
such investment was to be complemented by technical assistance (TA). The original project
design considered provision of TA through specialized consulting firms (Empresas Consultoras
de Apoyo a la Delagación de los Servicios - ECADS). Although the procurement process was
initiated, these firms were not hired and technical assistance for service delegation was limited.
The lack of external support to municipalities and service providers could undermine long term
sustainability of the improvements in service provision.

(iii)Promote sustainable solid waste services in cantonal capitals.

50.     Due to the cancelation of sub-component 3C (Solid waste investments in cantonal
capitals), municipal solid waste services were not improved, and therefore, this objective was not
achieved.

(iv) Improve overall sector performance by promoting performance-based investments financing
     by the national government for the urban WSS sector.

51.     Component 1 of the project considered some activities that would strengthen MEF's
ability to target approximately US$75 million annually in telephone taxes (Impuesto sobre
Consumos Especiales, ICE) earmarked for the WSS sector more efficiently to develop coherent
overall financial policies. In addition, Component 3 would partially finance water supply,
sanitation and solid waste investments using incentive payments in eligible municipalities which
had delegated municipal services to autonomous operators. Component 2 considered WSS
investments in rural areas, with the participation of municipalities, beneficiary communities and
the project, each contributing a share of the investment cost according to the Project's financial
policy. These activities were designed to promote the development of sector financial policies
oriented to performance-based financing investments. However, the cancelation of most of
Component 1 of the project and the limited implementation of Component 2 significantly
reduced the project's influence on WSS sector performance.

3.3    Efficiency:

52.     . Given the lack of information available, partly because the envisioned monitoring and
evaluation system was never in place, and partly because assumptions made at appraisal did not
materialized due to the earlier closing and reduced scope of the project, the analysis of the
efficiency of the project is based on information from 103 contracts: 27 for water supply
systems, 45 for basic sanitation units a flush latrine with basin and shower (UBSs), and 31 for
both services, all of which were partly financed with loan proceeds.

53.     Out of the 103 contracts analyzed, 90 (87 percent) were signed for an amount below the
investment cost ceiling agreed during project preparation following an economic evaluation: all
45 of sanitation, 19 of water supply, and 26 of both services. On average, the 103 contracts had a
value of 30% less than the maximum reference value. Among the 58 contracts that included
water supply connections, there are 16 (28 percent) for less than 50 connections, which was the
agreed minimum number of connections per contract. The average unit cost of water supply
connections was US$466, 33 percent below the US$700 investment ceiling. And the average unit
cost of BSUs was US$314, 30 percent below the US$450 investment ceiling. For more detailed
information please see Annex 3.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

54.     The project is rated as highly unsatisfactory, essentially because its overall outcome is
measured against the project's original Results' Framework since no formal restructuring took
place. As a result, the PDO was not achieved. Furthermore, while the project was highly relevant
to the administration which prepared it, its design and overarching focus on sustainability did not
necessarily coincide with the priorities of the new administration that was left to implement it.

55.    The few activities implemented under the project generally did not follow the original
design, did not represent good practices and did not integrate lessons learned during the first
phase of the APL. There were clear deficiencies in the technical quality of the works constructed
and there are doubts as to the sustainability of the investments financed.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

56.    Although the project was expected to have significant impacts on poverty and gender
development, the reduction of social intervention limited those impacts and no ex-post
evaluation was conducted to measure them.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening:

57.     Component 1 considered activities to promote sector reform and institutional
strengthening by focusing on: (i) strengthening the capacity of SAPSyRS through training and
the development of technical norms; (ii) upgrading the sector information system (SISASAR)


                                                16
developed as part of APL-1; (iii) sector planning and policy development; and (iv) strengthening
the capacity of other key sector actors (municipalities, service providers and water user
associations) to assume their roles in the sector. The cancelation of this component restrained
institutional strengthening to improve long term capacity.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative

58.    No other unintended outcomes and impacts were identified.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:

59.    Not applicable.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

60.     The risk to development outcome is considered high because of the following factors at
the national, municipal and community level:

 National: Risk of weak political support. The Government announced a new WSS investment
 program but the policies and strategies to be applied under this new operation are unclear.
 Government policy on WSS sector development is unknown; however, the emphasis is on
 showing rapid results rather than following sometimes lengthy participatory approaches, an
 approach that might lead to lower quality and sustainability of works.

 Municipal: Risk of lack of involvement of municipalities. The implementation experience of
 Phase I and II of PRAGUAS/APL showed a clear municipal interest in participating under the
 project's financial policy. Municipalities and communities demonstrated that demand-
 response and performance based approaches can deliver sustainable results on a national
 scale. There is a risk of decreasing municipal involvement, however, if sector policies change,
 for example: (i) if a government policy of full subsidies without municipal co-financing for
 investments is adopted; or (ii) if WSS investments are made directly through central
 government institutions without municipal participation.

 Community: Risk of communities not sustaining the assets. Long term technical assistance,
 training and operational and management services to existing juntas (water user boards) are
 required to ensure sustainability. MIDUVI does not have the institutional set up to provide
 technical assistance to rural communities. PRAGUAS focused on strengthening
 municipalities and creating water board user associations to make these the technical
 assistance mechanism close to communities. This component was canceled; therefore, the risk
 of not having an institutional mechanism to provide long-term assistance (technical,
 administrative and social) to water board user associations remains high.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry :

Rating: Satisfactory

61.     Bank performance during design and appraisal phase up to project approval was
satisfactory. The Project design was consistent with the CAS and was carefully prepared
considering the experience and lessons learned during the previous phase and relevant regional
experience.

62.     An ex-post evaluation of the first Phase of the project shed light on areas with room for
improvement and confirmed the adequacy of other areas and parameters of the project. Based on
those findings, the project team incorporated lessons learned and changes that were expected to
increase efficiency, control and quality of outputs. Some of the key changes included: (i)
simplification of procurement. Under PRAGUAS II, designs, supervision and community
development/training services would be contracted at the national level through large
engineering and social consulting firms, CDF and CIS. This modification would limit
procurement undertaken by municipalities; (ii) improved on the job training of water boards and
community members; (iii) tightened specifications for several system components to make works
more cost effective and; sustainable; (iv) improved M&E systems with user-friendly information
systems that would allow for the utilization of baseline and diagnostic data for monitoring of the
social plan by consultants, municipalities, water boards and communities; (v) adoption of
capacity-building activities to strengthen the emphasis on the promotion of healthy hygiene
habits and the use of sanitary facilities; (vi) strengthened financial incentive framework for the
delegation of cantonal WSS services to achieve more autonomous models to improve service
provision; and (vii) development of an extensive and innovative set of M&E indicators for the
project. In total there were 7 indicators for the PDO and 20 intermediate outcome indicators to
monitor implementation progress.

63.     The project included the design of a rigorous evaluation to assess impacts on beneficiary
households and communities over time. A specially designed baseline survey would be carried
out for sample and control communities. Follow-up surveys would be carried out for households
in sample and control communities at the mid-term review and at the end of PRAGUAS II.

64.     The capacity of MIDUVI/PMU to implement procurement actions for the project was
evaluated as well as the overall project risk for procurement. Several specific actions were
agreed between the Bank and the Government to mitigate risks, including provisions in the loan
agreement for procurement to update the register of contractors and consultants every six months
and submission to the Bank of revised bidding documents, and formats for evaluation. The
overall risk for procurement was assessed as average based on the existing procurement team in
the PMU for PRAGUAS I.




                                               18
65.     A financial management assessment was conducted during the preparation phase. The
assessment concluded that, under the management of PMU/PRAGUAS, the Project would
maintain financial management arrangements compatible with Bank requirements. It also
identified several inherent and control risks related to the project that resulted in substantial risks.
Nonetheless, after the application of mitigation measures, the residual risk was assessed as
moderate. A financial management action plan was designated to address these issues, and it
identified a minimum set of actions required to ensure that proper financial management
arrangements were in place, including: (i) recruitment of the financial management coordinator,
accountant and treasurer as external consultants; (ii) provision of stability to project staff during
Project implementation; (iii) close and constant monitoring at the municipal level; and (iv)
assurance that local counterpart funds were available for Project implementation and others.

66.    The Project design was thorough and the Bank took into account the adequacy of relevant
aspects such as social, technical, financial, economic, environmental, institutional and fiduciary
aspects.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     The approach of the supervision team can be divided into two phases. Between the board
approval, effectiveness and the decision of the Government to cancel most of the loan (July 2006
to January 2008), the Bank team was focused on supporting and guiding the PMU in
implementing the project as originally designed. Rather than waiting for the incoming
administration in January 2007, the team pushed the project through effectiveness, and approved
the recruitment of most key staff (with the exception of the PMU Coordinator). This decision
would probably have been the right one if the new administration had been similar to previous
ones, with frequent ministerial turnover and similar policy principles, as expected at that time.
However, the Correa administration that came to power in January 2007 turned out to be very
stable and to follow different policies. After the new administration took office, although some
minor adjustments were discussed, the team failed to recognize the increasing disconnect
between the content of the Bank ­ PMU discussions and the intentions of the Ministerial
authorities, and continued to work mostly with the PMU (where most of the staff, but for the
PMU Coordinator, had been appointed by the previous administration).

68.     In the phase following the Government's decision to cancel most of the loan (January
2008 ­ March 2009), the Bank team adjusted its mode of supervision and began to actively
involve the Ministerial authorities in the entire decision-making process. It regularly consulted
with management, raising its preoccupation with the technical soundness of some of the
activities financed by the project, which however had to be balanced with the Bank's overall
interest in maintaining a working relationship with the administration. To account for growing
concerns on the Bank side over sustainability and fiduciary issues, the team organized more
frequent supervision missions, together with independent technical reviews of works under
construction and extensive field visits. Despite a very delicate overall engagement with Ecuador,
the team was able to maintain a reasonably good relationship with its counterparts at all levels
and bring the project to closure in a non-conflictive manner.



                                                  19
69.     The team also advised the Borrower on repeated occasions of the importance to carry out
a formal restructuring of the project in order to reflect changes in the scope, design and loan
amount. However, the Borrower was not convinced that the corresponding process (which would
have included Board Approval, since the PDO and its indicators would have changed) was worth
the effort, given that its strategy was to cancel most of the loan and complete and close the rest as
quickly as possible.

70.     Over the entire course of supervision, sufficient budget and adequate staff resources were
allocated, and the project was closely and adequately supervised. The Bank Team was highly
stable, with only one change of TTL over the entire implementation of PRAGUAS I and II, and
several of the key staff remaining in the Bank team for more than 10 years. Aide-memoires were
prepared regularly and the project's performance in terms of achievements of development
objectives and implementation was rated realistically in the Implementation Status Reports.

71.    The review of procurement of consultants, goods and works was done in accordance with
the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement and the Bank´s Guidelines for Procurement of
Goods and Works by borrowers and the Guidelines for selection and Contracting of Consultants
by borrowers.

72.     A social development specialist was included in the Bank team throughout the life of the
project to ensure that the project design and supervision included oversight of social
participatory schemes, and access of indigenous groups as project beneficiaries and stakeholders.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     Based on the Bank performance during the lending phase as well as supervision, the
overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

74.     During project preparation, the government performance was highly satisfactory. The
project was prepared in a relatively short time span, following sound technical principles,
reflecting a number of lessons learned during the PRAGUAS I project. The project was a logical
step for a sector that had been in modernization over the previous 7 years, in part thanks to the
support of the first phase of the APL. As part of project preparation, the GOE conducted in-depth
ex-post evaluations of PRAGUAS I projects, initiated the preparation of key Terms of
Reference, and obtained all the necessary authorizations to declare the project effective in a
relatively short time (6 months, much less than the average in Ecuador at the time).

75.    During project implementation, particularly during the last year, Government
performance was unsatisfactory. The Government failed to recognize the growing disconnect



                                                 20
between the technical work carried out by the PMU and its own policies and strategies. The
decision to dismiss high and intermediate level staff of the PMU that had been hired through
independent, competitive processes and the subsequent weaknesses due to the high turnover in
key personnel and the lack of key staff to perform project planning and implementation
activities, severely affected implementation after December 2007. The revised procurement plan
was not carried out as planned. The Government failed to act after independent supervision
revealed significant technical and social weaknesses in the on-going sub-projects in June and
October 2008, and did not implement the agreed action plan.

76.     Although cooperation agreements had been signed by SAPSyRS and the Indigenous and
Afro-Ecuadorian councils (CODENPE and CODAE), the PMU failed to follow-up on these
collaboration agreements to synchronize demands of subprojects originating in indigenous
groups, where CODENPE and CODAE would assist the communities in meeting the eligibility
criteria to participate in PRAGUAS (i.e. community organization, financial contribution ­up to
10%). Moreover, an Action Plan that had been agreed between PRAGUAS and the Directorate
of Intercultural Bilingual Education (DINEIB) at the Ministry of Education, for the production of
bilingual materials in Kichwa and Shuar on Hygiene and management of water and sanitation
systems, was not implemented.


6. Lessons Learned

       The impact of political transitions on project implementation can be significant, in
       particular when the new administration disagrees with significant aspects of project
       objectives and design. The Bank teams must be alert to changes in administration
       priorities and consider a restructuring of the project early on to make the necessary
       adjustments if common ground can be found on sound technical principles. This is
       particularly true in the case of APLs or projects prepared by one administration but
       implemented by another. In addition, rushing through initial implementation (including
       the contracting of key PMU staff) shortly before an administration change, despite
       allowing for more expedite implementation, poses risks especially when it can be
       expected that the incoming administration might have different priorities from the one
       preparing the project. Finally, the Bank should not shy away from sustaining high-level,
       frank discussions with incoming administrations on the scope and technical principles of
       on-going or new projects, and consider a mutually agreed cancelation as an acceptable
       option if no agreement can be found.

       Insulating the implementing team from staff turnover could have positive results in the
       case of highly unstable political environments, but also negative consequences, especially
       when the political context changes and the PMU staff no longer has the trust of the new
       political authorities. In such case, it is important to recognize that the Bank's counterpart
       is not the PMU but the Government's implementing agency (in this case MIDUVI) and
       the Bank team must exert special care in identifying possible discrepancies between both.

       In the case of a deteriorating project implementation, it is important for the Bank team
       not to alienate the Borrower's goodwill towards the project. Tradeoffs must be made


                                                21
          between the need to maintain or improve the quality of project implementation, and the
          need to maintain working relationships with the Client so as to reduce the risk of having
          to close a project without the support and engagement of the Client.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a)       Borrower/implementing agencies:

77.   In its comments to the draft ICR, the Government of Ecuador presents in some details its
own assessment of the project and raises the following issues:

          Assessment of Recipient Performance: The Borrower's comments state that the Recipient
          provided the "personnel, funding and the infrastructure required so that the PMU could
          efficiently carry out all work requirements and undertakings made." The Borrower
          proceeds to mention that one of the reasons for significant staffing problems with the
          PMU is linked to the Bank's requirement to have PMU staff selected through an
          independent, competitive process and given long-term contracts. A complete discussion
          of this issue is included in the ICR's paragraphs 34(b) and 67. While the team does not
          necessarily concur with the Borrower's assessment, this point was included in the lessons
          learnt.

          Assessment of Bank performance: the Borrower generally praises the Bank's performance
          but raises the issue of the Bank's temporary withholding of loan proceeds in October
          2008 and mentions the Government had to provide short-notice emergency funding to
          make up. The team does not question this fact; the ICR provides a complete description
          of the context that led to this decision in paragraph 34(d).

78.     The Borrower does not take a firm position on the project's overall performance, noting
instead that its own evaluation of the project is still on-going.

(b)       Co-financiers:
79.       Not applicable.

 (c)      Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society):

Annex 2.            Outputs by Component

Component 1: Water and Sanitation Sector Reform and Institutional Strengthening

1.      Activities in this component were focused on strengthening institutional capacity of
SAPSyRS and other sector actors; however, these activities were delayed since implementation
concentrated on components 2 and 3, related to the construction and rehabilitation of water and
sanitation infrastructure in rural and cantonal capitals. The only output in this component was the
physical upgrading of the office environment of SAPSyRS, MIDUVI.

Component 2: Water and Sanitation in Rural Areas

2.     Subprojects of water and sanitation in rural areas were to be implemented following a
demand-based approach. The project cycle included social promotion activities, community
development, hygiene education, and the design, construction and supervision of civil works. A
comparison between PAD estimates and actual subproject outputs are shown in the following
table.

3.      It should be noted that the actual figures are lower than the values expected at the end of
the project (Project Outcome). This is due to the partial cancelation of two thirds of the loan and
the early ending of the program. The increment of people with access to improved water supply
corresponds to 11% of the original objective, and the increment of people with access to
sanitation corresponds to 64% of the original objective considered at appraisal.

4.      During the implementation phase, 104 projects of water supply and sanitation and 179
projects of sanitation only, were implemented through 119 construction contracts.

5.      The lack of effectiveness in social intermediation during implementation affected
effectiveness of services and their sustainability; therefore, figures shown in the table refers to
access to improved water supply or sanitation services, without considering their sustainability,
as defined at appraisal.

6.       The quality of outputs was analyzed during supervision missions in 2008 and 2009. Field
visits revealed that construction quality of water supply systems was good. Water supply systems
were built according to design specifications; their construction materials and workmanship were
acceptable. It was found that construction projects suffered from a lack of social intervention to


                                                                24
prepare the community for the construction work. On the other hand, rural sanitation
infrastructure presented construction deficiencies. In some cases these deficiencies were due to a
lack of supervision and in other cases were due to a lack of social intervention, lack of
information, and lack of coordination between municipalities and communities.

Component 3: Promotion of New Management Models for Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste in
Cantonal Capitals

7.      This component was largely canceled. The Program implemented rehabilitation and
efficiency improvements of water supply and sanitation systems in three cantonal capitals:
Tulcan, Riobamba y Cayambe. The actual number of people directly affected by project-funded
activities cannot be determined due to the absence of a strict TA program with these
municipalities, including regular monitoring of key service quality indicators. However, the
detail of the activities financed under the component follows:


   1. Tulcan (61,115 urban population). Distribution network replacement in Rafael Arellano
      street. Improvement of water tanks. Replacement of feeding line for the water treatment
      plant. Purchase of laboratory equipment.

   2.   Riobamba (174,538 urban population). New chlorination system. Creation of District
        Metering Areas. Installation of meters.

   3. Cayambe (35,993 urban pop.). Installation of macro-meters.




                                               25
Annex 3.         Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     Given the limited access to information it is not possible to conduct a rigorous ex-post
evaluation as was done at the closing of the previous phase of PRAGUAS, partly because the
envisioned monitoring and evaluation system was never in place, and partly because assumptions
made at appraisal did not materialized given the earlier closing and reduced scope of the project.

2.      At appraisal the strategy for implementing the rural investment component built on the
experiences from the first phase. The project required communities to initiate participation in
project activities and to validate their commitment and need for the project via a cash
contribution towards the expected capital cost. The self-selected project communities (from those
poor communities already identified as eligible) would choose their preferred level of service
from a menu of options. However, the project design was expected to incorporate eligibility
criteria to screen proposed technical solutions to maximize the likelihood of the interventions
being economically feasible. The project aimed to maximize overall benefits for each specific
subproject, including those related to health impacts by promoting better hygiene practices
specifically handwashing with soap; leaving the responsibility for O&M costs to the
beneficiaries who will also pay a 30 percent cash and labor contribution to capital costs for
project implementation.

3.      Agreement to project rules regarding cost recovery was a prerequisite for community
participation, increasing the odds of sustainable investments. In particular, the project rules
required that user charges cover operation and maintenance expenses and the replacement of
electro-mechanic equipments, and that those communities confirm and demonstrate their
willingness to adopt such charges. Communities were also expected to accept the responsibility
for service provision through a water board (junta) as a condition for participation in the Project.
To increase the likelihood that the systems build by PRAGUAS II were and remain economically
feasible, a new component to deliver post-construction support to the juntas was added, and sub-
project performance was going to be more closely monitored and information collected on a
continuous basis, to increase the useful life of the systems.

4.      Additional benefits were expected from the on-site sanitation component, although these
were not quantified at appraisal. Rather least-cost analysis of the alternatives and cost-
effectiveness criteria were agreed to be used for investment decisions. The strategy included
strong social promotion and demand generation activities of user investments in sanitation,
limited subsidies, targeted coverage levels of at least 60 percent of households per community to
achieve increased health impacts, and promoting a wider range of lower cost options. Those were
expected to bring additional benefits to the communities.

5.      Given the lack of information available, the analysis presented in this annex is based on
information from 103 contracts9: 27 for water supply systems, 45 for basic sanitation units a
flush latrine with basin and shower (BSUs), and 31 for both services, all of which were partly
financed with loan proceeds.

9
  Information on contracts was collected by a consultant hired by the Bank in August 2009 after it became evident
that the PMU was not in condition anymore to provide reliable cost and scope information on the contracts carried
out under the project. It was not possible to obtain access to 100% of the contracts signed under the loan.


                                                        26
6.      During project preparation, investment ceilings were defined for each type of
intervention: US$700 for each new water connection, and US$450 per UBS. It also included
ceilings for rehabilitation that ranged from US$250 to US$700 for each water supply connection,
and US$300 per BSUs. These ceilings were based in parts on an economic analysis.

7.      Out of the 103 contracts analyzed, 90 (87 percent) were signed for an amount below the
maximum investment cost: all 45 of sanitation, 19 of water supply, and 26 of both services. On
average, the 103 contracts had a value of 30% less than the maximum reference value. Among
the 58 contracts that included water supply connections, there are 16 (28 percent) for less than 50
connections, which was the agreed minimum number of connections per contract. The average
unit cost of water supply connections was US$466, 33 percent below the US$700 investment
ceiling. And the average unit cost of BSUs was US$314, 30 percent below the US$450
investment ceiling. The results are presented in Figures 1 and 2.

BACKGROUND

1.       The former IEOS was one of the most relevant of the State's executing agencies, and
achieved important successes in terms of water and sanitation coverage; it helped lead to national
average drinking water coverage increases from 20 percent to 60.5 percent from 1961 to 1999,
and increases in sanitary sewerage coverage rates from 14 percent to 51.5 percent in the same
period. With the entry into force of the Law on State Modernization, the former IEOS began a
process of transferring the water supply systems to the municipalities and communities so that
they could assume responsibility for their operation, maintenance, and administration, thereby
initiating one of the first steps taken toward decentralization. However, following the dissolution
of the IEOS, the service-providing entities failed to develop adequate programs for satisfying
demand in either quantitative or qualitative terms.

2.     Both the people and the central and local government authorities have recognized that the
main problems are those associated with the supply of and demand for services; imbalances in
the provision of those services; and the unsatisfactory management of entities in the Sector.10

3.      Supply of and demand for services. According to end-2001 data, the country had four
million inhabitants without adequate drinking water services, five million without adequate
sanitation services, and six million--in urban areas--without adequate solid waste disposal.
Moreover, water service was intermittent in almost half of urban centers, losses still amounted to
65 percent of total production, while surface water went untreated in 30 percent of urban centers,
and waste water untreated in 92 percent, and solid waste discharged into streams and rivers.

4.     Imbalances in the provision of services. The transfers and loans to the Sector failed to
contribute effectively to improving the situation of the poorest because they were turned over
without clearly defined and documented objectives, nor did they lead to good service on the part
of those receiving them. The forms and channels used for these transfers and loans also have the
negative effect of reducing the "incentives" in the sense of efficiently operating services, with
municipalities establishing tariffs making cost recovery possible. The subsidies granted service-
providing entities through the tariff structure (crossed subsidies) also fail to favor the poorest, as
the form in which they are designed and applied ultimately favors the largest consumers of
water, generally higher-income households. The vast majority of lower-income people in rural
and periurban areas receive lower quality services, and have to spend a significant proportion of
their household income in order to pay for them (a higher proportion than so allocated by
households with better service).

5.     Problems with entrepreneurial management in the Sector. The organizational approach
used for the Sector in our country is oriented toward decentralization of service-rendering to the
municipality and community level. However, this decentralization is incomplete as there is no
appropriate regulation of the quality and price of services, nor is there an adequate information
10
     Taken from the Sectoral Development Plan of the SAPSyRS.


                                                       32
system that might enable service-rendering entities, governmental authorities, and users to
compare the quality and price of services received.

6.      The tariffs cover only part of the costs. The difference between such costs and tariff
revenues is financed by resources from national and municipal transfers and by taxes specifically
earmarked for investment in the Sector. In addition, infrastructure operation and maintenance is
deficient owing to the shortage of financial resources for addressing these needs, a problem
leading to a shortening of the useful economic life of the infrastructure.

7.      This set of problems, as well as the scenario brought about by the promulgation of the
Law on State Modernization and its Regulations, of the Law on the Promotion of Investment and
Citizen Participation, and the Law on Municipal Governance, opened the possibility for
flexibility in the market structure. This included the use of existing central government and
sectional organizations, establishing alternatives for the provision of services through new
organizational modalities and alliances; the PRAGUAS Program was designed as a means of
supporting actions relating to modernization of the Sector and of endeavoring to reverse the
prevailing conditions described above.

ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN                UNDER       PRAGUAS        I   (Reform    and    Institutional
Strengthening Component)

(a)    Under PRAGUAS I, the SAPSyRS promulgated the NATIONAL DRINKING
WATER AND SANITATION POLICY (2002). The general objective of this Policy was to
interconnect the efforts of the Government and society with a view to improving the living
conditions of Ecuadorians. The formulation of this State Policy constituted an opportunity again
to promote the concept of environmental sanitation through interconnected efforts to improve,
among other things, the provision of water, sanitary sewerage, and the collection, treatment, and
proper disposal of solid wastes.

(b)     To operationalize this Policy and remain in synch with the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) of reducing the proportion of persons without sustainable access to water and
sanitation services by half by 2016, the SAPSyRS formulated the SECTORAL
DEVELOPMENT PLAN. It posited that increased coverage and efficiency in the Sector will
only be possible with the development of key strategies, and called for strong political,
economic, technical, and social support from all Ecuadorians. These strategies were oriented
toward changing the status quo, replacing it by a virtuous circle resulting in continuing
improvement in service quality and coverage.

(c)      Another important document generated by the SAPSyRS as part of the Reform and
Institutional Strengthening Component of PRAGUAS I, as a support for the activities of service
operators, is the GUIDE FOR THE PREPARATION OF TARIFFS FOR DRINKING
WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES, a document that analyzes the subsidies, explains
the structure that a tariff must have, and shows the way to calculate and apply a tariff.

(d)     One key element of the strategies laid down in the Sectoral Development Plan is the
reallocation of the transfers and loans to the Sector, inasmuch as the State should have urgent


                                               33
measures for ensuring that the subsidies do in fact go to the poorest (redistributive effect) and
contribute to the administrative and financial strengthening of the service providers
(development effect), bearing in mind that those subsidies and loans which are unregulated
should be abolished.
In an effort to embark on this dynamic, in 2004 the SAPSyRS, with support from the PRAGUAS
Program and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, established the REDISTRIBUTION
MECHANISM FOR THE SPECIAL CONSUMPTION TAX. Two-thirds of the collection of
this tax would be turned over as a State subsidy for improving drinking water coverage. The
success obtained, especially in terms of water distribution, was significant, in that this sizable
subsidy is effectively reaching all sectional enterprises or entities responsible for performing the
drinking water delivery service (see Registro Oficial [official gazette] No.463 of November 17,
2004).
(e)     PRAGUAS I also included preparation of the PRELIMINARY DRAFT ORGANIC
LAW ON THE PROVISION OF WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES. Its aim is to
establish the basic rules governing the efficient delivery of the public services of providing
drinking water and sewerage throughout the national territory, in both urban and rural areas. The
provisions of this law ensure compliance with the primordial duties assigned to the Ecuadorian
State in the Political Constitution of the Republic (prior to the one promulgated in 2008).

One section of this draft law posited the necessity for organizing and operating a municipal
control body, which would be a deconcentrated agency of the municipal administration that
would enjoy both operational and financial autonomy, as well as decision-making independence
in the pursuit of its mission, and would be connected to the municipality through the municipal
council. Its profile would be exclusively technical.

(f)     Creation of the Sectoral Information System on Drinking Water, Sanitation, and
Solid Waste (SISASAR). The principal objectives of this information system were to: diagnose
the main problems in the sector, be they technical/operational, administrative,
economic/financial, commercial, or management-related, at any time; compare the quality and
cost performance of the services in the various municipalities or service-providing entities; and
plan and effectively channel economic resources, through the implementation of technical
assistance programs, and the preparation and updating of technical guides and management
guides, as well as rules and procedures for tariff systems.

(g)     Staff training and strengthening of the SAPSyRS. In this area it was possible to
structure and back several work teams, such as the teams for Technical Assistance (Management
Models), Integrated Solid Waste Management, and Investment Incentives, with participation
from the Information System Team.

In addition to the self-training activities performed by these teams and the (provincial) EPAS,
toward the very end of PRAGUAS Phase I the SAPSyRS was able to provide training to
approximately 60 staff in courses on Project Formulation and Evaluation; Regulation,
Concessions, and New Management Models; the Sectional Approach; and Information Systems.
Thirty-five percent of the participants were officials from the provincial directorates.




                                                34
ACTIONS PLANNED FOR PHASE II OF THE PRAGUAS PROGRAM

8.     Effectively, as indicated in the World Bank report, it is planned to continue in Phase II,
based on the lessons learned in Phase I, with the following activities:

   (a) Advance the Draft Law for the Provision of Drinking Water and Sanitation
       Services; achieve its promulgation and work on its Regulations.

   (b) Working in tandem with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, develop a Financial and
       Resource Management Program for Water and Sanitation to bring order to
       investments, making it possible for service providers to count on the financial resources
       needed to satisfy demand, particularly on the part of the poorest; incentivize the
       strengthening of service providers so that they operate efficiently and recover their costs;
       and motivate consumers to conserve the water resource. In addition, work on the
       strategies for intervention in and contributions to the organizations and institutions in the
       Sector, achieving a public-private alliance that looks forward strategically and is
       expressed annually in a Country Agenda for Water and Sanitation. Do the foregoing
       within the framework of the National Policy on Drinking Water and Sanitation and with a
       view to implementing the Sectoral Development Plan.

   (c) Apply the tariff guide, as one of the major tools for achieving the sustainability of
       services.

   (d) Promote the use of the Sectoral Information System (SISASAR).

   (e) Create the Technical and Quality Standards System for the Drinking Water and
       Sanitation Sector, which in a systematic and integrated manner develops technical
       standards consistent with the requirements of the Sector so as to support and promote
       harmonious and competitive development in conditions marked by efficiency and
       economy.

   (f) Establishment and strengthening of the work teams, moving forward with those in the
       two subsectors that are relatively new in terms of institutional know-how, namely
       integrated solid waste management and environmental management.

   (g) Continue training SAPSyRS staff, at both the central and provincial levels, so as to
       promote the efficient provision of products and services and meet the challenge of
       leadership.

EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES: DESIGNS AND IMPLEMENTATION

9.     The designs carried out under PRAGUAS I were revised and updated by consultants
hired by the Program, and served as the basis for the implementation of Phase II, as related to the
contracting for drinking water and sanitation systems.



                                                35
10.      Solutions will be provided in this phase approximately as follows:

         9,500 in Sanitation
         6,400 in Drinking Water.

11.    Operations will be evaluated during the current year by staff from the Subsecretariat for
Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Solid Waste, so as to assess the experience of the Drinking
Water Boards responsible for system operation and maintenance.

12.     In this regard, it bears noting that the Program is being implemented in 12 provinces at
the national level as well as in 35 cantons.

13.     The Incentive Component is being implemented in four provinces (of four cantons each)
in the Sierra, which were audited by the enterprises concerned.

14.    At this writing, the works are almost completed, with only some contracted in the
drinking water area not yet finished.

15.    Auditing of the drinking water system was outsourced by MIDUVI through the
Subsecretariat of Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Solid Waste, under the supervision of staff
from the latter.

Borrower's performance during the project as it evolved and was implemented, with
special emphasis on the lessons learned that can be applied in the future.

1.      A few months after Mr. Rafael Correa D. took office as President of the Republic, the
National Government decided to terminate Loan 7401-EC with the World Bank owing to a State
policy that will make it possible for works with social projects to be financed exclusively with
government resources. The execution of the Phase II portion totaling US$7,621,820.26 was
consistent with agreements reached in a timely manner with municipalities and communities.

2.     Despite this, the National Government was supportive at all times, through the provision
of personnel, funding and the infrastructure required so that the PMU could efficiently carry out
all work requirements and undertakings made.

3.     The primary problem identified by the National Government with regard to the delayed
PMU activities in 2007 was the fact that the PMU had a number of consultants engaged in
various areas but did not see the fruits of their labors. This is the case with various positions,
such as the Planning Coordinator, the Monitoring and Evaluation Coordinator, and the Legal
Advisor, for example.

4.     The World Bank's requirement that long-term contracts be entered into with the
consultants hired, using poorly drafted contracts containing no clause that would make it possible
to terminate them unilaterally, caused serious harm to the Ecuadorian State owing to appeals by
the former PRAGUAS PMU consultants.

5.     Even when, in October 2008, the Bank illegitimately withheld resources from the
Program, the National Government covered its needs using government funding so that the
works would not be brought to a halt and that it would be possible to settle the fees due to the
consultants engaged by the PMU.

6.      At the same time, and taking account of the strong points of and experience gained under
the PRAGUAS, the National Government launched a new program on Drinking Water,
Sanitation, and Solid Waste for Rural Areas. In this program, national consultants and
professionals were trained so as to have a specialized human resource group capable of
addressing efficiently the requirements that will have to be covered in the sector over the next 20
years.

Evaluation of Bank performance, including the effectiveness of relations between the
borrower and the Bank, with special emphasis on lessons learned

7.      The National Government extends its thanks to the Bank and Bank staff in charge of the
project for all the assistance they provided to ensure its success. Surely over the 10 years of
PRAGUAS Phase I and Phase II execution, valuable lessons were learned about how to approach
the provision of water and sanitation services in rural areas and the issues on which the National
Government is now decisively taking action with a view to improving the quality of life of
people living in rural areas. Some of these lessons are:




                                                37
       The importance of community participation in the form of unskilled labor, empowering
       same as regards the works and their care and maintenance.
       The prior social work that should be carried out in order to ensure successful
       implementation of such works.
       The need for adequate legislation and a legal framework that enables the State to take
       effective action to address the serious coverage problems that the country has in this
       sector.
       The need for ongoing training of local professionals so as to have stakeholders with the
       capacity to implement works effectively.

Proposed arrangements to ensure the future sustainability of the project, and to design
with the Bank the performance indicators to be used to monitor the future operation and
its development impact

With regard to the new Rural Program

8.      In keeping with provisions handed down by the authorities (SAPSyRS/MIDUVI
administration, January 2007 to May 2009) work was carried out to formulate a new Program for
the rural area, known as the Water and Sanitation Partnership Program. It incorporates ideas,
concepts, and strategies from PRAGUAS and from other Programs carried out by the SAPSyRS
in the past.

9.    The Program itself has the following components: Rural Investment (studies, designs,
and construction); Health Education; Water Quality Monitoring; and Strengthening of
Community Operators (JAAPS).

10.    The financing of this Program had initially been provided by budget allocations and the
SAPSyRS. Along the way, new funding sources have been incorporated, such as those described
below:

       Spanish Water Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (current status: preapproved,
       with final approval anticipated for October 2009). Amount of project: US$40,000,000.
       Nonreimbursable resources US$32,000,000, national counterpart US$8,000,000 (it has
       been agreed to value the installed capacity, studies, and designs). The IDB will perform
       the operation monitoring activities. Project duration: 4 years.
       Debt cancellation resources from the Spanish Government. Amount: US$5,715,736
       (nonreimbursable), plus US$1,000,000 (national counterpart). Project total:
       US$6,715,736. Beneficiary provinces: Esmeraldas, Sucumbíos, and Carchi. The grant
       resources will be available in September 2009, although the project has already started
       using government resources from the counterpart. Project duration: 2 years.
       Institutional cooperation agreement between the MIDUVI and PETROPRODUCCION
       for the development of approximately 300 water and sanitation projects aimed at
       developing the rural area in the northeastern provinces of the country. Amount of
       contribution from PETROPRODUCCION, approximately US$6,000,000. Project
       duration: 3 years. This project will enter into force in 2010.



                                              38
       Spanish Government resources for meeting the Millennium Development Goals.
       Amount: US$5,000,000 (nonreimbursable). Work area: Provinces of Esmeraldas, Los
       Ríos, Manabí, and Bolívar. SENAGUA, UNDP, SAPSyRS/MIDUVI alliance. Resources
       administered by the UNDP. Project duration: 3 years. This project is already under way.
       National Strategy for the Eradication of Child Malnutrition (INTI). Effort involving
       commitments by all the social ministries. Area of intervention (Cantons): Alausí, Colta,
       and Guamote in Chimborazo Province; Guaranda, Chillanes, and San Miguel de Bolívar
       cantons in Bolívar Province; and Sigchos and Pujilí cantons in Cotopaxi Province. This
       project is already under way, and has a duration of 4 years. No specific amount has been
       determined.

CONCLUSIONS

11.     It is fair to say that the PRAGUAS Program was conceived as a program focused above
all on "Sectoral and Institutional Reforms," with the two phases of the Program being
interrelated with a view to achieving the outcomes sought through modernization measures and
activities, and especially to ensure that these reforms be sustainable over time.

12.    However, as is generally known, the current government reached the decision that
programs and works that are social in nature should be financed with the resources of the
Ecuadorian State, it being recognized that this was the reason why MIDUVI authorities chose to
terminate the loan and make modifications in the design of the Program, abandoning the
component that was its strongest pillar, with the resulting outcomes, the indicators for which are
shown in the World Bank report. Practically all the steps made in terms of sectoral reform have
come to a halt. Moreover, with the birth of PROMADEC, with a highly subsidy-oriented policy,
there was a break with the partnership strategy, and with contributions between institutions as a
savings measure and as a way to involve all stakeholders in the problems of the Sector.

13.     In principle, the absence of a LAW ON THE PROVISION OF DRINKING WATER
AND SEWERAGE SERVICES made it impossible for Ecuador to have integrated development
planning for those services, which contemplates always achieving objectives in the area of
coverage and quality; establishing a basic normative system of institutional responsibilities,
making it possible to comply with essential principles, and favoring the creation of conditions
that ensure access to a basic level of services by the people; determining mandatory minimum
conditions with regard to organization, institutional performance, and the quality of the services
provided as a result of the substantial and growing provision of services; defining a basic
arrangement for economic and financial support of services, including tariff principles that
sustainably ensure the efficient rendering of services and the equitable compensation for same on
the part of the user population; obtaining, through decentralization in favor of the sectional
entities, the building of a self-sufficient service-providing system, with entrepreneurial operation
and with operational and financial autonomy; establishing basic guidelines for the adoption and
operation of regulation and control approaches for the efficient services that are simultaneously
independent of any political interference; and permitting effective participation and social
control with respect to the planning and management of drinking water and sanitation services.




                                                39
14.     Special attention should also be paid to the topic of the INSTITUTIONAL
STRENGTHENING OF THE SAPSyRS, which must assume and exercise leadership. To this
end it must strengthen and focus its skills, enhance the flexibility of its internal structure, build
multidisciplinary work teams with a high response capacity in terms of effectiveness and
efficiency, with professional ethics, motivation, and a desire to serve through action. This
implies a mastery of knowledge, trends, techniques, powers, and expertise, all within a
framework of political will to address changes and correct existing weaknesses such as policy
overlap. Indeed, one is responsive to the National Drinking Water Policy and the other in
principle contradicts its leadership role, continuing to promote transfers to sectional governments
without establishing a minimum set of preconditions, and resulting in continued resource losses.
