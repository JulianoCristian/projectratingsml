By 2005, PRAGUAS had improved water supply and\n            sanitation (WSS) services for over 250,000 people. The town\n            component of the project supports municipalities which are\n            willing to make their utilities more autonomous and to raise\n            tariffs to obtain quick service improvements and choose\n            their own management models. PRAGUAS has become the\n            government's primary vehicle for addressing challenges\n            in the water supply and sanitation sector. The objective of\n            PRAGUAS is to increase the coverage and effective use of\n            sustainable WSS services. It focuses on rural areas and\n            small towns where two thirds of the country's poor reside."}, "docdt": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
