supply and sanitation\n            (WSS) services for new rural beneficiaries, and promote\n            their effective use, as well as to provide improved and\n            sustainable WSS services to beneficiaries in cantonal\n            capitals. In addition it will promote sustainable solid\n            waste services in cantonal capitals, and, will improve\n            overall sector performance by the national government\n            through the promotion of performance-based investment\n            financing for the urban WSS sector. The first Component -\n            Sector Reform and Institutional Strengthening - will\n            strengthen the capacity of the Sub-Secretariat of Water,\n            Sanitation and Solid Waste (SAPSyRS) as well as other key\n            WSS sector actors such as municipalities, WSS operators,\n            water users associations and others. The Rural Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Component will design and build rural water\n            supply and sanitation systems, train communities, organize\n            water user boards into regional organizations, and finance a\n            nationwide hand-washing campaign. The third Component -\n            Promotion of New Management Models for Water, Sanitation and\n            Solid Waste - will provide technical assistance to help\n            municipalities delegate their water and sanitation services\n            to autonomous operators, and, will develop sustainable\n            arrangements for solid waste services, while providing\n            investment finance to upgrade municipal water, sanitation,\n            and solid waste services. Finally, the Project\n            Administration Component will finance project management\n            activities, as well as a strategic communication program."}, "docdt": "2006-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
