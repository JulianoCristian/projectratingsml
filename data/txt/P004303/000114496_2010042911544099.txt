Dear Mr. Mohd. Fadzil Yunns:
      We refer to the Project Agreement (Sabah Land Settlement and

      In response to the request contained in the Treasury letter
dated May 10, 1991, and the discussion we had with your staff in the
field in October 1990 and February 1991.  We are pleased to inform
you that the Bank has agreed to amend paragraph (b) of the Schedule
to the Project Agreement to read as follows:
      "contract with FELDA Mills Corporation for the construction
      and operation of the pal oil mill in accordance with
      arrangements satisfactory to the Bank."
      Kindly dispatch to us one copy of the Trafer and Operation
Agreeement between FELDA and FELMILL revised to reflect the above
amendment.
      Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by
signing the form of confirmation on the copy of this letter and
return it to us duly dated.  A copy of this letter is being sent to
Dr. Hadenan Abd. Jalil, Deputy Secretary, Treasury, and to the State
of Sabah, and another copy is enclosed for your records.
