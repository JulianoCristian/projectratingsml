The lessons\n            learned indicate that defining the subsidy level not only\n            describes the cost-effectiveness of a project but also\n            allows measuring the scale of necessary future intervention.\n            Politicization of project procedures should be minimized.\n            The project confirmed a deep necessity for the improvement\n            of extension services in Poland. Privately managed advisory\n            firms are more effective than state ones. Previous exposure\n            to similar interventions influences project progress.\n            Flexibility of a demand-driven approach has a positive\n            impact on project outcomes. Convincing farmers about the\n            necessity of certain technological solutions is possible\n            through displaying a demonstration farm on the local scale.\n            It would be beneficial to encourage farmers to gather in\n            groups to lower costs through joint tender procedures.\n            Gathering farmers into producers and equipment-using groups\n            is financially beneficial to them. Projects should consider\n            designing a mechanism to transfer the experience of the\n            project management into other body which may implement these\n            projects. Development of project specific MIS requires\n            allocation of significant resources."}, "docdt": "2004-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
