Ultimately, the project will\n            reduce discharge of organic matter, a major cause of\n            environmental problems in the Baltic Sea. Project activities\n            are directly linked to the implementation of the Baltic Sea\n            Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Program; and also\n            supports Poland's move towards compliance with its\n            national policies, European Union (EU) directives, and\n            international agreements. The project has two main\n            components. The first involves farm environmental\n            improvements and consists of specially-trained\n            agri-environmental advisors who will work with eligible\n            farmers to develop farm management plans. These plans will\n            consider options for cropping for, tilling, manure\n            spreading, fertilizer application practices, and constructed\n            wetlands, as well as investments such as manure storage\n            facilities, buffer strips, etc. The first component also\n            provides financial support for recommended farm investments.\n            The second component support public awareness programs,\n            project monitoring and management, a replication strategy,\n            and recurrent costs."}, "docdt": "1999-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
