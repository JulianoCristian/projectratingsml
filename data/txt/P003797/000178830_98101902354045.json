It\n            will provide for: (a) the installation of the second 400 MW\n            generating set (Unit No. 2) at Suralaya with coal handling\n            and ash disposal facilities for Unit No. 1 and Unit No. 2;\n            (b) the construction of the 500 kV transmission lines from\n            Suralaya to Semarang with 500 kV substations at Suralaya,\n            Jakarta, Bandung and Semarang; (c) the provision of a\n            simulator at Suralaya for the training of the operating\n            staff; (d) the establishment of a Java system control center\n            at Jakarta; and (e) the consulting services including\n            training. No engineering risk is foreseen in the type of\n            work involved in the project. Delays in land acquisition may\n            occur. However, appropriate measures have been included in\n            the project to prevent them. There is a possibility that\n            coal may not be available from the Bukit Asam by the\n            expected commission date of the Suralaya station, in which\n            case it will be necessary to use fuel oil in the plant and\n            the project has been designed to permit it."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
