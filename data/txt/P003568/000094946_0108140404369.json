high. Performances by\n            the Bank, and Borrower are similarly rated as satisfactory,\n            and highly satisfactory, respectively. Lessons focus on the\n            competency of the Tianjin implementing agencies, which\n            delivered high quality, and speed of physical construction\n            components, therefore, the high economic rates of return in\n            the area, are attributable to such efficient implementation.\n            Restructuring under the project, particularly that of the\n            public transport company, was mostly beneficial, in that it\n            encouraged a results-oriented approach, rather than\n            emphasizing on operational, and technical results alone.\n            Also, a flexible approach in project design, strong\n            government commitments, and the organizational competency of\n            implementing agencies are factors which minimize the\n            unexpected risks resulting from innovations in institutional\n            development. However, the difficulties experienced with the\n            introduction of improved planning, and management\n            techniques, convey the need for both capacity building, and\n            understanding of local conditions. This holds true for\n            procurement issues as well, exemplified by long delays,\n            particularly regarding the traffic signaling system's procurement."}, "docdt": "2001-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
