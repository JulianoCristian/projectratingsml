F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Program Development Objective was to help the Province of Catamarca to reform
and restructure its government so as to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery of
public services within fiscally sound policies.
  Specific objectives within each of the policy areas were:
  a. Public Finance and Administration: (i) Improving tax collection and administration
to promote higher reliance on own-source revenues and increased accountability; (ii)
reforming civil service, including reduction in the wage bill and redundant personnel;
improved training and compensation; controls to lower absenteeism and overpayments;
and, (iii) rationalizing public expenditures and prioritizing government spending, with
emphasis on privatization and outsourcing to improve the reliability and quality of public
services.
  b. Education Reform: (i) Increasing low student/teacher ratios; (ii) reducing
disproportionate use of temporary and substitute education personnel; (iii) improving the
incentive for quality improvements; (iv) enhancing private sector participation; and (v)
reducing administrative costs.
  c. Health Reform: (i). Extending coverage to the uninsured poor; (ii) ensuring the
financial viability of the provincial health insurance carrier; (iii) reallocating resources to
non-personnel spending; (iv) promoting essential public health services; (v) promoting
hospital autonomy (vi) and implementing quality assurance systems.
  Key Indicators were not explicitly defined during appraisal; instead they were
embedded in the Policy Matrix and Letter of Development Policy (see Annex 9). The
Bank and provincial authorities reached an agreement on a detailed set of Key
Performance Indicators (including both impact/outcome and output indicators) by
December 2001 (see Project Status Report, Dec. 2001). Impact indicators were designed
to meticulously measure sector performance in the various policy areas, including, among
many others, the percentage of roads in bad condition, savings resulting from class
consolidation, improvements in repetition and desertion rates, and improvements in intra-
hospital rates of infection. Unfortunately, the corresponding baselines and targets were
never finalized, as their development was halted by the December 2001 economic
collapse. Instead, a more succinct set of impact indicators was adopted. Output indicators
reflected the policy conditionalities included in the Policy Matrix

Revised Program Development Objectives (if any, as approved by original approving
authority)
PDO were not revised during implementation. However, output indicators, which
relfected the operation's policy conditionalities, were tacitly modified in June 2003, when
a number of loan conditions corresponding to the second and third tranche disbursements
were amended as part of the operation's overall restructuring (see Section 1.6)

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal:

Following the flight of private capital flows to emerging markets in 1998 as a result of the Asian
and Russian crises, and the devaluation of the Brazilian Real in early 1999, Argentina's economy
slipped into recession, as evidenced by negative growth rates and a sharp deterioration of social
indicators experienced from 1999 onward. As a result of the prolonged economic downturn
combined with weak fiscal discipline during a national election year, Argentina's fiscal program
went astray in 1999, resulting in a fiscal deficit of approximately 4.1 percent of GDP, 37 percent
of which was generated by provincial governments. In 2000, the incoming De la Rúa
administration initiated a set of economic reforms in an attempt to revitalize economic activity
and boost the confidence of foreign and domestic investors. In addition, the government
negotiated a three-year US$7.4 billion stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) that included a deficit target for the national government as well as a consolidated deficit
target for provincial governments. The Bank was asked to assist the larger provinces in meeting
these deficit targets and to support second generation reforms at the provincial level, focusing
mainly on health and education spending. The Bank and the government agreed to replicate the
model piloted by the Second Provincial Reform Loans (PRL-II) in Tucumán, Salta, San Juan and
Río Negro. These operations sought to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery of public social
services within fiscally sound policies by providing support to three pillars of the provinces'
reform program: public finance, education, and health. Catamarca, a small and poor province in
Argentina's Northwest region, was selected to be the first province in this new phase. The choice
of Catamarca was based on its track record of reform from the mid-1990's onward, its pressing
needs to enhance the efficiency and quality of social sector spending, and the potentially strong
demonstration effect it could have on other provinces given its historical reputation as a poorly-
run province.

Approved in September 2000, Catamarca's PRL was consistent with the objectives of the Joint
IBRD-IFC Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering FY 2001-2004 (Report No. 20354-AR,
dated September 8, 2000), which was discussed by the Executive Directors on June 27, 2000,
shortly after the new administration had taken office. Specifically, the 2001-2004 CAS identified
the need to: (i) enhance social development, including poverty alleviation and human resource
development; (ii) improve the performance of the state, particularly at the sub-national level; and
(iii) consolidate structural reforms. Together with continuing support for reform in revenue-
sharing, individual provincial reform programs were identified as the main pillars of the Bank's
continued support for provincial reform in Argentina. Likewise, the operation reflected the
recommendations from OED's Country Assistance Evaluation (July 2000), which emphasized the
need to concentrate lending on social sectors and provincial reform, without neglecting the reform
of federal institutions. As discussed in the Board Paper (R96-55) approved in April 1996, the
fiscal justification for sub-national reform lending rested on the link between fiscal deficits and
pressures on the current account of the balance of payments, as provincial fiscal deficits increased
country risks and added to Argentina's vulnerability to external shocks. In addition, provinces
were considered a an important focal point for achieving development objectives in social
development, as they accounted for almost all public spending in health and education, as well as
being responsible for providing basic infrastructure services (pp. 15-18, FY 2001-2004 CAS).

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

The Program Development Objective was to help the Province of Catamarca to reform and
restructure its government so as to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery of public services
within fiscally sound policies.

Specific objectives within each of the policy areas were:

a. Public Finance and Administration: (i) Improving tax collection and administration to promote
higher reliance on own-source revenues and increased accountability; (ii) reforming civil service,
including reduction in the wage bill and redundant personnel; improved training and
compensation; controls to lower absenteeism and overpayments; and (iii) rationalizing public
expenditures and prioritizing government spending, with emphasis on privatization and
outsourcing to improve the reliability and quality of public services.

b. Education Reform: (i) Increasing low student/teacher ratios; (ii) reducing disproportionate use
of temporary and substitute education personnel; (iii) improving the incentive for quality
improvements; (iv) enhancing private sector participation; and (v) reducing administrative costs.

c. Health Reform: (i) Extending coverage to the uninsured poor; (ii) ensuring the financial
viability of the provincial health insurance carrier; (iii) reallocating resources to non-personnel
spending; (iv) promoting essential public health services; (v) promoting hospital autonomy; and
(vi) implementing quality assurance systems.

Key Indicators were not explicitly defined during appraisal; instead they were embedded in the
Policy Matrix and Letter of Development Policy. The Bank and provincial authorities reached an
agreement on a detailed set of Key Performance Indicators (including both impact/outcome and
output indicators) by December 2001 (see Project Status Report, Dec. 2001). Impact indicators
were designed to meticulously measure sector performance in the various policy areas, including,
among many others, the percentage of roads in bad condition, savings resulting from class
consolidation, improvements in repetition and desertion rates, and improvements in intra-hospital
rates of infection. Unfortunately, the corresponding baselines and targets were never finalized, as
their development was halted by the December 2001 economic collapse. Instead, a more succinct
set of impact indicators was adopted. Output indicators reflected the policy conditionalities
included in the Policy Matrix.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification:

PDO were not revised during implementation. However, output indicators, which reflected the
operation's policy conditionalities, were de facto modified in August 2003, when a number of
loan conditions corresponding to the second and third tranche disbursements were amended as
part of the operation's overall restructuring (see Section 1.6).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

Catamarca's Provincial Reform Loan (PRL) provided support to the province's own reform
program in three policy areas: (i) public finance and administration; (ii) education reform; and
(iii) health reform. The specific objectives within each of the policy areas were as follows:




                                                   2

Public Finance and Administration: Traditionally, Catamarca's fiscal performance had been weak,
with inadequate management and controls, and high current expenditures stemming from the
large-scale incorporation of workers into the public sector. The longstanding problems with fiscal
management translated to high levels of indebtedness, inefficiencies in spending, and low quality
of public services. However, from the mid-1990s onwards, Catamarca demonstrated a
commitment toward public sector reform and improved fiscal responsibility. After faltering
somewhat toward the end of 1999, the commitment toward reform and fiscal responsibility was
renewed and deepened in early 2000, as incoming provincial authorities correctly diagnosed the
need to strengthen fiscal adjustment in the face of the ongoing deterioration of macroeconomic
conditions. Emergency measures were adopted, including a ten percent reduction in public
salaries and the freezing of automatic salary increases for years of service. With the support of the
PRL, the government also undertook several actions aimed at reaching a sustainable fiscal
situation, with a focus on:

· Strengthening public finances, including conducting a resources and expenditure review
    program and reaching specific fiscal targets in terms of primary balance, overall balance,
    personnel expenditures and debt stock.
· Enhancing the mobilization of own-source revenue by eliminating distortions in local taxes
    and increasing property tax revenues.
· Enhancing human resources management by establishing a retrenching program for
    redundant personnel and implementing a merit-based salary scale.
· Rationalizing public investments by: (i) privatizing and concessioning the provincial bank and
    the water company, respectively, which had traditionally drained provincial resources without
    fulfilling their missions effectively; and (ii) reforming the Provincial Road Directorate
    (Dirección Provincial de Vialidad ­ DPV), including a strategy to modernize its
    administration, enhance its road improvement and maintenance programs, and piloting the
    use of rehabilitation and maintenance contracts (Contrato de Recuperación y Mantenimiento
    - CREMA contracts) that introduced private sector participation in road maintenance.

Education Reform: Catamarca had one of the country's highest unitary cost (expenses per
student), which was only partially explained by the need to service a dispersed population. In
contrast, the quality of education in Catamarca was the lowest in the country based on the 1998
national evaluations. Likewise, the levels of school attendance, grade repetition and absenteeism
in Catamarca were significantly poorer than the national averages. To address these shortcomings,
the specific actions supported under the program focused on:

· Rationalizing education expenditures by limiting the share of personnel expenditures,
    increasing the student/teacher ratios, reducing the disproportionate use of temporary and
    substitute education personnel, decentralizing administration of own resources at the school
    level, and reducing the number of teaching training institutes.
· Improving quality by establishing performance-based incentives in teacher's pay and the
    allocation of school bonuses, and implementing strategies to boost retention and target the
    performance of poorly performing groups.
· Enhancing equity and private sector participation by allocating public subsidies among
    private schools based on objective criteria related to quality of education and characteristics
    of the student population--e.g., number, socio-economic status.

Health Reform: In 1999 Catamarca's spending on public health was at par with the national
average at about US$300 per capita. However, health indicators were poor. The child mortality
rate in 1995 was 26.1 per 1000 births, well above the national average of 22 per 1000, with high



                                                 3

rates of birth and teenage pregnancies, as well as high prenatal mortality. The program supported
several actions aimed at improving Catamarca's health system, focusing on:

· Rationalizing health expenditures by reallocating resources to non-personnel spending,
    increasing spending in essential public health services such as immunizations, child and
    school health programs, and prevention and control of communicable diseases.
· Restructuring public health delivery by promoting hospital financial autonomy through cost-
    recovery mechanisms, enhancing quality of services, and extending coverage to the uninsured
    poor.
· Ensuring the financial viability of the provincial health insurance carrier (Obra Social de los
    Empleados Provinciales - OSEP) by implementing automatic deductions of state and
    municipal employees, and attaining operational balance.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

N.A.

1.6 Other significant changes:

Restructuring: By restructuring the operation in August 2003, the Bank sought to address the
profound changes that followed the economic collapse of December 2001, while preserving the
overall objectives of the loan. The decision to restructure the operation instead of canceling the
two undisbursed tranches was based on Catamarca's solid fiscal management, even in the face of
crisis, and the substantial progress it had made in the implementation of the reforms in the areas
of public finances and administration, and health. Restructuring provided the opportunity to
reframe the province's program in a manner that was feasible given the macroeconomic
uncertainties without deviating from the operation's original development objectives.

Although Catamarca was able to maintain a fiscal program consistent with the original fiscal
conditionalities, fiscal stringency together with rising social pressures prevented the province
from fully pursuing all the reforms at the pace originally envisioned. Overall, a total of 16 out of
42 conditions were amended--seven and nine conditions corresponding to the second and third
tranches, respectively. The majority of the amendments were related to education (i.e., nine
conditions), reflecting the difficulties experienced in carrying out the reforms in this sector. The
amended conditionalities in the education sector scaled back the original outcomes, while the
amendments in the other two policy areas constituted adjustments needed to reflect the post-2001
conditions that did not significantly affect the operation's original key outcomes (see Tables 7.1
and 7.2, Annex 7 for individual amendments and overall impact of the restructuring, respectively).
By restructuring the operation as opposed to canceling it, the Bank offered the province its
support as well as substantial incentives to continue with the implementation of the critical set of
reforms supported by the operation despite the heightened fiscal and social pressure.

Cancellation: The current Argentina CAS, which was discussed by the Board in June 2006,
proposes a US$3.3 billion lending program that, at the request of the authorities, is made up
exclusively of investment operations. In this context, in agreement with the government, the three
provincial reform loans, including Catamarca's PRL, which were approved prior to the 2004-
2005 CAS, were closed on March 31, 2006, and undisbursed tranches totaling US$226 million
were cancelled. These loans are envisaged to be replaced with new investment operations in the
provinces concerned, including a US$25 million provincial investment project in Catamarca (pp.
44, 49, CY 2006-2008 CAS).

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Following the Board's approval in September 2000, there was rapid progress in the
implementation of various reforms, reflecting the strong commitment on the part of the provincial
authorities, the thoroughness of the preparation process, and the overall effectiveness of the PRL
model. However, the initial momentum was caught short by the rapid deterioration in Argentina's
macroeconomic conditions that ultimately led to a full-blown economic and political crisis in
December 2001. In face of the ensuing economic and institutional chaos, provincial authorities
turned their attention to crisis management and many reforms were postponed due to lack of
adequate fiscal resources and mounting social tensions. In 2003, Argentina began to emerge from
the depth of the crisis. Economic growth rebounded, reaching 8.8 percent growth in GDP in 2003,
as a result of the country's improved competitiveness due to the currency depreciation of 2002,
favorable international market and financial conditions, and sound fiscal management. Given
Catamarca's sound fiscal management, both before and during the crisis, and its continued
progress in the implementation of its health and fiscal and public administration reforms, even
throughout the difficult 2001-2002 period, the PRL was given a new lease on life in August 2003,
when it was restructured to adapt its policy conditionalities to the post-crisis environment. The
restructured second tranche amounting to US$20 million was disbursed in September 2003.
Although the US$25 million third tranche was cancelled in March 2006, Catamarca continued to
make progress in the areas of public finances and administration, as well as health reforms.
Education reforms, however, continued to lag behind (see Section 2.1, Tranche Release Binding
Conditions). The various aspects affecting implementation can be summarized as follows:

Strong Borrower's Commitment at the Provincial Level: The operation benefited from strong
commitment on the part of provincial authorities. The newly elected governor was closely
involved in preparation activities and tailored his key cabinet positions in health and education to
the requirements of the program--for example, the Minister of Finance of the outgoing
administration was appointed Minister of Education. The governor also enjoyed the support of the
legislature, where his political party held a majority. The policy actions supported by the
operation reflected the province's own reform program as outlined in its Letter of Development
Policy (August 22, 2000), thus enhancing the province's ownership of the operation. Catamarca's
reform program also benefited from its political continuity, as it built upon the Participatory
Development Program (Plan Estratégico Consensuado, December 1996) that had been developed
by the previous administration. To a lesser degree, such political continuity remained even after
the departure on the administration sponsoring the PRL-supported program, which ensured some
level of support of the actions supported by the operation--i.e., the Minister of Finance and his
team, who had been key actors in the conception and implementation of the reform program
remained in their posts until January 2006, two years into the new administration.

Uneven Support from the National Government: The PRL program was designed to support
reform efforts in selected provinces in a manner consistent with national sector policy. Indeed, in
many cases national government saw the reforms efforts spearheaded by provincial governments
as cutting-edge, and hoped they would have a demonstration effect on more hesitant provincial
governments. As such, the reform programs were vetted by the national ministries and, in some
cases, with promises of technical assistance and political support. This was particularly case in
Catamarca's education program, as a new reformist national minister was prepared to help the
ambitious program put together by the province. With the change in the national administration in
late 2001, such support was less forthcoming. Conversely, the health minister appointed at the
national level by the post-2001 administration proved to be an even stronger supporter of the
reforms that were being pursed at the provincial level. It is also important to note that the
devaluation had an adverse impact in those provinces engaged in reform and investment


                                                 7

operations with the World Bank and IADB vis-à-vis those provinces who had borrowed from
commercial banks. Specifically, the provinces that had borrowed from development banks saw
the burden of IFI (International Financial Institution) loans tripled overnight, as the loans had
been passed on them in U.S. dollars and they had to bear the exchange risk.

Thorough Preparation Process: The Bank dedicated a significant amount of resources to the
preparation of this operation, which resulted in technical soundness of the policy actions it
supported. Specifically:

· Internal consistency with the Bank's overall strategy: As mentioned above, the operation
    reflected the objectives of the overall Bank's strategy as outlined in FY 2001-2004 and
    OED's Country Assistance Evaluation (July 2000).
· Synergies with other sector operations: The Bank's team effectively capitalized on the
    experience and know-how developed by national-level sector operations, including PRISE,
    the Secondary Education Decentralization Project (PRODYMES-I) in education reforms, the
    National Program for Maternal and Child Nutrition and Health Project (PROMIN), the
    Provincial Health Development Project (PRESSAL) and the Health Insurance Reform and
    Technical Assistance Projects in health reforms, the Water Sector Reform and the Provincial
    Roads Projects for water and transport sectors, and the Second Provincial Development
    (PDP-II) and the Provincial Bank Privatization Loan in public sector reform.
· Technical soundness: A series of sector studies was conducted as part of the preparation,
    including expenditure reviews in the health and education sectors, the characteristics of
    municipal governments, and assessments of the province's roads program, contracting
    procedures, the structure of the water sector, and tax administration. These studies, which
    involved the main actors within each sector, contributed to enhancing the technical soundness
    of the province's reform program and expanding its support by key actors.
· Sensitivity toward gender issues: A gender assessment was conducted as part of loan
    preparation, which concluded that the reforms supported by the operation could potentially
    have important effects on reducing inter-gender disparities in accessing social services (both
    health and education), as well as enhancing professional opportunities for achieving gender
    equity in public sector management.
· Participatory process: Building upon the participatory approach of the 1995 Provincial
    Development Program, the Bank's team and provincial authorities gave particular importance
    to public input during the design process, which significantly enhanced the legitimacy of the
    reform program. Results from a social assessment, which included a survey of the general
    population and focus groups with the major stakeholders, indicated that the program
    objectives resonated within civil society. In addition, the Bank held a public forum in
    Catamarca to discuss the Bank's diagnosis of the fiscal situation and social services in the
    province and present the program being supported under the PRL. The forum, which was
    attended by the Bank's country director and major stakeholders, was followed by a press
    conference that received ample media coverage.

Operation's Design: Overall, the operation effectively built upon the PRL model and effectively
incorporated the lessons learned during the pilot PRL-II operations. However, policy
conditionalities were overly complex and, in the education sector, the technical experience
required for their successful implementation was lacking. Specifically, the strengths and
weaknesses of the operation's design can be summarized as follows:

· Effectiveness of the PRL model: The operation replicated the PRL model previously piloted
    under the four preceding PRL-II operations. Actors at all levels, including national and
    provincial authorities and professional staff, as well as the Bank's task managers and sector


                                                 8

    specialists, noted the particular strengths of the PRL's cross-sector approach to public sector
    reform, which simultaneously addressed the need to enhance efficiency and service delivery
    in the social sectors while maintaining a sustainable fiscal framework, thus, enhancing the
    medium- and long-term sustainability of the development process. Likewise, by lending
    directly to provincial governments, operations such as Catamarca's PRL can tailor policy
    actions to the specific needs of the provinces, as well as coordinate at the provincial level the
    various sector operations being sponsored at the national level.
· Incorporation of lessons learned: Catamarca's PRL effectively incorporated the lessons
    learned from the previous four PRL-II loans, including, among others: (i) the need to ensure
    the appropriate sequencing of social sector reforms, thus selecting provinces such as
    Catamarca that have already achieved a level of control in their fiscal and debt situations; (ii)
    the need to extend the life of the operation beyond 12 to 18 months to adapt more realistically
    to the time needed to implement reforms and show initial results; (iii) the need to have broad
    political support for the reform program, including not only the executive power and
    legislative branch, but also larger civil society; (iv) the benefits from including social
    assessment and participatory mechanisms as a part of the project's preparation to help ensure
    the implementation and sustainability of reforms; (v) the importance of capitalizing on
    ongoing sector operations to provide the needed know-how to implement sector reforms; and
    (vi) ensuring that most legislation required for the program, including those involving
    privatization and hospital decentralization, were already in place.
· Excessive complexity of the policy conditionalities: The Policy Matrix was too complex, with
    a total of 20 and 22 conditions for the second and third tranches, respectively. Moreover,
    these conditions did not exhibit a clear hierarchy, as key policy actions (such as the
    liquidation of the provincial bank and concessioning of the water company) and agreed
    performance targets (such as attaining fiscal balance) had the same weight as technical inputs
    (such as conducting studies on specific topics or adopting action plans). This complexity
    made it more difficult to focus on central issues, particularly as the implementation
    environment itself grew more complex. The elimination of those policy conditions related to
    technical inputs (such as adopting action plans) would have helped streamline the Policy
    Matrix.
· Lack of technical feasibility of the education reforms: In hindsight, the education reforms
    were too ambitious, from both a political and technical standpoint. Politically, the teachers'
    unions effectively capitalized on the fragility of the political environment in the 2001-2002
    period to pose resistance to the proposed reforms aimed at enhancing accountability.
    Provincial authorities anticipated strong technical support from the national government in
    the implementation of their education reforms, given their conceptual alignment; however,
    this support failed to materialize.

Risk Assessment: At appraisal, the Bank's team correctly identified the main risks affecting the
operation and put in place measures to minimize their impact. Key risk factors included the
deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the potential erosion of political commitment,
and the reversibility of some of the reforms in the case of political changes. To minimize these
risks, the program was designed to be fully implemented during the earlier years of the provincial
administration's four-year term. While the political commitment of provincial authorities was
considered to be strong, the program included key upfront actions such as the passage of a law
supporting the privatization or liquidation of the provincial bank, to further demonstrate their
resolve. The program also required legislation to support the policy changes, thus substantially
reducing the risk of reversal.

Although at the time of appraisal it was expected that the measures taken by the De la Rúa
administration would succeed in averting a major economic crisis, in retrospect it is now clear


                                                  9

that the risk of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions was underestimated by the markets,
governments, and international financial institutions.

Economic and Political Collapse 2001-2002: When the project was eventually declared effective
after several months of delays, mainly as a result of a succession of Ministers of Economy at the
national level, the economic, the political and social situation was deteriorating rapidly. By the
end of the year, capital flight led to the imposition of banking controls, a policy that proved
highly unpopular and the cause of massive protests. In December 2001, President De la Rúa
resigned and was succeeded by several interim presidents in the month after his resignation until
President Duhalde was appointed by the national congress to complete the existing presidential
term through May 2003. During the interim presidencies, the parity between the peso and the
dollar was abandoned, and the government announced that it would not service its external debt
(except for that with the IFIs). Meanwhile, the country continued to sink into a deeper recession,
with GDP falling by 11 percent in 2002. The social costs of the crisis were profound, with
poverty gripping more than 50 percent of the population by July 2002.

While Catamarca was better prepared than other provinces, managing the effects of the country's
economic and political debacle absorbed the full attention of provincial authorities. Despite the
initial momentum, progress on various fronts, such as the implementation of a merit-based pay
scale for public employees and the implementation of the road maintenance program, had to be
postponed due to lack of financial resources. At the same time, the 2001 crisis severely affected
the legitimacy of government, resulting in the evaporation of much political capital. Thus,
reforms that were met with significant opposition, such as the ones in the education sector, lost
momentum. Given the highly unfavorable implementation environment, the achievements of
Catamarca's PRL and the sustained support of the provincial authorities for its reform program
are particularly noteworthy.

Post-Crisis Economic Environment: Despite the very difficult macroeconomic context, the
federal and provincial governments took extraordinary measures to contain the fiscal situation
during 2002, which led to the eventual stabilization of federal-provincial fiscal relations. The
national government entered into bilateral agreements (Programa de Financiamiento Ordenado
de las Finanzas Provinciales - PFO) with 17 of the 24 provinces, including Catamarca, agreeing
to support debt restructuring and servicing in exchange for the provinces meeting specific fiscal
and debt targets. The government also agreed on a transition program with the IMF, covering the
period January through August 2003. In view of the more promising macroeconomic prospects,
the original closing date of March 2003 was extended to December 2003 to allow for the
operation's restructuring, which was completed in August 2003 and the second tranche was
disbursed in September of the same year. After two additional extensions, the operation was
finally closed on March 31, 2006. The US$25million corresponding to the third tranche were
cancelled, due to lack of progress toward some of the policy conditions--mainly in the education
sector--as well as continuing uncertainties in the country's macro framework over the medium
term, including concerns regarding the lack of engagement on the part of national authorities on
structural issues affecting investment climate and private sector participation. As noted below
under lessons learned, the experience of Catamarca's PRL shows that failings or uncertainties at
the macro level that are beyond the sphere of influence of provincial governments can override
substantial achievements at the provincial level.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a)      M&E Design: As mentioned earlier, the design of the monitoring and evaluation
indicators was not fully developed at appraisal, particularly in terms of the operation's overall
impact. However, the Policy Matrix effectively operationalized the major aspects of Catamarca's
reform strategy and the main project outputs associated with the operation. To bring the operation
to current design standards, a logical framework was subsequently retrofitted in July 2005, which
has been partly used to measure impact as part of this ICR. However, as with the set of impact
indicators developed in 2001, baseline values were not identified and the Borrower was not made
responsible for reporting them, which severely limited their usefulness.

(b)      M&E Implementation: As noted earlier, implementation was severely disrupted by the
2001-2002 economic crisis, which also affected the continuity and fluidity of supervision efforts
during that period (it is important to note, however, that PSRs were still completed periodically).
Full-fledged supervision efforts resumed in early 2003 to determine the viability of restructuring
the operation and assess the progress made toward the accomplishment of second tranche policy
conditions. During supervision, the Policy Matrix and the corresponding sections in the legal
agreement (Schedules 3 and 4) functioned as the main de facto M&E tool for the operation given
that lack of other predetermined indicators.

(c)      M&E Utilization: Particularly noteworthy are the performance contracts between public
hospitals and the province, which constituted a particular useful M&E tool designed as part of the
health component. Specifically, these contracts clearly specify performance targets on an annual
basis, which are formally agreed by the hospital directors and the Ministry of Health. These
performance contracts have been very useful in monitoring progress and assessing the impact of
the reforms implemented in individual hospitals. Their effectiveness is attested by the fact that the
new Minister of Health has adopted them for all public hospitals within the province, although
under PRL conditionality they were only required for the two main hospitals. Likewise, the
director of the San Juan Bautista Hospital, who became familiar with performance contract under
the PRL, has adopted them to define agreed performance targets with each of the service areas
within the hospital.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The current CAS reflects a significant shift from development policy lending to an investment-led
strategy. As a result, policy-based operations like Catamarca's PRL are not envisioned in the near
future despite a potentially substantial demand at the provincial level. Nevertheless, there are
several operations within the current CAS that can support Catamarca's efforts to further
strengthen public sector management and the delivery of basic infrastructure and social services.
Specifically, the Sub-National Governments Modernization Loan (Loan No. 7352-AR, approved
December 2005) is designed to support provincial governments in their efforts to improve their
institutional capabilities, and those of their municipalities, to effectively manage their resources
and improve the quality of public services. Based on a set of eligibility conditions designed to
gauge progress in the core areas of public sector management--i.e., financial administration, tax
administration, cadastres, and property registries--provincial governments can participate in a
Basic Module to complete and consolidate the modernization of these core areas and, those that
are more advanced in their modernization efforts, can also participate in the Advanced Module to
focus on the modernization of other areas in their provincial or municipal administrations. While
Catamarca could potentially be eligible to participate in this operation to continue the public
management reforms started under the PRL, the province has not yet expressed an explicit
interest.


                                                 11

In the health sector, Catamarca is currently participating in the ongoing Maternal-Child Health
Insurance APL (Loan No. 7225-AR; approved October 2003), which supports the implementation
of the country's flagship maternal-child health program (Plan Nacer) in the nine poorest
provinces. The Plan Nacer constitutes a direct follow-up of the reforms initiated under the PRL,
including establishing a health insurance program for uninsured and linking it to cost recovery
mechanims. The province could also be potentially eligible to participate in the Essential Health
Services Program (Loan No. 7412-AR; approved November 2006), which will replicate the
incentive and governance structures introduced under the Plan Nacer in public health functions at
the provincial level, including vaccination, as well as implementation of provincial health
prevention and promotion activities for HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, and health monitoring. In
the education sector, Catamarca is currently participating in the ongoing Rural Education
Improvement Project (Loan No. 7353-AR, approved December 2005), which aims to increase
school attendance among children in rural areas.

Sector operations focusing on basic infrastructure include Catamarca's Provincial Investment
project, which is expected to focus on upgrading water supply, irrigation, and water resources
management in the province. To deepen the actions taken to modernize Catamarca's DVP under
the PRL, the province is eligible to participate in a technical assistance component that is part of
the recently approved Provincial Roads Infrastructure Project (Loan No. 7301-AR, approved June
2005), which aims to support the use of CREMA contracts in participating provinces and
strengthen the provincial road agencies. Another opportunity to carry out further reforms in the
road sector with the Bank's support will open in FY 2009, with the Provincial Roads III Project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities,
and Bank assistance strategy):

As a result of the uncertainties regarding the medium-term macroeconomic framework, together
with the Bank's limited dialogue with the national government in key policy areas, the current
CAS does not include policy-based lending operations. Consequently, policy-based lending
operations directed at provincial governments such as Catamarca's PRL are not included in the
CY 2006-2008 CAS. However, the objectives of this operation are still consistent with those
established under the current as well as the 2004-2005 CAS. Specifically, by focusing on
advancing reforms in the social sectors while maintaining fiscal responsibility, Catamarca's PRL
is fully consistent with the current CAS objectives of promoting sustained growth with equity,
social inclusion, and improved governance (p. 30, CY 2006-2008 CAS).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between policy actions supported by operations and outcomes):

In retrospect, the macroeconomic framework that existed at the time of Board approval proved to
be unsustainable in light of the traumatic events of late 2001 and the first half of 2002. In
particular, the vulnerability of the economy to the volatility of private capital flows and the
imbalance in relative factor prices seem to have been underestimated. Also, in retrospect, the debt
situation at the national level turned out to be more one of insolvency than illiquidity, as believed
at the time the international financing package was put together. As a result, despite Catamarca's
fiscal adjustment during 2000 and 2001, the operation's general objective of supporting macro
stability and, implicitly, the convertibility of the exchange rate was not met. However, with its




                                                  12

emphasis on fiscal responsibility, Catamarca's PRL has contributed to restoring macroeconomic
stability during the post-crisis period.

The operation has partially met its specific development objective of promoting an efficient and
responsive delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies. With the support of the PRL,
Catamarca succeeded in advancing critical reforms in the health sector, ensuring a more efficient
and responsive delivery of health services. Likewise, the province has succeeded in enhancing
the quality of its public expenditures, increasing the relative share of non-salary expenditures for
the province as a whole and within the education and health sectors. It has also eliminated
contingent liabilities by liquidating the provincial bank and concessioning the water company.
These accomplishments have been done in the framework of fiscally sound policies and despite
the economic, political and social upheaval that ensued after the 2001 crisis. In the education
sector, accomplishments are more modest, as strong interest groups--including teacher's unions
and private schools--effectively blocked critical reforms such as those aimed at introducing
performance-based criteria in salaries and the allocation of resources among public and private
schools. Achievements under the various policy areas can be summarized as follows:

Public Finances: Satisfactory Performance. Catamarca was one of the few provinces that took
preemptive fiscal measures to respond to the deterioration of macroeconomic conditions in early
2000, almost two years before the crisis of 2001. With the full support of the incoming governor,
the new economic team adopted strict adjustment measures aimed at reducing provincial
expenditures, obtaining legislative approval for an Emergency Salary Law that included a ten
percent across-the-board reduction in salaries, and a set of complementary measures aimed at
improving efficiency and rationality in the use of public funds. The PRL was seen as a key
component of the overall reform strategy, which helped maintain focus on fiscal targets and other
key reforms.

As a result of its preventive adjustment and the actions taken under the PRL, Catamarca was
better prepared to weather the crisis than other provinces, succeeding in maintaining a solid fiscal
performance without major social and political disruptions, and meeting its payroll obligations on
time even at the worst of the crisis. The province was able to meet the second tranche condition
calling for a current account surplus and, although the third tranche was cancelled, it would have
met the corresponding fiscal targets including overall balance, personnel expenditures and
property tax revenues. In 2005, the province met its performance targets under the national Fiscal
Responsibility Law (Ley Federal de Responsabilidad Fiscal; Law No. 25.917), which sets
general rules in terms of fiscal performance and public debt sustainability for the Argentinean
public sector, including the provincial governments.

  The accomplishment of the specific objectives under public finances and administration can be
  summarized as follows:

  · Fiscal Performance: Accomplished. Catamarca's fiscal performance has been remarkable,
       even in the face of the economic crisis. The province met all but one of the original fiscal
       targets agreed under the PRL. Specifically, it has maintained a current account surplus from
       2002 onward, equivalent to roughly 25 percent of current revenues in 2005. Likewise, it has
       maintained an overall fiscal surplus from 2003 onwards, equivalent to 6.9 percent of current
       revenues in 2005. In addition, personnel expenditures represented roughly 40 percent of
       current revenues in 2005, well below the specified PRL target of 56 percent. With regard to
       personnel expenditures, a word of caution is appropriate, as personnel expenditures increased
       by 38 percent between 2004 and 2005 and further salary increases have been granted in 2006.
       The third-tranche condition requiring that the stock of debt be equal to or less than 99 percent
       of total revenues was the only original target that was not met, as in 2005 Catamarca's stock
       of debt represented 119 percent of current revenues. However, the province met the targets
       agreed with the national government under the PFO, thus meeting the third-tranche condition
       as amended. Moreover, despite the devaluation of the peso in early 2002, Catamarca's debt
       stock in U.S. dollars increased by a factor of only 1.07 between 1999 and 2005, compared to
       1.5 for the provinces as a whole, reflecting the province's sound financial management before,
       during, and after the crisis.
  · Improved tax collection and administration: Accomplished. As a small and relatively poor
       province, Catamarca is heavily dependent on automatic transfers from the national
       government and can improve its fiscal performance through local revenue mobilization only
       marginally. However, with the support of the PRL, the province has taken steps to eliminate
       economic distortions from local taxes and excessive administrative burdens on local firms by


                                                           14

  simplifying the tax regime for small and medium firms through Law No. 4.994 and its
  subsequent modifications (Laws No. 5.022 and 5.024). In addition, Catamarca has made
  substantial efforts to enhance the administration of its property taxes. Taking advantage of the
  cadastre system implemented under the PDP-I and II, Catamarca has increased property tax
  revenues by 85 percent between 1999 and 2005, compared to an average 42 percent for all
  provinces (see Table 1). Monthly revenues averaged Arg$710,000 between January and July
  2006, equivalent to a 240 percent increase relative to 1997 (almost ten times as much as
  required by the third tranche condition that required a 25 percent increase with respect to
  1997). In terms of its overall fiscal effort, Catamarca has increased its overall tax revenues by
  224 percent between 1999 and 2005, at about the same rate as the average for all provinces
  (223.5 percent). In terms of discretionary transfers, Catamarca receives roughly a third of the
  average for all provinces.
· Enhanced civil service: Accomplished as amended. The PRL supported the province in its
  efforts to reduce the wage bill, eliminate redundant personnel, and introduce a merit-based
  compensation scheme. A voluntary retrenchment program was set in place but has not
  elicited a significant response on the part of provincial employees--only 167 employees
  chose to participate out of 27,000 provincial employees. In view of its poor results, the
  province has decided to terminate the program. An incentive-based system for salary
  increases, the Fund for Productivity-Based Incentives (Fondo Provincial de Productividad ­
  FIP) was set in place in June 2004 and has been used as a key instrument to channel a large
  proportion of salary increases granted in the provincial administration since the Emergency
  Salary Law was rescinded in 2003. In addition, the province succeeded in reducing its
  personnel expenditures as a proportion of current revenues. Specifically, Catamarca reduced
  the level of personnel expenditures as a proportion of current revenues by 17.4 percentage
  points (from 58.6 to 41.2 percent) between 1999 and 2005, compared to just 13 percentage
  points for all provinces (see Table 1). However, this ratio will not be maintained, as
  substantial salary increases have been granted during 2005 and 2006, which will not be fully
  reflected in the payroll until August 2006. Moreover, the province added over 5,000
  employees to its payroll in 2004, after maintaining the number of provincial employees stable
  since 2000. As a result, the number of provincial employees per 1,000 inhabitants increased
  from 74 to 81 between 1999 and 2004.
· Rationalization of public expenditures: Accomplished. Overall, Catamarca's level of
  investment in infrastructure has been traditionally higher than that of other provinces (12.5
  compared to 10.7 percent for the provinces as a whole in 1999). This difference has
  accentuated between 1999 and 2005, when Catamarca increased its investments in
  infrastructure by over 7 percent compared to less than 2 percent for the provinces as a whole
  (see Table 1). This higher level of investments translates, for example, to a larger proportion
  of the population having water connections (91 versus 71 percent for all provinces in 2005).
  While the number of sewerage connections is still lagging behind (30 versus 43 percent for
  all provinces in 2005), it increased at the same pace as in other provinces (7 percent) between
  1999 and 2005. The PRL supported Catamarca's efforts to prioritize government spending,
  with emphasis on the privatization of the provincial bank, the outsourcing of the water
  company and the modernization of the Provincial Road Directorate (Dirección Provincial de
  Vialidad ­ DVP).
   a) Provincial Bank: In accordance with the second and third tranche conditionalities, the
      province liquidated its provincial bank in December 2000, after no offers were presented
      for the purchase of its stock offered in an international public bid. In this way, the
      province has effectively eliminated a serious contingent liability, as the Bank had
      required periodic influxes of capital from the provincial treasury--equivalent to US$56
      million between 1992 and 1999.



                                                15

     b) Water Company: The province met all second-and third-tranche conditionalities related
        to the concession of the water company. A private concessionaire assumed full
        managerial and operational responsibility of the water and sewerage utility company
        servicing the capital and adjacent areas. Although the concession set off to a good start,
        the drastic change in the macroeconomic and social environment as a result of the 2001
        crisis made it infeasible to satisfy key conditions of the original concession contract, such
        as tariff increases and levels of investment. As a result, the province and company have
        jointly agreed to rescind the current contract. A new bid is expected to be offered in the
        next few months (see Section 4). In addition, a regulatory entity has been operational
        since 1995, when the electric company was first concessioned. The regulatory entity has
        generally fulfilled its responsibilities for the regulation of the electric and water
        companies. A subsidy for the poor has been in place since 2000, when the concession
        was first granted. Approximately 10,000 out the 50,000 water users currently receive
        subsidies amounting to 80 to 90 percent of their water bill, representing 11 percent of the
        total billing (facturación).
     c) Road Directorate: Under the PRL, Catamarca's DVP has taken some steps towards its
        modernization and enhanced performance. Specifically, it has accomplished all but one
        of the policy conditions corresponding to the second and third tranches. In accordance
        with the PRL, the DVP now prepares a multi-year plan for road maintenance and
        rehabilitation. As a result of two studies conducted under the PRL, the DVP is also
        relocating its maintenance workshop and studying options for providing fee-based
        services to other provincial agencies. Likewise, the environmental impact assessment
        department has been revamped and environmental guidelines and procedures are being
        reviewed. In addition, the province successfully concessioned the maintenance of 150 km
        of a gravel provincial road, which is currently under implementation. Awarding a
        CREMA contract was the only condition that was not met. Although the province sought
        twice to bid out the rehabilitation and maintenance of 130 km of provincial roads using
        the CREMA protocol, no offers were presented. The main reason was the relative
        unattractiveness of the work given its remote location and limited scale.

Education: Moderately Unsatisfactory Performance. Catamarca's performance in the education
sector is rated moderately unsatisfactory, as the actual achievements are below the levels
anticipated both at project design and at restructuring. Conceptually, the reforms were too
ambitious and, although they coincided with the policies being promoted at the national level at
the time, their implementation required a technical know-how and experience that surpassed the
province's institutional capacity. In addition, the opposition that they generated from the teachers'
unions was stronger than anticipated.

Despite the partial achievement of the province's reform program supported under the PRL,
Catamarca now ranks better than it did in 1998 in several indicators measuring education quality
and efficiency, such as illiteracy, repetition and promotion rates, and student/teacher ratios (see
Table 2). Unfortunately, the lack of data at the provincial level on standardized test scores (results
at the provincial level were last made public in 1999) prevents inter-year comparison of quality of
education for individual provinces. At the regional level, Catamarca is one of the provinces of the
Northwest Region (NOA), which ranks fourth out of five regions in both math and language
scores, indicating that the quality of education among the NOA provinces remains among the
lowest in the country.

      Accomplishment of the specific objectives in the education sector can be summarized as follows:

      · Increasing low student/teacher ratios: Partially accomplished. Under the PRL, the province
           intended to increase the student/teacher ratio to at least 20:1 at EGB I and II levels, and 10:1
           for EGB III and Polimodal levels. At restructuring, these targets were modified to 16:1 and
           9:1, respectively. The province successfully reached these targets in urban areas, as required
           by second-tranche conditions. Third-tranche conditionality would have been met only
           partially, as only the targets corresponding to EGB III and Polimodal levels were achieved
           for the province as a whole.
      · Reducing          disproportionate use of temporary and substitute education personnel:
           Accomplished. The PRL supported the tightening of teacher leave regulations and the
           implementation of an outsourced system for medical checks on sick leave. By mid-2003, the
           province had succeeded in reducing the share of salary expenditures for substitute teachers to
           only 3.6 percent of all salary expenditures in education, compared to 25 percent in 1998. A
           new control system for medical leaves was implemented under the PRL.
      · Modifying teachers' work rules (Estatuto Docente): Partially accomplished. With the
           support of the PRL, the province sought an ambitious reform of the Teacher's Statute that
           governs teacher pay and conditions of employment to include, among others, a teachers'
           salary scheme with incentives for quality, results and attendance, the selection of directors
           and teachers at the school level through a competitive system, the reformulation of the criteria
           allocating school bonuses based on educational risk and ability of individual schools to
           reverse drop-out, repetition rates, and the implementation of a decentralized supervision
           system. However, the conditions requiring the adoption of a new performance-based salary
           scheme and performance-based school bonuses were waived at restructuring due to strong
           opposition from teachers' unions. The main outcome was the passage of a law mandating that
           the designation of supervisors be based on competitions (concursos). While the competition
           was carried out in 2003, the process largely failed as a result of technical and political factors
           (for example, the competition called applicants to prepare an overly complex `supervision



                                                              17

     project' and was conducted only a couple of months before the inauguration of the new
     governor). Only a fraction of the supervision posts were granted based on the results of the
     competition (36 percent); however, those who were not selected but had been serving as
     supervisors until that time were reconfirmed in their posts. While the decree is still active, it
     is not clear whether it will be applied in the future.
· Reallocating resources to non-personnel spending: Accomplished. With the support of the
     PRL, salaries in the education budget grew at a slower pace than the education budget as a
     whole between 2002 and October 2005, when this condition was last supervised. The relative
     share of salaries has remained below 90 percent, introducing more flexibility in education
     expenditures. The hefty salary increases recently granted to teachers in Catamarca are likely
     to undo some of this flexibility.
· Improving the incentive for quality improvements: Accomplished. A decentralized
     management model was implemented in ten schools as a way to enhance accountability.
     Under the new model, schools are responsible for the administration of maintenance and
     other operating expenses.
· Enhancing private sector participation: Not accomplished. About 6.5 percent of the
     education budget is transferred to private schools as subsidies. The allocation of these funds,
     however, provides little incentive for improvements, as it is largely based on historical
     agreements and normally on the number of teachers employed. Second-tranche conditionality
     called for the passage of a law modifying the formula used to allocate these subsidies, basing
     it on objective criteria, including the number of students, their socioeconomic background,
     and the quality of schools. At restructuring, this condition was postponed for the third tranche.
     The law was never presented to the legislature.
· Reducing the number of teachers' institutes: Partially accomplished. Of the 26 institutes
     operating in 1995, the province reduced the number to 13, exceeding the second tranche
     target (14 teachers' institutes) but one short of the target corresponding to the third tranche
     conditionality (12).

Health Reforms: Satisfactory Performance. Under the PRL, Catamarca made substantial
progress in the reforms of the health sector. The actual achievements are similar to the levels
anticipated at project design, which were not substantially modified by the 2003 amendment. The
PRL provided the framework for the province to define a comprehensive policy framework for
the health sector and to provide continuity throughout the 1999-2005 period. Catamarca's efforts
in the health sector were centered on three pillars: (a) strengthening of basic health network (red
de atención primaria); (b) enhancing the financial sustainability and equity of the health system
by improving cost recovery; and (c) setting the foundations for a health insurance system for the
poor. Its success is reflected in the improvement in health indicators, which has been better than
for provinces as a whole (see Table 3). Specifically, considering a five-year average for the
periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2004, infant mortality in Catamarca was reduced by 4.3 deaths per
1,000 births compared to 3 for provinces as a whole.1 Likewise, the percentage of births taking
place in health facilities has increased by an impressive 8 percentage points between 1998 and
2003. The percentage of population without health insurance or a medical plan has increased
from 36 to 45 percent between 1998 and 2003. This is, however, better than the national trend
that shows roughly 12 percent of individuals with formal health insurance either discontinued, or
reduced their coverage due to rising unemployment and falling real wages during the crisis.



1The five-year average is a better measure of infant mortality for Catamarca given the significant annual variations
experienced due to the small population and the small number of births, which make annual infant mortality rates very
sensitive to random factors, reporting problems, migratory movements, etc. As an illustration, annual birth mortality
rate in Catamarca ranged between 15.5 and 22 deaths per 1,000 births between 2001 and 2004 (INDEC, 2004).

Accomplishment of the specific objectives in the health sector can be summarized as follows:

· Promoting hospital autonomy: Accomplished. The PRL was highly successful in helping
    establish the legal framework for cost recovery by individual hospitals and supporting its
    implementation. All provincial hospitals have adopted the cost-recovery modality and 16 out
    of 17 are effectively collecting payment, with monthly collections averaging Arg$100,000
    during the first half of 2006. Cost recovery for smaller hospitals is done centrally with the
    support of the Ministry of Health. The two largest hospitals--the San Juan Bautista and the
    Children's Hospitals that account for 70 percent of all provincial hospital expenditures--are
    responsible for their own cost recovery and are currently billing all insured patients and
    recovering between 60 and 70 percent. Collections from private health insurance providers,
    PAMI, and the national health insurance providers registered in the database of the National
    Health Superintendence (SNSS) exhibit very high levels of cost recovery, close to 95 percent.
    However, the provincial health insurance agency (OSEP) has had an uneven payment history.
    Being the main health insurance provider in the province (it provides health insurance to 42
    percent of the population), OSEP's performance is critical in determining the success of the
    cost recovery efforts by individual hospitals. Despite being granted a 50 percent reduction
    with respect to other providers, OSEP has paid only 30 percent of its bill during 2006,
    obstructing the overall cost recovery efforts by individual hospitals. The situation is expected
    to improve now that OSEP has a more stable flow of resources.
· Extending coverage to the uninsured poor: Accomplished. With the support of the PRL, the
    province developed and implemented a system sponsored by the national government to
    identify poor non-insured people, and a plan of medical assistance with preventive
    components and first-level of prevalent and seasonal diseases, maternity and childhood and
    access to ambulatory medicine, with a particular focus on rural areas (Primary Health Care
    Program ­ PROAPS). In accordance with second tranche conditionality, such health care
    benefits for the uninsured poor were being provided in five of the province's 12 health zones
    and, as of December 2004, the third tranche condition of expanding coverage to ten zones
    was also being met. The PROAPS has been replaced by the Maternal-Child Health Insurance
    Program (Plan Nacer), which is the central pillar of the Kirchner administration's health
    sector reform agenda. The Nacer program allows provinces to provide uninsured mothers and
    infants with a package of essential prevention, diagnostic and treatment health services.
    Enrollment is voluntary for all uninsured children up to their sixth birthday, pregnant women,




                                                             19

  and mothers for up to 45 days past their date of delivery or unintended abortion. Catamarca is
 one of the nine provinces in which the Nacer Program is being piloted.
· Ensuring the financial viability of the provincial health insurance carrier (OSEP): Under
  implementation. As noted above, OSEP provides health insurance coverage to 42 percent of
  Catamarca's population; therefore, its fiscal solvency is critical to the sustainability of the
  province's health system. Under the PRL, critical actions were implemented aimed at
  stabilizing the financial situation of OSEP, including implementing automatic payroll
  deductions from all municipal employees and OSEP beneficiaries, and additional contribution
  for high-complexity interventions (Law No. 5.116/2004, Ley de Transplante). Further actions
  were taken in the past two years, including passage of new legislation regulating work rules
  and salaries for provincial health workers (Law No. 5.161/2005), Ley de Carrera Sanitaria,
  for which salary supplements are subject to OSEP contributions on the side of both the
  province and the employee. In 2006, new legislation (Law No. 5.186/2006, Ley de Recursos
  de la Obra Social) was approved to increase the rate of contribution on the part of the
  province from 4 to 9 percent, resulting in an overall rate of 13.5 percent. Although OSEP
  still registered a deficit of almost Arg$1 million (equivalent to 15.2 percent of its resources)
  as of April 2006, an operational surplus is anticipated for the second half of the year, in
  accordance with the PRL conditionality for the third tranche. While the modernization of the
  agency is being done incrementally, OSEP now has a more transparent and predictable flow
  of resources that is in line with its obligations.
· Promoting essential public health services: Partially accomplished. The PRL has ensured
  that the level of health expenditures are maintained, with a adequate level of support for
  critical health programs such as immunizations, health promotion, reproductive health, child
  health, school health, environmental health, sanitary control, and surveillance and control of
  communicable diseases. A budget of Arg$119.5 million was approved for 2002 and 2003,
  amply exceeding the Arg$98 million minimum specified as a condition for the second tranche.
  Likewise, 10 percent of the resources were allocated to fund the identified set of critical
  health programs, exceeding the 8 percent target. Succeeding in protecting the health budget
  during the crisis was a particularly noteworthy achievement of the PRL, in view of the
  scarcity of fiscal resources. In 2004, however, the resources assigned to health expenditures
  decreased substantially to Arg$83.2 million, and so did the share of the funds designated for
  health programs (Arg$2.6 versus Arg$7.8 million required by third tranche conditionality).
  Among the factors contributing to the reduction in Catamarca's health budget was the
  decision of the national government to provide provinces with ambulatory and HIV
  medicines, as well as reproductive health supplies during 2004, which have resulted in
  corresponding reductions in provincial health budgets.
· Reallocating resources to non-personnel spending: Accomplished. With the support of the
 PRL, the share of salaries in the health budget has decreased to 77 percent at the time of the
 disbursement of the second tranche, and 61 percent in December 2004. The need for non-
 salary expenditures in health is essential for quality and effective services.
· Establishing quality assurance systems: Accomplished. With the support of the PRL,
  Catamarca has successfully adopted performance contracts between hospital directors and the
  Ministry of Health. These contracts have proved to be highly successful in introducing
  improvements in administrative management and setting clear performance targets for
  individual hospitals in terms of levels of production, quality of services and client attention
  standards. These contracts were successfully piloted in the two largest hospitals--the San
  Bautista and the Children's Hospitals--and were subsequently extended to all hospitals.
  Some of the specific issues covered under these contracts are: enhancement of the medical
  records (historia clínica), the implementation of a mechanism for customer feedback (buzón
  de quejas), use of IDs by hospital staff, and the establishment of medical committees

    responsible for systematically tracking and studying inter-hospital infections, mortality
    causes and tumor pathologies.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Although the operation fell short of fully achieving its development objectives in the education
sector, it was successful in enhancing health services in Catamarca in a framework of fiscal
responsibility. Despite of the difficult macro environment, the province succeeded in
implementing an ambitious structural reform program, exhibiting sound fiscal management
before and during the 2001 crisis. Provincial authorities also showed strong determination to
eliminate chronic sources of provincial deficit by liquidating the provincial bank and
concessioning the water company. Some of the key outcome targets as reflected in the loan's
policy conditionalies were formally revised at restructuring to reflect the macroeconomic and
social changes that resulted from the economic collapse of December 2001. Thus, the operation's
overall outcome rating has been assessed against both the original and revised key outcome
targets, in accordance with the Harmonized Evaluation Criteria for ICR and IEG Evaluations and
the new ICR guidelines issued in August 2006.

With respect to the original key outcomes, the operation is rated `Moderately Satisfactory.'
Development objectives for the public finance and administration component were fully met and
the level of achievement has been in line with the outcome targets specified at approval (except
for the debt stock target and the concession of a second road maintenance contract that do not
constitute significant deviations from original key outcomes). The same is true for health reforms,
where development objectives were fully met and key outcomes largely reflect original key
outcomes (except for lower health expenditures in 2004 and the financial equilibrium of OSEP,
which, although not yet achieved, it is expected for the second half of 2006). In the case of
education reforms, development objectives were only partially met, as the improvements in the
delivery of education has been very limited. At restructuring, several key outcome targets were
scaled down to better respond to the technical and political limitations facing provincial
authorities. In this way, conditions calling for the incorporation of performance-based monetary
incentives for both teachers and schools were waived, and the decentralization pilot program was
made less ambitious by forgoing the administrative decentralization of salary resources as well as
a stronger role in decision making for school advisory councils. Other targets, such as
student/teacher ratios, were also cut back. Moreover, original outcome targets that were not
modified at restructuring were not fully met (see Section 7.2, Annex 7). Thus, despite the
impressive performance in the areas of public finance and administration, as well as the health
sector, the operation is rated `Moderately Satisfactory' with respect to with respect to the original
key outcomes.

With respect to revised key outcomes, the operation is rated `Moderately Satisfactory.' In contrast
with the stellar performance in the areas of public finance and administration, as well as the
health sector, progress toward education reforms remained below expectations. Several revised
key outcomes were only partially met, including those regarding increasing student/teacher ratios,
reducing the number of teachers' institutes, and adopting a performance-based selection process
for school supervisors. There was no progress toward modifying the allocation of public subsidies
among private schools as the corresponding law was never presented to the legislature (see
Section 7.2, Annex 7).




                                                 21

Taking into consideration the operation's overall achievement, Catamarca's PRL is considered
`Moderately Satisfactory' (see Table 7.3, Annex 7). Catamarca has exhibited remarkable fiscal
responsibility before, during and in the aftermath of the 2001 crisis. Even in the face of highly
unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and dismal business climate, Catamarca met all original
fiscal targets, except the one relating to its debt stock. The province also succeeded in liquidating
the provincial bank, thus eliminating a chronic source of provincial deficit. Catamarca also not
only succeeded in concessioning its water company and setting in place a regulatory entity but,
unlike other provinces, is determined to ensure that the water company remains within the private
sector. Health reforms have succeeded in strengthening the basic health network, improving cost
recovery in public hospitals, and setting the foundations for a health insurance system for the poor.
The operation has also resulted in significant institutional strengthening by supporting the
adoption of sound management tools and legislation. Likewise, Catamarca's PRL helped protect
the public safety net that provided support to the poor during the 2001-2002 period. However,
while the operation has been successful in introducing substantial improvements into the
management of provincial resources and in enhancing the delivery of health services, progress in
the education sector has been limited, casting a shadow over the operation's overall performance.
In terms of the operation's overall relevance, the objectives pursued by the operation are still
highly pertinent vis-à-vis the current priorities of both the Kirchner administration and the Bank's
current CAS. The Moderately Satisfactory rating represents an upgrade from the Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating at the last PSR prepared in December 2005. The higher rating is justified
by the impressive performance in fiscal and public finances areas, including the liquidation of the
provincial bank and the concessioning of the water company which are structural reforms that are
likely to be sustained and which have generated permanent improvements in Catamarca's fiscal
structure. Improvements in the health sector are also structural and likely to be sustained. While
the education program was only partially implemented, Catamarca has improved its ranking on
certain education indicators.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or
to amplify discussion above):

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Province of Catamarca belongs to the part of Argentina with the lowest social and economic
indicators. In the late 1990s, its per capita income, at Arg$4,500, was about half the national
average, and 17th out of 24 provinces. Under the PRL, Catamarca successfully introduced the
specific goal of enhancing health services to the poor by providing basic health coverage to non-
insured indigent population. As uninsured households are generally unemployed or work in the
informal sector, they have a much higher likelihood of being poor than the insured households.
Although basic health statistics, such as infant mortality, are not disaggregated by socio-economic
stratum, the improvements observed in infant mortality and number of births at health facilities
observed Catamarca between 1999 and 2003 are likely to be related to the expansion of health
coverage among the uninsured. Also, as noted above, the PRL supported the implementation of a
subsidy for the poor as part of the concession of the water company. Approximately 20 percent of
all water users being served by the concessionaire currently receive subsidies amounting to 80 to
90 percent of their water bill, representing 11 percent of the total billing. Beneficiaries receive a
water bill that shows the total payment, the subsidy and the payment due in a disaggregated
manner; the province is responsible for transferring the subsidies to the concessionaire. This
subsidy is in addition to an already affordable water bill--the median water bill amounts to
roughly Arg$24 per month, well below the average for other NOA provinces. There have been
some shortcomings, however, in the actualization of the roster of beneficiaries, which has
remained pretty much unchanged since the inception of the program. The subsidy is expected to


                                                   22

be maintained under a new concession and even expanded to cover the tariff increase for the next
socio-economic stratum.

During the period 1991-2001, Catamarca reduced the percentage of the population with
unsatisfied basic needs (UBN) from 28.2 to 21.5 percent--equivalent to a 6.7 percentage point
reduction compared to 2.2 percentage points for all provinces (INDEC 2001). Although it is
difficult to establish direct causality between the operation and Catamarca's superior performance
in reducing UBN vis-à-vis that of the country as a whole, it is likely to be linked to the sustained
commitment of provincial authorities toward fiscal discipline from the mid-1990s onward and, in
2000, their ability to anticipate the impending economic crisis and take the necessary steps to
cushion its impact. In this way, the province was able to continue to pay salaries and provide
social services regularly even through the worst of the crisis.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development)

Catamarca's PRL has introduced innovative management practices and tools that are likely to
enhance public management and institutional development over the medium and long term.
Perhaps the most important achievement has been the successful implementation of cost recovery
mechanisms by individual hospitals. The success of this intervention is mainly the result of an
impeccable sequencing of the reforms and the creation of a sound system of incentives. In terms
of sequencing, the PRL supported first the adoption of the needed legal framework and
subsequently, its actual implementation and actual results. It benefited from the progress achieved
under other operations, such as the creation of a national registry of beneficiaries of all national
insurance carriers that is currently maintained by the SNSS. Without this database, the
implementation of cost recovery mechanisms would be infeasible. In addition, the PRL supported
enhancing financial viability of OSEP, another key component for the success of the overall
strategy. In terms of incentives, cost-recovery proceeds from individual hospitals are used to fund
salary bonuses rewarding increased billing and reductions in absenteeism in that same hospital,
creating a clear link between performance and rewards. In its initial stage, the awards were
distributed uniformly among all personnel within each hospital. Although not theoretically perfect,
this approach constituted a good first step to help overcome resistance and gain support among
the staff. As it turned out, those making a real effort to increase billing and reduce absenteeism
are now pressuring those perceived as free riders to do more. In the next stage, rewards will be
allocated based on the performance of individual operational units within each hospital in
meeting performance targets mutually agreed with the hospital director. In the case of other
innovations introduced under the PRL, such as the concession contracts for road maintenance, the
competitions for school supervisors, the administrative decentralization of educational resources
to individual schools, their future sustainability and their full impact is still pending.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The PRL has helped provide continuity throughout changes in administration within the various
ministries and appears to have played a significant role in coordinating the reform efforts across
ministers under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance. While it is clearly not desirable that
such a role be played by a lending operation--rather, mechanisms should be embedded within the
province's organizational structure--it is nevertheless positive that the operation served to fill
such a critical purpose.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Presently, the risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is considered moderate in
most respects. In general, policy actions undertaken under the PRL have either survived or were
implemented during the traumatic 2001-2002 period, which is a good indicator of their
sustainability. Other factors contributing to the sustainability of the operation's development
outcomes include the favorable macroeconomic conditions prevailing in Argentina since 2003
and a robust flow of public revenues due to increases, primarily in automatic transfers from the
national government (coparticipación) but also own-source revenues. At the national level, the
Fiscal Responsibility Law establishes fiscal performance indicators and provides for the
monitoring over time of fiscal results as well as for possible sanctions in the case of deviations
from the provisions of the law. While the high level of discretion and the consensual approach
under the Fiscal Responsibility Law create a potential risk that fiscal discipline will not be
sustained, such an approach may also increase provincial ownership, which is critical given
Argentina's strong federal character. It remains to be seen whether the Fiscal Responsibility Law
will be more successful in improving provincial and national fiscal performance than the many
national and provincial fiscal responsibility laws that preceded it, despite its relatively less
stringent provisions when compared to similar pieces of legislation adopted in other countries in
Latin America, such as Brazil.

Catamarca's current provincial administration has demonstrated its support for the previous
reforms and, in some cases such as the health sector, has taken them even further. Likewise, the
provincial administration has expressed its intention to maintain the water and electric company
in the private sector, despite heightened tensions at the national level with the concessionaires of
public services. In addition, the policy agenda of the newly appointed Minister of Education
seems to be in line with the reforms originally envisioned under the PRL, opening the possibility
of future progress in this sector. Specific observations regarding the degree of the sustainability
of the reforms pursued under the various policy areas can be summarized as follows:

Public Finances and Administration: While the sustainability of the reforms in the area of public
finances and administration is considered to be generally likely (with the exception of human
resources management), there are some worrisome trends to be noted in the areas of public
finances. Specifically:

· Public finances: Although Catamarca's financial situation enjoys general good health, several
    factors are increasingly burdening the province's finances and limiting its room for maneuver
    during future economic downturns. These include:
    a) Hefty salary increases: The monthly provincial wage bill has increased by 158 percent
        between January 2005 and January 2006--from Arg$29 to Arg$46 million, respectively.
        A further salary increase became effective in August 2006.
    b) Increased municipal transfers: Automatic transfers to municipalities have also increased
        substantially, from 17 percent to 25 percent of all provincial tax revenues, including both



                                                24

         provincial taxes and those transferred automatically by the national government
         (coparticipación). Moreover, before the passage of the new law, roughly half of transfers
         to municipalities were automatic transfers and the other half were discretionary transfers.
         Now, with the passage of the law, all of them are automatic.
    c) Debt servicing: Given the structure of Catamarca's debt, the province will now be facing
         higher debt payments than in the past.
    d) National Education Funding Law (Law No. 26.075): As a result of a newly enacted
         national law that ties education spending to growth in GDP (a 6 percent target for 2006),
         Catamarca's education budget is expected to increase by almost 20 percent in 2006--
         equivalent to Arg$50 million.
· Human resources management: Despite the impressive progress attained during the mid-
    1990s, prospects for the sustainability of the civil service reforms are not encouraging, as
    signs of reversal are already apparent. For example, the province has decided to interrupt the
    retrenchment program in view of its poor results. Moreover, although the number of
    provincial employees remained stable until 2003, it increased by over 20 percent in 2004,
    when more than 5,000 employees were added to the provincial payroll.
· Privatization and concessioning: The provincial bank was effectively liquidated; thus, its
    sustainability is not an issue. The water company was also concessioned as originally
    envisioned and, although the current contract will soon be rescinded, it is expected that a new
    concession will be in place within the next few months. Specifically, the conditions in the
    original contract became infeasible after the 2001 crisis, particularly with regard to the tariff
    structure and investment schedule originally anticipated. The water company has failed to
    make the scheduled investments (mainly due to the higher prices for PVC, a key material
    used in water systems) and the province is currently subsidizing the entire electrical supply
    required for water production to compensate for higher energy prices. The province has been
    working jointly with the company to annul the current contract. A new bid for the water
    concession has been prepared with input from the current concessionaire to be offered in the
    next few months--the rationale behind seeking input from the current concessionaire is that,
    if the bid is attractive for the current provider, it is also likely to attract other providers, thus
    increasing competition. Provincial authorities have expressed their commitment toward re-
    concessioning the water company.
· Provincial roads: Although modest, the achievements under this area are considered to be
    sustainable. The DVP is moving ahead with the relocation of its maintenance workshop and
    is studying options for its restructuring. Likewise, the positive experience resulting from the
    concession for road maintenance that was implemented under the PRL has reportedly
    encouraged the DVP to explore other opportunities for concessions, although marginally with
    respect to the bulk of its operations.

Health: The sustainability of the achievements under the health sector is considered to be very
likely. The passage of the law regulating work rules for public health workers (Carrera Sanitaria)
provides clear rules for employment and career advancement. Cost recovery by provincial
hospitals is also considered to be sustainable over time, as all provincial hospitals are actively
implementing it under the legal framework provided by a provincial law. The cost recovery
mechanism provides sound incentives among hospital workers through salary increases and
training; thus supporting its sustainability. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, some of the
innovative management tools introduced by the operation, such as management contracts between
the province and the hospitals, have been extended to all provincial hospitals, exceeding the loan
requirements. Likewise, these contracts are also being used within individual hospitals. The
province is also continuing its policy to provide health insure to the poor, now under the Nacer
program that focuses on mothers and their children. Likewise, as a result of recently enacted
legislation, the financing of the provincial health insurance (OSEP) is now in line its needs.


                                                  25

Finally, the passage of a new law that regulates work rules for public health workers (Carrera
Sanitaria) illustrates the thrust of the reforms in the health sector. Although not required under
the PRL, the new law provides clear rules for employment and career advancement, as well as
performance-based salary incentives such as attendance and productivity.

Education: Achievements in education have been generally limited, thus their sustainability is not
an issue. However, the recently appointed Minister of Education seems to have a vision for the
sector consistent with that articulated by the PRL. This constitutes a change in support of the
reform agenda that had been defined for the sector by the preceding administration. Reportedly,
new efforts will be made towards modifying teachers' work rules (Estatuto Docente), enhancing
education quality, promoting professional training, and enhancing the management of resources,
including the approval of a new Estatuto.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance:

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the operation was moderately
satisfactory. The Bank devised an effective strategy towards public sector reform at the sub-
national level by focusing resources on select provinces with demonstrated willingness and ability
to implement reforms, thus capitalizing on the window of opportunity provided by the presence
of reform-minded administrations at the provincial levels.         Likewise, the Bank's strategy
correctly identified the need to promote reforms in the social sectors--education and health--in a
framework of fiscal soundness. These two sectors are central to the medium and long-term
success of any provincial reform strategy, as they represent a significant share the Catamarca's
budget. Moreover, the services in these two sectors are critical in determining the level of human
capital development of the province in the medium and long term.

Catamarca proved to be a sound choice for participating in the PRL. The province had
demonstrated a commitment toward reform, strong political support from the legislative branch,
and a fiscal situation that, although in need of improvement, was not structurally flawed. Despite
the unprecedented difficulties posed by the 2001-2002 implementation environment, Catamarca's
performance under the PRL successfully demonstrated that small, poor provinces can
successfully advance on difficult reforms and maintain a framework of fiscal responsibility when
there is substantial political will.

The Bank embarked on a thorough preparation process, including in-depth technical analysis
within the various sectors as well as participatory mechanisms to gather input from key
stakeholders and the civil society in general. The Bank's staff helped to identify and prepare an
operation consistent with both the Borrower's interests and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy. A gender assessment was performed as part of the loan preparation to ensure that the
reforms would not pose negative gender impacts but, rather, reduce inter-gender disparities. The
Bank worked in close collaboration with the provincial government and maintained a high degree
of coordination between the PRL and other Bank operations, both provincial and sector loans.
The Policy Matrix effectively operationalized key aspects of Catamarca's reform strategy



                                                 26

supported by the operation that were ambitious but still feasible in the areas of public finance and
administration as well as health. However, the limited progress in the implementation of the
education reforms was partly determined by the operation's quality at entry in this area, as the
reforms were overly ambitious and lacked the technical experience required for their successful
implementation.
(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

Even under normal circumstances, policy development operations pose a challenge in terms of
supervision, as they require both precision and agility. In the case of Catamarca's PRL, this
challenge was exponentially more complex given the extraordinary circumstances under which
the operation was implemented during 2001 and 2002. Once the macroeconomic environment
improved, the Bank moved quickly to restructure the operation in order to adapt it to the new
realities. The supervision team that was constituted by staff from various networks succeeded in
supporting the implementation of reforms in multiple sectors while maintaining internal
cohesiveness. In this regard, PREM provided overall coordination and encouraged the other
networks to take responsibility for supervising their sector reform programs; in turn, the
Infrastructure and Human Development networks were fully cooperative and fully supported the
operation. Thus, the experience of Catamarca's PRL--as well as those in Santa Fe and
Catamarca--could be considered an example of successful cross-sector coordination between
multiple networks--PREM, Infrastructure, and Human Development. In turn, the supervision
team forged a close relationship with provincial authorities through periodic visits and fluid
communication. At times when relations were tense between the government and IFIs, the task
manager and the PRL team succeeded in maintaining the channels of communication open with
provincial authorities and the professional staff working in the various sectors covered under the
operation. During the interviews conducted as part of the ICR preparation, professional staff and
authorities repeatedly praised the input of their Bank counterparts in terms of policy making and
rigorous monitoring, reporting it as an important value-added benefit of the operation. The project
was very well documented, as all official records, communications, e-mails and reports presented
by the borrower and sector task managers during the life of the project were archived in the
Bank's IRIS (Integrated Records Information System). This reflects a substantial effort, as many
of the lengthy reports produced by the borrower were presented as hard copies, which required
their manual scanning.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Given the severity of the economic collapse of December 2001, it is, of course, relevant to
question whether the Bank should have predicted such an outcome. However, given the many
different views on the causes of the crisis and whether it might have been avoided, this question
can be more adequately addressed as part of the evaluation of the overall Bank strategy toward
Argentina than as part of this ICR, which focuses on the specific reforms supported by the
operation. Although the debate over what was the appropriate strategy under the conditions
prevailing at the time is likely to continue, the implementation of Catamarca's PRL indicates that
adjustment operations can help ensure the sustainability of ongoing reforms during difficult
periods. Moreover, the specific reforms supported by the operation were necessary in any event,
as illustrated by their impact on provincial management and service delivery as well as the
sustained momentum for their continuing implementation, particularly in the areas of public



                                                  27

finance and administration as well as health. In the case of education reforms, they lacked the
needed technical expertise at the time of appraisal, which contributed to their partial
implementation. For the reasons and those outlined above, the Bank's performance is considered
Moderately Satisfactory with regard to the preparation and implementation of this particular
operation.

5.2 Borrower Performance:

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During preparation, the province provided full collaboration. Staff from the various provincial
ministries and agencies participated in the preparatory work, ensuring that the proposed actions
were consistent with the province's reform program. Catamarca had strong ownership of the
reform program, illustrating the ideal case in which a Bank operation fully supports provincial
objectives. The highly transparent and participatory approach used by Catamarca's authorities
was critical in developing support for the program being supported under the PRL. Most of the
reforms were subjected to the scrutiny of the legislature and public input was actively sought on
specific reforms (e.g., privatizations and concessions).

The supervision of the program was entrusted to an Executing Unit located in the province's
Ministry of Finance. While the Ministry of Finance took the lead in implementing the reform
program, the Ministries of Education and Public Health participated actively as well. The
performance of the Executing Unit was highly satisfactory, serving as an effective interface
between the different actors, including the governor, the provincial ministries, the Bank, and the
executing units of other related projects. The supervision team was kept well informed of all
relevant developments--both of progress and occasional difficulties--that took place during the
implementation of the program. Adequate documentation was made available to support the
request for disbursement of the second tranche. The province demonstrated a strong internal
cohesiveness during the implementation of the operation, articulating political support from the
top with a demonstrated ability for implementation throughout the end of 2003. This fluidity was
particularly noteworthy in the management of public finances and the health sector, which,
despite its complexity, benefited from a uniting vision. From 2004 onwards, the level of political
support for the reform program has been uneven. Conversely, reforms in the health sector were
supported and advanced even further under the incoming administration. In the education sector,
the province was unable to make progress in some of the key reforms. Because of its performance
in the education sector, the government's performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory despite a
stellar performance in other areas of reform.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

N.A.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The lack of fiscal resources and the mounting social tensions that resulted from the country's
economic collapse posed a difficult test for provincial authorities and their commitment toward
reform. However, as opposed to abandoning their reform program, the provincial authorities
continued with their efforts, pushing for difficult reforms on various fronts, except in the


                                                28

education sector. In the education sector, provincial authorities could have been more decisive in
the implementation of these reforms, particularly as part of the recent salary renegotiations, which
rendered Catamarca's teachers at the top of the pay-scale for teachers in the country. At the
national level, the operation benefited from the clearly defined framework established by the
national government for managing the fiscal situation of the provinces in the aftermath of the
2001 crisis, using the orderly financing agreements first, and subsequently the Fiscal
Responsibility Law. For these reasons and the ones noted above, the Borrower's overall
performance is considered Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

Provincial policy development operations such as Catamarca's PRL are only appropriate
under stable macroeconomic conditions. While this type of operation requires an overall
satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework, such framework is the responsibility of the
national government and beyond the sphere of action of provincial authorities. As illustrated by
the experience of Argentina's last series of PRLs, particularly those for Córdoba and Santa Fe,
failings or uncertainties at the macroeconomic level can override substantial achievements at the
provincial level, leading to loan cancellation.

Under stable macroeconomic conditions, policy-based operations supporting a well-defined
set of reforms can be effective tools in promoting structural adjustment at the sub-national
level. Direct provincial lending using fast-disbursing operations have the advantages of: (i)
addressing the needs of individual provinces more specifically; and (ii) introducing a critical mass
of financial incentives and technical support that can effectively accelerate the pace of the reform
process within individual provinces. In addition, operations such as Catamarca's PRL foster
provincial ownership, internal consistency of provincial sector policies, and cross-sector
coordination during their implementation. As reported by provincial authorities, the direct
relationship with the Bank also brings added legitimacy and credibility to the province's reform
program, as well as valuable technical assistance in the development of sector policies and
methodological rigor in implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

Provincial operations can be effective complements of sector reforms and operations at the
national level. While sector-specific investment operations targeting provincial governments
provide for a sharper sector focus and longer term engagement, multi-sector provincial-level
operations such as Catamarca's PRL can help promote sector objectives by boosting political will
to take key policy actions at the provincial level. This is particularly important in the case of
Argentina, where highly autonomous provinces play a predominant role in providing critical
public services, such as education and health. On the downside, direct provincial lending
concentrates risk on specific provinces--as opposed to national sector operations that diversify
risk among multiple participating provinces.

For reforms to be successful, they have to follow the right sequence, take into consideration
interrelationship of needed reforms, and be supported by a sound incentive system. The
successful implementation of the cost-recovery mechanisms by public hospitals underlines the
importance of having in place not only an adequate legal framework but also the tools needed for
implementation--in this case, the national register of beneficiaries of national insurance carriers.
Likewise, the financial viability of OSEP determines the overall success of the cost recovery
system, given that it provides health insurance to over 40 percent of the population. In addition,
the reward system tying cost recovery to salary bonuses for hospital workers ensures that there
are strong incentives ensuring its sustainability.



                                                  29

For provinces to be fiscally responsible over the long term, a consistent system of incentives
must be in place at the national level. A clear strategy of the national government towards the
provinces is a prerequisite for broader fiscal adjustment among sub-national governments, such as
the determination to avoid bailouts of fiscally irresponsible provincial governments. In this regard,
the operation has benefited from the clearly defined framework established by the national
government for managing the fiscal situation of the provinces in the post-2001 period, using the
orderly financing agreements first, and subsequently the Fiscal Responsibility Law.            It is
important to note, however, that the high level of discretion and political nature of bilateral
financing arrangements under the Financial Responsibility Law generates uncertainties as to
whether the law will ultimately lead to sustained fiscal discipline.

The Bank's continuous engagement during critical periods can help sustain ongoing
reforms and protect previous achievements. The experience of Catamarca's PRL indicates it
was beneficial to have an operation in place providing a clear roadmap for enhancing service
delivery in key social sectors during times of economic, political and institutional chaos. The
substantial financial resources attached to the PRL became even more attractive in face of the
overall lack of liquidity in the country in 2001-2002, providing the province additional incentives
to sustain the ongoing reforms in the short and medium term. The experience of Catamarca's PRL
also shows that sector reforms are possible even when the overriding priority is fiscal adjustment;
however, sector budgets need to be protected, in particular to ensure that cost savings from
efficiency gains can be reinvested into the sector.

Within a difficult lending and operational environment, focusing on the consolidation of
more mature reforms appears to have been an effective strategy. The experience of
Catamarca's PRL indicates that adjustment operations can be effective in consolidating mature
reforms, as those in the health and banking sectors. In these sectors, the province was able to
build upon previous institutional work done under other operations, using the PRL's financial
incentives to support the implementation of key actions still pending. Alternatively, the reforms
in the education sector that lacked the same level of know-how and maturity proved hard to push
forward.

The success of SAL loans depends on a combination of factors, the most important of which
is strong political support. In the case of Catamarca, the ambitious set of reforms supported
under the PRL succeeded as a result of a unique combination of strong political support from the
governor and the provincial legislature, as well as a solid leadership in those sectors exhibiting
the best performance--i.e., provincial finances and health.

Loan conditionality should focus on results, going beyond the enactment of legislation or
executive decrees. Like many structural adjustment operations, Catamarca's PRL illustrates the
danger of having conditionality that can be legally met despite not having any significant impact.
In this particular case, there is no guarantee that the law requiring the selection of school
supervisors on a competitive basis will be sustained. Alternatively, the loan's conditionality for
the cost recovery by public hospitals focused on both legal instruments and outcomes, providing
incentives for its successful implementation.

Overly complex operations with a large number of conditionalities that lack a clear
hierarchy are difficult to implement and supervise. These difficulties became evident during
the implementation of Catamarca's PRL, which initially included over 50 conditionalities to
cover the province's ambitious reform program. Reducing the number of conditionalities and
establishing a clear hierarchy between them can improve overall design. In this regard, it might
be useful to focus primarily on major policy actions and the achievement of specific targets,


                                                 30

rather than including the satisfactory completion of technical inputs, such as studies and action
plans, as policy conditions.

Cross-sector operations at the provincial level require strong coordination during both
preparation and implementation. On the side of the borrower, this type of operation requires
strong coordination efforts, both horizontal (i.e., between across multiple government agencies at
the provincial level) and vertical (i.e., between ministries at the national and provincial levels).
On the Bank side, operations such as Catamarca's PRL demand strong cooperation and
coordination between the various sector teams. While successfully achieved in this case, the need
for effective coordination could pose risks to other operations of similar complexity.

Key impact and monitoring indicators have to be developed during appraisal, including
baselines and targets. Otherwise, there is the risk that they will never be completed, thus
hampering the effective supervision and evaluation of the operation.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

[This is a summary of the Borrower's Report--the actual report has been archived in the project's
files]

Catamarca's Provincial Reform Loan was considered not only an important project in itself, but
also a pilot experience, given that the challenges faced by provincial authorities were similar to
those of many provinces. There were several factors that made Catamarca a good candidate for
success, including its sound financial management from 2000 onward as well as its previous
progress toward reform in the context of various Bank-financed operations, including the First
and Second Provincial Development Projects and sector loans in the areas of health, education
and transport.

Both the Bank and provincial authorities were highly committed to ensuring a sound project
design, where substantial resources and effort were assigned to project preparation. As a result,
the operation correctly targeted key problems and identified critical objectives together with
technically sound courses of action to ensure the achievement of such objectives. Provincial
authorities maintained their strong commitment toward such objectives during implementation,
not only under the administration that initiated the project but also its successor. The fact that the
team in the province's Ministry of Finance, which played a central role in the operation's original
design and subsequent implementation, remained on board until January 2006, roughly two years
into the new provincial administration, attests to the commitment of the incoming provincial
authorities to ensure the sustainability of the operation.

Achievement of Objectives: Although it is clear that the difficult macroeconomic situation
negatively affected the province's performance, both within and beyond the scope of the project,
overall achievement is considered highly positive. Although the third tranche was not disbursed,
the operation effectively supported the province in its efforts to enhance public management and
service delivery while maintaining a healthy financial management, which continues to the
present day. The liquidation of the provincial bank and the concession of the water company are
just two examples of the critical structural reforms implemented under the project. In addition to
the specific objectives that were achieved in each of the policy areas--fiscal performance, health
and education--the province's ability to continue to pay salaries and deliver services during the

difficult 2001-2003 period, avoiding additional hardships on the population, was a direct result of
the province's sound financial management and the reforms supported by the operation.

The partial achievement of the education component is partly related to the impact of the 2001
crisis, as the negative social impact of the crisis created additional resistance within teachers'
unions to the structural reforms supported under the project. While achievement was limited
within the education component, it is important to note that the province has continued to take
steps to improve education delivery in a manner that is consistent with the strategy delineated
under the Provincial Reform Project. Some of the specific actions include: the adoption of salary
incentives to discourage absenteeism and the abuses in the use of personal licenses, the
implementation a program aimed at increasing enrollment and reducing desertion and repetition
rates, and training for rural teachers. The province has also continued in its efforts to increase the
student/teacher ratio, although population patterns in the province make this objective particularly
challenging--70 percent of school buildings are located in rural areas, accounting for only 30
percent of the province's student population.

Bank's Performance: The Bank's performance is considered more than satisfactory, being
particularly noteworthy the fluidity of the relationship of the Bank's staff with that of the
province during the entire life of the project, including preparation, implementation and
evaluation.

Future Operations: The province is currently assessing the possibility of participating in the Sub-
national Governments Modernization Program (Loan 7352-AR) to continue with the
implementation of its reform program. Moreover, it would be of utmost interest to the province to
resume discussions with the Bank regarding the possibility of obtaining financing to support the
modernization of water resources management, a top priority for Catamarca.

Lessons Learned and Recommendations:

· Project management presents additional challenges to provinces like Catamarca, in which
    highly qualified human resources are not in abundance. To overcome this limitation, top
    advisors within each of the policy areas were made responsible for project coordination and
    implementation. However, top advisor positions tend to be political appointments that change
    with each administration, thus disrupting project implementation. Thus, for future operation,
    it would be best to create a Project Executing Unit constituted by permanent provincial
    personnel from the various areas to be targeted under the project.
· Training and capacity building should be an important component of any future operation,
    regardless of the specific area of intervention.
· It would have been very helpful for the province to have the documentation related to the
    project, including initial diagnostic studies, project documents, and the final evaluation, in
    Spanish. Although these documents can, of course, be translated, the specificity of the
    terminology makes it difficult for non-technical translators to capture the text's full meaning.
· It would be important to adapt national CREMA contracts to reflect local conditions within
    individual provinces. The failure of the CREMA bidding processes conducted as part of this
    operation was primarily the result of lack of enough technical capacity on the part of local
    firms.

Annex 7. Additional Annexes

7.1 Restructuring

By restructuring the operation in August 2003, the Bank sought to address the drastic changes
that followed the economic collapse of December 2001 while preserving the overall objectives of
the loan. The decision to restructure the operation instead of canceling the two undisbursed
tranches was based on Catamarca's solid fiscal management, even in the face of crisis, and the
substantial progress it had made in the implementation of the reforms in the areas of public
finances and administration, and health. Restructuring provided the opportunity to reframe the
province's program in a manner that was feasible given the macroeconomic uncertainties without
deviating from the operation's original development objectives.

Although Catamarca was able to maintain a fiscal program consistent with the original fiscal
conditionalities, fiscal stringency together with rising social pressures prevented the province
from fully pursuing all the reforms at the pace originally envisioned. Overall, a total of 16 out of
42 conditions were amended--seven and nine conditions corresponding to the second and third
tranches, respectively. The majority of the amendments were related to education (i.e., nine
conditions), reflecting the difficulties experienced in carrying out the reforms in this sector. The
amendments in the education sector scaled back the original outcomes, while the amendments in
the other two policy areas constituted adjustments needed to reflect the post-2001 conditions that
did not significantly affect the operation's original key outcomes. By restructuring the operation
as opposed to canceling it, the Bank offered the province its support as well as substantial
incentives to continue with the implementation of the critical set of reforms supported by the
operation despite the heightened fiscal and social pressure. Table 7.1 provides a detail of the
individual amendments, and Table7.2 shows the overall impact of these amendments on the
original outcome targets.

7.2. Rating the Outcome of Projects with Formally Revised Objectives:

As noted earlier, the operation's development objectives--i.e., to promote an efficient and
responsive delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies--remained unchanged at
restructuring. While operation has largely met its development objectives, some of the key
outcome targets as operationalized by the loan's policy conditionalies were formally revised at
restructuring to reflect the macroeconomic and social changes that resulted from the economic
collapse of December 2001. Thus, the operation's overall outcome rating has been assessed
against both the original and revised key outcome targets in accordance with the Harmonized
Evaluation Criteria for ICR and IEG Evaluations and the new ICR guidelines issued in August
2006.

Assessment of outcome with respect to original key outcome targets: Moderately Satisfactory.
The operation has clearly succeeded in supporting Catamarca in its efforts to enhance efficiency
and responsiveness in the delivery of public services, most notably health, within fiscally sound
policies. Despite highly unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, the province succeeded in
implementing an ambitious set of restructuring reforms, including liquidating the provincial bank
and concessioning the water company. Fiscal management has been remarkable, before, during,
and after the 2001 crisis. Reforms in the health sector have also been largely implemented as
originally envisioned. However, some of the key outcome targets envisioned at approval were not
achieved. The level of achievement was particularly poor in the education sector, as strong vested
interests, including teachers' unions and private schools, succeeded in blocking some of the
reforms. Moreover, original key outcomes in the education were significantly scaled down at
restructuring, the most significant being the removal of conditions calling for the incorporation of
performance-based monetary incentives for teachers and schools. Thus, despite the substantial
achievements in the areas of public finance and administration, as well as the health sector, the
operation is rated `Moderately Satisfactory' with respect to with respect to the original key
outcomes. The operation's achievement can be summarized as follows:

A. Public Finance and Administration: Most of the original key outcomes were either achieved or
exceeded. The level of attainment of this component was remarkable, especially in face of the
unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and business climate, pointing to the sound fiscal
management and strong determination of provincial authorities to proceed with the reform
program. As mentioned above, Catamarca met all original fiscal targets, except the one relating
its debt stock. The province also succeeded in liquidating the provincial bank, thus eliminating a
chronic source of provincial deficit. Catamarca also succeeded in concessioning its water
company and setting in place a regulatory entity and, unlike other provinces, Catamarca is
determined to ensure that the water company remains within the private sector. Only two of the
original targets were not fully met, as follows:

· Debt stock: The original fiscal target regarding the debt stock calling for a ratio not greater
    that 99 percent of current revenues was not met as a result of the peso devaluation with
    respect to the U.S. dollar. In 2005, Catamarca's debt stock represented 119 percent of current
    revenues in 2005. However, the province's debt stock increased less than that of other
    provinces, by 8 percent between 1999 and 2005 compared to 53 percent for provinces as a
    whole.
· Road Directorate: The original third-tranche condition required the province to select a
    winner private sector bidder for two pilot contracts introducing private sector participation in
    road maintenance. The province succeeded in awarding only one contract, as there were no
    offers when the province attempted twice to bid out the second contract.



                                                44

B. Education Reforms: This component did not reach several original key outcomes, including:

· Student/teacher ratios: This outcome target was partially achieved. For the second tranche,
    the province successfully reached the original targets but only for urban areas as amended, as
    opposed to the province as a whole as originally agreed. In addition, original outcome targets
    calling for student/teacher ratios of at least 20:1 at EGB I and II levels, and 10:1 for EGB III
    and Polimodal levels were reduced at restructuring--the modified targets were modified to
    16:1 and 9:1, respectively. Only the targets corresponding to EGB III and Polimodal levels
    were achieved for the province as a whole.
· Modifying teachers' work rules: This outcome target was partially achieved. Among the
    various modifications envisioned of the Teachers' Statute, conditions requiring the adoption
    of a new performance-based salary scheme and performance-based school bonuses were
    waived at restructuring. The remaining conditions regarding were met as amended.
· Enhancing private sector participation: This outcome target was not achieved. Second-
    tranche conditionality called for the passage of a law modifying the formula used to allocate
    these subsidies, basing it on objective criteria, including the number of students, their
    socioeconomic background, and the quality of schools. The law was never presented to the
    legislature.
· Administrative decentralization: Although a decentralized management model was
    implemented in ten schools as a way to enhance accountability in the administration of
    resources, except for salary expenses, which was waived at restructuring. Likewise, the
    requirement that school administrators administer decentralized resources in consultation
    with school advisory councils was also waived at restructuring.
· Reducing the number of teachers' institutes: This outcome target was partially achieved. For.
    Of the 26 institutes operating in 1995, the province reduced the number to 13 one short of the
    original outcome target of 12.

C. Health Reforms: All but one of the original key outcomes were largely achieved or exceeded.
While the minimum spending targets for health care were amply exceeded in 2002 and 2003, the
resources assigned to health expenditures decreased substantially in 2004, and so did the share of
the funds designated for health programs. Among the factors contributing to the reduction in
Catamarca's health budget was the decision of the national government to provide provinces with
ambulatory and HIV medicines, as well as reproductive health supplies during 2004, which have
resulted in the corresponding reductions in the health budgets.

Assessment of outcome with respect to revised key outcome targets: Moderately Satisfactory.
All conditions of the restructured second tranche were met and the corresponding tranche was
disbursed. Although the third tranche was cancelled in agreement with the government as part of
the negotiations of the new CAS envelope, most conditions regarding public finance and
administration, as well as health have been met. Progress toward education reforms has been
partial on most fronts and no progress was made toward modifying the formula allocating public
subsidies to public schools. Thus, despite the substantial achievements in the areas of public
finance and administration, as well as the health sector, the operation is rated `Moderately
Satisfactory' with respect to its revised key outcomes. Specifically:

A. Public Finance and Administration: All of the revised key outcomes have been either achieved
or exceeded, except for awarding the second contract for road maintenance as explained above.

B. Education Reforms: Although several of the key outcomes in the education sector were revised
at restructuring, education reforms continued to stall. Several of the revised key outcomes have
being only partially met.


                                                  45

· Student/teacher ratios: This outcome target was partially achieved, as revised targets EGB I
    and II were not achieved for the province as a whole.
· Modifying teachers' work rules: This outcome target was partially achieved. Although a
    competition (concurso) was held for the selection of school supervisors as required by the
    PRL revised conditionality, the results have had little impact on the actual appointment of
    supervisors.
· Reducing the number of teachers' institutes: This outcome target was partially achieved. The
    province reduced the number of teachers' institutes from 26 to 13--although the original
    outcome target indicated a maximum of 12 teaching institutes, this still constitutes a
    significant accomplishment.
· Enhancing private sector participation: This outcome target was not achieved. As mentioned
    above, the law modifying the formula used to allocate these subsidies was never presented to
    the legislature.

C. Health Reforms: All of the revised key outcomes have been either achieved or exceeded,
except for two conditions. First, as explained above, minimum spending targets for health care
were not met for 2004. Second, although measures aimed at ensuring the financial sustainability
of the provincial health insurance carrier are now in place and an operational surplus is expected
for the second half of the 2006, OSEP still registered a deficit as of April 2006.

Weighted Overall Project Outcome: Moderately Satisfactory.               Weighing the operation's
ratings with respect to original and revised objectives based on the share of actual disbursements
before and after the revision took place renders an overall outcome of Moderately Satisfactory, as
shown on Table 2.3.
