restructure\n            the provincial government, and ensure an efficient, and\n            responsive delivery of public services, within fiscally\n            sound policies. Catamarca was selected to participate in the\n            program, because of its reformist record since 1995, its\n            pressing needs to enhance the efficiency, and quality of\n            social sector spending, and the strong demonstration effect\n            it would have on other provinces, given its weak record on\n            social, and economic indicators. The project will support\n            fiscal adjustment, including structural reform in the social\n            sectors, based on the design of the Second Provincial Reform\n            Loan. Within the reform program to be supported, the health\n            component has the specific goal of reaching the poor,\n            providing basic health coverage to non-insured indigent\n            populations. Similarly, the education component seeks to\n            redirect spending, towards schools in poor neighborhoods,\n            and provide special retention programs, to reduce drop-out\n            rates among the poorest children. The single currency loan\n            will be disbursed in three tranches, between FY2001-2003."}, "docdt": "2000-08-21T00:00:00Z"}
