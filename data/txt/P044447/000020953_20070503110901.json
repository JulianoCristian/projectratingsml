as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned included: 1)\n            Provincial policy development operations such as\n            Catamarca's Provincial Reform Loan (PRL) are only\n            appropriate under stable macroeconomic conditions; 2) Under\n            stable macroeconomic conditions, policy-based operations\n            supporting a well-defined set of reforms can be effective\n            tools in promoting structural adjustment at the sub-national\n            level; 3) Provincial operations can be effective complements\n            of sector reforms and operations at the national level; 4)\n            For reforms to be successful, they have to follow the right\n            sequence, take into consideration interrelationship of\n            needed reforms, and be supported by a sound incentive\n            system; 5) For provinces to be fiscally responsible over the\n            long term, a consistent system of incentives must be in\n            place at the national level; 6)  The Bank's continuous\n            engagement during critical periods can help sustain ongoing\n            reforms and protect previous achievements; 7) Within a\n            difficult lending and operational environment, focusing on\n            the consolidation of more mature reforms appears to have\n            been an effective strategy; 8) The success of SAL loans\n            depends on a combination of factors, the most important of\n            which is strong political support; 9) Loan conditionality\n            should focus on results, going beyond the enactment of\n            legislation or executive decrees; 10) Overly complex\n            operations with a large number of conditionalities that lack\n            a clear hierarchy are difficult to implement and supervise;\n            11) Cross-sector operations at the provincial level require\n            strong coordination during both preparation and\n            implementation; and 12) Key impact and monitoring indicators\n            have to be developed during appraisal, including baselines\n            and targets."}, "docdt": "2007-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
