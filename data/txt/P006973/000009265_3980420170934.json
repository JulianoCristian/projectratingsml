The main Project objectives were to: (a) provide\n            adequate expansion of the generation, transmission, and\n            distribution facilities to effect fuel savings and meet the\n            growth of electricity consumption between 1989 and 1994; (b)\n            strengthen Dominica Electricity ServicesLimited (DOMLEC)\n            institutionally by providing outside management services and\n            training of technical personnel; and (c) assist DOMLEC in\n            planning system expansion to meet its long-term energy\n            requirements. While the Borrower feels that Bank performance\n            during project preparation was satisfactory, it considers\n            that Bank performance during appraisal and supervision was\n            not because of the adverse results of the litigation with\n            Nord-France. The overall outcome of the Project is deemed to\n            be marginally satisfactory because of its likely\n            sustainability and because the two main physical and\n            institutional objectives were satisfactorily achieved. Key\n            lessons learned from the Power Project are: 1) Restrictions\n            imposed on the eligibility of bidders and on the size of the\n            bidding packages, tend to increase project costs by\n            constraining competition and economies of scale in the\n            supply of goods, works, and services; 2) projects such as\n            this one should reduce the risk of costly litigation by\n            providing at the bidding stage a clear definition of\n            criteria; 3) To ensure timely, efficient and continuous\n            project implementation it is important to guarantee\n            continuity of the Project Executing Unit (PEU) principal\n            staff; 4) The business of providing electricity services and\n            the business of project engineering are very different; and\n            5) When formalizing initial positions relating to recently\n            awarded large contracts, Borrowers should not hesitate to\n            cancel contracts with first winners at the first formal\n            indication of intent to renegotiate the value of winning\n            bids, and to re-award them to next lowest evaluated bidders."}, "docdt": "1997-05-01T16:18:02Z"}
