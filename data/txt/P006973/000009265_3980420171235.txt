2. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Consumption and Resources
2.01     Dominica meets most of its commercial energy demand through
petroleum products and electricity. Energy consumption in 1985 was about
19,300 toe or about .23 toe/inhabitant, which is among the lowest in the
Caribbearn community. Petroleum products accounted for about 76% of the
primary energy consumption (out of which some 11% corresponds to diesel-
fired electric generation and 65% to direct use by final consumers),
hydroelectricity for about 20% and LPG for about 4%. The use of diesel for
electricity amounited to 35% of total diesel consumption in 1985. The
country has no kaown fossil fuel resources, but hes considerable hydro
potential and possibly some usable geothermal resources.  Efforts to
promote fuel conservation and the use of indigenous resources is now a
major Government concern as the volume of petroleum products imported
increased from 75,000 barrels in 1983 to 115,000 barrels in 1985 causing an
increase of expenditures from US$3.8 million to US$6.1 million. In an
attempt to curb consumption and as a means of increasing its revenues,
Government has set prices for gasoline, kerosene, diesel and LPG some 20%
above efficiency prices, through a consumption tax that has increased in
direct proportion with recent falls in the price of petroleum products in
the international mnarket.
2.02     The country is endowed with substantial hydro resources in
relation to its area (750 km2) end population (85,000). A 1984
comprehlensive survey of the most promising basins has ascertained that an
average production of some 110 GWh per year (about 5 times the generati..n
energy requirements In 1985) could be developed at a cost not exceeding US
cents 6.3/KWh, -.hich would make them competitive with diesel-fired
generation at a wholesale diesel price in Dominica of about $23/bbl.
corresponding to UJS$S!2/bbl. of crude oil in the international market.1
2.03     GeochemiiicaL and geophysical measurements carried out with
assistance from the French Government indicated that there are some
promising geothermial fields. The exploration program of geothermal
resources calls fox extensive drilling and a pilot electric generation
project. The Government has decided not to assign a high priority to an
exploratory effort, taking into account the high costs involved and the
much less risky 8rnl readily available solution offered by hydroelectricity
(para. 2.02).
2.04     Dominica's main non-commercial energy sources are vegetable
charcoal and wood, which are mostly used for domestic purposes in the rural
areas. Correlation with data on other Caribbean islands suggests that
charcoal and wood energy usage amounts to about 1,500 toe!year, which is
less than 10% of the commercial energy usage.
2.05     The limited availability of begasse and cther agricultural wastes
as well as animal natrtire would yield a very minor contribution to the
country energy needs, either in terms of gas for domestic use or power
1/ This is based on estimates of the following: diesel oil international
price of about 25% above crude price; ocean transport costs of diesel
from Southern Caribbean to Dominica of US$3/bbl. and on-shore handling
and distribution costs of some US$4/bbl. (Annex 3.2, Attachment 9).

generation. Wind power and solar heating may have localized applications
(e.g. crop drying using solar heating); however data are still being
gsathered by the Government, which his resorted to international technical
assistance grants, to assess the use of less conventional energy sources.
Enerzy Sector Urganization
2.06     The responsibilities of the ministries with respect to energy
matters are as follows. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism
regulates petroleim imports and prices. The Ministry of Finance analyses
the impacti of p.trolsum imports and the retail price structure on the
balance of paymerts, Government revenues and internal inflation. An
agreement between these two ministries i3 needed before imports are
contracted or retail price policies are changed. The Ministry of
Communications and Works (MCW) supervises the electric power utility
(DOMLEC) and handles directly the activities concerning new or less
conventional technologies. The Ministry of Agriculture regulates and/or
operates the activities regarding wood, vegetabls charcoal, biogas, biomass
and solar heating.
2.07     Given the scarcity of administrative and human resources, the
Government has relied on the expert advice of the Secretariat of Economic
Affairs of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to formulate
energy policies. A number of strategies intended to increase self-reliance
are under way or being established through improved energy demand
mnanagement (conservation, efficiency, and pricing policy) and reduction in
petroleum dependence (through the development of renewable energy sources).
In addition to the continued use of OECS technical assistance, it is
desirable that a coordinating mechanism be established within the
Government to assure that prices for diesel, LPG and electricity continue
to be set in a consistant -way so that the consumers use the enezgy source
that is most efficient to their needs. It was agreed during negotiations
that Government would appoint not later than December 31, 1987, under terms
of reference acceptable to the Association, an Inter-Ministry Lnergy
Committee consisting of representatives of MCW, Ministry uif Finance, and
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism to coordinate the pricing of energy
products.
Power Sector Tariffs and Regulation
2.08     Under the Electricity Supply Act DOMLEC is authorized to change
its electricity rates with the approval of the Minister responsible for
electricity, presently the Minister of Communications ard Works. Although
there are provisions in the Act for changes not approved by the Minister to
be referred to a Public Utility Commission for determination it has never
been necessary for them co be exercised.
2.09     Although DOMLEC's average tariff is reasonable by reference to
long-term supply costs, a 10% increase is necessary for financial reasons
(para. 3.34). Some imiprovements tc the company's tariff structure (Annex
2.1) were introduced in June 1984 upon the recommendaticn of consultants.
A flat rate per kWh was replaced by separate rate levels for each customer
class. Domestic consumers are charged at an increasing block rate,
industrial consumers are charged time-of-day rates and commercial consumers
are charged for each kW of installed capacity together with a flat energy



- 5 -
charge. In addition to the foregoing charges a fuel surcharge is made for
each kWh sold to recover additional fuel costs in excess of a basic cost
established in 1978. A 1985 CARICOM financed study formulated marginal
cost taritfs for each consumer group and concluded that present tariffs for
industrial and commercial consumers were higher than marginal costs while
those for domestic consumers were lower. During negotiations it was agree'!
that by March 31, 1988 DOMLEC would prepare a program for establishing a
new tariff structure and rate levels taking into account the
recommendations of the CARICOM-financed study, exchange views with the
Association on the program and implement the program after taking into
account the comments of the Association. Government would take or cause
DOMLEC to take all meac":es required to ensure prompt implementatioll of the
program. DOMLEC's financial controller (para 3.29) would, as one of his
tasks, adlust the proposed structural changes to make them consistent with
DOMLEC's targeted revenue requirements (para 3.36).

2.10     The major power sector constraints are insufficient skilled
manpower and because of the small size of DOMLEC, the lack of available in-
house specialist expertise to deal with planning and technical problems
outside DOMLEC's day-to-day operations. The Project addresses these issues
by providing finance for: (a) a project manager; (b) technical assistance
to give support to regular staff; and (c) a comprehensive training program.
3. THE PROJECT
The Power Market
3.01     About 45,000 inhabitants, or 53% of the population, had access to
electricity services in 1986. Average electricity consumption per capita
was about 214 kWh/year and installed power generating capacity was about 89
watts per inhabitant. These indices are among the lowest in the Caribbean
Community (CARICOM). Hurricane David caused complete interruption of the
electricity supply in August 1979 and destroyed much of the transmission
and distribution installations. Restoration work was completed by the end
of 1983 and in that year consumption recovered its 1978 level. The
Government with the help of a USAID grant: (i) strengthened the generation
system in 1985; and (ii) is completing the electrification of the East
Coast and providing a transmission ring around the coast, where nearly all
population is concentrated.
3.02     Electricity consumption grew at an average rate of 11.2% p.a.
between 1983 and 1986, reaching 19.6 GWh in 1986. This rate is high
because it was only in 1983 that consumption recovEred the pre-hurricane
level of 1978 (para. 3.01). The average annual growth rate between 1978
and 1986 was 4.2%. Residential consumption has traditionally accounted fot
slightly over half of the demand, whereas the industrial consumption has
accounted for less than 10%. Based on the prospects of a wider access of
the population to electricity services and to the Government's sustained
moderate economic growth, it is expected that consumption will reach about
30.5 GWh in 1995, r-.presenting an average increase of 5% per year. This
rate of growth for electricity consumption relates to the expected average
GDP growth of about 3% per year in the next decade.



- 6 -
3.03     Electricity losses have been high in the post-hurricane years
averaging over 20% of net generation between 1980 and 1983. Consequently
DOMLEC carried out a loss reduction study in 1983 and started implementing
it the following year. As a result of better control on electricity theft
and meter calibration, as well as installation of capacitor banks, losses
dropped to 17.8% in 1984 and 15.1% in 1985. It is expected that continuing
surveillance of non-technical losses and the distribution component of the
Project will progressively reduce losses to 13% by 1989 and keep them at
that level during Project implementation (paras. 3.10b. and 3.44).
The Expansion Program
3.04     The existing generation facilities have an effective capacity of
6.6 MW and an annual energy capability of 28.6 GWh firm and 37.8 GWh
average. Taking into account reserve requirements and market fGrecast,
additional generation facilities would ideally be required in 1990. Due to
time constraints and financial availability however, it is expected that
these facilities would not be completed until 1991. Even though the 1990
reserves would be below a normally planned level, DOMLEC will be able to
get through this critical year by concentrating its efforts on a
maintenance program for generation units. The Project addresses this issue
by assisting in the training of diesel maintenance staff (para. 3.10d).
3.05     A 1984 study financed by CDB and carried out by con;altants
(Shaw,inigan/Lavalin) showed the economic feasibility of expanding
generation through the use of hydro-electric resources.  A survey of the
major basins indicated that the least-cost options were in the Roseau River
where the two existing hydro plants were developed. Since the oil prices
dropped sharply in late 1985, a reevaluation of the feasibility of the
hydro scheme selected in the 1984 study against a diesel alternative was
necessary. The hydro-based expansion is more economical than an all-diesel
alternative for a wide range of credible oil price sce..arios (Annex 3.2,
para. 8). A break-even discount rate favorable to an all-diesel
alternative of 9% would require diesel prices to be about 2/3 of the low
forecast. Such an hypothesis corresponds to a cost of US$81bbl. of crude
oil in the international market in 1995. The likelihood of such an event
is now considered to be remote; therefore the decision to base the system
expansion on an indigenous resource such as hydro is clearly justified.
3.06     The 1987-1993 expansion program comprises: (i) in 1987, the
completion of the rural electrification project funded by USAID and
complemented by DOMLEC's internal resources, as well as normal additions
and rcplacements to the distribution network; and (ii) between 1988 and
1993, all investment needed as part of the Project.

Prolect Backaround
3.07     The Project, which was identified in May 1984, was prepared by
Government and DOMLEC with the assistance of consultants and wns appraised
in October 1986. Negotiations were held in Washington from February 17 to
19, 1987. The Dominican delegation was led by Mr. Frank Baron, Chairman of
the Board of DOMLEC.
Project Objectives and Relation to the Sector
3.08     The main project objectives are to:
(a)  provide adequate expansion of the generation, transmission and
distribution facilities to effect fuel savings and meet the growth
of electricity consumption between 1989 and 1994;
(b)  strengthen DOMLEC institutionally by providing outside management
services and training of technical personnel; and
(c) assist DOMLEC in planning system expansion to meet its long-term
energy requirements.
3.09     These objectives address relevant sector needs, taking into
account that:
(a)  electricity consumption in the island recovered its pre-hurricane
level in 1983 and experienced high annual increases in 1984
(14.8%) and 1985 (11.5%) due to the full restoration of the
electric services;
(b)  the present generation system relies heavily on diesel generation
for meeting the load during the dry season;
(c)  power losses are still high despite progress in reducing losses as
a percentage of net generation from 20.8Z in 1983 to 15.1Z in
1985;
(d)  technical and financial planning capability is scant and has 'teen
weakened by the withdrawal of Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC) technical assistance;
(e)  more-qualified personnel are necessary to adequately plan,
construct, manage and operate DOMLEC's expanding system;
(f)  existing studies of basins other than the Roseau River are
insufficient for a decision on a logical sequence of sites for
further hydro development.
Project Description
3.10     The Project consists of the following components:
(a)  Generation
The proposed project would provide the system with some additional
22.7 MWh of yearly average energy capability, 11.8 GWh of yearly
firm energy, 4.6 MW of peak capacity in the dry season and 4.0 MW
of peak capacity in the wet season (Annex 3.2, Attachment 1).
Part of these additions are generated in the Project hydroplants
and part in the existir.g Trafalgar and Padu hydroplants by
increasing the minimum and average flows. The generation
component consists of the following:



(1) diversion of an average flow of 0.20 m3/I from the Clarke's
River into the Fresh Wacer Lake; the scheme consists of a
cemented rubble masonry dam and a polyethylene pipe (1991);
(ii)  a concrece dam at Fresh Water Lake to increase the storage
volume by 512,000 m3 (1991);
(iii)  a 1131 kW hydroplant located at Laudat in the Roseau River
(1991);
(iv)  a 2844 kW expansion to the Trafalgar hydro plant in the
Roseau River (1992);
Further details on these generation facilities are given in Annex
3.2, Attachment 5.
(b) Transmission and distribution system (1988-1993)
Improvements and expansion to the exibting system between 1988 and
1993, including the loss reduction program, consist of the
following:
(i) construction and reconductoring of about 20 km of 11 kV
transmission lines;
(ii)  construction and improvement of about 20 km of 11 kV
primary distribution lines and about 32 km of 400/230 V
secondary lines;
(iii)  installation of about 4 x 150 kVAr capacitor banks for loss
reduction;
(iv)  installation of about 1500 kVA of distribution
transformers, customers' metering equipment (about 3,000
customers), service droDs and street lighting.
(c)  Acquisition of equipment, tools, vehicles for operation and
maintenance
This includes mainly the acquisition of mobile and fixed meter
calibration sets; micro-computer hardware and software; tools for
generation, transmission and distribution maintenance; radio
communication equipment; and about 20 light trucks and specialized
vehicles for operation and maintenance.
(d) Training Program
Implementation of a training program to upgrade DOMLEC's staff
skills. The program will consist of scholarships abroad for
DOMLEC technical staff; specific in-house training programs for
plant operators and maintenance staff and linemen with the
assistance of outside experts, and training materials and
equipment.
(e)  Engineering and Consultant Services
(1) Consultants' services for providing managerial,
administrative, financial art technical assistance to
DOMLEC eor the duration of the project;



- 9 -
(ii)  Consultants' services for engineering and supervision of
the construction of the hydroelectric works;
(iii)  Individual expert services for project management of the
hydroelectric works on behalf of DOMLEC;
(iv)  Individual expert services for monitoring of the loss
reduction program;
(v)  Consultants' services for planning system expansion to meet
demand growth beyond 1993, including feasibility studies
related to the development of new hydroelectric schemes
after the Roseau River potential is fully harnessed;
(vi)  Consultants' services for feasibility study of a
dispatching center;
(vii)  Individual experts services for assisting the Forestry
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture in the review of
its staffing and training needs and in the management of
the National Park.
(f) General Investment
Includes all necessary investment in building expansiorn, office
furniture and other items related to DOMLEC's operations.
Project Cost
3.11     The total project cost, including physical and price
contingencies, is estimated at US$16.7 million, of which US$13.0 million
(77%) is the foreign exchange component. This estimate does not include
import taxes and other duties because DOMLEC is exempt from these levies.
The summary table in Chapter 1, shows the breakdown by project components
and Annex 3.3 provides further details. Total financing requirements,
including financing charges (US$1.6 million) are estimated at US$18.3
million, of which US$14.0 million would be in foreign exchange. Project
component costs are based on detailed estimates at January 1987 prices,
using the following elements:
(i) design studies at the bidding level for the generation
works prepared by consultants (Shawinigan/Lavalin); the
costs for the generation works are broken down by the five
major contracts which will result from the procurement of
goods and services for these works (para. 3.22);
(ii)  transmission and distribution expansion assessment by
DOMLEC;
(iii)  training program contents and costs by individual
consultant provided by IDA;
(iv)  consultant services of 95 staff-months for the engineering
and supervJsion of the construction of the generation works
based on a review made by the Government of the
Shawinigan/Lavalin's proposal; 56 staff-months for the
generation works Project Manager; 45 staff-months for
general technical assistance, including managerial



- 10 -
services, monitoring of the loss reduction program and
assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture for the
management of the National Park; and 35 staff-months for
the expansion planning studies and for the feasibility
study of a dispatch center. These estimates have been
reviewed by IDA and are considered adequate.
3.12     Physical contlngencies amount to 7.6% of the project base costs
and they have been calculated on the basis of experience with similar
projects as follows: 12.5% for the generation civil works; 5% for the
generation electromechanical works and pipeline supplies; 10% for
transmission, distribution, expansion planning and dispatch center studies,
and general investment; and 8% for generation works engineering and
construction supervision.
3.13     Price contingencies amount to 6.5% of the base cost including
physical contingencies. They have been calculated at the following annual
rates (i) for foreign costs: 3% for 1987, 1% for 1988 to 1990, 3.5% for
1991 to 1993; and (ii) for local costs: 4% for 1987 and 1988 and equal to
foreign costs for the remaining years.

3.15     The US$3 million IDA credit would be equal to about 16% of the
project financing requirements and would be used to finance equipment,
tools and vehicles for operation and maintenance, training and technical
assistance, engineering consulting services for construction and
supervision of the hydro scheme and studies for expansion planning and for
a dispatch center. As indicated in the above table and in Annex 3.4 giving
details of co-financing arrangements, other finance would come from CCCE
(civil works for New Trafalgar and steel pipeline), EIB (electromechanical
and transmission and distribution equipment), CDB (civil workts for Laudat,
Clarke's diversion and Fresh Water Lake dam) and CIDA (woodstave pipe). As
a condition of credit effectiveness, CCCE, CDB, CIDA and EIB should have
notified the Association that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness
or of the first disbursement of their finance have been met. CCCE, CDB and
EIB conducted their appraisals at the same time as the Association. Their
finance, which is scheduled for approval in the first quarter of 1987, is
expected to be made available to DOMLEC through Government on the following
terms. CIDA finance is expected to be approved in the second quarter of
1987 and will be made available to D0MLEC as a grant.

Relcndirng Term,s
3.16     During negotiations it was agreed that Government will onlend the
proceeds of the IDA credit to DOMLEC for a 20-year term, including a 5-year
grace period, at the Bank's current interest rate of 7.92% per annum.
DOMLEC would bear the foreign exchange risk and as a proxy for this and to
simplify the administrative burden on the company the loan would be
denominated in US dollars. It was also agreed that, in the event of
DOMLEC's license to generate and supply electricity, which expires in 2001
(para. 3.27), not being renewed by Government, the oatstanding balance due
by DOMLEC to Government would immediately become repayable. The execution
of the subsidiary loan would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
Project Implementation
3.17     Basic design and bidding documents for the hydro scheme were
completed in February 1987 by consultants (Shawinigan/Lavalin) retained by
the Government under a contract funded by CDB. As a condition of
effectiveness, DOMLEC would be required to employ consultants on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association, for the tendering process as well
as for detailed engineering design and construction supervision of the
hydro scheme.2 All the engineering required for distribution and
2/ In December 1986 IDA reviewed a proposal made by Shawinigan/Lavalin for
providing such services and agreed that these consultants be retained
provided there is an agreement, acceptable to the Association, between
the consultants and DOMLEC as to the allocation of the consultant
personnel in the office headquarters and in the field and the resulting
contract cost. This agreement should be reached by mid-March 1987; in
case there is no agreement by that date, DOMLEC should promptly invite
a short list of consultants to present proposals.

transmission works will be provided by DOMLEC which has adequate expertise.
Any special problems related to the transmission that exceed DOMLEC's
technical capability will be handled with the technical assistance provided
by the Project. Distribution and transmission works will be carried out by
force account by DOMLEC which has handled satisfactorily, time and cost-
wise, a similar volume of works during the last few years. The Project
would be completed by December 31, 1993.
3.18     DOMLEC has already appointed a Project Manager with qualifications
and under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Assoc.ation. During
negotiations it was agreed that DOMLEC will not later than December 31,
1987 employ consultants, under terms of reference already agreed between
IDA and DOMLEC, to: i) prcvide technical assistance in the management,
financial and technical areas; ii) review the staffing and training needs
of the Forestry Department (para 3.42). It was also agreed that DOMLEC
would submit:  (i) not later than September 30, 1987 an implementation plan
for carrying out the Project training component, and not later than
December 31 each year thereafter, until Project completion, a report of
training activities undertaken or to be undertaken during the year, and a
detailed plan covering training activities to be undertaken during the
following year; (ii) not later than December 31, 1987, employ ur.der terms
and conditions acceptable to the Association and Government an expert to
assist the Forestry Department from time to time in the management of the
National Park during Project construction (para. 3.42); iii) not later than
January 31, 1991 employ consultants to carry out studies related to system
expansion planning and to the feasibility of a dispatch center on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association.
3.19     The employment of consultants for the detailed engineering and
construction supervision of the hydro generation works in early 1987 would
permit an earlier commissioning of Laudat power plant, Clarke's River
diversion and Fresh Water Lake as the tendering process could start as soon
as the zontract with the consultants was signed. Project benefits would
increase because these project components economically replace diesel fuel
consumption (Annex 3.7).

services for in-house training (about US$94,000, item iii above), includes
such items as scholarships abroad (about US$263,000), and training
equipment and materials (about US$114,000) which will be procured through
direct purchase and international shopping respectively.
3.22     Five contracts will be awarded to carry out the hydro generation
works:
(i) Civil works for Laudat power plant (including powerhouse),
Clarke's River diversion and Fresh Water Lake dam and pipe
erection associated with Laudat and Clarke's River
diversion with an estimated value of US$3.1 million to be
procured under international competitive bidding according
to CDB guidelines;
(ii) Civil works, power house and pipe erection for New
Trafalgar with an estimated value of US$2.0 million to be
procured under CCCE procedures which ensure satisfactory
competition;
(iii) Electromechanical equipment supply and erection for the
whole hydro scheme. It would also include miscellaneous
gates and valves for erection under the two above
contracts. This contract has an estimated value of US$2.8
million and will be procured according to EIB guidelines,
which ensure adequate competition;
(iv) Woodstave pipe supply and erection supervision for the
whole hydro scheme with an estimated value of US$1.6
million to be procured in Canada under CIDA grant
procedures; and
(v) Steel pipe supply and erection supervision for the whole
hydro scheme with an estimated value of US$1.0 million to
be procured under CCCE procedures.
3.23     Three contracts for the supply of equipment and materials for the
distribution and transmission expansion with a total estimated value of
US$1.8 million would be procured under EIB guidelines. Goods and services
which are related to general investment needs of DOMLEC (about US$370
thousand) will be procured according to DOMLEC's own regulations, which are
adequate to handle in an efficient way small purchases through the duration
of the project. During the procurement and construction stages of the
project IDA will review the timing of the procurement and supply of goods
and services financed by other donors to ensure that it is consistent with
the project implementation schedule
3/  Provision is included in the IDA credit for the financing of this
position after the contract of the appointed project manager, which is
funded by UNDP, terminates in June 1989.

Disbursements
3.24     Proceeds from the proposed IDA credit would be disbursed for:
(a) 100% of the expenditures related to the consulting services for:
(i) the engineering and supervision of the construction of the
hydro generation works; (ii) studies related to expansion planning
and to the feasibility of a dispatch center; (iii) technical
assistance in the managerial, financial and technical areas;
(b) 1002 of the foreign expenditures related to the training program
for scholarships and training experts services;
(c) 100% of the foreign expenditures for equipment, tools, vehicles
for operation and maintenance, and for training equipment and
materials.
3.25     The proposed credit would be disbursed over a period of seven
years (Annex 3.6), in accordance with the applicable IBRD/IDA standard
disbursement profile. The closing date for the credit would be June 30,
1994. Disbursement requests would be fully documented, except for imported
goods whose value is less than US$200,000 equivalent which would be based
on presentation of a statement cf expenditures. A special account would be
established in the National Commercial Bank of Dominica with a deposit of
US$0.25 million. Periodic replenishment would be made to this account
against withdrawal applications received from DOMLEC and supported by such
documents as the Association requires. The Borrower would be required to
have annual audits for the project accounts, special account and
withdrawals based on statement of expenditures. Retroactive financing for
up to US$100,000 is proposed for the payment of the consultants for
detailed engineering and construction supervision for expenses incurred and
paid by the Borrower after February 1, 1987 (Para. 3.19).
Proiect Benefits aid Justification
3.26     The proposed project would help improve the power sector's
efficiency and would enable minimum system expansion requirements to meet
load growth expectations. The project is justified as being the least-cost
expansion program of the sector's generation, transmission and distribution
systems (para. 3.05 and Annex 3.2). A measure of the minimum benefits
associated with this program is given by the incremental sales revenue and
by the saving of diesel fuel through increased hydro generation (Annex
3.7). Based on valuing the former at the current average tariff and the
latter at the prices of diesel in Dominica derived from expected evolution
of crude oil prices in the international market, the rate of return of the
project is e2timated to be about 11 percent, which compares favorably with
the opportunity cost of capital in Dominica (10 percent). The project,
however, is likely to generate additional social benefits accruing from
increased employment opportunities and expanded residential and public use
of electricity, as well as additional economic benefics accruing to
production from a more reliable electricity supply. Sensitivity analysis
shows that rates of return of 10% would still result if investment costs
are 10% higher or benefits are 10% lower than now estimated.

Implementation AQtency
3.27     DOMLEC is a government-owned corporation which was incorporated
under the Companies Ordinance in 1975. Under the 1976 Electricity Supply
Act DOMLEC is given a sole and exclusive licence to generate, transmit,
distribute and sell electricity for a 25-year period commencing June 1,
1976 (para. 3.16).  Government appoints DOMLEC's Chairman and its Board of
Directors who have all been drawn from the private sector. Up to 1983,
when Government purchased its shares, the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) had a majority interest in DOMLEC.  Government wishes to
encourage lccal citizens and employees of DOMLEC to participate in the
ownership of the company and has recently offered 60% of its shares for
public subscription.
3.28     The major responsibilities of DOMLEC's Board include approval of
annual budgets, major capital investments, and senior staff appointments
and compensation. MCW approves tariff increases, monitors DOMLEC's
operations through regular reports, assists in major investment planning
and is consulted by DOMLEC's Chairman on all matters of major importance.
These arrangements are working well.
3.29     DOMLEC's organizational structure (Annex 3.8) is satisfactory and
its staff is expected to be capable of running the company's day-to-day
operations effectively. The company employs about 125 people including
four professional engineers and one graduate technician. DOMLEC's staff
turnover has been low. Its Managing Director is a qualified and capable
engineer satisfactory to the Association. DOMLEC's financial staff is to
be strengthened by the appointment of a Financial Controller. During
negotiations it was agreed that DOMLEC would only appoint to the positions
of Managing Director and Financial Controller persons having qualifications
and experience satisfactory to the Association. It was further agreed that
a Financial Controller with such qualifications and experience would be
appointed not later than September 30, 1987.
3.30     To ensure satisfactory project implementation DOMLEC will need to
employ engineering consultants (para. 3.17). A project manager has already
been employed. DOMLEC requires specialist assistance for technical and
engineering services, for which it would not, because of the small size of
its operations, be cost effective to employ full-time staff. Consequently,
the project includes provisions for such services (para. 3.17).
3.31     A recent USAID-financed project includes training for DOMLEC's
senior managers. However, few of DOMLEC's technicians have had any formal
training and the level of their technical skills needs to be improved if
they are to cope effectively with DOMLEC's enlarging operations and with
more advanced technology. Consequently, the project includes a training
component (Annex 3.9) which would include on-the-job training for middle-
level supervisors and technicians (paras. 3.10 and 3.17). A Human
Resources Development Committee, which includes senior management as well
as DOMLEC's personnel officer, would be capable of implementing the
training component.
Financial Performance and Prospects
3.32     Annex 3.10 contains supplementary information about DOMLEC's
finances together with historical and projected income statements, source
and application of funds statements, balance sheets and key financial



- 17 -
indicators. In the five-year period 81-85 DOMLEC's finances have been
marked by good but declining rates of return varying from 20% for 1982 to
13% in 1985, an average annual growth in kWh sold of about 10% following
serious hurricane damage in 1979, and a much improved capital structure
with a debt/equity ratio of 30/70 at December 31, 1985 mainly resulting
from the reinvestment of earnings. Nevertheless, as DOMLEC's earnings were
absorbed by capital spending, the company was left with a weak liquid
position in 1986 with bank overdraft facilities being fully utilized and no
access to further facilities. Furthermore, DOMLEC's average costs have
been increasing more rapidly than its average revenues.
3.33     DOMLEC's electricity rates (excluding fuel surcharges) have
changed little since 1979 (apart from a tar4.ff restructuring in 1964 which
resulted in a 5% increase in average rates). After taking into account
fuel surcharges DOMLEC's average revenue per kwh sold increased by about
12% between 1981 and 1985 as a result of an increasing proportion of
electricity production through oil. This trend will be reversed as the
hydro-facilities provided by the project come into operation. 1985 average
electricity rates of 16 US cents per kWh are lower than some countries in
the West Indies but nevertheless high by world standards.
3.34     A 10% tariff increase (excluding the fuel surcharge) was approved
effective April 1, 1987 which would reduce DOMLEC's future dependance on
limited bank overdraft facilities. The overall effect of the tariff
increase, after taking into account the fuel surcharge, is estimated to
increase the average rate charged to consumers by about 7%. Despite the
tariff increase it is expected that DOMLEC's rate of return would decline
to about 5% in 1987 because a USAID grant-funded rural electrification
project would considerably add to fixed assets in service in that year.
3,~J5    Although some further increases in electricity rates (excluding
fuel surcharges) would be required during project implementation it is
expected that these would be more than offset by reductions in fuel
surcharges as the project hydro facilities are placed in operation. It is
estimated that by 1993 the average price to the consumer would have
declined by about 13%. To meet the minimum rate of return requirements
(para. 3.36) it is estimated that becween 1988 and 1993 the following
nominal tariff increases to the basic tariff (excluding fuel surcharges)
would be needed: 1988 2.2%; 1989 2.3%; 1990 3.9%; 1992 11.4%; 1993 6%.
3.36     To help finance its immediate and future capital needs it was
agreed during negotiations that DOMLEC would maintain its tariffs at a
level sufficient to earn a rate of return on average net fixed assets in
operation, revalued from time to time when required by the Association, of
not less than 6% in 1988 and 1989, and 7% thereafter. It was also agreed
that, before October 1 each year, DOMLEC will furnish to the Association a
preliminary estimate of its rate of return for the current fiscal year and
a forecast for the next fiscal year. Further, it was agreed that, if the
estimates indicate that DOMLEC would not meet the rate of return
requiiements, it will promptly take all necessary measures to meet such
requirements.  It was also agreed during negotiations that Government will
authorize any tariff increases required to meet the agreed rates of return.



- 18 -
3.37     By project completion DOMLEC is expected to strengthen its
finances considerably and to reduce its present over-reliance on debt to
finance its future investments. As a result of the project, fuel is
expected to decline 'rom 32Z of operating costs in 1987 to 3% in 1993 while
depreciation would increase from 17% to 32% in the same period. After
project completion, DOMLEC will have a satisfactory debt service coverage
of 1.3 as well as a strong debt/equity ratio of 54/46.
3.38     To protect DOMLEC's financial viability it was agreed during
negotiations that (a) DOMLEC would not incur any new debt (other than for
the project) without the prior approval of the Association unless its
future debt service coverage ratio is 1.5 or higher and (b) would not
undertake any investments in excess of $250,00 (other than the project)
until project completion unless it has furnished the Association with
satisfactory evidence that such investments are technically, financially
and economically justified and that DOMLEC will have adequate financial
resources to carry out the investments.
3.39     As mentioned in para. 3.27 Government has recently offered to sell
60% of its shares to the general public. Although DOMLEC's immediate cash
position would not be adequate to pay dividends, it is expected that,
providing the agreed rates of return are achieved, DOMLEC would be able to
pay dividends in the future without jeopardizing the financing of the
project. To avoid this it was agreed during negotiations that, until
project completion, dividends would not be paid except out of net income
for the year and not in excess of 10% of the issued and paid-up -walue of
the ordinary shares. It is estimated that during project implementation
such dividends, if any, would not exceed 2% of the estimated project costs.
3.40     DOMLEC's accounting records, a substantial part of which are
computerized, have been well maintained and financial statements are
prepared monthly and compared with annual budgets. The level of
receivables has been gradually reduced and should reach a satisfactory
level of about 60 days by the end of 1986. Annual audits have been carried
out by the international firm, Cooper and Lybrand, and audit reports have
been issued within six months of the company's fiscal year end. At
negotiations it was agreed that DOMLEC will continue to engage independent
auditors satisfactory to the Association and that DOMLEC's audited accounts
would be submitted to the Association not later than six months after the
end of its fiscal year.
Environmental Aspects
3.41     The Project is not expected to have any major detrimental effect
on the environment, mainly because the nature and small size of the
generation works would not cause any material changes to the natural
conditions (Annex 3.11). There will be no people directly affected by the
Project who would require resettlement or any other special action. The
storage capacity of the existing Fresh Water Lake will be increased by
about 512,000 m by diverting about 0.2 m3/s of water from the Clark River
and by building a small additional dam that will raise the water level in
about 6 m. These relatively small works are not expected to have any
adverse impact on the National Park or on its use. The National Park has a
total area of 6400 ha'. of which only about 5.5 ha. would be flooded; the
land flooded is of no special importance and is well represented elsewhere



- 19 -
in the National Park. Only minor improvements will be required tc the
existing roads giving access to the construction sites. Small construction
equipment and labor intensive techniques will be used. Work crews will be
brought into the area daily. No transmission facilicies will be built in
the National Park. The 11 kV transmission from New TrafalgaL to Fond Cole
will be built parallel to an existing 11 kV line, with minimum addition of
right-of-way requirements. Distribution expansion in the urban centers
will be implemented in accordance with DOMLEC's standards with due regard
to environmental and aesthetic considerations. 4
3.42     During negotiations it was agreed that Government would take or
cause DOMLEC to take all measures required to ensure that the Project is
carried out with due regard to ecological and environmental factors. It
was also agreed that DOMLEC would employ by December 31, 1987: i) an expert
to assist, from time to time, in the management of the National Park during
project constructlon (para 3.18): (a) to help ensure that such a
construction will nave a minimum effect on the National Park flora and
fauna, and will not interfere with the normal use of the National Park by
the public; and (b) to provide technical assistance in the preservation of
the wildlands which constitute the National Park; and ii) a consultant to
review the staff and training needs of the Forestry Department. It was
also agreed with Government and DOMLEC that they would: i) install road
signs and warnings on access roads to the construction sites identifying
the National Park and restricting speed limits; ii) forbid work night
shift; iii) ensure that construction material will be normally obtained
from sources outside the National Park. If it is necessary to obtain such
material inside the Park to avoid significant additions to material costs,
then the borrowing areas will be restored to ;-heir initial state to the
extent possible; and iv) ensure that no spoils will be dumped in the
National Park.
Project Risks
3.43     The generation component is subject to the risks normally
associated with the cor.struction of civil works in areas where dry and wet
seasons are well marked as most of the work on the dams associated with the
power plants, the Clarke River diversion and Fresh Water Lake regulation
are to be implemented during the dry seasons. If most of the construction
cannot be carried out during the dry seasons, a delay of up to nine months
in the -ompletion of the generation facilities may occur. Based on the
field investigations and given the small size of the civil works and its
simplicity of design, the hydro scheme is believed to be free of major
geological problems. The other project components face no special physical
risk. Design standards for generation, transmission and distribution
facilities take into account wind gust velocity and seismic factors as
appropriate. A Project Manager has been engaged and technical assistance
will be provided (para. 3.18) to assist DOMLEC during the implementation of
the proposed project and to strengthen DOMLEC's managerial and technical
capacity. The project cost estimates include adequate allowances for
physical and price contingencies, and no major cost overrun is expected
(paras. 3.12 and 3.13). The successful operation of the hydro scheme is
closely linked to the skills of the operating personnel and to adequate
maintenance of its civil works and electromechanical equipment. The
project includes a training component to improve the capacity of the

su4table British standards.

operating and maintenance personnel and to acquaint it with the equipment
that is technologically new to DOMLEC; at negotiations, agreoment was
reached with DOMLEC that the hydrn installatiros will be monitored and
inspected after completion at least once every two years by experts
acceptable to IDA and that a copy of the inspection report; would be
submitted to IDA.
Performance Indicators
3.44     Project execution will be monitored against target dates shown in
the implementation schedule (Annex 3.5). DOMLEC't operational, financial
and managerial performance would be monitored through indicators shown in
Annex 3.12.

ANNEX 2.1
DOMINICA
Electricity Tariffs
1.       The Electricity Supply Act of 1976 authorizes DOMLEC to change its
electricity rates with the approval of the Minister responsible for
electricity. If the Minister approves the proposed amendments, notice is
published in the Government Gazette. If within 60 days of receipt of
proposed tariff changes by DOMLEC the Minister disapproves or does not
approve such tariff changes, the company may refer the matter for
determination by a Public Utility Commission, established in 1972. Up to
now it has never been necessary for DOMLEC to refer any proposed tariff
changes to the Commission.
2.       It is estimated that DOMLEC's total average electricity rates for
1986 will be about 16 US cents per kWh including a fuel surcharge of 3.5 US
cents per kWh. Although the total average rate is high by world standards,
other countries in the region near Dominica, such as Belize and St.
Vincent, have higher rates. The high rates largely reflect the unavoidably
high unit cost of supplying a small population. Between 1981 and 1985
total average electricity rates (excluding the sales tax - see para 5)
increased by 12%. As a percentage of total rates the fuel surcharge grew
from 10% in 1981 to 15% in 1985 because of the need to meet increasing
demand by electricity produced by oil. The average base rate for
electricity increased by about 5% during this period because of the
structural changes referred to in the next paragraph.
3.       DOMLEC's tariff structure (Attachment) was revised in June 1984 on
the recommendation of consultants. In addition to a fuel surcharge
introduced in 1978 to recover fuel costs over a base price of EC$1.41 per
imperial gallon, separate rate levels were established for each customer
class as well as installed capacity charges for industrial and commercial
classes. A two-step block energy rate is used for domestic consumers, with
a rate of EC 28.5 cents (US$10.5 cents) for consumption up to 50 units, and
a time-of-day tariff for industrial consumers using maximum power ratings
of not less than 5 KVA. A service charge is made for each KVA of installed
capacity for commercial consumers with a flat energy charge. Between 1979,
when electricity rates were about doubled to help DOMLEC finance
reconstruction costs following a severe hurricane, and the June 1984
revisions, electricity rates were at a flat rate of 32.5 EC cents per unit
for all consumers.
4.       On January 1, 1986 Government introduced a consumption tax on oil
purchased by DOMLEC. This tax, which has varied from month to month with
the base fuel price, has equalled about 50% of the cost of fuel oil to
DOMLEC thus increasing the fuel surcharge to consumers. However, this
extra charge has more or less been compensated for by the cancellation of a
10% sales tax on electricity bills from January 1, 1986.



- 24 -
5.       A tariff study financed by the Caricom Secretariat was completed
in November 1985. The study requires further review and analysis and the
development of an action plan before its recommendations could be applied.
To assist in this task the project will provide management services.
6.       A calculation of long-run marginal costs suggests that present
average tariffs are about 15% above long-run marginal costs which would
tend to decline as the present plant mixture of run-of-river hydro plant
and diesel plant becomes by 1992 substantially a hydro system.

which the Industrial Rate is applicable in cases where the consumer
concerned has not requested in writing to be charged at the Lighting Rate
as follows:
A service charge of $4.00 per month per kVA of installed capacity
plus 36.3 cents per unit in any month subject to the minimum
monthly charge of the service charge.
E. Street Lighting
Applies to all electricity supplied for the purpose of lighting
streets and roads mainly at nights throughout the Commonwealth of Dominica.
Notwithstanding any other stipulation, the rate of electricity for Street
Lighting shall be 37 cents per unit.
F. Fuel Surcharge
In addition to the charges set out above, the Company shall add or
deduct per unit consumed, a fuel surcharge which shall be calculated from
the following formula:
The total alumber of imperial gallons of diesel fuel consumed in
all the Company's generating stations in Dominica during the
calendar month immediately preceeding the calendar mojth in which
the meters are read;
multiplied by -
the current price less the base price -
divided by -
the total units sold by the Company in Dominica during the
calendar month immediately preceeding the calendar month in which
the meters are read.
In this context base price means $1.4066 cents per imperial
gallon.
Current price means the price payable in cents per imperial gallon
for diesel fuel delivered to the Company at Fond Cole Power
Station on the last day of the calendar month immediately
preceeding the calendar month in which meters are read.
G. Consumer Deposit
Consumers are required to maka a deposit equivalent to an
estimated two months' electricity consumption. This amount is placed in a
deposit account in the consumer's name and held as security for monies due
to the Company. It gains interest at the rate of 4 percent per annum and
is refundable on termination of the service and upon settlement of all
amounts owing.



- 27 -
H. Reconnection Fee
A fee of $22.00 is payable for reconnection after disconnection
for non-payment of electricity bills. No fee is payable by a consumer
whose supply was disconnected as a result of hurricane damage and who has
settled all previous electricity accounts up to date.
I. Transfer of Service
A consumer requesting a transfer of service from one location to
another is required to pay a fee of $5.00 provided that the new location is
within 100 ft (30 meters) from the nearest suitable pole. The extra
material required for supply at a distance in excess of 100 ft must be paid
for separately.
J. Service Call
A fee of $5.00 is payable where the fault proves to be in the
consumer's installation.

ANNEX 3.1
DOMINICA
POWER PROJECT
NOTES ON THE POWER MARKET
Sales Prolections
1.       Attachment 1 provides historic and forecast sales for 1976-1995.
The historic period is marked by the Hurricane David, which caused complete
interruption of the electricity supply in August 1979 and destroyed much of
the transmission and distribution works. By the end of 1983 the DOMLEC
power system was restored to the size and capability that existed prior to
the hurricane.
2.       The current forecast is based upon an assessment made by
consultants (Shawinigan/Lavalin) as part of the 1984 feasibility study on
the expansion of hydroelectric resources. Adjustments to this forecast
were made by DOMLEC to reflect actual consumption during the years 1984
(second semester), 1985 and 1986 (first semester) and were considered
reasonable by the Bank. The consultant used three approaches to forecast
the market: (i) detailed analysis of consumption for each customer
category; (ii) global estimate based upon an analysis of consumption
trends; (iii) global estimate based upon a correlation between total
electricity consumption and GDP and electricity price.
The first method, although more involved, was preferred because it
adequately reflects: (i) Government and DOMLEC policies as to desirable
rates of electrification in view of localization of potential customers and
system expansion requirements; and (ii) expected unit consumption of
existing and new consumers as a function of income. Such effects on the
market forecast may not be correlated with GDP variations or with
historical trends. Furthermore, the distortion caused by the hurricane
David on the data for 1979-1983 places caution on the use of global
estimates derived by the other two methods.
3.       The domestic sector forecast is based on estimating the number of
new customers and the consumption per customer (existing and new).
Considering that the number of domestic consumers generally saturate at
about 802 of the number of households, the current forecast for 1995 works
very close to saturation. The commercial sector forecast was developed by
correlation with the domestic sector consumption. Industrial consumption
is a very small part of total consumption - less than 10%. Industrial
consumption was estimated on the basis of unit consumption per area
occupied, number of new industries per year, and area occupied per each
industrial undertaking.  The Government has built some 6,500 m2 Of factory
shell buildings and is marketing Dominica as a location for small
industries such as garment manufacturing. Industrial participation in



- 29 -
total consumption is expected to increase to about 14% in 1995, whereas the
commercial category would drop from the current level of 30X to 25% and the
residential category and other users would remain at their present level -
about 50% and 101 respectively.
Generation Requirements
4.       Attachment 2 shows the generation requirements based on the sales
forecast (Attachment 1) and the following assumption on losses, DOMLEC's
own use and load factor.
5.       A study on power transmission and distribution loss reduction was
commissioned by CARICOM to international consultants (Adair and Brady) and
was completed in September 1984. Insses in 1983 were 20.3% of the net
energy generated, out of which 10.11 were estimated as being technical
losses    The major factors contributing to the existence of non-technical
losses were lack of meter testing facilities and instruments, lack of an
adequate consumer services department, human error, meter inaccuracy and
diversion of energy. The consultants recommendeds (i) for reduction of
technical losses: installation of some 3 MVAR of capacitor banks in the
period 1985-1989 and regulators on the Portsmouth/Marigot feeder and use of
the Melville Hale generating plant during peak hours for voltage
regulation; and (ii) for reduction of non-technical losses: reorganize the
consumer department; establish an adequate meter testing facility; seal all
meters; survey all consumers to detect unmetered or illegal services;
establish a tight control of meters and seals; training of liri crews;
introduction of a radio communication system.
6.       DOMLEC started implementing the above recommendations in 1984 and
as a result losses dropped to 17.81 in 1984 and 15.11 in 1985 and are
estimated to reduce further to 14.0% in 1986. The consultant target was to
arrive at an ultimate loss level of 9%, out of which only 0.41 could be
non-technical losses. DOMLEC does not consider it feasible or even cost-
effective to reduce non-technical losses to such a low level. Instead
DOMLEC has set a target of reducing total losses to 131 by 1989, out of
which the non-technical losses would account for some 3.51. The Bank
considers this to be a realistic and satisfactory target for planning
purposes. To achieve this, DOMLEC's management will have to continue its
commitment to combat theft and to keep meters in good order; in addition
the Project would contribute towards that target by financing a suitable
expansion of the distribution and transmission system; improvements in
communications; acquisition of vehicles, tools, metering equipment, mobile
and fixed meter testing and calibration facilities; technical assistance
for monitoring of the results and, if warranted, new recommendations to
achieve the target or redefine it; a training program for operating
personnel.
1/ HV lines 2.31; Power Transformers 1.71; Distribution Transformers 2.11;
and LV Lines 4.11 (Total does not add up to 10.11 due to round-off).

7.       DOMLEC's own use was estimated as a percentage of the generation
on the basis of the historical data (about 1.8 - 2.0X, the lower values
forecast prevailing in the end of the forecast period when less diesel
generation will be needed). In fact, it just represents steps of .1 GWh in
1987 and 1990 with respect to the use in 1.985.
8.       Given that the structure of the consumption is not expected to
change appreciably, the load factor is estimated to remain at about the
current level of 582 until 1989 and thereafter slightly increase to 591 due
to a small increase in the participation of the industrial category in the
overall consumption.

ANNEX 3.2
DOMINICA
POWER PROJECT
NOTES ON ENERGY AND POWER BALANCES
The Existing Generation Facilities
1.       Attachment 1 shows the power and energy capabilities of the
existing facilities. According to DOMLEC's experience the annual average
energy capability of the two existing hydroplants (Padu and Trafalgar) is
limited to about 15.6 GWh. This limitation would be removed with the
additional regulation provided by the increase of the Fresh Water Lake
level. Two of the Trafalgar units were commissioned in 1952, the third in
1961 and the two Pauu units in 1967.
2.       The Trafalgar and the two 110 kW Melville Hall diesel units are 15
years old and inefficient for base production (about 11 kWh/I.G.). They
should be retired when new additions to the system are timely and
financially feasible. The 250 kW diesel unit at Melville Hall is about 10
years old and its efficiency is reasonable (about 12.5 kWh/I.G.). It
should be considered for retirement between 1990-1995, the year depending
upon the reserve margin provided by the actual addition to the system. The
two 1.126 kW units at Fond Cole have a better efficiency (14.2 kWh/I.G.)
however they are about 15 years old and at least one of them is to be
considered for retirement along with the 250 kW Melville Hall unit. The
remaining unit could be possibly kept a few years more as a reserve unit.
The Expansion Program
3.       A feasibility study on the expansion of hydro-electric resources
was carried out by consultants (Shawinigan/Lavalin) and completed in
December 1984. The first phase of this study consisted of a review of the
Dominica's hydro-electric potential. It was completed in September 1983,
with the recommendation that sites on the Roseau River Valley were
evaluated on the feasibility phase. The first phase identified the
following possibilities of basin developments:
Installed        Average Energy   Average Energy Cost1
Basin         Capacity-HW             GWh/year          US cents/kWh
Roseau             5.6                  29.8                  3.8
Boeri              4.1                  25.7                  4.7
Macoucheri         4.3                  26.4                  5.4
Riviere Blanche   5.0                   30.2                  6.3
Total          19.0                 112.1                  5.1
The equivalent energy cost provided by an all-diesel engine
alternative was about US cents 11/kWh, considering that a barrel of diesel
cost over US$40 (without taxes) to DOMLEC at that time.
1/ At 10X discount rate; costs escalated to January 1987 level.

4.       The second phase of the study considered the following options for
development in the Roseau Valley:
-    diversion into the Roseau River of a portion of the Clarke's
River;
-    construction of a dam at the outlet of Fresh Water Lake to provide
daily peaking and seasonal storage;
-    new hydro power developments to develop the head between Fresh
Water Lake and the headrace or tailrace of the existing Trafalgar
power station; such a head could be developed though a single
plant (Big Trafalgar) or a combination of the expansion of the
existing Trafalgar with a new plant at Laudat or Titot Gorge;
-    extension of the existing Padu hydro station to utilize the flows
diverted from the Clarke's River and the pondage provided by the
dam at the outlet of Fresh Water Lake;
-    extension of the existing Trafalgar hydro station to better
utilize the flows of the Rcseau River.
In addition, diesel units would be scheduled to provide low water
energy backup and peaking, if economically warranted.
The characteristics of these projects are presented in attachment 2.
5.       There are several ways in which the potential of the Roseau River can
be developed. Logical sequences of hydro and diesel units were tested to seek
out a least cost sequence. For the load growth forecasts under consideration
it will be the next century before the average energy capability of the river
is completely utilized. Because of this condition, system simulations
concentrated on establishing the first development to be built.
The Clarke's River diversion and the dam at Fresh Water Lake are
extremely cost-effective options; however, they require new power plants or
extension to existing plants to effectively utilize the improved flow. Two
schemes that can do this are:
-   a new power plant at Laudat (which resulted to be slightly less
costly than Titot Gorge) plus extension to the existing Trafalgar
plus extension to the existing Padu; plus diesels;
-   a new power plant, Big Trafalgar, utilizing the full head between
Fresh Water Lake and the tailrace at Trafalgar to develop the flow
plus a smaller extencion to the existing Trafalgar plus an
extension to Padu;
6.       The Big Trafalgar scheme was considered under two different
reserve capacity conditions: (i) the two largest units; and (ii) the two
units at Big Trafalgar plus the next largest unit. The second condition



- 35 -
reflects the potentisl risk of concentrating the generation at Trafalgar,
which has a history of landslides at the cliff leading to the power
station.
Under similar reserve capacity requirements the two projects,
Laudat and Big Trafalgar, are of similar cost. When the more stringent
reserve capacity is applied. the Laudat schome becomes clearly the least
cost expansion sequence.
7.       The proposed development sequence is:
1st.     Clarke's R'.ver Diversion
Fresh Water Lake Reservoir
Laudat hydro (' x 1131 kW)
2nd.     Trafalgar hydro expansion (2 x 1422 kW)
3rd.     1 x 1100 kW diesel (or 2 units depending upon the retirement
of the s6cond Fond Cole diesel unit)
4th.     Padu hydro expansion.
Attachment 3 shows the cost comparison aniong several development
schemes as studied by the conaultants.
8.       Attachments 4 to 7 provide the energy and power balances for the
Project generation expansion and to an ali-diesel alternative, considering
the updated forecast of generation requirements (Annex 3.1, Attachment 2).
Due to time consttaints, Lauclat is seheduled for 199l1 and Trafalgar
expansion for 1992. Due to the recent fall of petroleum prices, it was
considered necessary to re-evaluate the feasibility of the hydro scheme
vis-a-vis an all-diesel alternative. Attachment 8 shows that the break
even discount rate is above the estimated opportunity cost of capital in
Dominica (10%) for a wide range of dtesel oil price scenarios. For a
probable scenario of diesel oil prices, based on recent Bank forecast, of
US$30/bbl. in 1990, US$341bbl. in 1995 and US$39/bbl. in 2000 and onwards
(placed at the thermal plant and expressed in constant January 1987
dollars) the break even discount rate would be 15%. Low and high scenarios
of 21s26:31 and 38:43:49 (in US$/bbl. for 1990, 1995, 2000) could yield
break even discount rates of 12% and 19%. For a 16:20:25 scenario, both
alternatives would be economically equivalent at the opportunity cost of
capital (10%). This may be considered however as a very low scenario.
Break even discount rates clearly favorable to the all-diesel alternative
of 8-92 require that diesel fuel prices in additton to being extremely low
in 1990 (US$12-14/bbl), were kept at such low levels as US$16-18/bbl. in
1995 and US$20-23/bbl. in 2000. A barrel of diesel oil placed in Fond Cole
at US$20 corresponds to a barrl of crude oil in Curacao, Antigua or
Trinidad at US$9 (pars. 9).
9.       Attachment 8 shows how diesel oil price estimates, at the Fond
Cole power station, were derived from crude oil international prices as
currently estimated by the Bank. It can be seen that a cost of US$20/bbl.
of crude oil in the internaional market (bank's forecast for 1995) would
correspond to a cost not less than UtS$33 per barrel of diesel oil at the
plant.

ANNEX 3.2
Attachment 2
DESCRIPTION OF THE HYDRO PROJECTS CONSIDERED IN THE FEASIBILITY STUDY OF
THE ROSEAU RIVER DEVELOPMENT.
The Clarke's River Diversion
The Clarke's River flows north eastward from Horne Macaque towards
the windward coast. The project will divert a portion of its drainage into
the Roseau River that flows towards the leeward coast. The construction
will consist of a cemented rubble masonry dam with nominally reinforced
facing and reinforced wing walls. The diverted flow will be carried
towards the Roseau River at Fresh Water Lake via a polyethylene pipe and
the existing Three Streams Diversion channel. The characteristics of the
project are:
-    drainage area diverted             1.45 km2
-    design flow diverted               0.32 m3/s
-    average flow diverted              0.20 m3/s
Fresh Water Lake Dam
Fresh Water Lake is a natural lake on the east side of Morne
Macaque and is the source of the Roseau River. It is proposed to build a
dam near the outlet of the lake to provide significant seasonal storage and
re-regulation of flows for daily peaking. The structure will comprise an
ungated concrete overflo-w weir flanked on both sides by fill embankments.
The characteristics of the project are:
-drainage area controlled
-    Clarke's River                     1.455 km2
-    Three Streams                      0.425 km2
-    Fresh Water Lake                   0.439 km2
-    Roseau River                       0.391 km2
-    Total                              2.71  km2
-storage volume                         512,000 m3
Laudat Power Plant
This power development would develop the head between Fresh Water
Lake and the existing balancing tank for Trafalgar. The main features of
the project are:
-   head                                 211 m
-   installation (1 unit)              1,131 kW
-  woodstave pipeline                  2,295 m
-   high-pressure steel pipe             347 m



r
- 38 -
Titot Power Plant
This development would be similar to the Laudat project except
that it would be located in the Titot Gorge. It would discharge into the
existing Trafalgar water conveyance system.
Big Trafalgar Power Plant
This development would utilize the entire head between Fresh Water
Lake and the Trafalgar tailrace in a single step. A new powerhouse would
be located adjacent to the existing power station. The tailrace would
discharge into a control tank built across the existing Padu pipeline which
would be designed as a grit removal chamber to improve grit removal from
the uncontrolled flows that enter the Padu system at Trafalgar. The main
features of the project are:
-     head                                  494 m
-     installation (2 units)              2,648 kW
-     woodstave pipeline                  2,275 m
-     high pressure steel pipeline        1,650 m
Trafalgar Expansion
In a combined hydro-diesel system the Trafalgar power plant could
be larger to generate more energy which is available for much of the time.
With the diversion of Clarke's River Trafalgar is definitely undersized.
For all possible projects for developing the head between Fresh Water Lake
and Trafalgar the features of a redeveloped Trafalgar are similar. The
improvements would consist of a rebuilt intake at Titot Gorge, a low
pressure pipeline to the top of the Trafalgar cliff and high pressure pipes
down the cliff to a new powerhouse at Trafalgar or to a new unit in the
existing powerhouse. The installation would be:
-   with Titot (2 units)                  2,844 kW
-   with Laudat (2 units)                 2,844 kW
-   with Big Trafalgar (1 unit)           1,344 kW
Padu Expansion
The existing Padu power station is also undersized.  Improvement
would comprise the building of a 2 unit extension to the existing
powerhouse together with twinning of the existing pipeline. Improvements
to the intake would be made as described under Big Trafalgar. The
extension would have a capacity of 2249 kW (2 x 1125 kW).

DOMINICA
POWER PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
The Least-Cost Solution
1.       The proposed Project is DOMLEC's entire 1988-1993 investment
program. The generation component accounts for about two thirds of the
program. It comprises two power plants, a river diversion scheme and a
reservoir to increase daily and seasonal regulation. It is the least-cost
solution when compared to other hydro schemes (Annex 3.2, paras. 5-7) and
to an-all diesel alternative for a wide range of credible oil price
scenarios (Annex 3.2, para. 8). The transmission requirements have been
analysed in terms of alternative routes for new lines and reconductoring of
old lines. The 11 kV transmission level is adequate for the amounts of the
power envisaged to be transmitted in the next 15 years and not even the
introduction of structures insulated for a higher level is economically
warranted. The distribution expansion requirements were determined based
on expected load growths and normal standards of quality of supply.
Conductor and transformer sizes were determined taking into account
expected loadings and level of losses. The other investment components
like equipment, tools and vehicles for operation and maintenance; training
program; studies for future system expansion; and general investment items
represent DOMLEC's essential needs.
Economic Costs and Benefits
2.       The program costs include capital investments and incremental
operation and maintenance costs associated with the expansion of capacity.
Capital investments consist basically of expenditures on generation,
transmission, distribution and other additions to fixed assets (property,
tools, vehicles). Training and pre-investment studies were also considered
as part of the capital investment streams. Fuel expenses were found to be
incurred before the coimmissioning of Laudat and were valued at prices of
diesel in Fond Cole plant, net of taxes and import duties, based on the
Bank's forecast of international crude oil prices in the Southern
Caribbean.
3.       The benefits derived from the program are associated with the
increase in sales resulting from the new investment (with a one-year lag in
the case of distribution) and the savings in diesel fuel resulting from the
increased hydro generation in Trafalgar and Padu and the new hydro
Seneration available in Laudat and in New Trafalgar. Incremental sales
were valued at the existing average electricity rate. Fuel savings were
evaluated with thie same criterion as for flel expenses (para. 2).
4.       All cost and benefits streams were expressed in January 1987 U.S.
dollars. Local costs were converted at the exchange rate of US$1.00 a
EC$2. 70.



- 52 -
5.       Incremental sales and fuel savings equal the hydro generation made
available by the Project In 1995, provided that the distribution network
has enough capacity to deliver the generation to the ultimate consumers.
So that benefits aecrued from expected sales in 1995 are properly accounted
for, suitable investment and O&M costs in distribution, are considered in
the year 1994 as a complement to the 1988-1993 project distribution
component.
Rate of Return
6.       The resulting rate of return (Attachment 1) is about 112 which is
above the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Dominica (10%). The
foregoing revenue-based rate of return, which is more a measure of the
adequacy of tariffs to the incremental costs of the investment program than
a measure of the Project's economic merits, thus indicates that the
existing tariff level would be sufficient to meet the long-term marginal
costs of powor supply in Dominica.
7.       The 11% ostimated rate of return does not fully measure the
benefits to society resulting from the implementation of the Project.
These include the social benefits of residential and public uses and the
economic benefits to production of reliable electricity supply. The
Project is estimated to create some 200 new jobs for Dominicans during the
four years construction period for the hydro facilities. The base value of
112 is thus deemed to be a minimum measure of the benefits conferred by the
Project.
8.       Standard sensitivity tests were carried out to evaluate the impact
of changes in key parameters on the rate of return. The results are shown
below:

Training Component
Manpower Development and Training
1.       Prior to the Government acquiring complete ownership of DOMLEC in
late 1983, major maintenance requirements and staff training were taken
care of by the parent company, Commonwealth Develo?ment Corporation (CDC)
on an "ad hoc" basis. Consequently, no efforts had been made towards a
planned approach to staff development. With the services of the parent
company no longer available, and with planned expansion beginning to be
implemented, DOMLEC's manager created in 1985 a Human Resources Development
Committee to conduct formal and informal studies of human resources
development needs and to plan appropriate responses. The Committee, under
the broad direction of the manager is coordinated by the deputy manager and
consists of three department heads and the personnel officer.
2.       With the assistance of the Bank, the members of the Committee have
individually and jointly developed a training plan to be carried out under
the project. This plan would complement the USAID-financed training abroad
for eight top and upper level managers for a period of 12 staff months.
The project training plan (Attachment) would include:
(a)   80 staff months of study tours and internship training aboard to
strengthen the technical and supervisory skills of ten new and
existing technicians and middle level supervisors;
(b)   provision of 12 months of expert services to initiate and conduct
short-term on-the-job training for upgrading the technical and
safety skills of about 55 ski)'ed and semi-skilled workers and the
supervisory skills of 12 field supervisory; and
(c)   provide about US$100,000 of on-the-job training equipment.
It is believed that the above project and USAID financed training would
appropriately strengthen DOMLEC's management and technical skills
capabilities to enable it to meet its short and medium -term
responsibilities for electric power generation, transmission and
distribution.
Technical Skills and Qualifications of Staff
3.       In general, the technical skills level of existing technicians and
operators are rather weak, especially in the repair and maintenance of
diesel engines, the car and truck fleet, control instruments and meters,
and in installation and maintenance of transformers and switch gear. The



- 56 -
primary reason for these weaknesses is that almost none of the technical
staff have had any formal training in their respective areas of technical
expertise. While most have had sufficient years of on-the-job experience,
the quality of that experience has been severely limited by the technical
shortcomings of the persons under whom they have been "apprenticed'. These
deficiencies will be further amplified by the increased level of technology
of the new equipment to be installed under the project and that already
being completed under the USAID project. Consequently, the technical
expertise of the existing staff will be upgraded through a combination of
study tours and plan internships abroad and formalizing the on-the-job
training activities through use of short-term highly skilled technical
specialists from abroad.

Study Tours and Internships Abroad
2.       Seven of the ten trainees going abroad wQvld intern for 3-12
months in electric power systems having similar levels of technology to the
new DOMLEC system, and three will need supplemental internships with from
6-16 months of training in a high quality technical training institute.

Training Facilities and Equipment
3.       Specialized training equipment, tools, spare parts, audio-visual
and relevant specialized training materials would be provided unider the
p:c4ect to facilitate on-the-job training.
Preparation of Training Program
4.       The basis for the planned on-the-job training program lies mainly
in the findings of a USAID financed in-depth study of DOMLEC's
organization, staffing and operation. The study was conducted by a
reputable international consulting firm whose major findings regarding
training included that:
(a)   expertise of technical personnel is generally quite low, with the
priority areas for high quality on-the-job training being diesel
engine repair and maintenance, automotive and truck repair and
maintenance, transmission and distribution system supervisors,
foremen and line repairmen, and customer service, meter repair and
calibration;
(b)   highly skilled expatriate specialists should be recruited to
prepare and conduct such training during the initial years; and
(c)   certain new technical personnel and identified existing ones
should be sent abroad for specialized training/internships in
similar systems and who, upon return, would also assist in future
on-the-job training activities. An on-the-job training program
prepared, with mission assistance, for implementation under the
project is shown in Teble 3.

Cost of the Training Component
5.        The total costs of the training component is estimated at
US$450,000. Detailed costs are shown in Table 4 below. Specialist
assistance and training abroad would be contracted for 100% of total costs
to a foreign contractor; all in-country training would be "on-the-job" with
no extra salary for those conducting training or extra allowances for
trainees; all. consumable supplies, other than electricity, are imported;
consequently, all training component costs are considered as "foreign
costs", except for an amount equivalent to US$10,000 for local
miscellaneotus expenses.

ANNEX 3.10
DOMINICA
POWER PROJECT
DOMINICA ELECTRICITY SERVICES LIMITED
Supplementary Financial Information
1.       This Annex supplements information provided in the text.
Attachments 1, 2, 3, and 4 contain historical and projected funds
statements, income statements, balance sheets and key ratios for 1981 to
1995.
Past Financial Performance
2.       Following serious hurricane damage to its facilities in 1979,
DOMLEC doubled its electricity rates. The five-year period 81-85 was
notable for rapidly increasing kWh sales, good rates of return, and a much
improved capital structure mainly through the reinvestment of earnings.
About 50% of DOMLEC's 81-85 capital spending of EC$10.8 million (US$4
million) was financed from internal cash generation, about 12% from part
of a 1982 EC$1.6 million loan received from CDB applied to the
rehabilitation of DOMLEC's electricity services and about 38Z from part of
a 1984 US$4.7 million USAID grant for rural electricity services. As
DOMLEC's internal cash generation was largely absorbed by its capital
spending there were no cash surpluses available in 1986 for future capital
spending. DOMLEC has an authorized capital of 3 million dhares of $1 each
of which 2 million have been issued. No dividends have been paid on DOMLEC
shares.
3.       Between 1981 and 1985 DOMLEC's rate of return on historically
valued net fixed assets has been good, but declining, varying from 20% in
1982 to 13% in 1985. The decline can be largely attributed to increasing
operating costs in a period where average tariffs (excluding the fuel
surcharge) remained at more or less the same level. KWh of electricity
sold increased by an average annual rate of about 10% between 1981 and
1985. This high growth rate can be attributed to the need to restore
electricity supplies to a satisfactory level following hurricane damage.
4.       DOMLEC's audited balance sheet at December 31, 1985, which is
summarized below, indicates a strong debt/equity rate of 30:70. However,
DOMLEC cash position was tight and its bank overdraft facilities of up to
EC$0.7 million were close to being fully utilized. Accounts receivable
continued an improving trend reaching the equivalent of 72 days sales. Of
DOMLEC long-term debt at December 31, 1985 EC$1.2 million was due to
Government in respect of the 1982 loan to help DOMLEC rehabilitate its
electricity facilities (para. 2). The remaining EC$3 million long-term
debt is due to CDC and was incurred some years previously.

Asset Valuation
5.       DOMLEC's fixed assets are valued at historical cost in accordance
with the normal accounting practice in Dominica. Although no revaluation
of fixed assets has ever been made for accounting purposes, a property
appraisal for insurance in 1980 indicates that, at that time, assets were
substantially undervalued. However, assets purchased prior to 1980 form a
rapidly declining proportion of DOMLEC's total assets. Recent inflation
rates have been low (varying from about 2% to 4% between 82 and 86) and
this pattern is expected to continue. By 19931 when the project assets are
in operation over 85% of the cost of DOMLEC's fixed assets will represent
additions since 1981. During the project implementation period the
proposed return on DOMLEC's fixed assets would be adequate to meet its
financial requirements. However, to protect any significant erosion of
earnings net fixed assets will be revalued from time to time when required
by the Association.
Future Finances
6.       DOMLEC needs additional revenues to strengthen its liquid position
by reducing tie current level of its overdraft.  Therefore, a 10% tariff
will be implemented effective April 1, 1987. During 1986 DOMLEC made full
use of its EC$700,000 bank overdraft facilites. As these facilities cannot
be increased, its liquid position was tight. With the 10% tariff increase
it is estimrted that unutilized bank overdraft facilities would amount to
about EC$530,000 equal to about 24 days cash outlays for operating expenses
and debt services. Although this is somewhat lower than desirable it is
expected that DOMLEC's liquid position would improve to a satisfactory
level in 1988. Projections are based on the assumption that DOMLEC would
achieve a minimum rate of return of not less than 6% in 1988 and 1989, and
7% thereafter. In 1986 and 1987 it is estimated that DOMLEC's rate of
return would decline further (para 3) to about 8% in 1986 and then to 5% in
1987 as a result of adding to assets in service the USAID grant-funded
rural electrification development program.
1/ The projected cost of DOMLEC's fixed assets in 1993 includes about 20%
of assets financed under a USAID grant for a rural electrification
program to be completed in 1987.

7. Although some further increasesa in DOMLEC' basic electricity rates
(excluding fuel surcharges) would be needed these would be more than
offset by declining fuel surcharges as the project facilities are
placed in operation. The result is that total average electricity
revenues are expected to decline in real terms. The following are the
estimated annual percentage electricity rate changes between 1988 and
1995. The estimated changes in the basic rates between 1988 and 1995
shown below are those needed to meet the minimum annual rate of return
requirements. However, the timing of rate changes may be varied
provided the annual minimum requirements are met (para 6).

8.       It is expected that by project completion DOMLEC would have
strengthened its financial position and would decrease its present
excessive reliance on debt-financing for major projects. The debt/equity
ratio is projected to be satisfactory between 1987 and 1995 and after
project completion in 1993 a good ratio of 54/46 is projected.
Accounting
9.       DOMLEC's accounting is based on CDC procedures and is basically
sound. The processing of transactions was significantly improved by the
introduction of an IBM computer. Payrolls, billings, stores, cash receipts
and accounts receivable are all computerized.
2/ This would be the effect of an increase of 10% in basic tariff from
May 1, 1987.

ANNEX 3.11
DOMINICA
POWER PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING THE
PROJECT HYDRO-GENERATION COMPONENT
Introduction
1.       This Annex describes the environmental impact of the Project
hydro-generation component, which in summary consists of civil and
hydraulic works to conduct water from an elevation of about 800 meters
above sea level (S.L.) to a natural lake called Fresh Water Lake at an
elevation of 760 meters (average) and thereafter to two downstream hydro-
power generating plants at elevation of 550m and 269m above S.L. at Laudat
and New Trafalgar respectively. It addresses the concerns expressed in the
Bank's terms of reference for ecological reconnaissance of hydroelectric
projects and is based on the December 1984 feasibility study on the
expansion of hydro-electric resources by Shawinigan/Lavalin consultants.
Clarke's River Diversion
2.       This scheme consists oF a diversion weir and spillway on Clarke's
river approximately 500 meters downstream from Boeri Lake situated on the
northern slope of Morne Micotrin. The diversion weir will be only 2m above
the stream bed and hence does not create any pondage, the spillway being of
the overflow type. The Clarke's river is believed to receive its flow from
underground sources emanating from the Boeri Lake and flows East towards
the Atlantic Ocean.
3.       An intake on the diversion weir will divert a part of the river
flow by a pipeline running along the contour towards Fresh Water Lake and
the Roseau Valley. This additional flow into t-q Roseau Valley will have
no significant impact on the environment there.
4.       Although the Clarke's river valley will be deprived of a
percentage of its normal flow at the diversion weir, the river will regain
flow within a short distance downstream to the East of the weir with the
steep slopes directing the high rainfall back to the stream bed almost
immediately.
5.       Riparian rights will not be affected as there are no water users
either inside the National Park or on the lOOm of river outside the Park.
6.       The loss of the water diverted upstream will be inconsequential to
the downstream regime since at the place where the Clarke's river joins the
Rosalie river, two other rivers, Stuart and Brown, also join at the same
place.

7.       Other than the diversion of water from one watershed to another as
explained above, the Clarke's River Diversion Project will have little
effect on the environment. The most visible characteristic would be the
track constructed for access to the weir and to provide a graded foundation
for the pipeline from the weir to Fresh Water Lake. The pipeline will be
constructed almost entirely by cutting into the sidehill on a slight uphill
grade to the diversion weir. Since the pipeline will be laid on the inside
of the track, the backfilled pipeline will quickly be hidden by vegetation.
There will still be plenty of space left for a footpath which could be
continued up the valley to Boeri Lake as a nature trail. None of the
facilities proposed present a danger to the public or to wildlife.
Fresh Water Lake Dam and Reservoir
8.       The existing Fresh Water Lake services as a natural reservoir and
does naturally regulate run-off to a certain extent. The expansion program
proposes to build a dam and spillway downstream of the existing weir (El.
759.8m) to create a new full supply level about 6.Om higher than the
present lake level. The design concept is that the lake would be filled to
the new level at the end of the rainy season and would gradually be lowered
to its present level during the dry season. The lake would also provide
pondage for the downstream hydro plants on a daily basis and fluctuations
in level up to Im would occur during a 24 hour period.
9.       The major impact will be from the flooding around the perimeter of
the lake and the re-exposure of the same area once a year. This area would
be cleared of all trees and brush before flooding. No problems are
foreseen along the shoreline, however at the south-east corner of the lake
the aquatic vegetation and the normal ageing process of the lake have
created marshy conditions. The raising and lowering of water levels will
stop the process by collapsing the marsh every year. At the designed full
supply level, the reservoir rim is competent on all sides.
10.      Outside the drawdown area the only effect on the flora and fauna
will be that due to raised ground-water levels at sometimes of the year.
New vegetation and a new ecostructure will develop quickly. Fish life in
the lake should not be affected as a similar lake regime will remain.
11.      The higher water level on Fresh Water Lake will be near the
present footpaths which may have to be rerouted at the northern end of the
lake. As construction of a new dam on Fresh Water Lake would not be
justified without building a new power development, access could also be
made available to the public to the dam at the southern end along the
pipeline (FWL to Laudat) track. This pipeline will be woodstave sitting on
small concrete footings. Again, for most of its length the woodstave
pipeline will be located on a back cut into the sidehill as is the present
access road and there will be space for a footpath beside the pipeline
12.      Facilities could be also added at the dam for the launching of
boats should the lake be made available for recreation or fishing. Use of
the lake as a recreation resource for the public would be controlled and
regulated so that there is very little change from the present regime for
the flora and fauna.

Laud*t Power Station
13.      A woodstave pipeline from the Fresh Water Lake at El. 760m to a
surge tank at El. 750m (approx.) and thence continuing as a steel pipeline
down the mountain slope to a power house at El. 550m (approx.) in Laudat
village (alongside the existing Laudat balancing tank) would constitute the
Laudat power development producing 1131 kW.
14.      The power house 3nd the tailrace are physically small and will
have little impact on their surroundings. Some privately owned land will
be traversed by the pipeline but the loss of land will be minimal and would
not involve relocation of housing. Operation of the new installation will
deliver clearer water to the Roseau River at the downstream plants of
Trafalgar and Padu thereby improving the water quality at Roseau itself.
New Trafalgar Power Station
15.      This station consisting of two generating units is proposed to be
built alongside the existing Trafalgar hydro station.
16.      The water conducting system consisting of woodstave and steel
pipelines from the intake works at Titot Gorge to the power station will be
replaced with higher capacity larger diameter pipes to convey an increased
quantity of water for higher power generation. There will be no
environmental impact because of the new power-station since the routing of
the pipeline is unchanged from the present one and the new station can be
considered as an extension of the present one.
Other Aspects of Environmental Impact of Prolect
17.      Resettlement of People - The proposed construction of the Clarke's
River Diversion Weir and the dam of Fresh Water Lake would not affect any
human habitations in these areas since there are no settlements at these
high altitudes with the nearest towns being Laudat and Trafalgar at lower
elevations.
18.      Impact of People on Project - The two major Civil Works Projects
viz, Clarke's River Diversion Weir and the dam on Fresh Water Lake are
almost entirely situated within the National Park area and hence there is
no potential for squatter settlement, and unplanned land-use activities.
Except for the operational staff at the two locations and visitors to the
project area, no large-scale traffic of people is envisaged to these areas.
19.      Archaelogical Sites of Historical Significance - There are no
sites within the project areas that have either historical significance or
archaeological importance.
20.      Multiple Use Capability of the Project - The project is primarily
meant for the generation of additional hydroelectric power by utilizing the
heads of water available between Fresh Water Lake and the existing
Trafalgar Station, there being no use of the water for irrigation purposes.
However, this project will enable, at a future date, the production of
additional electric power at Padu Hydro Station. In the medium term future
the water from the reservoir and catchment areas above El. 141m after
production of electrical power may be used for export to other Caribbean
islands by conveying it in steel pipelines to the coast at Roseau and
loading on tankers for sea transportation.
