PROJECT COMPLETION MEMORANDUM
MEXlCO
WATER, WOMEN AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3101-ME)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Memorandum for the Water, Women and
Development Project, which the Bank supported with Loan 3101-ME (US$20 million).
The effectiveness date was December 27, 1991.  Subsequent to Loan
approval the newly elected Mexican Government implemented a poverty alleviation
program that made Loan funds unattractive for the beneficiary states.   The
Borrower and the Bank considered several alternatives to reformulate the project
according to the new policies.   To that effect, the Effectiveness date was
extended eleven times. However, in the end, the reformulation efforts led to the
conclusion that because of the considerable revisions necessary to adapt the
project to Mexico's new policy framework, it was more efficient to terminate the
loan and identify a possible new operation.  On April 15, 1991, -tLe Borrower
requested that the loan be canceled. Thereafter, the Effectiveness Date of April
26, 1991 was allowed to elapse and all obligations of the parties were
terminated.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this Project Completion Memorandum was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.

PROJECT COMPLETION MEMORANDUM
MEXICO
WATER, WOMEN AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3101-ME)
1.        This memorandum is in lieu of a Project Completion Report for the
Mexico Water, Women and Development Project and is based on a desk review of
project files and related documents and reports.
Background
2.     On Jane 22, 1989, the Bank approved a loan in the amount of US$20.0
million for the financing of water and sanitation services, and productive
activities in the pilot states of Queretaro, Hidalgo and Michoacan.
Subsequent to Loan approval the newly elected Mexican Government implemented a
poverty alleviation program that made Loan funds unattractive for the
beneficiary states. The Borrower and the Bank considered several alternatives
to reformulate the project according to the new policies. To that effect, the
original Effectiveness Date of December 27, 1989 was extended eleven times.
However, in the end, the reformulation efforts led to the conclusion that
because of the considerable revisions necessary to adapt the project to
Mex'.co's new policy framework, it was more efficient to terminate the loan ax.d
identify a possible new operation. On April 15, 1991, the Borrower requested
that the loan be canceled. Thereafter, the Effectiveness Date of April 26,
1991 was allowed to elapse and all obligations of the parties were terminated.
Proiect Concept
3.        The Water, Women and Development Project was the Bank's first
operation that would combine funding for water supply an.d eanitation
facilities, and support for productive activities with a special focus on
women. The link between the water and income-generating components was
expected to be a crucial element of the project, as it would increase the
possibility of success, especially since the main beneficiaries were to be
low-income women. A project focusing only on income-generating activities was
thought to have limited impact because the time and energy required by women
to fetch water would constrain them from taking advantage of training and
credit opportunities and the income-generating activities emerging from them.
Likewise, a project focusing only on community water and sanitation needs
would not be affordable to many households because the beneficiaries would be
unable to pay for the services on a sustainable basis without a scheme for
increasing their income through productive activities.
4.        Integrated in the conceptual design of the proposed project was the
recognition of the importance of community participation in defining and
addressing their needs, as well as the principle that the community itself is
the primary decision maker, organizer and investor in the project. This
approach, by encouraging self-help and promoting increased community
responsibilities was to support the Government's strategy to change the
generalized perception that improvements in living standards would only be
achieved through increased public sector involvement.



-2-
5.        In this context, the project envisaged an important contribution
towards the implementation of cost-recovery policies. Until then, the
Government strategy had been to consider investments in the water sector
targeted to low-incoiv groups as direct transfers. In the Government's policy
framework of subsidy reductions, it was agreed during negotiations that the
State Water Agencies (SWA's) participating under the project would recover
100% of the operating costs and 70% of the investment costs through the water
rates.
Proiect Obiectives
6.        The main objective of the project was to improve the living
standard of low-income population grouDs, especially women, by:
(i) providing water and sanitation and impreving the target
population's health and sanitation knowledge and hal'its;
(ii) promoting income-generating activities, primprily for women who
would be freed from the chore of fetching water by improved water
supply services and providing them with the necessary training and
credit to carry out such activities; and
(iii) assisting the state Governments of Michoacan, Queretaro and Hidalgo
to strengthen the SWAs abilities to design, build, operate and
maintain water systems in low-income areas.
Proiect Description
7.        The project included three major components related to:  (a)
provision of water supply and sanitation (71.8% of total cost); (b) creation
of income-generating activities (18.9% of total cost); and (c) initial steps
to extend project replication to other states (9.3% of total cost).
a)   Water and Sanitation Services comprised:  (i) a line of credit
of US$ 12.0 million through BANOBRAS (the National Bank for
Public Works), the borrower, to the SWAs agencies to finance
the installation of new water supply and sanitation services
in a total of about 200 low-income communities in rural and
peri-urban areas; (ii) maintenance of existing water systems
(including procurement of maintenance equipment); (iii)
technical assistance to strengthen the SWAs in the areas of
organizational and operating performance, information systems,
and design and construction using low-cost technologies and to
train staff in community mobilization techniques; and (iv)
development of a health education program to improve health
and sanitation knowledge and habits;
b)        Income-Generating Activities included:  (i) a line of credit
of US$5.0 million through BANOBRAS to financial intermediaries
to support the investment and working capital needed by



3
beneficiaries to start productive activities.   These
activities were expected to involve micro-enterprises under
some form of cooperative ownership. Financing of tools and raw
materials to carry out piecemeal work for in-bond industries
was also included; and (ii) technical assistance to the
agencies in charge of promotion at the community level for
project implementationY This technical assistance would
consist of: (a) training of trainers within the promotion
agencies in education techniques encouraging community
participation in the decision making process, targeted mainly
to women and project evaluation; (b) developing the
beneficiaries' entrepreneurial skills and their ability to
make decisions, thereby gaining the confidence and experience
needed to adjust to different economic environments; and (c)
train4ng the participants in the skills to carry out the new
activities; and
c)        Proiect Preparation in Other States  was to operate as a
project preparation facility and included technical assistance
to other states for: (i) identifying water-cum-productive
activities projects; (ii) preparing subprojects in other
states that would be eligible for future financing.
Rationale for Loan Cancellation
8.        During project preparation, the newly elected Government of
President Salinas launched the National Solidarity Program (PRONASOL) to
finance projects targeted to the poorest members of society. It was only
after Loan Approval, however, that the scope and modus operandi of PRONASOL
began to take shape. PRONASOL is managed by the Secretariat of Planning and
Budgeting (SPP) which was supposed to be involved in the implementation of the
Bank project only in a limited way. To address gender-specific poverty
issues, the new Government developed a "Women in Solidarity Program" within
PRONASOL, which provided assistance for productive activities. The PRONASOL
funds, including those under the "Women in Solidarity" Program are provided
on a grant basis.  Thus, the PRONASOL funds were much more attractive than
j/ The financial agencies were local parastatals witn experience in handling
credit lines for micro-enterprises. Specifically, they were: FOMICH in
Michoacan, Impulsora Hidalguense in Hidalgo, and FIMINSSE in Queretaro.
.g  The promotion and technical field work for the implementation of the
income-generating component, was also to be carried out by FOMICH in Michoacan
and by Impulsora Hidalguense in Hidalgo. In Queretaro, the outreach and field
work was to be carried out by IDEAS, a state government agency responsible for
carrying various social action programs throughout the State.
/  In true fact, the money is supposed to be returned to a community fund.
However, there are no clear rules as to how or when this should take place.
Since these decisions are mostly left to the recipient of the funds, the

the less concessional loan funds that were to be provided under the Water,
Women and Development Project. As a result, all the states originally
proposed to participate in the project were unwilling to enter into subsidiary
agreements with BANOBRAS to use Bank funds. Signature of such agreements by
at least one of the participating states was a condition of Loan
Effectiveness.
9.        During the period since loan approval, the Bank has been working
very closely with the Mexican Government on several other projects to support
its efforts to alleviate the impact of economic stabilization measures on the
poor. Two new loans, the Water and Sanitation Sector Project (Loan 3271-ME,
approved by the Board of Executive Directors on November 8, 1990) and the
Decentralization and Regional Development Project (Loan 3310-ME, March 26,
1991), directly or indirectly, support the PRONASOL scheme. These pove-rty-
oriented projects are being funded by a mix of resources (i.e., credit,
Federal and State grants and internal cash generation of local water
utilities) that varies according to the degree of poverty in the municipality.
In total, the requirements of cost-recovery of investments for these new
projects are significantly less stringent than those applicable under the
Water, Women and Development Project.
10.       On November 7, 1990, the Borrower requested the Bank to reformulate
the Water, Women and Development Project, so as to align it with the scheme
under the other projects. Subsequently, two Bank missions visited Mexico to
discuss possible ways of reformulating the Project in accordance with the
general policy framework that had been developed in the context of the two
FY91 projects. The final Mexican reformulation proposal was received by the
Bank on March 20, 1991. It followed the general objectives of the original
projects, but with the following major modifications:
(a) Loan funds, would directly support budgetary allocations for
PRONASOL through SPP. Originally, BANOBRAS was to on-lend loan
funds to the three pilot states, which, in turn were to on-lend the
funds to the SWAs. In the reformulated project SPP would replace
Banobras as the Borrower;
(b) Water tariffs in the project areas would cover only operation and
maintenance costs; the requirement that water rates cover also 70%
of the SWAs'water -ad sanitation investment cost was to be
eliminated. This modification was in line with sector policy
agreed under the Water and Sanitation Sector (Loan 3271-ME) which
calls for federal and state grants for investments in the poorer
areas of the population;
(c) Substitute all three pilot states with other states where the Women
in Solidarity Program was being successfully carried out; and
.... continued)
system does not offer any incentives for repayment. Thus, the funds can be
considered as grant money.



-5-
(d) With regard to the credit line to finance private sector income-
generating activities, the Borrower proposed to implement the full
cost-7ecovery condition only for exceptional cases and instead
provide grants to beneficiaries. The Bank, on the other hand
sought to maintain the coat recovery features as far as possible to
ensure that requests for credit reflected a sound analysis of costs
and benefits and also further the replicability of the operation
for a larger target group.
11.       Except for the cost recovery proposal described in (d) above, most
of these modifications could have been accepted. However, it became evident
to both the Borrower and the Bank during the process of reviewing possible
alternative solutions thai tne implementation of the reformulation would
require an effort comparable to that of developing and appraising a new
operation, especially the appraisal of a complete new set of pilot states and
finar.^ial intermediation arrangements. Reformulating the existing project
would have had the additional disadvantage that maintenance of the original
outdated project framework would limit significantly the possibility of
considering other alternative approaches in addressing gender specific issues.
Thus, the Borrower, by letter dated April 15, 1991, requested the cancellation
of the loan. At the same time, the Borrower expressed the interest of the
Nexican Government in a new Women in Development oriented operation with Bank
financial and technical assistance.
Conclusions
12.       A major shift in Government policies towards the provision of
assistance to the poor took place after the loan was approved. Since under a
possible reformulation of the existing project all the participating states,
executing agency and key policies would have had to change, the decision to
consider a new operation rather than attempt to restructure the existing
operation was prudent and reasonable.
13.       The project was well designed and took a comprehensive approach to
attack the vicious cycle of women's lack of productivity because of the time
spent in household chores, lack of basic services and health. This approach,
was coupled with the concept of meaningful community participation in
identifying and seeking solutions for the community problems. The Project was
to rely on groups of trained extension workers to act as facilitators in the
mobilization of low income women to participate in the process of planning and
executing projects to upgrade their basic infrastructure, and identifying and
implementing productive activities. While the Water, Women and Development
project did not become effective, its conceptual underpinnings were fully
accepted by the new Government and f jpted for the ongoing Women in Solidarity
programs. In this context, it may be argued that the Bank played a valuable
role and acted as a catalyzer of the actions that followed.
14.       Probably the most important policy issue involved with the proposed
reformulation of the Project deals with cost recovery.  The "Women in
Solidarity" Program provides quasi-grant funds for simple income-generating
activities requiring limited investments. The Water, Women and Development
project included a credit line for more ambitious activities requiring higher



-6-
levels of capital expenditures. In general, the Bank's position was that
grant money did not provide the necessary incer.tives for a successful
implementation and desirable cost recovery of the program, particularly for
income generating activities. In contrast, the Government believes that grant
money is more effective for reaching final beneficiaries, especially the
poorest segment of the population, and stimulating income-generating
activities, for which the use of credit lines is considerably less attractive
(see Annex). This difference, however, may ultimately have been surmountable.
In fact, the pilot character of the project provided a vehicle for testing the
sustainability of alternative schemes for supporting income-generating
activities and this approach, which was being explored under the project
reformulation efforts, might be considered in the context of a new loan
operation.
15.       With hindsight, a substantial amount of staff resources both on the
pe-rt of the Mexican authoriticzs and the Bank could have been saved by
terminating the loan at an earlier stage. However, the extended period during
which the extensions to the effectiveness date were being considered was one
of active dialogue between the Government and the Bank on the policy framework
for the water sector and poverty alleviation. There were sufficient reasons
to believe that, ouce the final policy framework for both the Water Sector and
Sanitation and the Regional Development Projects were agreed upon, the Water,
Women and Development Project could be successfully realigned to complement,
within its gender-specific objectives, the efforts of the other two
operations. Although this expectation was not unreasonable, the Government
and the Bank, in the end, agreed to take the more efficient route of trying to
give a fresh look at the issues of Women in Development in Mexico.

Dear Sir:
Reference is made to Loan 3101-ME, Water, Women and Development Project,
financed by the World Bank, as well as to your communication dated June 5, 1991.
In this respect, it is the opinion of this 3ecretariat, that in the
findings of the Report (paragraph 14) it is necessary to clarify that the
position of the Mexican Government has been to focus its attention --within the
Women in Solidarity Program-- to the population groups, particularly those with
the greatest needs, through the promotion of programs geared toward poverty
alleviation and justice.
In this sense, the scheme used by Women in Solidarity, has proven its
feasibility through awards of seed money, reinvesting the partial recovery of
these resources within the same community making possible the consolidation of
the projects or the initiation of others as decided by thcse involved. However,
the Water, Women and Development Project included a credit line for profitable
productive projects that made such resources less attractive and feasible to the
target population, whose recovery expectations were almost non-existent.
