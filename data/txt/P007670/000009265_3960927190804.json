is to\n            improve the living standard of low income population groups.\n            To that end, the project will include three major components\n            relating to: (i) water supply and sanitation; (ii) income\n            generating activities; and (iii) project preparation in\n            other states. The water and sanitation component comprises a\n            line of credit for: (a) installation of water supply and\n            sanitation services in about 200 low income communities; (b)\n            maintenance of water systems; and (c) technical assistance\n            to strengthen the State Water Agencies (SWA), train staff in\n            community mobilization techniques, and to implement a health\n            education program. The income generating component\n            comprises: (a) a line of credit through BANOBRAS to\n            financial institutions (FI) in the participating states to\n            support the investment and working capital needed by\n            beneficiaries to start productive activities; and (b)\n            technical assistance to the agency in each state in charge\n            of project promotion at the community level. The final\n            component for project preparation in other states will\n            finance technical assistance to other states for: (a)\n            identifying water-cum-productuve activities projects; and\n            (b) preparing subprojects for future financing. It will also\n            finance priority works in other states."}, "docdt": "1989-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
