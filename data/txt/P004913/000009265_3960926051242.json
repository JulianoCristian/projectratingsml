At the local level, the project aims to (i)\n            implement the first priority investment package for the\n            development of the Cheliff river basin; and (ii) to\n            safeguard and improve farmers' income.  Secondly, at\n            the sector level, the project intends to (i) develop and\n            implement new institutional arrangements to ensure adequate\n            water management, operation and maintenance in the Cheliff\n            river basin and to (ii) develop and improve internal\n            financing of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) by\n            increasing user charges to fully cover costs.  Finally, at\n            the national level, the project seeks to develop efficient\n            irrigation potential in the country by expanding the\n            large-scale irrigation areas presently used for irrigation\n            by about 25 percent.  To accomplish these objectives at each\n            level, the project consists of several components.  They\n            involve:  (a) rehabilitation of existing irrigation\n            infrastructure; (b) construction of new irrigation systems\n            in Haut Cheliff; (c) provision for equipment and vehicles\n            for extension and O&M staff; and (d) technical\n            assistance.  Lastly, the project entails (e) training and\n            recruitment; and (f) on-farm investments."}, "docdt": "1987-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
