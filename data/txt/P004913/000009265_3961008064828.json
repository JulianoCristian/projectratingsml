The Banks\u0092\n            performance is considered satisfactory while the Borrower\u0092s\n            performance is considered unsatisfactory. The project\n            encountered a large number of difficulties and issues which\n            hampered project implementation. In addition to the security\n            conditions which have progressively worsened during the last\n            two years of the project, weak central and regional\n            institutions and the lack of sound sectoral policies were\n            the main constraints, not only at the level of the technical\n            ministries in charge of the project but also at the level of\n            the Ministry of Finance. Lessons learned from this project\n            include: (a) the change of OPIs statutes into EPIC's\n            (Etablissements Publics a caractere Industriel et\n            Commercial) should have been more closely monitored by the\n            Bank; (b) water tariff adjustment should have been a\n            condition of loan effectiveness; (c) key indicators for\n            project implementation should have been followed up by the\n            Government and the Bank; greater care should have been given\n            to the monitoring system to be put in place for the project;\n            (d) the Bank should endeavor to agree on an authorized\n            allocation deposited in the special account commensurate\n            with the actual project financial needs. (e) a time-gap with\n            the structural adjustment process negatively affected the\n            project particular factors: shortage of foreign currency,\n            shortage of construction materials, deficiency in the\n            banking sector delaying creditors payments, cumbersome\n            administrative procedures."}, "docdt": "1995-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
