An important aspect of the proposed loan of US$40\n            million are the arrangements for technical assistance\n            intended to upgrade the project appraisal and supervision\n            capabilities of Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD),\n            the borrower and administrator of the loan. Although this\n            first loan to BAD will be confined essentially to the\n            financing of construction materials industries, the Algerian\n            authorities expect that, over time, the experience acquired\n            by BAD's unit in appraising and supervising a number of\n            medium-sized projects will set a pattern for BAD in most of\n            its future operations, whatever their nature and sources of\n            funding. Progress should gradually enable BAD to assume a\n            stronger role in the Algerian investment-decision process.\n            Whether this approach will work, particularly whether\n            BAD's new working tools will carry weight is the\n            essential risk in this operation which has considerable\n            attributes of an experiment in the Algerian context."}, "docdt": "1975-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
