Some lessons learned included: 1) The project\n            design incorporated three critical lessons learned from\n            earlier Integrated Conservation Development Project (ICDPs);\n            they are the need to explicitly link conservation\n            commitments with development activities; the importance of\n            involving local communities (CAP process); and the need to\n            include the entire buffer zone rather than a few selected\n            communities to have a significant impact in halting\n            encroachment; 2) The project has demonstrated that by\n            linking and sequencing of conservation and development\n            activities, the local community was more committed to the\n            conservation goal; 3) Linking forest protection with rural\n            development is a more effective approach to protection of\n            critical forest areas than relying on enforcement alone; 4)\n            The use of the Commune Action Plan (CAPs) is a good example\n            of participatory planning and has assisted village- and\n            commune-level staff to comprehend their rights within a\n            \"bottom-up\" planning process; 5) With the project\n            design and implementation involving local community's\n            participation, decentralization and delegation of approval\n            to provincial level was critical to the success; and 6) For\n            ICDP projects engaging community's participation, there\n            should be more than one Midterm Review (MTR) and the first\n            MTR should be carried out in Year 2 to take stock, identify,\n            and address potential problems at early stages."}, "docdt": "2007-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
