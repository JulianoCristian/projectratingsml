Dear Sir:
I refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated November 8, 1997 between the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam (the Borrower) and International Development Association 
(IDA) for the above Project (the Credit Agreement).  I further refer to the letter 
dated December 29, 2000 on behalf of the Borrower, requesting certain modification to 
the Credit Agreement to facilitate implementation of the Project.
I am pleased to inform you that IDA concurs with the request and agrees to 
amendments of the Credit Agreement as set forth below.
The Table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Credit Agreement, Withdrawal of 
the Proceeds of the Credit, is amended in part to read as follows:

(b) incurred during
50%
calendar years 2002 and
afterwards, until

Except as specifically amended by the provisions of this letter of amendment, 
all terms and conditions of the Development Credit Agreement otherwise remain in full 
force and effect.
Please indicate your agreement with the terms of this letter of amendment by 
countersigning and dating the form of confirmation below and returning one signed 
original copy of this letter for our files.  This letter of amendment shall enter into 
effect as of the date hereof upon our receipt of a copy of this letter of amendment
