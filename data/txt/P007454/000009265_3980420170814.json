The most\n            significant lessons learned were asment, training and\n            extension services; and (iii) elimination of public\n            subsidies for irrigation operation and maintenance costs\n            (O&M) by introducing irrigation charges which cover\n            O&M costs and encouraging the follows that: (i)\n            restructuring of public sector enterprises, with a view to\n            making them more efficient, usually is not successful; (ii)\n            high quality appraisal is a sine qua non for a sound\n            project; (iii) the Bank needs to be scrupulous when it\n            deviates from Bank procurement guidelines; (iv) a\n            sustainable project must be based on sound economic policies\n            for achieving sectoral objectives; (v)irrigated farming\n            development strategies. irrigation of sugar cane does not\n            represent an efficient use of water; and (vi) the role of\n            the government in the irrigation sub-sector should be\n            limited to defining policies, enforcing legislation, and\n            promoting sustainable"}, "docdt": "1996-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
