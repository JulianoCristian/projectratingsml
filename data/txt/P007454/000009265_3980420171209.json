sugar production in the\n            country to a level sufficient to satisfy the domestic market\n            and those export markets to which Jamaica has access under\n            special arrangements (EEC, US); and (c) to improve the\n            overall efficiency and financial viability of the industry.\n            With this in mind, the project comprises (a) physical\n            rehabilitation and managerial and technical assistance for\n            the two main public sector factories and estates; (b)\n            rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure for cane\n            cultivation in the dry Southern Central Plains region; and\n            (c) sugar research activities. The project will create\n            stability in an industry whose foreign exchange earnings are\n            vital to the country's balance of payments, and\n            safeguard the incomes of over 45,000 workers and farmers who\n            depend on the industry."}, "docdt": "1987-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
