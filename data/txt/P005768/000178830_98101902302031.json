Irrigation Project will\n            consist of: (a) raising agricultural production, farm income\n            and welfare of people in Wadi Rima by providing technical\n            assistance, agricultural credit, gravel access roads,\n            potable water supply, and extending the Wadi's\n            hydrometeorological monitoring program for evaluating its\n            surface and groundwater potential for future optimal use,\n            and constructing a gabion test structure in the Wadi to test\n            the diversion capability and strength of a comparatively low\n            cost design for its possbile future application in Tihama\n            and other similar wadis; (b) construction of a headquarters\n            camp for Tihama Development Authority (TDA) at Hodeidah; and\n            (c) provision of Institutional Support to the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and the Central Agricultural Research Station\n            (CARS). The project will generate social as well as economic\n            benefits. The average agricultural income of 77 percent of\n            Wadi Rima's population, 44,000 persons, was estimated\n            to be below the US$150 subsistence level in 1977.
