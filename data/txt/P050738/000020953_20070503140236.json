Lessons\n            learned included: 1) The major lesson to be drawn from the\n            Project is that in this case a learning and innovation loan\n            (LIL) proved to be an inappropriate vehicle for taking on\n            important and contested legal, policy, and institutional\n            issues, particularly in light of the lack of project\n            ownership at sufficiently high levels of Government; 2)\n            recognize the central importance of pragmatic adjudication\n            of rights through the systematic titling program if the\n            investment is to bring desired economic benefits; 3)\n            recognize the need for full coverage of land parcels in a\n            given territorial area where the systematic titling is being\n            carried out; 4) pay more attention to the long-term\n            operation of the title registry relative to the initial land\n            titling program; 5) focus on ways to further reduce the per\n            parcel costs of land titling; 6) put clear focus on the\n            outputs and development objectives rather than inputs and\n            processes; and 7) ensure that there is regular and reliable\n            feedback from intended beneficiaries and other stakeholders\n            to verify that the objectives are in fact being achieved."}, "docdt": "2007-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
