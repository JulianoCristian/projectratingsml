 construction of 26,000 km of logging - extraction, forest,\n            and village - access roads, and stabilization of 25,000 km\n            of existing forest roads; (ii) procurement of specialized\n            logging equipment for inaccessible forests, vehicles and\n            equipment for road construction and log extraction, and\n            installation of maintenance workshops; (iii) establishment\n            of an intensified forest management program, including\n            reforestation, afforestation, forest protection, expansion\n            of forest nurseries, erosion control, range improvement, and\n            wildlife and environmental protection; and (iv) technical\n            assistance and training. At full development it is expected\n            to generate over TL 4.0 billion in incremental income,\n            contribute about TL 2.3 billion in net revenue to the\n            national Treasury, save over US$500 million equivalent in\n            foreign exchange, and yield additional benefits to most of\n            the 5 million forest villagers, who are among the lowest\n            income groups in Turkey."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
