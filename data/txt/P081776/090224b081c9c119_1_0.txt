                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress toward achieving the PDO is reasonable. To reduce water pollution in the Pearl River Delta, the Zhen'an Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Foshan has been
                         expanded thus increasing the percentage of wastewater collected and treated from 50% to 88%. In Jiangmen, pollution reduction works have been completed with the
                         Wenchengsha WWTP and associated pumping stations now entering operations. Sludge treatment works started in mid-April 2013, and are expected to be completed by December
                         2013. Works for sediment removal have been completed with approximately 20.5 km (100% of plan) having been dredged. River embankment and flood control works had suffered
                         extensive delays due to difficult land acquisition and resettlement, but works are now well underway with approximately 4.43 km completed (86% of plan). The estimated completion
                         date is July 2013. The financial status of the Foshan Water Group Company has improved substantially, and it now generates sufficient revenue to meet operating expenses;
                         however it still cannot cover debt service. Institutional and financial reforms in Jiangmen are progressing slowly and sewerage tariff adjustments are behind schedule which could
                         compromise sustainability.
