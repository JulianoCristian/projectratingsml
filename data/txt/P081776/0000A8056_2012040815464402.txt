                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Physical implementation is well underway although some works are behind schedule. One major achievement is the expansion of the Zhen'an Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)
                         in Foshan. These works have increased the percentage of wastewater collected and treated from 50% to 88%, thereby reducing water pollution in the Pearl River. Wastewater
                         improvements in Jiangmen are also completed and entering operations at the Wenchengsha WWTP and District pumping stations, and formal acceptance should be obtained in fall
                         of 2012. These works will further reduce water pollution in the Delta. Sludge disposal works in Foshan are much behind schedule as the client has proposed a new decentralized
                         treatment system to replace the centralized system agreed at appraisal. The new technical design is approved, but the associated land changes require national approvals and a
                         project restructuring. As this component is likely to extend beyond the Loan completion date, the restructuring will include a one year closing date extension. Works for sediment
                         removal are completed with approximately 20.5 km (100% of the planned works) having been dredged. River embankment and flood control works have suffered extensive delays
                         due to difficult land acquisition and resettlement, but these difficulties have now been resolved and completion is expected by end 2012. Institutional and financial reforms are
                         progressing slowly and sewerage tariff adjustments are behind schedule for both cities.
