                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Physical implementation is progressing reasonably well. To reduce water pollution in the Pearl River Delta, the Zhen'an Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Foshan has been
                         expanded thus increasing the percentage of wastewater collected and treated from 50% to 88%. In Jiangmen, pollution reduction works have also been completed with the
                         Wenchengsha WWTP and associated pumping stations now entering operations. Works related to sludge treatment are behind schedule, largely because the design agreed at
                         appraisal was just replaced in October 2012 with a new decentralized treatment system, with a one year closing date extension also approved to complete the redesigned works.
                         Works for sediment removal have been completed with approximately 20.5 km (100% of plan) having been dredged. River embankment and flood control works had suffered
                         extensive delays due to difficult land acquisition and resettlement, but these difficulties have now been resolved. Three out of four contracts were completed, with approximately 4.43
                         km completed (86% of the planned works), and the last contract is expected to be completed by February 2013. The financial status of the Foshan Water Group Company has
                         improved substantially and it now generates sufficient revenue to meet its operating expenses and debt service. Institutional and financial reforms in Jiangmen are progressing slowly
                         and sewerage tariff adjustments are behind schedule which could compromise sustainability.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The client should (a) procure a design/build contractor for the newly approved sludge treatment works in Foshan as soon as possible so that works can begin by January 2013; and
                         (b) submit action plans to improve the financial sustainability of the Foshan Water Group Company (FWGC) and the Jiangmen Biyuan Wastewater Company (JBWC).
