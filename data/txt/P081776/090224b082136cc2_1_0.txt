                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards achieving the PDO is reasonable, with most of the expected results to be achieved by the project completion date on December 31st, 2013. To reduce water
                         pollution in the Pearl River Delta has been achieved by the successful completion of, the Zhen'an Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Foshan that has been expanded to
                         increase the percentage of wastewater collected and treated from 50% to 88%. In Jiangmen, pollution reduction works have been completed with the Wenchengsha WWTP and
                         associated network of sewers and pumping stations now fully operational. Sludge treatment works in three out of four WWTP are expected to be completed by the project completion
                         date. Works for sediment removal have been completed as planned with more than 20.5 km of river dredged. River embankment and flood control works have been almost
                         completed, with only one pumping station to be completed after December. The financial status of the Foshan Water Group Company has improved substantially, and it now
                         generates sufficient revenue to meet operating expenses; however it still cannot cover debt service. Institutional and financial reforms in Jiangmen are progressing slowly and
                         sewerage tariff adjustments are behind schedule.
