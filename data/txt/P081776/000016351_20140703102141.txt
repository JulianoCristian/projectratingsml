I. Disbursement Profile
   1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Pearl River Delta region in Guangdong province is a complex metropolitan area
where more than 40 million people live. Its economic growth rate has been maintained
above 13 % in the last years, more than 3.5 points above the national average, due to the
high foreign direct investment, the high relevance of manufacturing industries and the
increasing role of the services sector. This rapid development has put an enormous
pressure on the environment, and more particular on the Delta’s waterways, whose water
quality has considerably deteriorated.

In 2002, the provincial government of Guandong defined a program of investments and
policy reforms to improve the water quality of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, one of
the most polluted areas in China. The US$ 9 billion Pearl River Delta Clean-up Plan set
out ambitious phased targets to meet water quality and other standards through important
actions related to: (a) industrial pollution control; (b) domestic wastewater treatment; (c)
agricultural and livestock pollution control; and (d) integrated rehabilitation of rivers,
creeks, solid waste treatment and ecosystem development and protection. The Plan
targeted 14 municipalities in the province with the priority outputs being the construction
of wastewater treatment plants and associated collection networks including pumping
stations and transmission mains. These 14 municipalities all are within the boundaries of
the Pearl River Delta catchment area.

In developing this infrastructure, the goal was to create economies of scale and other
potential collective benefits: by the time of project appraisal, the Guangdong Provincial
Government and municipalities recognized that regional planning approaches presented
opportunities for inter-municipal cooperation, jointly-managed facilities and reduced
costs for provision of environmental infrastructure.

Rationale for Bank involvement

At the time of project appraisal in May 2006, the first Guangdong PRD Urban
Environment Project (PRD1, Ln. 4742-CN), designed to support the Guangdong
government to improve the water quality of the PRD, was under implementation. This
was the first stage in the Clean-up Plan which focused on financing wastewater treatment
facilities and other investments in the provincial capital of Guangzhou, the biggest single
source of pollution in the Delta (34% of organic pollution load). The project included
parallel GEF grant financing, and supported policy reforms including pilots on inter-
municipal cooperation in the planning and operating of shared wastewater facilities (two
pilots in Guangzhou and one in Foshan), improvements in water quality monitoring and
information dissemination. The project also carried out a study on concessional financing
of wastewater services in Jiangmen.




                                             1
The provincial government intended to give continuity to those interventions to keep
improving the quality of the PRD waters through additional investments in other
municipalities of the Delta. In 2005, discussions were held to include Foshan and
Jiangmen, contributing to 15% of the pollution in the PRD1, as new target cities in a new
project.

At that time, a number of environmental challenges were identified in these two cities. In
Foshan, sludge from the existing WWTPs was handled in an inefficient manner, with
insufficient dewatering and disposal in provisional locations near the WWTPs.
Contaminated sediment was accumulating in the river beds, being both a source of
pollution and a cause to the reduction of the hydraulic capacity of the river during flood
events. There was an increasing need to monitor the water quality of the main rivers in
order to control pollution sources and enforce environmental regulations better.

After a series of initial discussions, it was also concluded that the new World Bank
project could bring value added through best practices in the design and implementation
of relatively innovative activities related to sludge management, dredging and safe
disposal of sediments from the rivers, and the establishment of an environmental
monitoring system.

In Jiangmen, the priority was to rapidly expand the wastewater treatment capacity, as
only 22% of the wastewater generated was being collected and treated. It was also agreed
that the World Bank will be best suited to support the newly created Jiangmen Biyuan
Wastewater Company and ensure efficiency and sustainability in the operations.

The project supported two prominent themes in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for 2006-2010 (Rpt # 35435): (a) managing resource scarcity and environmental
challenges especially related to water pollution reduction and conservation; and (b)
promoting balanced urbanization and improving the quality of urban life. It also
supported the Government’s 11th Five Year Plan which set out a “people-centered”
strategy, aiming to achieve a “harmonious society” that balanced economic growth with
distributional and ecological concerns.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

PDO: The PDO in the PAD was “to reduce water pollution in the Pearl River water
system originating from Foshan and Jiangmen municipalities through a package of key
initiatives, including wastewater treatment and sludge disposal, water quality monitoring,
sediment removal from waterways, and flood protection and river embankment
improvement.” The PDO in the Loan Agreement was simply “to assist the Borrower in



1
  So, together with Guangzhou which was contributing 34% to the overall pollution of the PRD, the two projects were
targeting cities contributing to reduce almost half of the water pollution in the region.




                                                         2
reducing water pollution in the Pearl River system originating from Foshan and Jiangmen
Municipalities”.

Key Indicators: Key outcome indicators include: (a) reductions in domestic source
pollution entering the Pearl River system from Foshan and Jiangmen; (b) improved
effectiveness in operations, management and finances of wastewater utility services; (c)
improved river water quality at monitoring stations in Foshan and Jiangmen; and (d)
increases in property values in the areas upgraded under the project.

In addition to indicator (b), the Project Agreement contained two financial covenants to:
(i) ensure the two wastewater companies were recovering full costs 2 , and (ii) request
these companies to produce annual financial forecasts satisfactory to the Bank.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

In the restructuring of November 2012, some changes were made in the Results
Framework: In indicator 1, “Reductions in pollution discharges entering the PRD river
network from Foshan (COD, NH4-N)” the baseline and targets for NH4-N were reduced
to correct overestimations made at appraisal. Indicator 2, “Evidence of improvement in
effectiveness in operations, management and finances of wastewater utility services
under the project”, was supplemented with five measurable sub-indicators directly related
to the operational and financial performance of the project companies, including: “Cash
Operating Cost per Unit”, “Wastewater Volume Treated per Employee”, “Consumption
of Electricity per Unit”, “Cost Recovery Ratio” and “Debt Service Ratio”. Indicator 4,
“Increases in land use rights for residential, commercial and industrial properties adjacent
to project areas”, was considered beyond the scope of the Project and difficult to measure,
so it was dropped. In response to a new corporate mandate, the Core Sector Indicator,
“Volume (mass) of BOD pollution loads removed by the treatment plant supported under
the project” was added.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Pollution reduction can be considered a public good, and therefore the activities financed
by this project to address water quality issues in the PRD waterways have contributed to
the improvement in the quality of life of the citizens who live downstream of the project
area. Of these, a population of 600,000 people in Jiangmen and 1.1 million people in
Chancheng district in Foshan3, can be considered to be more directly benefitted by the
project.


2
  Defined as the need to have total revenues higher than the sum of operating expenditures, increase in working capital,
and the amount by which debt service exceeds depreciation and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3

3
 The entire population of Chancheng District in Foshan can be considered benefited from all the project activities.
With the new extension, the Zhen’an WWTP alone is benefitting 600,000 in 2013. In Jiangmen, the plant is now
working at 81% capacity, thus serving approximately 500,000 out of the potential 600,000.




                                                           3
In addition, institutional strengthening activities designed to support project management
benefited staff from the Foshan PMO, hosted first by the Foshan Water Resources Bureau
and then by Foshan Environmental Protection Bureau. In Jiangmen the institutional
strengthening activities focused on the preparation of strategic corporate plans to support
Jiangmen Biyuan Wastewater Treatment Company (JBWC).

                                            4
 Jiangmen Components (US$39.15 million, US$24 million):

(a) Wastewater Management. ($38.35 million, $23.32 million) Expansion of the Wen
Cheng Sha WWTP by 150,000 m3/day (to bring the plant’s capacity to 200,000 m3/d);
construction of 22 km of interceptors, secondary sewers, three pumping stations;
reconstruction of an existing storm drainage pumping station; and purchase of equipment

dewatering.

(b) Institutional Strengthening and Training. ($0.8 million, $0.68 million) Technical
assistance to enhance operational and business management capacities of the newly
established Jiangmen Biyuan Wastewater Company.

1.6 Revised Components

The Foshan sludge treatment component was re-designed in 2012. A new feasibility
study was conducted incorporating actual data from the ongoing wastewater operations,
finding that only 220 tons/day sludge had to be treated instead of the 400 tons/day
estimated at appraisal (see section 2.2 for details). The November 2012 restructuring
paper amended the project description of Part A.2 of the project as follows: “Construction
of four decentralized sludge treatment facilities with a total capacity of 200 tons/day to
treat sewerage sludge from the wastewater treatment plants at Zhen’an, Shagang,
Chengbei and Nanzhuang in Foshan”.

1.7 Other significant changes

The November 2012 restructuring paper also included: (a) a reallocation of funds; (b) an
increase in the disbursement percentages for selected categories; (c) a one year extension
of the Loan Closing date to December 31, 2013 to allow extra time to implement the re-
designed sludge treatment facilities and to complete sewer networks; and (d) amendments
to the Subsidiary Loan Agreements to reflect certain administrative changes that occurred
during implementation.

The rest of the components were implemented as planned with some minor changes in
the scope of some activities, such as the elimination of the GDP green growth study, the
reduction of the scope of the institutional strengthening activities 4 for the wastewater
utility in Jiangmen, and corresponding purchase of equipment instead.

Other minor changes were:




4
 Mainly related to the suppression of the implementation of the training plan for JBWC staff. This training plan was
modified by the company and implemented using the company’s own funding.




                                                          5
       - The slight reduction in the number of km of sewers built in Foshan (1.1 km out
       of 8) to be included under a different locally funded urban development project.
       - The client financed 0.9 km of river embankments out of the original 6.67.
       - The length of river bed dredged was 7 km less than expected because the
       detailed survey conducted at the design stage revealed that part of the sediments
       were not polluted, being just sand and gravel, so that section of the river was
       consequently ruled out.
       - The incorporation of the GIS-based wastewater network map into the broader
       urban management information database of Foshan.

The final project cost was US$142.2 million, with US$70.92 disbursed by the loan. This
disbursement amount is US$25.08 million less than the loan contribution estimated at
appraisal (US$96 million). This difference is mainly due to changes in design,
procurement savings due to substantial low bids, but also due to overestimation of loan
requirement at appraisal and some incomplete activities such as the environmental
management system or the pumping station and pressure pipes in Foshan. A more
detailed analysis of the undisbursed amount is included in annex 1.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background Analysis

The main background analysis was conducted under the preparation of the PRD1. For
instance, the institutional arrangements at the regional and provincial levels were well
known, so project preparation focused more on assessing the context in the municipal
areas of Foshan and Jiangmen. The municipality of Shenzhen was initially considered to
be included under the project, but it preferred to pursue pollution control measures using
own resources.

The background analysis included an assessment of areas that, while not directly included
in the project design, helped to put the proposed investments in the broader context of the
efforts made by the provincial government to improve the quality of the PRD waterways.
For instance, information was also collected on the Industrial Pollution Control Action
Plan (IPCAP), discharge requirements, number of industries registered and targets on
industries to be reallocated.

During project preparation, feasibility studies and site selections for works were also
assessed. Different alternatives for design and implementation were analyzed considering
specific options for each component. A detailed financial assessment of the two
wastewater utilities (Foshan Water Group Company (FWGC) and Jiangmen Biyuan
Wastewater Treatment Company (JBWC)) included an analysis on cost recovery
mechanisms, surveys on willingness to pay, and projected tariffs aiming at full cost
recovery.




                                            6
Lessons learned

Lessons learned and recommendations from previous projects in China and from PRD1
were incorporated into the project design. These included the need to reinforce the
autonomy of utilities for a more efficient performance by relying on progressive tariff
increases, or the projection of future tariffs that are set by the level of average
incremental costs in the sector. Another lesson learned was the assimilation of the idea
that pursuing inter-municipal cooperation to build and manage environmental-related
infrastructure to achieve economies of scale, while desirable, was very challenging to
implement due to the difficulty to address the necessary institutional changes for
developing and operating inter-municipal infrastructure. Therefore, unlike PRD1, this
project did not include any activities promoting such approach.

Delegating the responsibility of project implementation to units that are relatively robust
and have the capacity to coordinate with related government agencies was another lesson
learned already identified in the PRD1 ICR.

Assessment of Project Design

The PDO was well aligned with provincial priorities and the Bank’s CPS. The design was
relatively simple and straightforward, with a focus on wastewater and sludge
management in two large cities in one province. The impacts of flood protection should
have been better worded in the PDO, so the main development objective of the project
could have been “to reduce water pollution discharge in the PRD system originating from
Foshan and Jiangmen municipalities and to reduce the recurrence of floods in Foshan”.

The Results Framework included adequate indicators to measure progress towards these
outcomes, although some of them could have been improved. Shortcomings relate to lack
of clarity in indicator wordings, unquantifiable or unrealistic targets, attribution
challenges, or impacts of project activities in the PDO not well reflected in the selected
indicators. Also, the PDO did not include language on “sustainability of operations” as a
goal, so Indicator #2 on evidence of improvement in effectiveness of operations, although
very important, was not closely aligned to the PDO itself. (See further details below in
Section 2.3.)

The project included appropriate activities to reduce pollution in the Foshan and
Jiangmen waterways. Given the low rates of collection and treatment of wastewater at
project identification, particularly in Jiangmen, it made sense to expand the collection and
treatment capacity considerably as the main way to reduce pollution entering the PRD
from these two municipalities. In Foshan, the project rightly answered an existing
demand to rehabilitate the main river, dredge its polluted sediment and design a safe way
to treat and dispose of both the sediment and the sludge from the increasing number of
WWTPs. These interventions, together with the establishment of an environmental
monitoring system, constituted provincial government efforts to control pollution in the
PRD.




                                             7
The project design rightly emphasized the need to guarantee the sustainability of the
interventions by focusing on the institutional and financial performance of the two
wastewater utilities. However, the conditions imposed to achieve financial autonomy by
recovering full costs, although in theory desirable, can be considered unrealistic: First, if
the wastewater sector alone is considered, one is unlikely to find utilities that recover full
costs within this sub-sector, as water supply operations often cross-subsidize wastewater
ones due to higher water supply than wastewater tariffs.

Second, in China, the Government is often responsible for capital investments, debts
service and depreciation, relieving this duty of the utility, which is usually only
responsible for O&M. While this arrangement would imply less autonomy to the utility to
make its own decisions, it does not mean that operations are not carried out adequately.
Under this project, Jiangmen Biyuan Wastewater Company was expected to become an
autonomous company responsible for both investments and operations of wastewater
services. However, this was not a priority for the government and the financial covenant
in the legal documents (designed for an autonomous company) was never applicable as
the government continued to be responsible for investments.

The targets set up for pollution reduction by the two WWTPs financed by the project
were not realistic, as they overestimated the concentration of pollutants in the inflows to
the WWTPs. This problem of dilution of pollutants is indeed endemic to the region,
caused by a combination of factors, such as combined collection networks (including
drainage and wastewater), high volume of rainfall and runoff and high water tables,
resulting in high infiltration rates in the network. During the restructuring, this problem
was partially amended by modifying one of the targets in indicator 1 and introducing a
new indicator on BOD removed by the plants with more realistic targets.

Safeguards. The project was correctly designed as Category “A” with two safeguard
policies triggered: OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement. In response, a comprehensive environmental assessment (EA) was carried
out in conformity with Bank and Chinese national policies. The final version was
disclosed to the public through the Bank’s Infoshop on April 27, 2006 and the
environmental management plan was disclosed on April 29, 2006. The Resettlement
Action Plan was disclosed on April 27, 2006.

Government’s Commitment and Stakeholder Participation. Guangdong Province
showed commitment to addressing water pollution in the PRD through its decision to go
forward with the ambitious PRD Clean-up Plan, reinforced with signed agreements
between the Provincial Governor and all city mayors on the increased level of wastewater
treatment coverage and other targets that cities should achieve by 2010. (See Annex 7)

Foshan and Jiangmen municipalities demonstrated strong interest in the project by setting
up well staffed PMOs and by assigning considerable budget for project preparation.
Foshan supported an autonomous company responsible for managing water supply and




                                              8
wastewater services in the City, and Jiangmen established a new one responsible for
wastewater services in 2006.

Both cities held public consultations involving meetings with key stakeholders and
considered public opinion surveys among directly affected people. The main issues and
concerns were incorporated into the project EA and environmental management plans
(EMPs) appropriately.

Assessment of Risks. The overall project risk was rated “Moderate”. Critical risks
related to the achievement of project outcomes were identified, the highest being the risk
that sources of water pollution outside of the project scope would not be effectively
controlled. Other risks related to the poor performance of wastewater utilities due to lack
of institutional and financial autonomy, and poor regulatory framework. No fiduciary or
social safeguards related risks were identified.

Additional risks related to potential overestimation of pollution loads to be removed by
the WWTPs should have been identified, given that this is a well-known and common
problem in the region. Also, although land acquisition and resettlement were not
significant in the project, they have caused delays in similar projects in China, so this risk
should have been included, as it affected the completion of the interception of wastewater
in the flood protection component.

Quality at Entry. In 2007, the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) carried out a review of
the project’s “quality at entry” and rated it “satisfactory”. This report downgraded QAE
to Moderately Satisfactory because of problems with the results framework that make
difficult to properly assess project outcomes and the need to set up more realistic targets
(For full discussion see Section 5.1a.)

2.2 Project Implementation

Project implementation was, in general, smooth, with little changes compared to the
initial plans. The project was restructured in 2012 to reflect the change in the design of
the sludge component in Foshan, to amend the Results Framework and to extend the
Loan closing date by one year.

Changes in Sludge Component

The initial feasibility study for this component recommended a centralized facility to treat
400 ton of sludge per day. Treatment consisted of drying sludge using natural gas. Since
it was the first time this kind of facility was designed in the region, the feasibility study
used best estimates and assumptions based on data and experiences from other regions to
specify the key design parameters of the new facility. In 2011, new data from the existing
WWTPs in operation revealed that the volume of sludge to be treated was only 220




                                              9
tons/day. 5 As a result, a new feasibility study was prepared, and concluded that
decentralized sludge treatment at each WWTP was the best option.

The need to re-design the component delayed implementation. At Loan closing, two of
the four sludge treatment facilities were operating. The facility at Nanzhuang WWTP was
not operated, because the WWTP was not receiving enough wastewater due to
insufficient extension of the collection network which was funded outside the project. It
is expected to begin operations in June 2014. The plant at Chengbei has been completed
but will not be commissioned until the municipality approves the revision of the urban
master plan in the area where the plant is located. It is expected that this problem will be
resolved by the end of 2014. Of the 220 tons/day of sludge, the two working plants,
which are now under the commissioning period and progressively increasing to 50% of
throughput in July 2014.

Changes in Institutional Strengthening Activities

Institutional strengthening activities were slightly reduced in scope in the case of
Jiangmen. As such, the training plan defined for JBWC was not implemented using the
project funds but redefined and carried out by the company using their own sources.

In the case of Foshan, the institutional strengthening activities were designed to provide
support to the PMO on project management, monitoring of safeguard implementation,
procurement and financial management. In addition, three overseas trainings (in Hong
Kong SAR, China, organized by Hong Kong Chinese University, the US, organized by
the University of Southern California, and in Singapore with Leaders in Urban
Governance Program), and two overseas study tours to Europe and Malaysia were
carried out to learn on best practices related to project activities (wastewater, sludge
management, river restoration and environmental monitoring) together with one
international conference on urban development (organized jointly with Pacific Rim
Committee of Urban Development). A study on environmental costs for GDP growth and
“green” economic planning was cancelled because the PMO considered that the internal
review and approval processes the study should have gone through were too long and
cumbersome.

Other delays

The most significant delay relates to the implementation of the water environment
management information system, including the purchase of water quality stations,
designed to improve water quality monitoring and pollution control in Foshan waterways.
The main contracts should have been signed in the second half of 2008 according to the


5
  The PMO also found that the option of drying sludge using natural gas was more expensive than expected due to
increased gas prices, making other mechanical dewatering methods more economical. In addition, one of the existing
WWTPs had already installed a sludge treatment facility on site, so the centralized option made less sense at that point.




                                                          10
original procurement plan, but the project proposal was only finalized in March 2013.
The five contracts have now been procured and installation of water quality stations,
monitoring platform and modeling will be completed in August 2014.

Delay was caused by changes in decisions on the institution that was going to host this
activity, together with prolonged review by the Bank to the first and key contract due to
inconsistencies in the bid evaluation report.

Delays also affected some activities under the flood protection component: a pumping
station and a pressure pipe were still under construction at closing due to difficulties in
the selection of an appropriate location for the pump station in a densely populated area
of the city. In order to avoid complicated and expensive resettlement, a smaller
unoccupied area was selected between a busy market and a police station. The presence
of the police station required additional coordination and permits, which contributed to
further delays.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design

The indicators included in the Results Framework reflected the impact of most of the
project activities in the PDO and included target values derived from different studies
conducted during project preparation, such as the Environmental Assessment or the
Financial Analysis. The indicator of improved water quality in the river, although
influenced by most of the project activities, is also affected by external factors.
Additional indicators should have been added to better reflect the effect sediment
dredging, sludge management, wastewater interception, flood control and or the
environmental management system, in the PDO.

The project could have, among others, measured the amount of pollutants in the dredged
sediment, the volume of wastewater or pollutants intercepted in the river rehabilitation
component, the amount of sludge disposed safely, or even the reduction in pollutants
discharged by industries due to the better monitoring and enforcement of environmental
regulations.

Indicator #1 in the PAD should have been made more explicit and referred to the annual
reduction in water pollution discharge from the wastewater treatment plants financed by
the project. Also, while the PAD says the baseline and targets values are derived from the
Environmental Assessment, but it is not clear how the numbers in Foshan were calculated.
The indicator refers to COD, BOD, Nitrogen and Phosphorus pollution, but only COD
and Ammonia were monitored. The targets set up for indicator 1 overestimated the
amount of pollution to be removed by the plants.

Indicator #2 in the PAD should have included quantifiable indicators related to utility
benchmarks such as those introduced in the 2012 restructuring. Indicator #4 was not
directly attributable to the project and should not have been used as a PDO indicator. The



                                            11
financial covenants were not applicable in the case of Jiangmen, as the municipal
government never intended to make the utility responsible for capital investments.

Finally, to meet the standards, all indicators should have had annual targets instead of just
mid-term review and end-of-project targets.

Implementation

During implementation data on water quality was collected at the inlet and outlet of the
Zhen’an and Wen Chang Sha wastewater treatment plants, and in representative stations
along the Foshan and Jiangmen waterways. Financial data from the two utilities was also
periodically gathered in order to monitor their performance.

The implementation progress was monitored and information related to these indicators
was collected and reported in progress reports. The Bank kept track of progress of
physical, financial, environmental and resettlement and land acquisition aspects, which
were reported in the semi-annual progress reports. External resettlement monitoring
reports were prepared and submitted periodically.

To improve the Results Framework’s, the restructuring in November 2012 revised the
PDO Indicator #2 to read “Evidence of improvement in effectiveness in operations,
management and finances of wastewater utility services assisted under the project”, and
five sub-indicators were added to measure specific technical and financial performance
parameters of the two utilities, including cost-recovery ratio and debt service ratio. Target
values were revised and different from the financial covenants in the Project Agreement,
which were not modified in the amended text. This created misunderstanding on which
ones should be followed.

Baseline and target values for ammonia in indicator #1 were reduced for Foshan, but
other pollutant targets were not revised. This indicates that the modification may have
been to correct an error in the estimation of ammonia at appraisal.

Regarding Indicator #4, “Increases in property values for residential, commercial and
industrial properties adjacent to project areas”6, this was dropped because it was difficult
to properly measure, and the projects’ attribution was weak.

In addition, a Core Sector Indicator, “Volume (mass) of BOD pollution load removed by
treatment plant under the project” was introduced (Indicator #5) to comply with a new
corporate mandate and to correct the overestimation of the targets in indicator #1. It is
strange, though, that the other overestimated pollutant’s targets for indicator #1 (COD for
Foshan and Jiangmen and Ammonia for Jiangmen) were kept unchanged.


6
  This is the wording in the main text of the PAD. The results framework in the PAD wrongly refers to the increase in
“land use rights” instead of property values.

Utilization

Water quality in the river

The project helped to monitor water quality in a more comprehensive and systematic way
in Foshan. Monitoring will likely further improve once the environmental monitoring
system with automatic stations is in place in the summer of 2014. This improved water
quality monitoring system is allowing Foshan Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) to
better understand the capacity of the river to assimilate pollution loads and plan more
effective pollution control measures. Once the automatic monitoring stations come on
line, the EPB will be able to track pollutants more effectively, and better enforce
environmental regulations.

Effluent monitoring from WWTPs and Industries

Foshan EPB has an Environmental Monitoring Center where online water quality data is
being collected from individual wastewater treatment plants and major industries. The
center was created in 2006 and receives data from 41 major industries and 11 wastewater
treatment plants in Foshan municipality. Foshan was the first municipality in China to
install such a system and Jiangmen is in the process of establishing a similar one. Foshan
will also continue to monitor their discharges to ensure the compliance with regulations.

Financial performance of wastewater utilities

Both utilities will keep tracking the indicators introduced by the project to monitor
efficiency of their operations.

2.3 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social Safeguards. The Project triggered OP 4.12 and a Resettlement Action Plan for the
Foshan component was prepared and disclosed on April 27, 2006. Implementation of the
Plan started in 2006 and was completed by Loan closing. In February 2014, the Foshan
PMO submitted a summary report of resettlement implementation prepared by the
external monitoring institution of the Project and was found satisfactory. The Jiangmen
component did not include resettlement.

Apart from some delays in the implementation of some resettlement actions, there were
no other issues related to land acquisition or resettlement of project affected people. A
total of 15 households were re-located, compared to 10 originally planned, and the
number of affected people was significantly lower than planned (302 versus 1974) thanks
to attentive design. Overall, the project complied satisfactorily with OP 4.12. See Annex
6 for more details.

Environmental Safeguards. The laws, regulations, policies and administrative
requirements for environmental assessments of development projects in China were
followed, as was the Bank’s OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. During preparation,


                                           13
the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and EMP were reviewed, found satisfactory
and disclosed in April 2006. Environmental impacts and mitigation measures were fully
considered during project design, construction and operation phases. When the sludge
treatment component was redesigned, a supplemental EMP was prepared and disclosed in
April 2011. Training was carried out on key environmental safeguard compliance
requirements, and monitoring of the EMP implementation was adequate. Environmental
management measures were included in the bidding and contract documents as
environmental protection was central to project implementation.
Environmental management activities for the dredging of the Foshan Waterway deserved
especial attention. Effective mitigation measures were adequately adopted to ensure that
all environmental indicators were kept within acceptable levels and the environmental
protection targets were appropriately defined. Public consultation and information
disclosure was a continuous process during the entire project cycle. Semi-annual
environmental monitoring reports and EMP implementation reports were submitted to the
Bank regularly. From the environmental management perspective, this complex
component was carried out in an exemplary way. This example has now set the
benchmark standard for any further dredging and waste materials disposal to be
undertaken by the municipality.

Environmental monitoring was carried out by qualified monitoring institutions during the
construction and operation phases, in compliance with EMP recommendations. The
monitoring results showed that the effluent, ambient air quality, odor and noise, and
sludge complied with the relevant environmental standards during the operation of
WWTPs. The water quality in the Fenjiang River significantly improved with the
implementation of the project and other government financed interventions.

Based on the factors mentioned above, the rating of the environmental safeguard
performance of the Project is Satisfactory.

Financial Management

Financial management largely followed Bank procedures and all project audit opinions
were unqualified. However, some small issues related to weak financial management
practices arose during implementation, especially in Foshan. These issues were disclosed
by the external auditors and related to project accounting practices (improper procedures,
mismatching of project progress with financial data and weak controls on resettlement
funds).

Project management coordination mechanisms and communication between PMOs and
lower level PIUs were not always clear and the changes in the agency which hosted the
PMO in Foshan (from EPB to the Water Resources Bureau -WRB and then back to EPB)
caused delays in disbursements.

Overall project compliance with financial management procedures is rated moderately
satisfactory.




                                           14
Procurement

Procurement was generally carried out in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the
legal agreements, Bank guidelines, and the agreed procurement plan. Procurement for
one design-build contract, one two-stage design, supply and installation contract, and one
ICB water treatment plant, had to be re-bid or re-evaluated during the process, causing
delays up to 12 months.

More experienced consultants, together with more experienced staff, could have been
hired in the preparation of the bidding documents especially for drafting the technical
specifications and technical evaluation and qualification criteria. Better coordination
between the different project implementation units could have avoided procurement
processing disruptions. Overall project compliance with procurement procedures is rated
moderately satisfactory.

       2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Operation of the wastewater treatment facilities in both municipalities is successful.
Wastewater collection and treatment will continue to comply with central and provincial
government regulations. In Fohsan the goal is now is to have all the sludge treatment
plants operating by June 2014, except the one in Chengbei which may take longer, and to
find a disposal site closer than the existing one 7 in order to make the process more
efficient and cost-effective. A longer term solution would be to continue to investigate
innovative ways of finding “markets” for the sludge that can save costs. This is what
Jiangmen is now considering: taking the dewatered sludge to a cement kilt operated by a
private operator to be used as fuel.

A key challenge for both Jiangmen and Foshan is to keep improving the collection
networks through sewer rehabilitation, and extension to new city areas where more
households can be connected. That would contribute to improving the efficiency of
treatment operations in the plants.

Both utilities have defined clear strategic plans. FWGC has a contract with Foshan
municipality up to 2030. The company plans to expand future investments and operations
through PPP arrangements in the form of BOTs beyond Foshan Municipality. JBWC is
also in the process of implementing its business and financial plans. Its contract with
Jiangmen municipality is being revised and will be renewed in 2015, simultaneously with
the next scheduled tariff increase. The company is developing a center to monitor
operations of all the WWTPs, similarly to the system existing in Foshan. The future
increase in wastewater tariffs planned in both municipalities will have positive effects on
the key financial performance indicators of both utilities, and on the sector in general that

    The existing landfill is approximately 100 km from the closest WWTP.




                                                          15
can become more financially independent and less dependent on budget government
subsidies (see Annex 3).

Foshan municipality plans are to keep improving its river quality monitoring network.
Once the environmental monitoring system financed by the project is in place, Foshan
EPB could easily add new monitoring stations in order to increase water quality
surveillance in the main waterways of the urban area.

The landfill where river sediments were stored has been closed and being monitored by a
private firm. The company had a contract for two years that has recently expired and
Foshan EPB is now taking charge of leachate monitoring.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives

RATING: Substantial

The PDO was relevant from preparation and through implementation. The PDO was
consistent with the two main CPS (FY06-FY10) themes which were key development
priorities, notably: (a) strengthening environmental protection and natural resource
management; and (b) improving urban environmental management and public service
provision. At completion, the PDO remained relevant with the new Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS, FY13 to FY16), whose first strategic theme is “supporting greener
growth” by “enhancing urban environmental services”; and “demonstrating pollution
control measures”.

The activities included in the project were aligned with the strategy set up by the
provincial government to improve the water quality of the PRD and its Clean-Up Plan.
Project activities were complementary to others being implemented by the provincial
government that also contributed to this broader environmental objective. Annex 7
includes an update of the Clean-up Plan implemented by Guangdong province as of April
2014.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

RATING: Moderately Satisfactory

As demonstrated by the EA, the reduction of pollution discharges was to be achieved
through three groups of activities in Foshan: (a) increasing the wastewater collected and
treated by expanding the Zhen’an WWTP; (b) dredging the river to eliminate polluted
sediments and increase its discharge capacity and (c) rehabilitating the Fenjiang
riverbanks by intercepting wastewater and transmitting it to the WWTP; In the case of
Jiangmen, the reduction of pollution relied exclusively on significantly expanding the
Wen Chang Sha WWTP.




                                           16
Reduction of Water Pollution in Foshan

(a) Increasing wastewater collection and treatment. The project investments expanded the
capacity of the Zhen’an WWTP from 200,000 m3/d to 250,000 m3/d, and constructed 7.6
km of associated sewer collection networks. The expanded WWTP was completed in
2010 beginning operations on the same year. At closing, the WWTP was operating at the
high hydraulic capacity of 95%; its full hydraulic capacity will be reached once
additional networks being financed outside the project are completed in 2015. With the
expansion of the WWTP 8 and the additional network, 600,000 people in Chancheng
district in Foshan are being served today, expanding to 890,000 in 2020 with future
developments of the network. These interventions have contributed to increase the
amount of wastewater collection and treatment in Foshan from 55% at appraisal to 88%
at closing (8 % more than expected).

(b) Sludge Treatment and Disposal. To complement the collection and treatment of
additional wastewater, the project financed the design of four decentralized sludge
treatment facilities and the construction of three, with the fourth nearly completed using
own financing at closing. Total capacity of the treatment works is 220 tons/day. These
new facilities will ensure sludge is properly treated and safely disposed, preventing the
contamination of groundwater and adjacent waterways around the disposal site as before
the project.

(c) Foshan River Water Quality Improvements – Riverbank rehabilitation. 6.7 km of
embankments along the Fenjiang river were improved by intercepting wastewater and re-
directing it to the WWTP and elevating the river banks to a high sufficient to protect
against a 1 over 50 years flood event. No indicator value is available to quantify the
amount of wastewater that was intercepted. These works also added to the amenity value
of the urban environment (see figure 1 in Annex 7).

(d) Foshan River Water Quality Improvements – Dredging and disposal. The project
financed dredging for sediment removal with 28 km of river dredged compared to 35 km
estimated at appraisal, as the scope was re-assessed in the Design approved in November
2007. Nearly 700,000 m3 of wet sediments were dredged and dewatered resulting in
362,600 m3 of dried sludge (less than 60% water content) which were disposed of safely
in a specially designed landfill in an abandoned quarry 28km away. The landfill was then
sealed in late 2011 and it is being operated today to ensure safe disposal of leachates. The
removal of these polluted sediments arguably helped improve water quality and increased
the river’s discharge capacity although no directly linked indicators are available.


Key Indicators. Indicators #1 and #5 measure the reduction in pollution discharges into
Foshan’s waterways:

                              WWTP)

Targets for indicator one on COD discharges appear under-achieved due to a clear
overestimation of the influent concentrations of COD reaching the WWTP at appraisal
and not due to plant malfunction or design issues. These high targets aimed to reflect
ongoing progress in expanding collection networks together with rapid expansion of
industrialization in Foshan. At the time of project restructuring the target for ammonia
was re-assessed, and a more realistic one was established. In addition realistic BOD
target was introduced in new indicator five. This target was surpassed by 77%. The plant
effectiveness in removing COD and NH4 is high with 88 and 94 % removal rates
respectively9.

In addition, water quality in the river improved as shown by Indicator #3, “Compliance
rate for COD, BOD, NH4-N and TP (mg/l) with river quality standards at measurement
stations in Foshan” as shown below. At appraisal, the water quality was considered
“worse than Class V” in the Chinese system due to its high NH4-N levels (see Annex 7).
At project closing, the NH4-N level had declined to 1.42 mg/l, improving the river’s
water quality to “Class V” (see also Annex 7).

This indicator reflects the effects of both project activities (link demonstrated in the EA),
and activities outside the project. For instance, Foshan EPB made considerable progress
towards mitigating industrial pollution control: three major and fifty wastewater
generators, and from two major polluted industrial sectors improved its wastewater
treatment to meet discharge limits and illegal wastewater dischargers along the Fenjiang
River were drastically reduced to marginal levels according to Foshan EPB. A total of
144 industrial enterprises were shut down and/or relocated during the project period.

(d) Water quality monitoring. The project was to finance the construction of four
automatic water quality monitoring stations and a water environmental management
information system under the “River Water Quality Improvement” component, but at
closing these works were ongoing. An emergency preparedness system to facilitate rapid
reaction from EPB towards uncontrolled discharge of pollutants in the river will be also
part of this component. The project also developed and installed a GIS, originally
included under the “Wastewater Management” component. The GIS now constitutes a
solid database of geo-referenced information to make informed decisions not only on
environmental matters, but also in other disciplines such as land planning. The tool
defined a set of survey and mapping standards, technical specifications for database
design as well as quality control and assurance mechanism on data migration, which will
be used for future data maintenance.
Reduction of Water Pollution in Jiangmen

Water pollution from the core urban districts of Jiangmen was to be reduced by
increasing the amount of wastewater treated in the city. At appraisal, the Wen Chang Sha
WWTP had a capacity of 50,000 m3/d. The project financed the expansion of the WWTP
to bring capacity to 200,000 m/3, as well as a pumping station, and 22 km of sewers. At
closing Jiangmen’s wastewater treatment capacity had risen from 22% at appraisal to
70%, mainly due to this expansion, serving about 500,000 people in the urban area. The
WWTP is now working at 81% of hydraulic capacity and it is expected to reach its full
capacity in the next years with further extensions of the collection network, reaching
600,000 potential beneficiaries. Pollution reduction targets were overestimated at
appraisal. The plant effectiveness in removing COD and NH4 is high with 89 and 97 %
removal rates respectively10. Indicator #5 introduced at restructuring, set up more realistic
targets.

Key Indicators. Indicators #1 and #5 measure the reduction in pollution discharges into
Jiangmen’s waterways:

In addition, water quality in the river improved as shown by Indicator #3 “Compliance
rate for COD, BOD, NH4-N and TP (mg/l) with river quality standards at measurement
stations in Jiangmen”. At appraisal baseline values showed pollution levels worse than
Class IV due to high COD, BOD and NH4-N levels. The target of meeting Class IV was
met after the project. As in the case of Foshan, this indicator cannot be fully attributable
to project activities. For instance, Jiangmen has achieved the target of having 95% of
registered industries complying with discharge standards.

Financial Analysis. Financial analysis was carried out at the completion of the project to
assess the financial sustainability of the wastewater companies in Foshan and Jiangmen
measuring the level of cost recovery in the sector and the impact of government
contribution on their fiscal expenditures. The results of this analysis are summarized as
follows with details provided in Annex 3.

Two financial indicators are included in the project financial covenants to assess the
financial sustainability of the wastewater companies in Foshan and Jiangmen. These are
(i) full cost recovery rate and (ii) debt service coverage ratio.

In Foshan, the financial analysis was carried out for Changcheng District, as it is the
jurisdictional territory for the Foshan Water Group Company (FWGC). This analysis
shows that the current concessional rate11 stipulated in the BOT contract between FWGC
and Foshan Municipal Government is enough for FWGC to comply with the indicator of
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSR) established in the financial covenant (DSR of 1.6 vs.


11
     Concessional rate is referring in this ICR to the rate paid by local governments to wastewater companies.




                                                            20
the target of 1.3) 12, but failed to meet the requirements of full Cost Recovery (CRR) in
2012 and 2013 (CRR of 0.9 achieved vs the target of 1 in the financial covenants, and
1.12 in the Results Framework). It is projected that full cost recovery could be met in
2014 and 2015, mainly due to the reduction of debt service requirements.13

An additional analysis shows that controlling the level of debt for capital investment
could help the wastewater company to comply with the requirement of full cost recovery.
Had FWGC borrowed less for its capital investment and used more internal cash, the full
cost recovery rate could have been complied with.

A financial analysis of the entire wastewater sector 14 also shows that the current
wastewater tariff paid by customers is not sufficient to cover full costs (investment and
operations) of the wastewater sector in Chancheng District (collection and treatment).
This tariff is to be increased more than 50% twice in 2014 and 2015 in order to meet the
funding requirements of the wastewater sector in Chancheng District. However, revenues
from wastewater tariff are sufficient to cover O&M costs for both treatment and
collection.

In Jiangmen, the analysis shows that JBWC, responsible for wastewater treatment, can
cover O&M costs through the concessional rate paid by the municipal government.
However, since it is the municipal government the one responsible for capital
investments and debt service payments, it is not possible to calculate the full cost
recovery and debt service ratios for the company. For the purpose of this ICR, the
financial analysis made a hypothetical assumption of including a fictitious payment from
the municipal government to the company equivalent to the value of depreciation of
assets15. Under this assumption, JBWC would comply with the financial covenant of debt
service coverage ratio and full cost recovery in 2013.

The level of cost recovery in the whole wastewater sector was also analyzed (including
not only treatment but also collection networks). The results show that the wastewater
revenues from the wastewater tariff can cover the O&M costs of wastewater treatment
and collection, although not the full costs including debt service and depreciation. To
meet the requirements of full cost recovery, it is estimated that the wastewater tariff in
Jiangmen should be increased from the current level of RMB 0.81 m3/ to RMB1.46 /m3
in 2014, and RMB1.61/ m3 in 2015.




12
   Yet, it does not comply with the target set up at restructuring (2.33).
13
   Note that these indicators were calculated only for the wastewater branch of the company, ie, excluding the water
   supply business.
14
   This includes not only wastewater treatment operations carried out by the company, but also the collection network
   which is responsibility of the municipal government
15
   The basis of this assumption relies on the idea that if the company were to take over investment responsibilities, it
   would have to receive a subsidy amount equal to the depreciation of the assets (subsidies are allowed under the
   revenue component of the cost recovery ratio as per the definitions included in the Project Agreement)




                                                           21
Economic Analysis

All project components were evaluated based on a least-cost analysis at appraisal since
projects benefits are difficult to quantify in a reasonably reliable manner, especially those
related to effects in public health and the environment.

The total project cost estimated at appraisal was US$187.9 million. At project closure, all
activities were completed except the environmental management system and the pumping
station and pressure pipes in Foshan that were still under implementation. The final
project cost incurred was US$147.1 million. The differences with the estimated cost at
appraisal are mainly due to favorable exchange rates. Although the loan savings were
US$ 25.08 million, contracts executed by the project spent an additional US$12.89
million compared with the procurement plan prepared at appraisal. Detailed information
on the differences between the costs estimated at appraisal and amounts finally spent by
the projects are included in Annex 1.

Average incremental costs (AIC) of selected alternatives of the WWTPs are almost the
same (Foshan) or lower (Jiangmen) than expected at appraisal. In the case of the sludge
management component, the feasibility study conducted at restructuring shows that the
decentralized option for treating sludge was more economical than the centralized one
considered at appraisal. The river rehabilitation component was also cheaper than
expected, unlike the river dredging which was US$ 20 million more expensive than
expected. A more detailed analysis can be found in Annex 3.

The economic and financial efficiency of the project is rated moderate.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Considering the substantial relevance of the PDO, the moderately satisfactory
achievement of project outputs and outcomes despite the shortcomings of project design,
and the relatively moderate efficiency with which project results were achieved the
overall project outcome rating is moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project did not target any particular beneficiary group nor was poverty focused. Yet,
improving the urban environment through better water quality in the main waterways can
be considered a public good with widespread benefits on public health and the economy.

The financial analysis conducted an affordability assessment on the sanitation tariffs.
This assessment concluded that both the previous and future expected increases in water




                                             22
and wastewater tariffs are broadly affordable even for the bottom 1% of low-income
families.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The two PMOs benefited from technical assistance to support project management tasks
including planning on tariff setting, financial management, procurement, contract
management and environmental and social safeguards monitoring.

In addition to supporting project management, Institutional Strengthening activities in
Foshan, focused on providing extensive training to the PMO and other municipal
agencies on sustainable urban development topics. The most relevant event was the
organization of an international conference to assess urban development in Foshan,
followed by study tours to learn from best urban development practices in Hong Kong
SAR, China (organized with the Hong Kong Chinese University), US (University of
Southern California) and Singapore (Leaders in Urban Governance Program).

In the case of Jiangmen, the institutional strengthening activities focused on providing
support to the recently established Jiangmen Biyuan Wastewater Company (2006), which
had been created to be responsible for the operation of the Wen Chang Sha WWTP.
During project implementation the company consolidated its operations and also went
through internal restructuring processes. The Technical Assistance (TA) developed a
business plan including a clear financial model and procedure manuals to increase
efficiency, enhance work performance and streamline job functions of key staff. Some of
the recommendations from the TA were applied by the company. However, the company
decided to use their own resources to implement the training plan and followed their own
financial model.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The GIS system has been used not only as the basis for the environmental management
system but also for other city departments to improve their databases and use it for
planning and decision making purposes. In addition, the provincial and municipal
governments have seen the dredging activity as something to be replicated elsewhere,
following the best practices from this project in terms of safe management and disposal
of the sludge dredged and transferred to a secured landfill.

The sludge management component was also innovative. The municipal government still
has to find an alternative sludge disposal site and operator to make the process more
efficient and cost-effective, but this example is likely to be replicated in other areas of the
PRD given the rapid expansion of wastewater treatment plants in this region. In the city
of Jiangmen, the utility is lowering costs of treating sludge by taking it to a cement kilt
for combustion. This approach is also new, and an example of mutually beneficial
arrangements that can be defined from the value added of the sludge as a by-product of




                                              23
wastewater treatment. This example may be also followed by other wastewater treatment
plants in the region.

Jiangmen’s utility’s good performance has been recognized with a national award from
the Ministry of Environment. The municipality and the company are planning to develop
an environmental learning center in the facilities of the WWTP to disseminate
environmental information and sensitize the public on the importance of environmental
management and pollution control.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Continuity of the PRD clean-up plan in Foshan and Jiangmen: low.

Although the region will continue to grow fast together with industrial activity, both the
municipal and provincial governments showed great commitment in keeping up with the
environmental management agenda in the region (See Annex 7).

Completion of unfinished project activities: low.

Both the environmental management system and the infrastructure included in the flood
protection component will be completed in the summer of 2014 and will start being
operational before the end of the year. The same is the case of the sludge treatment plants,
already under commissioning, with the exception of Nanzhuang which will do so in June,
and Chengbei which is waiting for approval by the municipality.

Sustainability of wastewater treatment operations: moderate.

The existing institutional and financial arrangements that both utilities have now with the
respective governments work well, and there is no reason to believe the investments
under the project will be affected by low maintenance or poor operations. It is desirable,
though, to keep increasing tariffs to strengthen the financial autonomy of the wastewater
sector, including also investments and operation of the sewer network, under the
responsibility of the municipal governments. The treatment plants have potential to
perform more efficiently by expanding the collection networks and reducing infiltration
levels.

Adequate Sludge and landfill management: low.

Sludge management operations are performing well for two out of the four facilities
financed by the project. The other two facilities will start operation in 2014. Foshan
municipality is in the process of looking for a more convenient and closer disposal site to
increase the efficiency of the process. The landfill site where sediments from the river
have been stored and closed will be monitored by Foshan EPB.




                                            24
Increasing flooding risks due to climate change: moderate.

A recent study16 has identified the city of Guangzhou in the PRD as the most vulnerable
coastal city in the world to climate change. The high risk is due to the increasing threat of
sea level rise, land subsidence and increasing frequency and intensity of rainfall events,
together with the large number of people living in the area and the high value of the
outputs produced by the region. The cities of Foshan and Jiangmen belong to the PRD
metropolitan area, and the conclusions of that study, could, at some extent, apply to these
two cities as well. Additional measures to mitigate flood risks will be probably necessary
in some critical areas in the next years. Detailed assessments will be needed to determine
the scope of such measures.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank team did well in incorporating lessons from PRD1, particularly in supporting
utilities to improve their performance, focusing on improving cost recovery in the sector
and to focus on interventions where the Bank could add value due to its innovative
characteristics and abandoning the idea of pursuing the difficult to implement inter
municipal cooperation.

The project interventions were well identified. It made sense to focus on wastewater
treatment on one side and on activities where sound knowledge and best international
practices could be applied. As recognized in the QAE assessment, investment selection
was based on economic rationality and lower costs rather than guided by political criteria.
That assessment recognized that considerable work was carried out financed by donor
funds and Bank budget to cover technical engineering, hydrological, economic, financial
social and institutional aspects of water pollution abatement in the PRD region.

Bank management was right in giving continuity to the team from PRD1, due to its high
technical level and experience in the region. The team developed a strong partnership
with the two municipalities, which would continue for the whole period of the project and
would be key to solve problems timely and effectively.

All preparatory work was conducted successfully and on time in only 1.5 years. Guidance
related to the preparation of social and environmental safeguards documents was given



16
     Hallegate et al. Nature Climate Change, 2013




                                                    25
timely so these documents were prepared well in advance and according to the Bank
policies and required standards.


Due to the shortcomings in the design of the results framework and the unrealistic
financial covenants pertaining to full cost recovery in the wastewater sector, the QAE
rating is reduced to moderately satisfactory. These issues could have been avoided had
the team made a more thorough effort to set up clear “smart” indicators that included a
well-defined baselines and were based on a more realistic view of the Chinese
institutional context in the sector.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Project supervision was planned and carried out adequately. Supervision teams were well
staffed to address and report on implementation issues as they emerged. Overall, the
Bank showed proactivity and flexibility by restructuring the project in 2012 to re-design
the sludge management component, extend the project period for one year and improve
the results framework by adding more quantifiable indicators to measure utility efficiency
and by dropping the indicator on increased land use rights.

The Bank continued to monitor the various technical challenges related to quality of
construction, installation, testing and commissioning of key works, and kept close tabs on
remedial actions taken by suppliers and contractors. The team’s safeguards experts
continuously followed up on implementation of the EMP and RAP. The Bank conducted
regular supervision missions twice a year.

The Bank provided the right expertise to resolve the issues causing delays such as
procurement irregularities and financial management weaknesses. Letters were sent to the
PMOs requesting them to take actions to address the issues disclosed by the auditors.
During supervision missions, the Bank reviewed the remedial actions being taken by the
PMOs and provided on-the-job training of financial management practices.
The Bank dealt directly with Project Implementation Units, when detecting internal
communication problems between PMO and PIUs. This was a smart decision to make
implementation more fluent by avoiding additional confusion and further delays. All
major issues that arose during project implementation were candidly reported in bi-
annual Implementation Status Reports (ISRs).

Finance analysts joined the supervision missions to follow up on the financial
performance of the two utilities, providing advice on future actions to achieve the
financial covenants.

During restructuring, the team could have also been more coherent when resetting targets
in indicator #1 (PAD) updating not only the target for ammonia in Foshan, but also all the
other parameters. ISRs could also have alerted that this and Jiangmen’s corresponding



                                           26
indicators were not on track. The financial covenants in the amended Project Agreement
at restructuring should have been updated to match the values set up in the new RF. The
rationale for this change in targets of cost recovery should have been explained.
Additional indicators could have been introduced to ensure the impacts from all project
activities in the PDO were measurable.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Consistent with the ratings on the quality at entry, quality of supervision, the overall
Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Government commitment to address the environmental problems of the PRD remained
strong from preparation to completion. Provincial and local authorities showed strong
leadership by making the necessary institutional reforms, such as the creation and
development of JBWC, and providing counterpart funding estimated at US$91.9 million
to support or complement project activities. The progress made in the implementation of
the Clean-Up Campaign explained in Annex 7, is also proof of the strong commitment to
keep up with the environmental agenda by the Guangdong provincial government.

The borrower also accepted a more convenient decentralized way to manage the project.
So unlike the PRD1, the provincial PMO delegated all project management tasks to
PMOs in the two cities. This arrangement favored a more fluent implementation as it
avoided extra clearance processes.

The provincial and municipal governments also played a key role in the selection of
project activities. The fact that they wanted to avoid “low hanging fruits” and rather
preferred to include those activities that were more technically complex was proved to be
the right approach.

While the government complied with most of the project covenants and agreements, that
was not the case for the financial ones related to the financial performance of the utility in
Foshan. Although these covenants were too ambitious (and invalid in the case of
Jiangmen), tariffs in the sector are still on the low side so the two municipal governments
could have made stronger efforts to further raise tariffs to improve the financial
autonomy of the wastewater sector.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance




                                             27
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Implementing agencies completed detailed designs, conducted design reviews and
implemented the environmental and social safeguards measures correctly with some
delays. Implementing agencies maintained strong commitment to achieving the PDO.

Foshan PMO was proactive in dealing with the startup delays and slow procurement
approvals and in achieving effective results. Implementation of the EMP was efficient
and environmental performance had been continuously rated highly satisfactory by the
Bank supervision missions. Final project cost was well within the appraisal estimates
despite significant depreciation of the US Dollar. This depreciation was also in part
responsible for the unspent US$ 25.08 million as shown by Annex 1.

Foshan PMO could have managed the institutional changes better, so the delays in the
execution of the environmental management component could have been avoided.


In both PMOs the quality of monitoring and reporting on the project outcomes and output
indicators was good, although it would have been desirable to pay more attention at
indicator #1 (PAD) so that actions could have been taken to set up more realistic targets
at some point during project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

With the rating on Government’s performance as satisfactory and the rating for
Implementing Agencies’ performance as moderately satisfactory, the overall Borrower
performance rating is moderately satisfactory, in line with the project outcome.

6. Lessons Learned

Lessons learned from the project could be summarized as follows:

Projects that fit into a broader government program can more easily maintain relevance
over time. The project remained relevant because it fed into an active, broader
government program to clean up the Pearl River Delta. Project interventions
complemented others financed by the provincial and local governments, and some of
these activities, set up sound examples that could be replicated elsewhere. Bank technical
support was essential to ensuring the successful completion of such activities.

The Results Framework deserves closer attention during the entire project cycle. Without
a solid and clear results framework it is difficult to measure the success of a project. In
this case, the task team reacted to the problem and was able to correct some of the
mistakes made during project design. However, the final results framework was still not




                                            28
perfect. This is an area where the Bank repeatedly underperforms, so additional training
is needed to task teams.

It is important to be realistic when defining the conditions that need to be in place to
ensure the financial and institutional sustainability of project investments. Although
raising wastewater tariffs is necessary to improve cost recovery, the Bank was too
dogmatic about requiring full cost recovery in utilities of the wastewater sector, and in
trying to promote an institutional model that was not accepted in the case of Jiangmen.

Better analysis of influent characteristics at the design stage: A better analysis of influent
characteristics is needed at the appraisal stage to avoid overdesigning the WWTP. Since
this is a common problem in the region, it is worth to explore the option of carrying out
some analytical work to address the problem in a more systematic way.

Collection of wastewater is as important as treatment. Working on improving the quality
and extension of the wastewater collection networks is essential to keep the wastewater
treatment plants working at maximum efficiency, meaning maximizing the removal of
pollutants discharged in the rivers. This does not necessarily imply building separate
systems for sewerage and drainage, but could mean improving the performance of
combined ones, maximizing the number of households connected and minimizing run-off
in urban areas through innovative methods (i.e. increasing area of permeable soils,
natural waterways, or green roofs, among others).

Centralized vs decentralized sludge treatment: While in principle centralized approaches
are preferred for sludge treatment facilities to achieve economies of scale, the analysis
should be case specific and conducted using real data rather than estimates and
assumptions. Local factors should be carefully considered such as gas prices, distances
from the different WWTPs to the centralized treatment facility, the effect of the dilution
problem in the amount of sludge to be produced and policy restrictions and/or market
access issues related to the reuse of sludge by-products.

There is potential for extending collaboration with the Bank to support innovative
investments to keep working on the environmental quality of the urban waterways of the
PRD and other similar regions in China. Areas such as sludge management, looking for
innovative ways to treat and dispose sludge, understanding the links between flood risk
management and urban sanitation by having more efficient collection networks, better
and more efficient monitoring and control of river pollution, or even looking for new
ways to manage solid waste are some of the areas to consider. The World Bank is in an
excellent position to add value by bringing best international practices in these activities.

     Depreciation of Dollars – The exchange rate is reduced from 1:8 at appraisal (December 2006) to 1:6.17 (ICR).

   Undisbursed funds due to incomplete activities at project closure are US$ 3.09 million in the Foshan component
only

   Change of design – Frist, the sludge component changed from a centralized 400 tpd sludge treatment center (sludge
drying) to four decentralized total 220 tpd sludge advanced dewatering plants within the premises of the WWTPs,
which result in substantially cost saving (no need for expensive site formation, access road, and only simple structure).
Second, the river embankment is reduced from 6.7 km to 5.8 km as some sections of river embankment were
constructed using local financing sources. Third, the river dredging is reduced from 35km to 28km and the amount of
river sediment is reduced by 27%, after detailed survey was undertaken, revealing less than anticipated sediment as
compared to the estimate made at appraisal (FS), which results in cost saving on both the river dredging and landfill
contracts.

Annex 3        Economic and Financial Analysis

A.        Financial Analysis

Financial analysis was conducted during the preparation of ICR (i) to assess the financial
situation of the project companies responsible for wastewater treatment in terms of cost
recovery; (ii) to show cost recovery levels in the entire wastewater sector considering the
costs of collecting, treating, and disposing wastewater; and (iii) to show at the extent of
which point Foshan and Jiangmen municipalities had sufficient financial resources to
meet the requirements of providing counterpart funds.

I.        Foshan

Institutional context. The wastewater management and sludge treatment components
were implemented by Foshan Water Group Company (FWGC) which is an independent
state-owned enterprise. FWGC owns and manages 16 water supply plants with a total
capacity of 2.138 million m3/day and water supply pipelines with a total length of
4,804.58 km. The total service area of FWGC’s water supply business is about 2,057 km2
including Chancheng, Sanshui, and Gaoming Districts and the total beneficiary
population is near 3.17 million.

FWGC operates 10 wastewater treatment plants with a total capacity of 880,000 m3/day
located in Chancheng, Sanshui, Nanhai, and Gaoming districts through TOT20 or BOT21
contracts with different district governments. FWGC also built sewer networks through
BT 22 contract with Chancheng District Government. Among those 10 wastewater
treatment plants, only 3 wastewater treatment plants, Zhen’an, Dongpo, and Shagang, are
located in the Chancheng District, Foshan’s core urban area.

The financial analysis of FWGC conducted during the preparation of the project focused
on FWGC’s wastewater treatment business in the territory of Chancheng District because
project interventions are located in this district, which has an independent jurisdiction
from Foshan Municipal Government. The financial analysis for FWGC does not include
the sewer networks and pumping stations which are run by Chancheng District
Government.

Existing wastewater tariff and its collection mechanism. The wastewater tariff is
collected from water users by FWGC together with the water tariff. It is then transferred
to Chancheng District Government represented by Chancheng District Finance Bureau.
The adjustment of this tariff needs to go through public hearing and gets understanding of
water users. There is then a concessional rate is paid by Chancheng District Government
represented by Chancheng District Finance Bureau to FWGC based on the amount of

   TOT: transfer, operate, and transfer.

   BOT: build, operate, and transfer.
22
   BT: build and transfer.

wastewater treated by FWGC according to the BOT contract between FWGC and
Chancheng District Government. The adjustment of this concessional rate very much
depends on the terms and conditions of the BOT contract.

The following table shows the development of the wastewater tariff and concessional rate
in Chancheng District since the preparation of the project in 2003.

The financial analysis conducted during the preparation of the ICR was carried out at the
company level and at the sector level. The results of both analyses are presented in the
following paragraphs:

FWGC’s Wastewater Business. The financial analysis of FWGC’s wastewater business
is to assess its financial situation relying on two key indicators included in the financial
covenants of the project23: the cost recovery ratio and the debt service coverage ratio. The
financial information for the assessment came from the audited financial statements of
FWGC’s wastewater business and the results are presented in the following table.




23
  The Financial Covenants included in the Project Agreement are: “(i) the utility’s total revenues must be the sum of its
total operating expenses, increases in working capital (other than cash), and the amount by which debt service
requirements exceeds depreciation; and (ii) the debt service coverage ratio is at least 1.2 times in 2008 and 2009, and
1.3 times in 2010 and beyond”. This means Cost Recovery Ratio of 1 and Debt Service Ratio of 1.3. Yet, those targets
were modified at restructuring (see Results Framework)

Therefore, based on the terms and conditions of the BOT contract, FWGC is close to the
situation of meeting the financial covenants. FWGC complies with the covenant of debt
service coverage ratio defined in the legal agreement24, but fails to meet the requirements
of full cost recovery in 2012 and 2013. It is projected that the covenant of full cost
recovery could be met in 2014 and 2015, mainly due to the reduction of debt services
requirements.

An additional analysis shows that more control on the debt for capital investment could
help comply with full cost recovery. For example, the annual debt service requirements
are controlled to the level of annual depreciation. It implies that the depreciation could be
sufficient to pay the limited debt service requirements. Assuming that FWGC had
borrowed less for its capital investment and used more internal cash, the full cost
recovery rate would be as follows:

Wastewater Sector in Chancheng. The revenue of the wastewater sector in Chancheng
District mainly comes from the wastewater tariff collected by FWGC and governmen t’s
subsidies. The expenses of the sector include the concessional rate paid to FWGC for
wastewater treatment including sludge treatment and concessional payments for other
two wastewater treatment plants, Chengbei and Nanzhuang, in Chancheng District. To
this, the expenses of running the collection network including pumping stations have to
be added. The revenue and expenses of wastewater sector in Chancheng District are
summarized as follows:

The above analysis shows that the current wastewater tariff revenues are not sufficient to
cover all expenses of wastewater sector in Chancheng District. The analysis also shows
that the wastewater tariff should increase more than 50% in 2014 and 2015 in order to
meet the fund requirements of wastewater sector in Chancheng District, assuming that the
efficiency of wastewater tariff collection is close to 100%. Another assumption for the
above analysis is that the expenses of wastewater sector in Chancheng District do not
include the capital expenditures in wastewater collection networks and pumping stations.
If these were to be added, the cost recovery rate would be even lower.

An additional analysis was made to compare the revenues from the wastewater tariff to
the different costs in the sector, based on the information provided in the above-
mentioned table. The costs in wastewater sector costs of O&M, costs of depreciation, and
costs of debt service requirements. These costs were compared with wastewater tariff
collected for the sector. The results of this comparison, presenting below, show that the
revenues from tariff are sufficient to cover O&M cost.

Tariff Affordability. An affordability analysis was conducted at completion of the
project to demonstrate the affordability of tariff for residents in Chancheng District. The
analysis shows that the combined water and wastewater bill does not exceed 0.6% of a
low household income and lies fully within the generally accepted ‘affordability
benchmark’ of a maximum of 5% of the income to be allocated for water and wastewater
services.

Municipal Finance. The Government provided counterpart funds for the implementation
of the project for a total amount of RMB554.3 million or US$44.9 million. Among these
funds, Chancheng District Government provided RMB439.5 million or US$36.1 million,
80% of total counterpart funds, and the remaining was provided by Foshan Municipal
Government. The following table presents the revenues of Chancheng District
Government and its contribution to the project.

II.    Jiangmen

Institutional context. Jiangmen Municipality consists of 3 districts and 4 counties. The
Bank financed project was implemented in 2 districts – Pengjiang and Jianghai, and
Jiangmen Biyuan Wastewater Treatment Company (JBWC) is the implementing unit. In
addition, JBWC currently operates 4 wastewater treatment plants and another two
wastewater treatment plants will be put into operation by the end of 2014. The total
capacity of wastewater treatment under the operation and management of JBWC will
increase to 375,000 m3/day in 2014 from current 285,000 m3/day. The current length of
sewer networks is 80 km and by the end of 2014 it will be 160 km within the boundaries
of Pengjiang and Jianghai. JBWC is the nominal owner of these sewer networks,
although these are actually operated and managed by Jiangmen Municipal Government.

Although Jiangmen Municipal Government makes final decisions on investments in the
sector, JBWC plays a role on mobilizing funds from local commercial banks with its
assets as a guarantee. Represented by Jiangmen Municipal Finance Bureau, the municipal
government agrees to repay these loans and interests although there is no clear agreement
between JBWC and Jiangmen Municipal Government.

JBWC has an agreement with Jiangmen Municipal Government about compensation of
expenses incurred for wastewater treatment. Currently, Jiangmen Municipal Government
will pay JBWC at RMB0.53/m3 based on the amount of wastewater treated (concession
rate). This rate was calculated on the basis of O&M cost. Therefore, the depreciation and
debt service are bared by the Jiangmen Municipal Government.

Existing Wastewater Tariff and Collection Mechanism. The tariff collection
mechanism is the same as in Foshan. In addition to the concession rate, Jiangmen
Municipal Government provides subsidies to JBWC for its debt service.

JBWC’s Wastewater Business. JBWC behaves like a non-commercial company, being
just responsible for building, operating and maintaining wastewater treatment facilities in
Jiangmen. The municipality, which approves and decides on investments is responsible
for debt service and enters short term contracts with the company to carry out these tasks.

      its financial viability. The results of this assessment are presented in the following table:

      In this analysis an hypothetical assumption is made in the category “Revenues from
      Subsidies”, as these are not real transfers in cash from the government to the company,
      but just the estimated amount the government uses for depreciation of the assets, as,
      unlike the Foshan case, it is the municipal government the responsible for capital
      investments in Jiangmen. Indeed the financial covenants were not designed for a case like
      this, and therefore the idea of compliance loses relevance in this case.

      With this important consideration, it could be said that JBWC complied with the debt
      service of coverage ratio and full cost recovery (ie: if JBWC was to be responsible for
      investments the subsidies would have to be in the form of cash transfers). Increase in
      working capital was one of the reasons for not complying with the financial covenant of
      full cost recovery since 2008 to 2012.

      By discounting depreciation from the operating costs, the O&M cost are covered in
      general by operating revenues which are generated by the concession rate, without the
      need for subsidies. The O&M cost recovery rates would be close to 1 as shown in the
      table below:

      Financial Assessment of the wastewater sector in Jiangmen. To assess the sufficiency
      of wastewater tariff for the whole wastewater sector, additional information was collected,
      including the revenues of wastewater tariff, government payment to JBWC, government
      payment to one BOT contractor, government payment for running pumping stations, and
      government payment for maintenance of sewer networks. The following table shows the
      revenues and expenditures in wastewater sector.

This information only reflected the cash requirements for the wastewater sector. It does
not include the amounts of depreciation of fixed assets such as wastewater treatment
plants, pumping stations, sewer networks. In Jiangmen the government will keep making
investments in wastewater facilities (not only collection but also treatment) using fiscal
revenues, with no intention of recovering its capital investment. The analysis shows that
wastewater revenues from tariffs do cover O&M costs of both collection and treatment
but will not cover the full costs including investments. For that to happen the tariff would
need to increase to RMB1.46 /m3 in 2014, and RMB1.61/ m3 in 2015.

Tariff Affordability. An affordability analysis was conducted at completion of the
project to demonstrate the affordability of tariff for residents in Jiangmen Municipality.
The analysis shows that the combined water and wastewater bill does not exceed 0.6% of
a low income household which lies within the ‘affordability threshold’ of a maximum of
5%.

Municipal Finance. It was Jiangmen’s plan at project appraisal to raise counterpart
funds through a commercial bank loan although it was assumed at appraisal that
counterpart funds would be fully provided directly from the municipal revenue resources
in the PAD. During the project implementation, Jiangmen Municipal Government only
provided less than 10% of total project equity from its fiscal revenues, which is about
RMB8 million. The remaining equity for the project came from specific funds mobilized
from different environmental programs of other governments, such as the central
government, provincial government and municipal government.

The fiscal expenditures of Jiangmen Municipal Government in 2008 was about RMB
1,972 million, and in 2013 it was about RMB3,857 million, which are large numbers
compared with the amount allocated for the project, so it can be concluded that the
contribution to the project had no negative fiscal impact on Jiangmen Municipality.

B.       Economic Analysis

At project appraisal, the methodology of cost-effectiveness was used to conduct
economic analysis because the benefits of wastewater/sanitation projects were difficult to
quantify in a reasonably reliable manner, especially those related to public health and the
environment. Therefore, a least cost analysis was adopted to select the soundest technical
options.

I.       Foshan

Zhen’an WWTP and Collection System

A least cost option was selected among five alternatives considered during project
preparation. Three alternatives were rejected technically and one alternative was rejected
because the energy savings during operation were not sufficient to cover the investment
costs.

At appraisal, the total investment for the component of wastewater management was
RMB243.5 million to construct the WWTP extension of 50,000 m3/day, adding to phase
I and phase II of 200,000 m3/day.

This component was completed in 2010 and the extension of the WWTP was put into
operation. The actual cost of this component was only RMB51.6 million. However, the
estimated capacity in use was 36,715 m3/day25.

Based on this information, the NPV and Average incremental costs (AIC) of the selected
alternative was calculated and the results together the analysis at appraisal are presented
below.

               Table 3-8 Least Cost Analysis of Zhen’an WWTP
                       At Appraisal        At ICR         % of Appraisal
Investment (Y)           55.1 mil          51.6 mil            94%
O&M Cost (Y)              8.6 mil           5.2 mil            60%

NPV (Y)                 126.9 mil          94.6 mil            75%
AIC2 (Y/ton)               0.74              0.75             101%
1/ Over 20 years with 8% discount rate.
2/ Average incremental costs of treated wastewater (AIC) calculated as NPV divided by total discounted
throughput.

The analysis shows lower NPV and slightly higher AIC due to the fact that the plant is
still not operating at 100% capacity.


25
  This is just an estimate, since the total plant of 250,000 m3/day capacity is treating 236,715 m3/day. Therefore this
analysis assumes that Phase I and II of 200,000 m3/day work at 100% and phase III treats the remaining 36,715 m3/day




                                                         43
Sludge Treatment Center and Disposal

At appraisal, the option of thermal drying after mechanical dewatering at one
consolidated site was selected due to its cost effectiveness represented by least NPV and
AIC.

However, with the latest development of advanced sludge treatment technology and the
decreasing of sludge quantity – one of the 5 WWTPs was building an advanced on-site
sludge treatment station, the regional treatment facility is then decentralized to be built at
the remanding 4 WWTPs with on-site advanced sludge dewatering station and the total
treatment capacity being reduced to 220 tons/day. At that time a least cost analysis was
conducted to compare the decentralized option of with the centralized one. The following
table presents the results of this comparison.

                          Table 3-9 Sludge Treatment Comparison
                              On-site Advanced              Thermal Drying

    NPV1 (Y)                           197.3 million               301.6 million

    2/ Average incremental costs (AIC) calculated as NPV divided by total discounted throughput.

In May 2014, FWGC won a contract to operate these sludge treatment facilities with a
price of RMB423.90/ton sludge for 20 years. This price includes the return of GWGC’s
investment for the sludge treatment facilities, operating and maintenance costs,
government tax, and FWGC’s profits. Based on this price and estimation of tax and profit,
NPV and AIC were computed and compared ones at appraisal and restructuring as
follows:

          Table 3-10       Least Cost Analysis of Sludge Treatment Comparison
                              At Appraisal        At Restructuring    At Completion

O&M (Y)                       46.6 million           18.7 million      20.7 million
NPV1 (Y)                     561.0 million          197.3 million     189.3 million
AIC2 (Y/ton)                           410                 328.9             315.7
1/ Over 25 years with 12% discount rate.
2/ Average incremental costs (AIC) calculated as NPV divided by total discounted throughput.

The eventual cost for sludge treatment is 34% of the costs estimated at appraisal and 96%
of costs estimated at restructuring.

Foshan River Quality Improvement



                                                   44
Since the works were implemented over a short time period, and it was a onetime
operation, (with only investment but no operations and maintenance costs), the NPV of
Foshan river quality improvement was not calculated. The alternative was selected
mainly because of its cost savings in investment. The following table presents the cost
estimated at appraisal and at completion.

                 Table 3-11 River Dredging Comparison (Y million)
                                At Appraisal At Completion     % of Appraisal
 Foshan Water Course Dredging           85.7           87.8              102%

 Total                                 114.6        134.5                117%

The value of those two contracts for dredging and landfill were 17% higher than the cost
estimated at project appraisal.

Flood Protection and Embankment Rehabilitation

The flood protection and embankment rehabilitation was also implemented over a short
time period and a onetime operation. Therefore, the alternative requiring less investment
was selected at appraisal. The following table compares the cost estimated at appraisal
and cost incurred at completion.

      Table 3-12 Flood Protection and Embankment Rehabilitation (Y million)

 Of which Land Acquisition          152.7                  162.9           106%
and Resettlement

The eventual cost for flood protection and embankment rehabilitation is 89% of the costs
estimated at appraisal, although the cost of land acquisition is 6% higher.

II.    Jiangmen

At appraisal, after rejection of several alternatives by technical reasons, the selected
treatment processes had least NPV and AIC. The Bank financed (i) the extension of Wen
Cheng Sha WWTP by 150,000 m3/day; (ii) the construction of 22 km interceptors,
network collection networks, and three pumping stations; and (iii) reconstruction of a
current drainage pumping stations in the urban area. The NPV and AIC after the
completion of the project were lower than the ones calculated at appraisal.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR (as reported by the Jiangmen and Foshan
PMOs)

Project Design

Foshan reports that it took almost four years to prepare the project. The PMO was
established under the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB). Several government
agencies were involved in project implementation under the Municipal Government of
Foshan, together with the State Enterprise (Foshan Water Group Company).

Jiangmen PMO states that project design was technically sound, incorporating lessons
learned from previous World Bank financed projects. Project activities were well defined
leading to achievable targets. The project closely supported the “Evolution of the
institutional framework for the Pearl River basin management”, being consistent Chinese
regulations and policies to improve the Pearl River Delta environment. Some of these
sound features of project design include:

         (a) Careful attention to water pollution discharge limits to avoid excess capacity
of receiving water;
         (b) Consideration of Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water
(GB3838-2002) to set up the project end-targets of pollution reduction, to improve the
receiving water quality.
         (c) Focus on the financial sustainability of the project by increasing the water
tariffs to a reasonable level (1.70 RMB/m3 in 2015). The proposed tariff was based on a
Bank study on 128 cities.
         (d) The packaging strategy, procurement plan, implementation plan, and project
management were properly developed with a realistic schedule.

Implementation

The project approval authority was the National Development and Reform Committee at
the provincial level, but in Foshan PMO’s opinion, the lengthy project review cycle made
project adjustments difficult, resulting in subproject cancellation. Therefore, more
expedited and simplified review procedures are necessary to accommodate project
adjustments.

During project implementation, regulation changes 26 and technology development on
wastewater treatment sludge management and disposal requirements caused delays in the
revised sludge treatment and disposal component. Other causes of delay were the change
in urban plan zoning affecting the location of one treatment station, lengthy local permit
approval, and delays on bidding evaluations and resettlement works.


26
   For instance, new regulation requiring a minimum of 60% of water content in sludge for disposal in land
fields.




                                                    49
Although procurement training was provided, the PMO and PIUs had difficulties with
preparing bidding documents. This could have been addressed by providing more
examples during the preparation of tendering documents, including assistance and
explanations on bid evaluation procedures to the local selection panelists.

In Jiangmen, small delays in the procurement of equipment were caused by the
difference of procedures and requirements for procurement between the Ministry of
Commerce and the World Bank together with ineffective communication. In addition to
the measures recommended by Foshan of increasing training on procurement, Jiangmen
advises on enhancing the communication with the PIU and taking effective measures in a
timely manner to address problems that arise during procurement processes.
On the Institutional Strengthening component, JBWC made modifications to the outputs
provided by the consultant (financial forecast tool, training plan and private sector
participation model) in order to develop a more practical business plan, including, for
instance, specific measures of internal management and promotion of staff. In the case of
the PSP model proposed by the consultant, JBWC, which is a SOE found it not
applicable to the existing institutional context.

The implementation of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was monitored
during the project construction and operation. Environmental protection measures were
mostly taken to alleviate the impact on the environment, on construction activities,
sediment and sludge transportation and disposal per contractual requirements. The least
impact alternatives were selected and closed environmental monitoring and supervision
was conducted.
The monitoring results indicated that the construction and operation of the Projects
conformed to the requirements of the EMP, except the total suspended particles (TSP) in
the atmosphere were found to exceed the Class II limit of 0.15 mg/m3 during the
construction of the sludge treatment stations as monitored in July and October 2013. The
contractor is making improvements on dust control to meet the TSP requirements.
Results
Foshan reports that the Project has achieved its goal to support critical local government
financial needs to increase wastewater treatment rate and properly manage sludge,
improve the water course environment and flood control, and bring best international
practices in project and financial management, procurement, contract and construction
management practices.
The water quality of the Fenjiang River has been improved substantially in meeting Class
V standards, and the public has enjoyed a clean river front. New improvements on 220
Foshan inner waterways will be carried out by 2018 giving continuation to the
investments made in this project.
The Foshan Water Environmental Management Information System, once completed,
will be able to monitor and assess water flows and quality of the waterways, to provide


                                           50
advance pollution warning and to support government decision making on environmental
matters. River water quality data is already being released to the public periodically and
this system will improve the quality of that information. The system is one of the first of
its kind in China and it could be adopted by other municipalities on inner river shed
management.
The dredged sediment was successfully disposed at the specially designed location
following high environmental and technical standards. This component is also an
example that could be adopted in other applicable areas of the country.
The FWGC has benefited from sound procurement procedures and advanced
international practices on technical and financial management which will be applied to
the future program development and implementation, particularly on cost control, debt
service and tariff collection. Learning from the experience gained, the FWGC has been
aggressive in expanding its water sector services to other cities nearby Foshan and sludge
management in other districts of Foshan.
Jiangmen explains that the target values of pollutants to be removed by the WWTP were
not achieved since these were set at unrealistically high levels. A progressive increase in
removal rates is expected as household connection coverage increases. The targeted river
quality standards of class IV were achieved. The performance made by JBWC is
significant as reflected by the values of the defined indicators.

Financial Sustainability
Detailed financial projections were defined in order to estimate the level of wastewater
tariff required to ensure the financial sustainability of the wastewater companies in
Jiangmen and Foshan. In Jiangmen, average tariff should have been increased to 1.41
RMB/m3 in 2010, and to 1.7 RMB/m3 by 2016 had all the costs, including depreciation
and debt service, been recovered. However the actual wastewater tariff in 2013 was 0.81
RMB/m3, which is below the expected level, and the concession rate paid from Jiangmen
Municipality to JBWC was 0.53 RMB/m3, not enough to cover full costs or debt service
requirements. However, it is the responsibility of the municipal government to cover
these costs. Jiangmen Municipality is in the progress of developing a plan to increase the
tariff by 43.7% in April 2014. In the case of Foshan the tariff is 68% of the projected one
at appraisal, and the target Debt Service Ratio has not been achieved by FWGC.

Bank Performance
Foshan PMO received strong support from the World Bank, particularly from the Task
Team Leader and from technical experts. Jiangmen reports that the WB team preparing
the project was very professional, leading to a good project design at the project
conceptual stage. The Bank’s task team was pro-active, flexible, and decisive in
interpreting and applying Bank policies and the covenants in the Loan and Project
Agreements, and in providing ample resources to address project issues. The performance
of the Bank was found to be highly satisfactory.

Borrower Performance


                                            51
Foshan has not clearly assessed Borrower’s performance in its completion report, and
Jiangmen states that a large amount of the domestic counterpart funds was made
available with the support of the state and municipal funds. During the project
preparation and implementation, Jiangmen PMO and PIU staff have demonstrated their
commitment to deliver the project and achieve the objectives. Every semi-annual
implementation report was submitted to the Bank on time and described the project
implementation in a detailed and comprehensive manner. The implementing agency
performance is considered highly satisfactory.

Lessons learned
Foshan PMO thinks that the experience gained in complying with stringent procurement
and resettlement requirements has been beneficial to the PMO and PIUs and has
contributed to build their capacity. FWGC has also learned and benefitted from sound
WB procurement procedures and advanced international practices on technical and
financial management which will be applied in future developments, particularly on cost
control, tariff collection and overall cost recovery.
In Foshan PMO’s opinion, the project could have included only one or two components
on conventional environmental infrastructure improvements in order to be more
manageable by the PMO. Also, Government strong support on necessary tariff
adjustments is necessary for sustainable operations on WWTP and to carry out
infrastructure improvements of sewers and pumping stations.
For Jiangmen, project implementation process has provided invaluable learning
opportunities for all agencies and staff involved. The capacity building of the PMO and
PIU staff has achieved the expected outcomes that will be greatly helpful for managing
future projects.
The difficulties of the tariff increase have been underestimated at appraisal. The
institutional study on tariffs mechanisms seeking for regulatory support should have been
taken into consideration much before project construction. Institutional reform is always
complicated and requires government’s commitment. The project itself is hardly able to
achieve tariff adjustments. In future Bank loan projects, it is highly recommended to take
diligent studies and adopting a workable strategy together with implementation measures
to achieve the desired objectives.

The fact that Bank’s procurement policy shall supersede the Chinese procurement
regulations if there is any conflict is not well understood, nor effectively implemented at
the working level. When the Bid Evaluation Reports (BER) are approved by the Ministry
of Commerce (MOC), it is very difficult to revoke the its decision. Thus, when
disagreement arises between MOC and the World Bank, this procedure could easily
cause the significant delay of the BER review/approval process. Jiangmen PMO strongly
suggests setting up regular communication channels and workshops to make mutual
understanding of World Bank policies and practice governing procurement processes.

Jiangmen PMO understands that a review of technical specifications and standards was
taking place in a joint effort made by the Chinese Government and the World Bank. This


                                            52
process started over a decade ago, however, no new standards have been released by the
Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD), PRC. A
recommendation is made to higher government levels and the World Bank to accelerate
the review process.

As JBWC is a state-owned enterprise, the Private Sector Participation (PSP) model
developed by the consultants hired under the project is not applicable based on the
current situation in Jiangmen due to: (i) lack of systematic policy and regulation for PSP;
(ii) lack of clarity on how to implement management and supervision responsibilities of
different governmental departments in public utilities. However, the promotion of PSP
for better management of public utilities shall be taken into consideration and more
specific and adaptable PSP models that can be applicable in Jiangmen shall be discussed
in future development plans.

Annex 6: Resettlement

A. Resettlement Implementation

Of the four Foshan subcomponents, the River Water Quality Improvement, involving
dredging and sediment disposal, required only temporary land occupation of 240 mu27
and a RAP was not needed; the Nanzhuang Sludge Treatment Plant required permanent
land acquisition of 30 mu for which land was acquired before project identification so a
RAP was considered unnecessary. Both the River Rehabilitation subcomponent and the
Zhen'an WWTP (Phase III expansion) required resettlement and land acquisition and a
RAP was prepared.

Fenjiang River North Bank Comprehensive Rehabilitation: Permanently, the
subcomponent took 85.22 mu of state owned land and 1.68 mu of collective land. The
subcomponent relocated 15 households with 46 people including 2 vulnerable persons, in
total 53 local enterprises/shops were partly affected. The subcomponent demolished
59,790.56 m2 of buildings including 2,676.39 m2 belonging to 15 households.
Zhen'an Wastewater Treatment Plant Phase III: The implementation of this
component required the acquisition of 86.89 mu of state-owned land being used by local
enterprises and shops. As per the RAP, this subcomponent required 45 mu of land. Yet,
an additional 41.89 mu were added for the future for the future expansion of Zhen’an
WWTP (phase IV). In total, 43,324.17 m2 of enterprise buildings including 19,201 m2 for
the future expansion of the plant, were demolished. Land acquisition and demolition
affected 8 local enterprises (2 owners and 16 contractors) and a total of 256 people.
The total permanent land acquisition of the Foshan component increased from 153 mu in
the RAP to 173.79 mu. In fact, land acquisition for the river Rehabilitation subcomponent
declined from 108 mu to 86.9 mu while the Zhen’an WWTP increased from 45 mu to
86.89 mu because of reserved land acquisition for the future expansions of the plant.
Compared with the RAP, the area of actual buildings demolished slightly increased from
105,442 m2 to 112,085 m2 mainly due to land acquisition for the future expansion of the
plant.

As shown in table 3 below, the RAP estimated that 68 entities (including enterprises,
shops and households) and up to 1974 people would be affected by the project. The
actual resettlement impacts are slightly different for entities affected mainly due to
splitting of households and recalculation of contractors and enterprises. At the end of the
project, the population affected was significantly reduced from 1974 to 302 for the
following reasons: 1) no affected enterprises and shops were totally relocated; all of them
were only partly affected (demolition); 2) out of the four vulnerable people defined, 2
passed away. In the case of Zhen’an WWTP the number of affected people estimated in
the RAP remained the same.

B. Resettlement Fund Disbursement

At present, a total of RMB162.94 million was used for resettlement implementation
under the River Rehabilitation subcomponent and RMB106.95 million for the Zhen’an
WWTP subcomponent (including RMB49.46 million for the future expansion of Zhen’an
WWTP - phase IV). All assets affected by the project were compensated according to
contracts/agreements prior to asset-taking and not less than what was stipulated in the
RAP.

C. Compensation Rate

As showed in table 4 below, except for building demolition of enterprises and shops,
actual compensation rates for both state-owned and collective owned land were higher
than stipulated in the RAP. In particular, compensation rates for the demolition of private
houses (15) increased about 140%. Actual rates for state-owned land under the Zhen’an
subcomponent were about 10.3 times30 than in the RAP; actual rates for collective land
were 1.7 times than in the RAP, and actual rate for state-owned land under the River
rehabilitation subcomponent remained the same 31 and was sufficient for the affected
enterprises to receive full replacement costs. According to the investigations on sampled
resettled households and enterprises, the compensation paid by the project was sufficient
to achieve full replacement and was considered satisfactory. All the affected households
and enterprises/shops received 100% of the compensation upon contract signed.

  The unit price used in the RAP was for state-owned land used for industrial purposes. During project implementation
and according to government decision, the land classification shifted to “state-owned land for commercial purposes”
and therefore, the unit price increased.

31
  When the RAP was prepared in 2006, a rate of 75,000 CNY/mu was the price established for state-owned land used
for industrial purposes. However, the land was allocated to the concerned enterprises by local government using lower
prices.

D. Complaint Handling System

Public consultations, public disclosure and information dissemination activities designed
according to Chinese law and Banks policy, were well organized. All affected persons
and enterprises/shops received proper resettlement related information on a timely basis.
Based on Chinese law and Bank’s policies, the RAP also included detailed grievance and
redress mechanisms and disseminated them among the affected groups. The designed
complaint handling system was clearly followed during actual implementation.

Chancheng District Government made great efforts to coordinate and negotiate with
affected people and entities; implement the mechanisms for collecting opinions and
suggestions from the PAPs, giving effective responses on a timely basis. According to the
external monitoring institute, not a single complaint or grievance was received during
project implementation.

E. Resettlement Monitoring

Resettlement implementation of the Foshan Component was closely monitored by Hohai
University which also prepared the Resettlement Planning of the project. In total, six
external monitoring reports on Fenjiang River North Bank Rehabilitation and five on
Zhen’an WWTP were provided regularly.

F. Evaluation of Livelihood Restoration

According to the external monitoring report, of the 46 people in the 15 affected
households (including two vulnerable people) of the river rehabilitation component, no
one changed livelihoods, and they were all relocated and received compensation for
house demolition. Of the two vulnerable people affected, one had an annual pension of
RMB12,000 and one had an annual income of RMB15,000 which guaranteed their
livelihood.

For Zhen’an WWTP III, the Hohai University monitoring team conducted random
investigations on livelihood restoration with four relocated enterprises and 30 employees.
Of the employees monitored, 80% expressed that except for transportation, their living
circumstances had improved; 96% had seen increases in income; 95% lived in new
dormitories with better conditions; 50% of the original employees chose to move with
their employers during the project

All affected enterprises and shops along the Fenjiang River expressed that their
businesses are experiencing an increase or is expected to increase in volume. They also
reported a great improvement of the surroundings due to the rehabilitation activities.


                                           57
Most of them clearly stated that the new circumstances are helping and will help to attract
more customers and clients.

1.   Number of relocated HHs reduced mainly due to family spliting after parents passed away;

2.   Number of relocated enterprises / shops and affected employees decreased significantly due to
     actual implementation. The River Rehabilitation subcomponent did not involve relocation and all
     those affected preferred the arrangement of backward resettlement alongside the river bank;

3.   Land acquisition increased about 10% and building demolishing increased about 6.3% due to
     additional land acquisition for the future expansion of Zhen’an WWTP.

4.   Land compensation rate increased significantly due to: a) land in Zhen’an shifted from industrial
     land to commercial land, b) the rate of the collective land under River Rehabilitation
     subcomponent was a result of negotiations with the village committee as owner.

    II. The PRD Clean-Up Program

Background and History of the Pearl River Delta Clean-Up Program

The Pearl River Delta (PRD) Clean Up Program was initiated in 2005 and completed in
2012. The objective of the Clean Up Program was to significantly reduce the pollution
loading on the PRD river networks and thereby provide for a cleaner river system in the
PRD. It targeted 14 municipalities in the province with the primary outputs being the
construction of wastewater treatment plants and associated collection networks including
pumping stations and transmission mains. These 14 municipalities are within the
boundaries of the PRD catchment area. The current population of Guangdong Province is
roughly 80 million with 60% of the population living within the PRD catchment. The
initiative for the PRD Clean Up Program - and corresponding investments – originated
from an understanding and recognition by the most senior political leaders in the
province of the true “cost” of the pollution of the water environment in and around the
PRD. A “political pledge” was consequently entered into between the top provincial
leadership and the participating municipalities in 2004 to meet, or exceed, some very
ambitious pollution control targets developed in consultation with the top professionals in
the provincial EPD and municipal level EPB, including shutting down the top 10
polluters in Guangzhou during the course of PRD.

Major Achievements and Additional Details of the PRD Clean Up Program
   At the end of the 8-year program in 2012, the investments provided for the following
    outputs:
       → Construction of 180 new WWTPs with associated collection and disposal
         infrastructure.
       → A total design capacity of the constructed WWTPs of 12,000,000 m3/day of
         wastewater treatment.
   The primary outcome of the program was an overall increase in the percentages of
    people served by waste water collection and treatment:
       →    28.3% in 2005
       →    80% in 2012
   These impressive achievements have resulted in the following impacts: (i) provided
    improved household and industrial environmental sanitation services, and (ii)
    provided improved water quality within the river network systems of the PRD.
   The original funding pledged in 2005 was about RMB 50 billion, with most of the
    funding being financed by the municipalities themselves. The Guangdong Provincial
    Environmental Protection Department provided RMB 1 billion of the Clean Up
    Program budget. By the end of the program in 2012, RMB 55.5 billion had been
    financed and implemented, an additional RMB 5.5 billion above the original
    commitments.



                                            60
    In 2008 the Provincial EPD provided additional financing for RMB 2.5 billion to
     construct at least one WWTP and collection network system in the economically less
     well-off districts of the province, outside of the Pearl River Delta catchment.
    At the municipal level, incentives were established to attract privately financed
     WWTPs and collection networks through BOTs. This has proved to be more
     successful than anticipated in the early stages of the Clean Up Program and therefore
     reduced the financial burden on the province to provide such wide wastewater
     collection and treatment coverage. The Public Private Partnership model has worked
     well and is being expanded to provide additional investments and wastewater
     coverage.
    EPD is in the process of embarking on another 8-year funding program for the
     continuation of the PRD Clean Up Program. This investment cycle (Phase 2) is for
     the period of 2014 to 2020. The level of funding is budgeted for RMB 118.7billion
     (~ USD 19.6 billion).
    Under this new set of initiatives it is expected to bring the collection networks up to
     the levels which will better match the treatment capacities invested in during the 2005
     to 2012 period of investments. Some municipalities will pursue the separation of the
     drainage network from the sewer network.
    Ambitious targets will be set up in reducing industrial pollution, including
     shutdown/improvement of heavily polluted industries (157 enterprises) and a
     mandatory green production program for heavily polluted industries (191 enterprises).
     A non-point source pollution control program will be also included. It is estimated
     that half of water pollution comes from non-point sources34.
     A website has been well developed by the province which includes details of the prior
     investment program and the elements of the new program. Annual reports for each of
     the 8 years of the Clean Up Program are available on-line. The PRD Clean Up
     Program website address is: http://pub.gdepb.gov.cn/pub/pubcatalog/extranet pub

Industrial pollution control in Foshan and Jiangmen

The PAD reported the plans made by the two municipalities to reduce industrial pollution
by reallocating heavy polluted industries and enforcing pre-treatment requirements.
These actions were indeed conducted during the lifetime of the project and data collected
at project completion shows that in a total of 34 enterprises were closed and/or relocated
out of Foshan urban area during the project period, including garment, chemicals, dying,
and construction material industry. Jiangmen also reported having achieved the target of
at least 95% of the industries in compliance with discharge regulations.

Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned from the 2005 – 2012 PRD Clean Up Program, as
communicated by the Guangdong Provincial Environmental Protection Department were:
   The successes of the Clean Up Program is largely attributable to the strong political
    leadership commitment.
   The concept of the “political pledge” was fundamental in turning promises into reality.
   The fact that most of the funding came from the municipalities provided for the sense
    of “ownership” required, not only for the construction phase, but also for the proper
    operations and maintenance of the investment assets.
   The institutional set-up and arrangements took some time to understand and master in
    the beginning, but at the end of the 8-year program the relationship between the
    provincial governments and the municipal level PIUs was working very well,
    delivering significant results.
   The private sector involved on some BOTs for WWTPs and the sewer networks has
    contributed to maximize the benefits, with the private sector taking on some of the
    investment and operational risks.
