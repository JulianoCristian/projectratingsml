       Improvement and Food Crop Project of Rwanda are as follows:\n            outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. The following lessons\n            can be drawn from the implementation for this project: (a)\n            In extension projects it is of vial importance that proven\n            production packages can be developed early on in the\n            project. In this project, no adequate food crop production\n            package could be developed, despite the impression that such\n            technology was already available at project preparation. (b)\n            The division of responsibilities between the research and\n            extension services needs to be clearly defined prior to\n            project start-up. The capacity of the research organization\n            to carry out its responsibilities should also be evaluated\n            during project preparation. (c) Market outlets for\n            production should be found prior to making decisions on\n            research and extension of production techniques. In the case\n            of this project, farmers did not respond as expected to the\n            increased availability of sweet potato and cassava cuttings\n            because the markets for surplus production did not exist.\n            (d) Extension has to be demand driven in order to succeed.\n            In this project, the initial reaction of the executing\n            agency was to satisfy appraisal targets, rather than meet\n            farmers' demands (coffee tree planting, seeds and tree\n            production, and erosion control measures), which delayed\n            getting the farmer to adopt the extension message and\n            required more intensive supervision by Bank staff."}, "docdt": "1993-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
