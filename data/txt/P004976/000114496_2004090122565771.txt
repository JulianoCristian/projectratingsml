(the 'Bank"), dated March 17, 1993 (the "Loan Agreement").  We also refer to your

to be channelled to the EPLF (as this term is defined under the Loan Agreement) under 
arrangements similar to those under Part B of the Project.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank accedes to your request. 
Accordingly, the Loan Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
1.
In Schedule 5, Section B.2: the letter "s" shall be added at the end of 
the word "Part" in the second and fourth lines, and the words 'A and" shall be 
inserted between the word "Parts" and the letter "B" in the second and fourth lines.
2.
All the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement not amended hereby 
shall remainin full force and effect.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and dating the 
confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
Sincerely,
