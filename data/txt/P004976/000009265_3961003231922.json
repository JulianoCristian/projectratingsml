a\n            social housing program for sale, an import program of\n            critical building materials for the private sector, and a\n            technical assistance program.  The Social Housing Program\n            for Sale (SHPS) aims at accelerating the completion of about\n            51,000 social units for sale, mostly under Entreprises de\n            Promotion et de Logement Familial's (EPLF) management,\n            through: supply of strategic construction materials (cement,\n            wood and steel rods), finishing products, and small\n            equipment and spare parts.  The private housing program,\n            targeted primarily to self-help builders, aims at assisting\n            the private sector in completing its unfinished housing\n            stock.  It will supply the private sector with strategic\n            construction materials.  The technical assistance component\n            aims at assisting the Government in implementing key housing\n            policy objectives in the following three critical areas:\n            improving the housing supply incentives; reforming housing\n            finance; and reforming and targeting housing subsidies.  In\n            addition, the technical assistance program will provide\n            specific support to the Ministry of Housing to mitigate the\n            negative environmental impact of the housing construction sector."}, "docdt": "1993-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
