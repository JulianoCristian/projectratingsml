Development Program Project for Uganda were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the Adaptable\n            program Loan (APL) instrument cut down on the demand for\n            rigorous project preparations for every Specific Investment\n            Loan (SIL). Institutional reform conducted parallel to\n            project implementation causes delays in program\n            implementation. An important lesson learned is that\n            establishment of new institutions require longer time than\n            anticipated for transition, which may impact on project\n            progress, and needs policy consultations and commitment as\n            part of the preparatory work. Restructuring an agency at the\n            same time as implementing a project is challenging and may\n            cause project implementation delays. Cost of the civil works\n            component both at appraisal and feasibility/detailed design\n            varied substantially due to the sudden sharp rise of the\n            cost of fuel, construction materials and other inputs at the\n            time of bidding. Cost of the civil works component at the\n            time of bidding varied substantially from that at the\n            feasibility and detailed design stage due to delays in the\n            procurement process of about four years."}, "docdt": "2012-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
