A.     Introduction

1.    This Project Paper seeks the approval to introduce changes in the Third Phase o f the Road
Development Program-RDPP3 (the Project) (Credit N o . 3976-UG and Grant No. H122-UG) for the
Republic o f Uganda and the accompanying amendments to the Project's legal documents.

2.       The proposed changes are as follows: (i)       dropping several sub-components such as civil
works for upgrading o f about 23 km o f Zirobwe-Wobulenzi road; rehabilitation and regravelling o f
about 91 km o f Atiak-Moyo road; and reconstruction and upgrading o f about 57 km on Busega-
Mityana road that could not be implemented due to a shortfall resulting from higher than anticipated
bids received on three tendered works contracts, out o f the seven originally planned for
implementation under the Credit; (ii)    reallocating the amounts in Category 1 (b) for reconstruction
and upgrading o f Busega-Mityana road o f SDR 16.53 million to Category 1 (a) to meet the shortfall
on upgrading Soroti-Lira road (125 km) and Kampala-Gayza-Zirobwe road (44 km); due to the
above and due to the fact that the financing agreement was amended (April 25, 2007) to allow 100
percent IDA financing o f civil works and consultancy services under the project resulting in cost
increases; and (iii) extending the closing date by 22 months from December 3 1, 2009 to October 30,
201 1. Due to initial procurement delays, the last o f three contracts for upgrading o f Dokolo-Lira
road contract will end on November 30, 201 1. Thus, the extension would allow for completion
o f the contract and defects liability period and implementation o f the Technical Assistance (TA)
support to the Ministry o f Works and Transport (MoWT) and Uganda National Roads Authority
(UNRA). The proposed changes and reallocation will help finance the deficit on the on-going
contracts, caused by higher bid prices than originally envisaged at appraisal, resulting from increases
in the costs o f construction inputs in both local and international markets. The changes will also take
into account the initial delays in the procurement o f works.

categories and extension o f the closing date would constitute a second order project restructuring.

5.     Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Progress towards Achievement of PDO:
The project development objective, namely, to "improve access to rural areas and economically
productive areas and to progressively continue to build up sustainable road sector planning, design
and program management capability including road safety management" i s a replica o f the program
development objective and would remain the same. The project i s the third and last phase o f an
originally four phased road sector Adaptable Project Lending (APL) Credit The already closed first
two projects, Roads Development Program Phase 1 (RDPP1) and Roads Development Program
Phase 2 (RDPP2) projects have contributed to the sector reforms, including the creation o f the
Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) and capacity expansion on a continuous stretch o f about
710 km o f national roads (including the rehabilitation o f a 166 km bitumen standard road that was
added to the RDPP1 through an amendment to the Credit).
6.      Project Implementation Progress: Current project implementation progress i s rated as
Satisfactory. The project has six components: (i)  upgrading and strengthening o f three high priority
                   detailed design o f the upgrading o f about 300 km o f District Roads reclassified to
national roads; (ii)
the National Road Standard; (iii)    consultancies for feasibility studies o f upgrading to bitumen
standard about 600 km o f priority national roads; (iv) rehabilitationhegravelling o f the Atiak-Moyo
road; (v) construction o f a proposed Road Authority headquarters building; and (vi) Institution
building support to the National Road Authority, including the provision o f external auditing
services.
7.       RDPP3 was originally planned to finance the paving and reconstruction o f 249 kilometers o f
national roads and to regravel 91 kilometers o f (national) gravel roads. Due to higher than expected
bids, the paving and reconstruction o f 57 kilometers o f roads out o f the 80 kilometers appraised
could not be financed by the project and Government o f Uganda (GoU) i s now financing these from
i t s own budget. The project was also supposed to finance the regravelling o f a 91 km road which was
planned to be financed by the IDA supported Northern Uganda Reconstruction Project (1994-1 996)
but was abandoned as the insurgency in the area intensified. While the roads were appraised for
regravelling, the government decided that with the increased traffic, it would be best to upgrade it to
                                                 3
a bitumen standard road. With that, the US$8.7 million allocated for the road was about 10 percent
o f the engineer's estimate for upgrading the road. Hence, the government's proposal is to finance it
at a later stage through other means.
8.      The outcome indicator related to the civil works for upgrading, rehabilitation and
reconstruction component i s "reduction in average travel time on national roads compared to
baseline" and "reduction in vehicle operating costs on national roads compared to baseline". At
closure o f the RDPP3, the three APLs will have upgraded and rehabilitated a total o f 877 kilometers
o f roads, close to the original target o f 886 kilometers appraised for upgrading rehabilitation and
regravelling under the Program. This has resulted in reduction o f travel time and vehicle operating
costs between Kampala and the far o f f towns o f Arua, Gulu and Hoima by about 40 percent. With
completion o f Soroti-Lira road, travel time and vehicle operating costs from the Kenya border for
traffic originating from Mombasa to north eastern Democratic Republic o f Congo (DRC) and
southern Sudan will also be reduced by a similar amount. Further, under institutional support to the
sector, creation o f a roads authority, transfer o f maintenance functions from the Ministry o f Works to
UNRA, and the creation o f a road fund are major milestones. With the above background, it can be
concluded that the outcome indicator related to the civil works for upgrading and
rehabilitationheconstruction under the program remains fully relevant and achievable,
notwithstanding deletion o f the following three civil works for: (i)     upgrading Zirobwe-Wobulenzi
road (23 km); (ii)    rehabilitation o f the paved Busega-Mityana road (57 km) and regravelling o f
Atiak-Moyo road (91 km); and building contract for the proposed UNRA and M o W T offices as
government has embarked on financing them. It would therefore not be necessary to modify the
project development objectives or target values. (See also Annex 1)
9.       Specific Reasons and Rationale f o r Project Restructuring. Designs and estimates for the
project were prepared in 2003/04. Based on the estimates, the original total IDA (including both
Credit SDR 45.97 million and Grant SDR 27.20 million) amount was SDR 73.17 million. The
project experienced delays at the prequalification stage, mainly due to the need to clarify the
information submitted by the prospective bidders and the need to verify the financial health o f the
recommended firms. In 2006, an update o f the estimates showed that the amount o n the Credit could
finance only two roads (to be executed in three contracts: 2 contracts for upgrading Soroti-Lira road
and 1 contract for upgrading Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road) out o f the planned four roads (2 for
upgrading, 1 for rehabilitation and 1 for regravelling). Bids were opened o n December 12, 2006 for
the first two civil works contracts and o n March 1, 2007 for a third contract. However, the total price
o f the three contracts was US$25 million over and above the Credit amount, necessitating a
commitment by GoU to finance the deficit. The high bid prices were a result o f considerable
increases in the prices o f inputs between the time o f the engineers' design and estimates in 2003/04
to the time o f bidding in 2006/07 (3-4 years). A cross-check within the region (Ethiopia, Tanzania,
and Kenya) showed similar escalation o f prices in the neighboring countries during the same period.
10.    Originally it was planned to continue the Roads Development Program with a fourth phase
(RDPP-4) that would mainly finance the rehabilitation o f district roads with a credit amount o f
US$26 million. However, GoU decided to "mainstream" the development o f district roads in i t s
recurrent and development budgets, and urged development partners (DPs) to focus on capacity
building (including capacity for the management o f local roads) and on large investments in the
national road networks. When RDPP-3 faced large cost overruns it was intended for a while that
                                                 4
RDPP-4 would be restructured to finance the shortfall. However, following an increased road sector
allocation in i t s budget, G o U decided to finance the contracts that could not be financed by the
Credit from i t s own resources. Thus, the proposed RDPP-4 was dropped. Instead, GoU requested
IDA to support a new proposed series o f integrated projects to be called Transport Sector
Development Projects (TSDP) that would, jointly with other DPs, support the government's Road
Sector Development Program.
C.      Proposed Changes
11.     Changes in Project Design, Scope and Costs.
   1.   Component I : Civil Works for Upgrading, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Component-
        this entails exclusion o f civil works for upgrading o f about 23 km o f Zirobwe-Wobulenzi
        road; rehabilitation and regravelling o f about 9 1 km o f Atiak-Moyo road; and reconstruction
        and upgrading o f about 57 km on Busega-Mityana road. Government i s currently financing
        the reconstruction and upgrading o f Busega-Mityana and construction o f seven bridges and
        two ferry landings on Atiak-Moyo road.
  ..
  1.
   1    Component 2:       Civil Works for Construction o Buildings-this
                                                            f               entails exclusion o f
        construction o f headquarters' building for M o W T and UNRA. G o U has budgeted for the
        works to commence in FY09/10.
 ...
 111.   Component 3: Roads Construction Services-this      entails excluding supervision services for
        construction o f roads listed above.
12.     Reallocation f r o m Category I (b) to Category 1(a) - The entire amount o f credit savings o f
SDR 16.53 million (approximately US$19.44 million), resulting from cancellatiodexclusion o f the
sub-components (as detailed in paragraph 11 above) under the civil works i s proposed to be fully
allocated to Category 1(a) for upgrading Soroti-Lira and Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe roads.
13.    The proposed restructuring would accommodate the new contracts for selection o f
consultants worth US$3.1 million o f which US$1.6 million would be for provision o f much needed
technical assistance to UNRA through Individual Consultants and US$l.5 million for extension o f
contract o f a consultancy firm to collect data on additional 10,000 km o f roads added to the national
roads network.
14.    Revised Cost Allocations - The detailed cost overview o f the restructured project i s presented
in Table 1. Table 2 indicates the category-wise costs. Total IDA contribution remains at US$107.6
million.

15,     Revised Procurement Plan. The procurement plan has already been revised and agreed with
the Bank to reflect the change in scope o f the project. The revised procurement plan i s attached as
Annex 2 to the Project Paper. Apart from selection o f Technical Assistance and the GoU financed
projects for rehabilitation o f bridges and ferry landings on Atiak-Moyo road and UNRA/MoWT
building, there will be no further procurement activity under this credit/grant. Procurement for the
GoU financed Busega-Mityana road has been completed and the works are ongoing.

16.    Implementation o the Project. The project experienced delays in procurement o f civil works
                       f
contracts at commencement o f the project. Another delay was experienced due to financing
shortfall. However, project funds are now fully committed in on-going contracts (actually there i s
an over-commitment o f US$25 million for the Dokolo-Lira contract, which will be borne by
MoFEP) and works are progressing satisfactorily. The implementation plan i s attached hereto as
Annex 3.

17.    Extension o the Closing date: The original closing date was December 3 1, 2009. Due to
                   f
delay in startup o f the project, the government has requested an extension o f 22 months, from
December 31, 2009 to October 31, 201 1. This will be the f i r s t extension o f this Financing
Agreement. The request for extension o f the Closing Date complies with the requirements o f OP/BP
13.30 o n closing date since:
             (i) the project development objectives continue to be achievable;
             (ii) the performance o f the Recipient i s satisfactory with disbursement amounting to
                  about 69 percent as o f end June 2009; and
             (iii) the Recipient has prepared a specific action plan indicating the procurement and
                   implementation schedules (Annex 2 & 3) satisfactory to the Association.
18.    Institutional arrangements. The proposed modifications will not change the agency
responsible for implementation. The Road Authority (now called UNRA) remains the implementing
agency for the works included in the financing agreement.

D.      Updated Economic Analysis

19.     In order to verify if the project would s t i l l be economically viable, prior to award o f the three
contracts, an H D M - 4 run was done to establish the EIRR, using the price offered by the lowest
evaluated bidder for each contract. The findings were that the sub-projects are s t i l l viable, with an
EIRR o f 23.2 percent for Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road as compared to an EIRR o f 25.8 percent at
appraisal while the EIRR for Soroti-Lira road was 15.2% (at commencement o f the works) against
21.3 percent at design. The traffic has increased one and half times since then. The updated
economic analysis i s attached as Annex 4.




                                                    9
E.     Safeguards Issues

20.     The proposed changes do not affect the overall environmental category o f the Project rated
Category B or trigger new safeguard policies.           The potential environmental impact o f
rehabilitatinghpgrading o f road has been appropriately rated as a category B activity.
Environmental assessments were carried out at appraisal in accordance with the requirements o f OP
4.0 1 on Environmental Assessment. All EMP/EIA/SIA/RPF/RAPs were disclosed in-country and at
InfoShop before appraisal.

F.     Expected Outcomes

21.     The proposed changes are limited to outputs and do not alter the original PDO or outcome
indicators as explained earlier (paragraph 5 above).

G.     Benefits and Risks

22.       Benefits - Major benefit from the project restructuring would be: (i)completion o f Soroti-
L i r a road which i s on an important trade corridor to South Sudan and north eastern DRC; and (ii)
completion o f Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road which l i n k s an important agricultural research and
production area to the capital city. The outcome indicators are "reduction in average travel time on
national roads compared to baseline" and "reduction in vehicle operating costs on national roads
compared to baseline". These are the same from the original project.


23.     Restructuring Risks -The risks identified at appraisal are associated with the lack o f skills o f
the staff in the Procurement and Disposal o f Public Assets unit in selection o f Consultants and the
lack o f sufficient supervision o f consultants by technical/user departments. These risks have
remained the same and are being addressed through the provision o f technical assistance in the
specific areas during the proposed time extension. Further assistance will be provided under the
follow on Transport Sector Development Project.

 H.    Fiduciary Issues

24.     There are no outstanding audit reports for this project and close-out audits for previous
projects implemented by UNRA have duly been submitted.

Proposed Mitigation Measures to Ensure No Additional Cost Escalation and Implementation
Delays - In order to ensure that there i s no additional cost escalation or implementation delays, a
technical audit i s being carried out on the three contracts. From the recommendations o f the
audit, any anomalies noticed in interim certificates can be corrected. For cost escalations
emanating from price fluctuations in the market, price adjustment formulae have been provided
in the contracts.

     2.      ANALYTICAL APPROACHES

     T w o analytical methods have been used during this evaluation:

             Analysis by Section: where individual road sections are analyzed separately based on
             bids returned for each;
             Analysis by Project: where the individual sections are analyzed together as a group
             making up the project.

     Using the above approaches, three scenarios were analyzed:

            Scenario 1: including N o n - Motorized Transport (NMT) effects and Agricultural
            Producer Surplus;
            Scenario 2: including NMT effects but excluding Agricultural Producer Surplus;.
          o Scenario 3: excluding both NMT effects and Agricultural Producer Surplus.

4.     SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for three (3) scenarios using the Analysis by Project
approach on the road taking into account only Motorized Traffic and N o n - Motorized Traffic
effects i.e. excluding Producer Surplus benefits:

       Scenario 1: where Costs are 10% higher than lowest bid; and
       Scenario 2: where Costs are 10% higher than lowest bid and Traffic i s 10% lower than
       current estimates.

The results from this sensitivity analysis are as given below:

5.     CONCLUSION

The results from this economic evaluation indicate that the investment in this road project based
on the LOWEST BID i s economically viable. Furthermore, the project i s robust under
uncertainties o f traffic reduction and cost increases as evidenced from the outcomes o f the
sensitivity analysis.

I t i s worth noting also NMT benefits have a considerable impact on the viability o f the project
unlike Producer Surplus effects. In fact the project does not pass the economic test once the
NMT effects are excluded from the analysis as evidenced by the results o f scenario 3.


                                                23
The Analysis by Section and by Project methodologies also gives good revelations about
viability o f the project in parts and by whole. In fact, both Soroti - Dokolo and Dokolo - Lira
pass the economic viability test on their own at the present lowest bid prices for both sections.

The sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the most realistic project case i.e. including
NMT effects but excluding Producer Surplus benefits. The reason for this i s that the Producer
Surplus benefits are for the most part speculative (based on another project area) because there i s
no specific data available for this project's area o f influence. The analysis indicates that the
worst-case scenario (increase in construction costs and reduction in traffic) s t i l l passes the
economic viability test significantly.

From the foregoing, the investment in Soroti - Lira (123 km) i s s t i l l economically viable at the
present lowest bid prices for each o f the road sections.

1.        Introduction

The Kampala - Gayaza road (14.6 km) i s planned for strengthening while the Gayaza - Zirobwe
road (29.7 km) and Zirobwe - Wobulenzi road (22.98 km) are planned for upgrading to bitumen
standard under the I D N G O U funded Road Development Program Phase 3 Project (RDPP3). The
detailed engineering design for these roads was carried out in 2003 to amongst other things
determine the economic viability for strengthening and upgrading based on the following two (2)
options on the six road sections: -

The feasibility assessed three alignments

i)       Alignment A: - A geometric design laid over the existing road centre line;
i)
 i       Alignment B: - An upgrading o f the project road within the existing road corridor; and
ii
 i)      Alignment C: - Containing four deviations.

The feasibility discarded alignments A and C on grounds o f safety, higher costs (alignment C)
and higher negative social/environmental impacts, As such; the final detailed design was based
on alignment B.

The recommended pavement structure designed in compliance with the M oWT Road Design
Manual and the SATCC Pavement Design Guide comprises of:

   o 225 mm lime stabilised gravel sub-base course (in case o f 50 mm asphalt concrete
     surface); or
     275 mm lime stabilised gravel sub-base course (in case o f 20mm/lOmm double surface
     dressing); and
     200 mm crushed stone base course.

The per-km unit financial costs for the above desired pavement structure for the preferred road
alignment B for each o f the road sections was:

The Economic Analysis results revealed that the strengthening and upgrading o f Kampala -
Gayaza - Zirobwe - Wobulenzi road based on the preferred alignment, cross-section (option B),
pavement structure, etc. was economically viable with the following economic performance
parameters:

Arising from the foregoing, the rehabilitatiodupgrading o f Kampala - Gayaza - Zirobwe -
Wobulenzi road at a cost o f US$32.54 million was justified since the overall IRR o f 27.5 percent
for Kampala-Zirobwe and overall IRR 23.6 percent for the entire road (Kampala- Zirobwe-
Wobulenzi) are higher than the discount rate o f 12 percent. This was despite the fact that the
Zirobwe-Wobulenzi section was marginally below the discount rate o f 12 percent with an IRR o f
10.08 percent.

On March 1, 2007, bids for the works implementation on Kampala - Gayaza - Zirobwe were
opened. The returns from the bid opening revealed that the per-km costs for lowest bidders were
53 percent higher than those used by the detailed design study.

2.        Objective o f the re-assessment

The primary objective o f this economic re-assessment i s to determine whether it i s economically
viable to proceed with the implementation o f Kampala - Gayaza - Zirobwe road based on the
returned bids. The analysis also included the section o f Zirobwe - Wobulenzi road although i t s
evaluation was based on the returned bid values for Gayaza - Zirobwe road.

As part o f this exercise, RAFU carried out 7 - day 12 - hour traffic counts on the project road
from the 9 - 15 March 2007 for updating the current traffic on the road.

3         Input Parameters for the Economic Analysis

This analysis relied on the same calibration information o f the H D M - 4 as was used during the
feasibility study apart from traffic and road upgrading unit costs. The traffic information used
was based o n the traffic count carried out in March 2007 while the road upgrading unit costs
were based o n the bid o f the lowest bidder.

4.      Analytical Approaches

Two analytical methods were used in this evaluation:

        Analysis by Section: where individual road sections are analyzed separately based on
        bids returned for each;
        Analysis by Project: where the individual sections are analyzed together as a group
        making up the project.

Using the above approaches, two scenarios were analyzed:

     o Scenario 1: including N o n - Motorized Transport (NMT);

                                                28

         6.       Sensitivity Analysis

         Sensitivity analysis was also carried out for four (4) scenarios using the "Analysis by Project"
         approach taking into account only Motorized Traffic and N o n - Motorized Traffic effects:

                Scenario 1: where Costs are 10% higher than lowest bid;
              o Scenario 2: where Costs are 20% higher than lowest bid;
              o Scenario 3: where Traffic i s 10% lower than current estimates;
                Scenario 4: where Traffic i s 20% lower than current estimates.

7.      Conclusion

The results from this economic evaluation indicate that the investment in this road project based
on the LOWEST BID PRICES i s s t i l l economically viable despite being higher than prices used
during the detailed engineering design study. Furthermore, the project i s robust under
uncertainties o f traffic reduction and cost increases as evidenced from the outcomes o f the
sensitivity analysis. This i s despite the fact that diverted traffic especially to the Kampala -
Wobulenzi road from the project road has not been taken into account, as it will be substaritially
reduced once this project i s implemented.


The Analysis by Section and by Project methodologies gives good revelations about viability o f
the project in parts and by whole. At project level, it seems the sections with higher traffic o f
Kampala to Gayaza do compensate for the l o w traffic on the Kiwenda - Zirobwe and the high
composition o f traffic by motorcycles.

The sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the most realistic project case i.e. including
NMT effects. The analysis indicates that even the worst-case project scenario (increase in
construction costs and reduction in traffic) s t i l l passes the economic viability test significantly
for "analysis by project".


From the foregoing, the investment in Kampala - Gayaza - Zirobwe - Wobulenzi road (67.28
km) i s s t i l l economically viable at the present lowest bid prices for o f the road sections.
