                         feasibility studies of upgrading to bitumen standard about 600 km of priority national roads (iv) rehabilitation/regravelling of the Atiak-Moyo road; (v)
                         construction of a proposed Road Authority headquarters building; (vi) Institutional support to the establishment of the Road Authority, including the provision
