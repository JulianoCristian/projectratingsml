The changes are as\n            follows: (i) dropping several sub-components such as civil\n            works for upgrading of about 23 km of Zirobwe-Wobulenzi\n            road; rehabilitation and re-gravelling of about 91 km of\n            Atiak-Moyo road; and reconstruction and upgrading of about\n            57 km on Busega-Mityana road that could not be implemented\n            due to a shortfall resulting from higher than anticipated\n            bids received on three tendered works contracts, out of the\n            seven originally planned for implementation under the\n            credit; (ii) re-allocating the amounts in category 1 (b) for\n            reconstruction and upgrading of Busega-Mityana road of SDR\n            16.53 million to category 1 (a) to meet the shortfall on\n            upgrading Soroti-Lira road (125 km) and\n            Kampala-Gayza-Zirobwe road (44 km); due to the above and due\n            to the fact that the financing agreement was amended (April\n            25, 2007) to allow 100 percent IDA financing of civil works\n            and consultancy services under the project resulting in cost\n            increases; and (iii) extending the closing date by 22 months\n            from December 31, 2009 to October 30, 2011. Due to initial\n            procurement delays, the last of three contracts for\n            upgrading of Dokolo-Lira road contract will end on November\n            30, 2011. Thus, the extension will allow for completion of\n            the contract and defects liability period and implementation\n            of the Technical Assistance (TA) support to the Ministry of\n            Works and Transport (MoWT) and Uganda National Roads\n            Authority (UNRA). The changes and reallocation will help\n            finance the deficit on the on-going contracts, caused by\n            higher bid prices than originally envisaged at appraisal,\n            resulting from increases in the costs of construction inputs\n            in both local and international markets. The changes will\n            also take into account the initial delays in the procurement\n            of works."}, "docdt": "2009-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
