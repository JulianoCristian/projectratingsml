productive areas, and to\n            progressively continue to build up sustainable road sector\n            planning, design and program management capability including\n            road safety management. The project has the following six\n            components: (1) There is a major cotton processing facility\n            in Lira and the prospect of rehabilitating the factory would\n            increase substantially  the cotton production. Upgrading the\n            road would also extend the paved road network to the North,\n            providing for significant improvements to road transport\n            services between Kampala and the North and between the\n            North, the border regions of Malaba and Busia, and on to the\n            East African seaboard. (2) The facilities of the Ministry of\n            Works, Housing and Communication (MOWHC) date largely from\n            the colonial era. It is proposed to build the Headquarters\n            on MOWHC land near the Central Mechanical Workshop in\n            Kampala. (3) The road construction covers the estimates\n            costs for the supervision cervices of the construction of\n            project roads. (4) Consultants services are being undertaken\n            under Road Sector Institutional Support Technical Assistance\n            Project (RSISTAP) for the execution of full feasibility\n            studies on the upgrading to National Road Standards of a\n            number of District Road Sections as National Roads. (5)\n            Consultants services will be procured in 2004 with the\n            feasibility studies being completed in 2005. (6) The need to\n            consolidate the institutional reform process initiated under\n            the Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP), and RSISTAP has\n            been identified in the recently completed Uganda Road Agency Study."}, "docdt": "2004-08-09T00:00:00Z"}
