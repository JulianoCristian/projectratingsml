The project\n            achieved its main objectives, institution building was\n            successful, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, whereas most of the\n            subprojects were well conceived, the difficulties\n            encountered by the Sebroko Hotel underline the danger of\n            approving a subproject whose ultimate viability depends on\n            external investments not assured within the subproject\n            itself. Second, with respect to the technical assistance\n            provided under the project, the continued extensions of the\n            contracts of the financial adviser and the architect or\n            engineer respectively are at once testimony to their\n            operational effectiveness but also an indication of a\n            failure to train counterparts to take over their\n            responsibilities at a reasonably early date. Finally, the\n            failure to implement the recommendations of the market study\n            was a result of a lack of commitment by the authorities of\n            the Ivory Coast to the objectives of the study and their\n            consequent unwillingness to devote the budgetary and\n            organizational resources necessary to carry out its major recommendations."}, "docdt": "1983-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
