will help the Government to\n            establish a preventive periodic road maintenance program and\n            set up a permanent training program for employees of the\n            Directorate of Public Works (DTP) of MTPU.  The project will\n            provide for:  (a) pavement strengthening and resealing of\n            374 km of the existing bituminous network; (b) establishment\n            of a Road Management Unit (RMU) in DTP; and (c) construction\n            and equipping of a training school for DTP's employees,\n            and technical assistance to help design and implement a\n            training program.  The project will also provide vehicles\n            and equipment for traffic counting, classrooms and\n            workshops.  Benefits will accrue in the form of\n            vehicle-operating cost savings and savings in road\n            maintenance costs.  There are no technical risks."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
