of 35 million tons per year (tpy), a\n            deep-water port near the city of Sao Luis, in the\n            Northeastern State of Maranhao, with a handling capacity of\n            vessels of up to 280,000 dwt, and a single track 1.6 meter\n            gauge railway line of approximately 890 km interconnecting\n            the mine to the port. The project also includes the\n            development of a town-site at Carajas to accommodate an\n            initial population of around 10,000, new housing and\n            supporting facilities along the railway line, environmental\n            and Amerindian protection components, and a staff training program."}, "docdt": "1982-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
