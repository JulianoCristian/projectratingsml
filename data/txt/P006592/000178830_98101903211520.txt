APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN CHILE
SUMMARY ANT CtTTCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Chile has requested Bank assistance in
financing a project for the improvement and expansion of agricultural
education and teacher training. Despite some progress in the reform of
education, the system continues to suffer from certain structural and
operational deficiencies. Three critical weaknesses are the poor
quality of primary education and teacher training, the secondary school
curriculum, which stratifies too rigidly those preparing for university
entrance and those entering vocational education, and agricultural
education, which is conducted in numerous small and ineffective schools.
The present project is particularly concerned with two of these pro-
blems, and as modified during appraisal and re-appraisal would consist
of the construction and equipment of (a) one new and extensions to ten
existing primary teacher training colleges, (b) four new and extensions
to seven existing agricultural secondary schools, and (c) technical
assistance and overseas training in the two fields of teacher training
and agricultural education.
ii.       Expanded facilities for primary teacher training would in-
directly assist the government in raising requirements for admission
to primary teacher training, thus improving the quality of teaching.
The proposed new school would replace unsuitable buildings; the
ten existing schools would be better equipped, remodelled and slightly
expanded. Total enrollments would be 5300 in a 3-year course.
iii.      The construction of four new and the extension of seven
existing agricultural schools would enable the government to rationalize
middle level agricultural education through more economical and better-
located larger schools. The eleven schools would have a total enroll-
ment of 4h66 students and an annual output of 990 agricultural techni-
cians.
iv.       Technical assistance would provide experienced foreign per-
sonnel in key positions to assure successful implementation of the
project.  Scholarships would finance the simultaneous training of local
personnel to replace the foreign experts.
v.        School design would be austere and consistent with functional
needs. Estimated costs of construction, furniture and equipment are
reasonable. Procurement would be by international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines Relating to Procurement."
vi.       To execute the project, a project unit with a full-time pro-
ject director, a full-time project architect and supporting staff would be
established in the Ministry of Education.  The School Construction Company,
which is responsible for building all government schools in Chile, will
supervise the construction of the project schools.



- ii -
vii.     The total cost of the project is estimated at $14.0 million,
of which 63% would be for construction, 17% for furniture and equipment,
4% for technical assistance and 16% for contingencies and price increase
allowances. The foreign exchange component is estimated at $3.6 million
or about 26% of the total cost.
viii.    The annual recurrent budget of the Ministry of Education can be
expected to increase by about 51% from E° 1154 million to about EO 1738
million between 1968 and 1975. About EO 18.5 million or 1.1% would be a
result of the proposed project. It is not expected that the government
will encounter difficulties in meeting its share of the capital cost and
the recurrent costs of the project.
ix.   The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of $7.0 million
for a period of 25 years including a grace period of ten years.



APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN CHILE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1965, in its first assistance to education and training
in Chile and, in fact, in Latin America, the Bank granted CORFO
(Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion) a loan of $2.75 million to
help finance the expansion of the vocational training programs of its
training department, now known as Instituto Nacional de Capacitacion
Profesional (INACAP). This project, which has progressed satisfacto-
rily and is now substantially completed, has assisted programs de-
signed to upgrade the labor force. The Bank has recently appraised a
second loan request to finance IfLACAP activities in the amount of
$1.5 million. This project will be concerned with various aspects of
INACAP training, major items being mobile units for agricultural and
fisheries training.
1.02      The present request is for Bank assistance in financing a
project directed primarily to the improvement of agricultural educa-
tion and teacher training. A Unesco project identification mission
identified priority needs for education in Chile in July, 1967 and in
May-July 1968 a Unesco project preparation mission assisted the
Government of Chile to prepare an education project based on those
needs. The project was appraised in October/November 1968 by a Bank
mission composed of Messrs. C.P. van Dijk (economist), R. E. Byron
(technical education), J. M. Holley (agricultural education),
G. Naleppa (architect) and N. Fisher (general education consultant).
1.03      The project, as presented to the Bank, comprised the con-
struction of seven new comprehensive secondary schools, the construc-
tion of three new and the remodelling of eight existing primary
teacher training colleges, the conversion of five existing industrial
schools into industrial streams of a comprehensive school and the
construction of four new and the expansion of seven existing agricul-
tural schools.
l.o4      During appraisal it became clear that, (a) the conversion
of the five industrial schools should await a study of the rationali-
zation of the system of industrial education and training, and (b) an
existing primary teacher training college, which was to be closed,
should be retained and added to the project.
1.05      After loan negotiations were completed in June, 1969, the
government reconsidered its decision to build seven comprehensive pilot
secondary schools, pending further investigations. A delegation will
visit England and Scandinavia during February, 1970 to study their
school systems before the government makes a final decision on a com-
prehensive secondary school system for the country. The government
also decided to delete one new primary teacher training college from
the project pending further consideration of the pattern of the school
system. The construction of another new primary teacher training college,



- 2 -
where work is about to start with local financing, was deleted from the
project at a later stage but its equipping was maintained as a project
item.
1.06     The amended project was re-appraised in November, 1969 by a
Bank mission consisting of Messrs. 0. Markgren (general education), and
G. Naleppa (architect).
1.07     The revised project, as agreed with the Government, would
consist of:
(i) the construction and equipment of:
(a) one primary teacher training college;
(b) extensions to ten existing primary teacher training
colleges;
(c) four new agricultural secondary schools;
(d) extensions to seven existing agricultural secondary
schools; and
(ii) technical assistance and overseas training in the two fields
mentioned above.
Social and Economic Backgroun
1.08     The Republic of Chile occupies a long, narrow strip of land along
the Pacific shore of the southern half of the South American continent.
It embraces a great variety of climatic zones, from the barren desert in
the North to the Antarctic ice of the South. The greater part of the
population and most economic activity is concentrated in the fertile valleys
of the central part of the country but mining is important in the northern
desert and agriculture, forestry and fishing in the South.
1.09     The population in 1969 was estimated at 9.3 million of which
approximately 50% is below 20 years of age. About 68% is living in urban
centers. The labor force in 1968 was 3.0 million of which approximately
200,000 are unemployed.
1.10     Major economic activities are: manufacturing and construction
which account for 30% of total GDP, commerce 21%, mining 10%, and agri-
culture, forestry and fishing 10?(.  Most important of the country's
mining activities is the copper industry which accounts for nearly 759 of
all export earnings. A reform of the agricultural sector to change the
pattern of land ownership and to make the country self-sufficient in
major foodstuffs is one of the present government's major development
objectives.

II. TIUIC EJUCATION SYSTE'I
Administration and Organization
2.01      Public education at primary and secondary level is highly
centralized (Annex 1); the Minister of Education is responsible for
policy, control and supervision of public primary and secondary
schools and teacher training colleges, and has control over the
curricula and examinations of private schools. The universities,
both state and private, are autonomous. The educational structure
is shown in Annex 2.
2.02      The Ministry of Education is qualitatively understaffed
and an urgent need exists for the selection and training of admin-
istrative and supervisory staff. Unesco, in conjunction with the
Ministry's Centro de Perfeccionamiento, Experimentacion e Investi-
gaciones Pedagogicas, has prepared a plan for such training.
Primary Education
2.03      The National Education Reform Act of 1966 extended the length
of primary education from six to eight years and reduced the secondary
course from six to four years. The education pyramid is shown at
Annex 3 and primary pupil enrollment figures for 1962-1968 at Annex 4.
2.o4      Total primary school enrollments at 1,923,300 in 1968
correspond to about 100% of the age group 7-15 but when the consider-
able number of under and over-age pupils is subtracted, the partici-
pation rate is about 70%. Projected enrollments to 1975 are shown in
Annex 5.  Of the 48,o00 primary school teachers in 1968, about 70;. were
qualified (A.Mnex 5a).
Secondary Education
2.o5      Until the 1966 Reform Act, secondary education was organized
in a highly rigid., compartmentalized system. The major part, repre-
senting 70/% of all enrollments, consisted of a six-year course of
academic secondary education of which the last years were primarily
university preparation.  The remaining part consisted of specialist
agricultural, industrial, commercial and feminine-technical schools.
Courses varied from two to seven years with little access to further
education. Development of this sector was mostly uncoordinated, schools
were poorly endowed, lacking in staff and materials; the quality of
training was therefore poor and the dropout rate high.
2.06      Following the 1966 Reform Act, the government is actively
pursuing a policy of restructurina secondary education but the existing
system still reflects many of the limitations of the old system.
2.07      About 75-80% of primary school leavers are admitted to
secondary schools. Although the overall retention rate in the primary
system is only about 25%, this is still a high progression rate. The



- 4 -
growth of secondary enrollment is shownm in Annexes 6a-6f. Total
enrollments in 1967 represented some 24% of the age group 15-19.
Secondary enrollments are expected to amcrease to 259,700 in 1970 and
420,6Co in 1975 which is equivalent to 30% and nearly 45% of the rele-
vant age groups respectively. The percentage share of technical
education in secondary enrollments will be raised from 28% in 1967 to
h44% in 1975; in that year 50% of all students entering secondary schools
will be enrolling in technical education (Annexes 6g-h).
2.08      The-total number of secondary school teachers is 17,420 of
whom 13,115 are in general secondary schools and h,305 in technical
-schools. Host are qualified.  Teachers are, however, employed on a
part-time basis and paid by the hour. The Government is fully aware
of the adverse effects of part-time teaching, intends to introduce
.radually, over the next decade, full-time teaching mad gave an assurance to
this effect during-negotiations.
-2.09      The present stock of teachers, augmented by the new output
from. the-universities, training courses, will be adequate, provided,
as-part of its plan to introduce full-time teachers, the Government
raises class contact hours in fields where shortages are likely to
occur (Annex 7).  For technical subjects, however, now training programs
should be developed.
Teacher Training
2.10      Primary teacher training is in a state of transition.  The
old-six-year course at secondary level is being replaced by a three-
year post-secondary course which will assure more mature stuLdents and
a higher level of training. At present, both the lower and the higher
-level coucses are given in 17 public and private teacher training
colleges. Parallel to the teacher training courses described above,
the universities iltrodunred primary teacher training at post-secondary
level in 196h.
-2.11    The present curriculum-concentrates too heavily on theoretical
pedagogics with little time for general education; there is no instruc-
tion in art, craft, music or-physical education; teaching practice
is-confined-to the final year.
2.12      Teacher training colleges. lack well qualified teacher
trainers. The current program of in-service training needs to be
energetically pursued in conjunction with a phased recruitment of full-
time graduate, specialist staff into these colleges.
2.13      Secondary-school teacher7 are trained at five universities
-in a five-year course.  In 1967 there were 9,685 secondary teachers in
training at the universities of whom .ll116 were in their final year.
2.14      The- Goveamment  has given as3urr.c-, that techcers trained
in university courses described above, will increasingly fcrm the
main teaching corps in all secondary schmols and teacher training



colleges. University expansion is proceeding at a pace sufficient to
assure a fuilly-qualified staff by 1975 provided class-contact hours
for part-time teachers now in service will be increased. Estimates
of future teacher demand and supply are given in Annex 7.
Agricultural Education and Training
2.15      Agricultural education at secondary level is given in 46
secondary agricultural schools of which 15 are Government and 31
private schools. Most are small and uneconomic in size and suffer from
insufficient supervision and lack of resources. Graduates are poorly
equipped to contribute effectively to the development of the agricul-
tural sector. The Government is well aware of the urgent need for
improvement and is in the process of a complete reorganization of
agricultural secondary education.
2.16      Post-secondary agricultural education at intermediate level
is given in seven University Regional Centers for 845 students. Degree
level agricultural education is given at five universities, where 1,h28
students are studying agronomy and 245 forestry.
Industrial Education and Training
2.17      Industrial education at secondary level is provided in 51
industrial schools and 4 polytechnical institutes operated by the
i4inistry of Education; 25 private schools offer a wide variety of
courses. Similar programs at secondary level are offered by two
universities. Enrollments in these schools have risen from 10,417 in
1964 to 13,251 in 1967 (Grades 9-12 only). Due to inadequate support
by the Ministry, standards of instruction are unacceptably low.  The
government is commencing to rationalize and improve industrial educa-
tion.
2.18      Vocational training of young employed and adult workers, of
students who have dropped out of the school system and of the unemployed
is provided by the Instituto Nlacional de Capacitacion Profesional
(INACAP). Technician training is given by INACAP and at the universities.
Hi-her Education
2.19      Higher education is mainly provided by the country's eight
universities, twso public and six private.  Although subsidized by
Governym?ent, each university is autonomous and reluctant to accept any
form of outsIde direction.  Mloreover, the universities provide programs
for industry, agriculture and commerce which duplicate the functions of
other institutions, indicating the need for rationalization and co-
ordinated planning.

III.  COST AND FTI,NCING OF EDUCATION
Financing of Education
3.01      Public primary and secondary schools are fully financed through
the education budget of the central government. Students' fees for board
and lodging are normally covered by government scholarships. Non fee-
paying private schools are subsidized by government grants amounting to
50% of per pupil costs in public schools. Fee-paying private schools are
not normally subsidized.
3.02      In higher education, the tiwo public universities (the Univer-
sity of Chile and the State Technical University) are Government subsi-
dized to about 70-80% of their recurrent and capital expenditure. The
six private universities also receive substantial government subsidies,
but the amount of their own resources is not known with any precision.
In addition, higher education is indirectly subsidized through scholar-
ships awarded by the National Student Assistance Board.
3.03      Subsidies to institutions not directly under the control of
the IMinistry of Education, as described in the two preceding paragraphs,
claimed nearly 40%0 of the education budget for 1968, of which more than
three-quarters or nearly 30% of the budget was for the universities. The
disproportionately high amount of public financial resources absorbed by
the universities is causing concern, particularly in view of the very
rapid growth in university enrollments foreseen in the coming years.  The
government is studying a plan whereby university students or graduates
would repay the cost of their university education over a period of 1l
years. The Fund thus created would be distributed among universities on
the basis of a long-range master plan for higher education.
Total Education Expenditure
3.04      Total expenditure on education in the last five years, in-
cluding the estimated share of the private sector, as shodn in Annex 8,
has increased from 4.6% of GDP in 1964 to more than 5% in 1968. Ex-
cluding private expenditure, for which no reliable estimates are avail-
able for 1967 and 1968, public sector expenditure on education in con-
stant 1967 prices has doubled during the four-year period 1964-1968.
3.05      Major increases took place in capital expenditure of the Min-
istry of Education and in recurrent and capital expenditure by decen-
tralized agencies such as the Student Assistance Board, the Universities
and the School Construction Corporation.



-7-
Recurrent Expenditure
3.06      An analysis of public education expenditure, broken down by
level and type of education, is given in Annex 9 and, in somewhat
greater detail, in Annex 10. A very high proportion of the budget is
spent on the universities (para. 3.03). In 1966 and 1967 these ab-
sorbed one-third of the total education budget, a proportion which had
decreased somewhat last year. In contrast, the amount spent on teacher
training and secondary education represents only a small part of the
education budget, i.e., less than 20% in 1968.
3.07      Most of the budget allocations for teacher training and secon-
dary education are for salaries and other personal allowances. The
allocations for instructional materials and equipment and Tnaintenance of
buildings and equipment are small, ranging from less than 1% of all re-
current expenditure for general secondary education, to 8\3 for teacher
training and 7.6% for industrial secondary education. These percentages
are much too low which is confirmed by the poor state of repair of most
of the buildings and the inadequacy or absence of materials, books and
equipment in most schools. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that adequate budgeta'ry'provision will be made fcr these items.
3.08      Average recurrent cost per pupil for each level and type of
education is shown in Annex 11, which also shows present teachers'
salary levels. Within secondary education, costs of the various types
of education differ greatly.  Improvement in the standards of equipment
in general secondary education and the rationalization of agricultural
and industrial education should reduce these cost differentials in the
future.
Future Recurrent Expenditure
3.09      Recurrent education expenditure by the Ministry of Education
is expected to rise by 51% during the seven-year period 1968-1975 or
by more than 6% per annum (Annex 12). This estimate appears low in
view of the probable pressures upon the government to improve simulta-
neously the supply of instructional materials, raise the standards of
buildings and maintenance and raise teachers' salaries. However, it
may be possible to maintain overall expenditure within reasonable
limits through more efficient deployment of the teaching force.
3.10      The proportion of the recurrent budget allocated to primary
education will drop to below )40%, which can be expected in a situation
where universal primary education will shortly be achieved. Secondary
and higher education will claim increasingly larger shares of the re-
current budget; higher education is expected to maintain its lead over
secondary education with no less than 37.4% of the budget in 1975.
E° 18.5 million or 0.7% of total recurrent expenditure for education



- 8 -
for 1975 would be a result of the proposed project.
3.11     In the absence of any projections of total government revenue
and expenditure up to 1975, it is difficult to state whether the projected
rise in recurrent education expenditure is feasible. It is not likely
that the total central government budget will rise by more than 5-1/2 - 6S
per annum in the next few years. Overall budgetary pressures will tend
to limit the annual increaees in educational recurrent expenditures to the
same or slightly higher rates of increase.
Capital Expenditure
3.12     Total capital expenditure for education has increased very rapidly
during the last four years, showing a threefold increase in constant prices
over the period 1964-1968 (Annex 8).
3.13     Projections of capital expenditure on education for the years
1972 and 1975 are given in Annex 13. In constant 1966 currency capital
expenditure is expected to rise from EO 135.5 million in 1968 to E° 171.5
million in 1975 or by about 3.5% per annum, which is a reasonable increase.

IV  EDUCATION AND TRAINING TEEDS
Existing Deficiencies
4.01      There is no evidence of serious quantitative shortages of
middle level manpower, except in agriculture and certain other occu-
pations, and a gradual increase in secondary enrollments should suf-
fice to meet quantitative labor market demands in the coming decade.
There is, however, much evidence that the average school leaver is
poorly prepared for entering the labor force and that a change in
the quality and orientation of secondary education is urgently needed.
4.02      Until very recently, secondary education formed a rigidly
compartmentalized system in which the majority of students and most of
the Ministry's resources were channelled into academic secondary
schools, whose major function apPeared to be preparation for higher
education, without regard to the needs of the majority of students.
4.03      The major weaknesses of the general secondary schools are:
- the course content, which is heavily academic and theoretical
in subject matter and not relevant to the needs of the coun-
try;
- the rigid methods of teaching which fail to allow for in-
dividual differences and interests anong students and emphasise
too much the importance of rote learning and memorization;
- a system of part-time teachers, which makes meaningful con-
tact between pupil and teacher virtually impossible;
- a serious lack of equipment and books, and poor school
facilities.
As a result, all but the ablest pupils become discouraged and there
is a high drop-out rate.
4.04      The technical-vocational schools display the same deficien-
cies as the general secondary schoolsaand suffer the following addi-
tional weaknesses:
- students have to make career choices at the age of 12 or 13
years, enter technical training without a sufficient basis
of general education and are denied access to higher educa-
tion;
- lack of financial and administrative support from the Minis-
try of Education;
- proliferation of scarce resources over a multitude of small,
uneconomic schools;



-10-
- an even more harmful shortage of equipment and supplies
than in the general secondary schools.
As a result, standards of technical education have deteriorated, the
the rate of drop-out is considerably higher than the already unaccep-
tably high levels in general secondary schools and technical schools
are looked upon as inferior institutions for whose output there is
little economic demand.
Reform Measures
4 05       Secondary Education.  The Government has decided to improve
secondary education. Major components of this reform are: (i) extension
of primary education from six to eight years and a rerduction in second-
ary education from six to four years; (ii) increased requirements for
admission to primary teacher training; (iii) curriculum reform and
rationalization of secondary education. The first and second of these
steps are already being put into effect. The third step is now being
investigated and discussed.
4.06       A more modern secondary school curriculum, with a better
balance between academic and technical education, and a more flexible
course organization, would allow ncximum transferability between dif-
ferent streams and schools of a diiferent type. One suggested solution
would make the first two years a common course of general studies,
during which period maximum student transferability would exist. During
the last two years, when the student would have reached a more mature
age, there would be pre-vocaticnal specialization, but still allowing
access to higher education.
4.07       Agricultural Secondary Schools.  To provide effective mid-
dle-level agricultural manpo-;ar, the present system of agricultural
secondary schools needs rationalization and qualitative improvements.
To that effect, the Government is taking the following steps which
would deserve Bank support.
4.08       The total number of schools will be reduced from 46 to 27,
of which 13 would be government schools and 14 privately owned. A number
of poorly located, inferior and expensive government schools will be dis-
continued, of which four woould be replaced by entirely newi schools in
agricultural areas where this form of secondary education is needed.
Seven other government schools will be expanded and equipped to form
larger aindmoore viable units.
4.09       A greatly improved curriculum will be introduced, which,
will emphasize general education in the first two years and greater
specialization in the second half of the four-year course; students'
access to higher education will be assured; a better balance between
general secondary education and agricultural education and training
will be attained.



4.10       Total enrollments in the 27 reorganized schools would be 6,500
students as compared with 4,860 students in the existing 46 schools;
schools would, consequently, be of a more economic size; output of
graduates would increase from 670 in 1968 to about 1,300 in 1974, of
whom 20% would enter higher education and 80% middle level employment.
This is still considerably belowg the estimated annual manpowJer require-
ments of 2,000 by 1974 but a more rapid increase is not feasible in
view of the inadequate supply of teachers and the conclusion that fur-
ther expansion should await the results of the present investigation
into a reform of the secondary education system.
4.11      The central administration and supervision of agricultural
education would be greatly strengthened, initially with the help of
foreign technical assistance; a program for the training of teachers
of agriculture, for appointment on a full-time basis, will start soon.
4.12       Industrial Secondary Schools.  Government plans for a ratio-
nalization and improvement of industrial secondary education are less
advanced than those for agricultural education. There are at present
55 public industrial schools and polytechnical institutes and 25 pri-
vate industrial schools. The Government intends to reduce the number
of public schools to 44.
h.13       Total enrollments in industrial secondary schools are ex--
pected to quadruple to more than 50,000 pupils in the period 1967 -
1975 and for that reason retaining most of the existing industrial
schools would be justified. Planned enrollment figures, however,
bear no relationship to manpower requirements of the country. The
foreseen enrollment expansion would greatly exceed the estimated re-
quirements. None of these requirements, moreover, has been specified
and as a result too little is known about the specific vocational
training which the schools should provide.
4.1h       The objectives of industrial education need to be defined
more sharply, on the basis of which improved curricula and course
outlines could be developped. In addition, the location of industrial
schools should be studied carefully to assure maximum coordination
between industrial education and regional and local training needs.
For these reasons, no industrial schools could be included in the
proposed project.
4.15       Primary Teacher- Training.  In a major effort to improve the
quality of primary education, the government has upgraded the training
of primary school teachers from secondary to post-secondary level. This
step was also considered desirable in view of the extension of primary
education from six to eight years, which will result in higher demands
on teacher qualifications and skills.
4.16       The total need for teachers in primary schools by 1980 is
estimated at 66,595 (Annex 5-a). Of the primary school teachers in
schools in 1968 (t48,000) about 70% were qualified. Of these about



- 12 -
17,000 will be in service by 1980 so that about 49,500 additional
trained teachers should be needed between 1969 and 1980.
4.17     The university programs in primary teacher training now
producing 1,075 new teachers a year will be reduced to a constant out-
put of 865 teachers a year as from 1972. Total output from the uni-
versities between 1968 and 1979 will be about 11,000. Private normal
schools are e.xpected to train some 1,400 teachers in the same period.
The output from government teacher training colleges will be stabilized
at a level of 1,900 teachers a year which would assure a total output
of 25,000 teachers over the period 1968-1979. The aggregate output from
these three sources, at about 36,000 would give about 83% trained prinary
school teachers in the school system by 1980.
k.18     Existing facilities are substandard and inadequate for improved
training at post-secondary level. Some buildings are too old for major
repairs and some dangerously damaged by earthquakes. All are lacking
in modern equipment, laboratories and practical work spaces. The govern-
ment intends to replace pur existing buildings, falling in the first
group, by two new schools of a more economic size, (of which one will be
built and equipped and the other equipped only as part of the project)
andl to extend and equip nine other schools which can still be used. The
proposed project would assist this modernization.
4.19     Technical Assistance.  The Ministry of Education is qualitatively
understaffed; available personnel have little experience in modern
curricula for agricultural education and teacher training. To assure
successful implementation of educational improvements, a considerable
amount of technical assistance would therefore be needed. Experienced
advisers and specialists should be recruited in the field of agricultural
education and trainIng of teachers. Programs for the training of local
staff in these fields should be implemented simultaneously so that
expatriate personnel can be replaced by experienced local staff in a
reasonable time. The need for Bank assistance in this field is strongly
indicated.

V. TIlE PROJECT
A. Technical Features
General
5.01       The proposed project consists of:
(i)   The construction and equipment of:
(a) one new primary teacher training college;
(b) additions to ten existing primary teacher training
colleges;of which one would receive equipment only;
(c) four new agricultural secondary schools;
(d) extensions to seven existing agricultural secondary
schools; and
(ii)   technical assistance and overseas training in the two
fields mentioned above.
5.02       The total number of new places to be provided in the project
is 5,549, as followis:

TOTAL    22   4,217   9,766   5,549      2,65
Primary Teacher Trai.ning Colleges
5.03       Both the new school  and the extensions included in the proposed
project would serve the modernization and improvement of primary teacher
training institutions.,  The proposed new schoolis to replace
existing unsuitable buildings; the age and condition of these buildings is
such that renovation would be economically unfeasible. The new school
would be larger and more economical to run.



- 14 -
5.04     In the ten existing colleges included in the project, available
accommodation is sufficient for the projected enrollments so that exten-
sions to these schools would be small. Of greater importance is the
improvement and remodelling of existing spaces and the provision of equip-
ment. In one of the schools, the new college in Santiago now under con-
struction, the project will only provide furniture and equipment.
5.05     This new college and the one to be constructed under the project
will be in large urban centers and accommodate 800 and 1,200 pupils
respectively; the other nine are located in smaller regional centers and
will have an ultimate enrollment of 300 or 400 pupils each. In the two
large schools, the number of boarders will be small (17.5%) but in the
regional centers boarders will be 57%. This is necessary because the
latter will draw students from large catchment areas. The enrollment
structure of each of the schools is given in Annex 14.
5.o6     The government is aware of the need for the attainment of a
balanced output of teachers from teacher training colleges and univer-
sities to assure an adequate supply (Annex 5a). Assurances given on
this point have been confirmed during negotiations.
5.07     The schools will offer a three-year post-secondary course.  The
curriculium for this course needs revision (para. 2.11); assurances to
that effect were given by the authorities to the appraisal mission and
have been confirmed during negotiations.
5.o8     Numerically, the present number of teacher trainers is sufficient
to staff the schools. However, a program of in-service training and a
phased recruitment of graduate, specialist teachers to replace lower
qualified staff is urgently needed. Part-time teaching should be phased
out.  Assurances that these steps will be taken were given during nego-
tiations.
5.09     In addition, technical assistance would be required, during a
period of two to three years, to assure the efficient implementation of
reform measures to be taken and the proper functioning of the new courses.
The cost of 10 man/years of technical assistance, as specified in Annex 15,
has been included in the project.
Agricultural Secondary Schools
5.10     The four new agricultural secondary schools will be established
in the center of agricultural areas. In addition, the project would
extend, modernize and equip seven existing schools, which were found to
be well located. Together, the construction or extension of eleven
schools will make it possible to discontinue the operation of a number
of inferior, expensive and non-essential schools and to concentrate the
national program of agricultural secondary education in larger, more
economic units by reducing the total number of schools from 46 to 27.
5.11     Each project school will have a total enrollment of 406
students. Due to the nature of the schools and their eccentric location,



- 15 -
all students would be boarders.  The enrollment structure of each of the
schools is given in Annex 14.
5.12     The curriculum of the agricultural schools has been revised to
give a better balance between general and agricultural education. The
schools will offer a four-year course, of which the first two years will
emphasize general education and the second half will stress specialization
in general and technical agriculture, rural sociology, and extension
methods and techniques. At least 60% of the agricultural instruction
would be practical training in school laboratories, on the farm or in
selected outside locations.
5.13     Students would be trained as middle level agricultural technicians
("prficticos agrlcolas") and could (a) fill many of the available middle
level positions in the extension and agricultural reform services, the
agricultural cooperatives and agricultural commerce and industry, or
(b) become self-employed on their own farm production units or (c) continue
their studies in higher agricultural or training institutions.
5.14     For the successful operation of the agricultural schools, it
would be necessary to discontinue gradually the present system of part-time
teachers by introducing the appointment of full-time staff except in the
case of certain highly specialized teachers, whose limited assignments
would make full-time appointment unfeasible. The authorities agreed on
this matter of full-time staff and assurances to that effect were given
during negotiations.
5.15     In addition, a program of both pre-service and in-service training
would be urgently needed to assure a fully qualified staff of about 300
teachers of agricultural subjects, who are needed by 1975. In cooperation
with the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Chile, the Ministry
of Education is working out such a program. Assurances were given during
negotiations that an adequate program to meet the teacher needs by 1975
will be implemented. Excellent accommodation for the teacher training courses
is available at the former site of the faculty at Rinconada de Maipui,
adjacent to one of the agricultural schools included in the proposed project.
Technical assistance, as specified in Annex 15, will be needed for the
organization and development of the courses and forms part of the proposed
project.
5.16     The Ministry's administrative and supervisory services responsible
for agricultural education are seriously understaffed and need strength-
ening to assure successful implementation of the reforms and of the
proposed project. Assurances that the supervisory staff for agricultural
education will be strengthened, were obtained during negotiations. The
Ministry proposed to appoint a new director of agricultural education, who
would be assisted by a specialist in this field under technical assistance
arrangements (Annex 15); the latter would be responsible for the training
of local countt.rparts, who would be awarded fellowships during the period
of their training.

-17-
5.19      The cost estimate given above is based on recent experience
in school construction by the Sociedad Constructora de Establecimientos
Educacionales (S.C.E.E.), the school construction company, responsible
for the design and supervision of government school projects. Their
costs are acceptable. During the last three years, construction costs
(expressed in Escudos) have risen, on the average by about 30% annually.
This has been mainly due to inflation, but there has also been a real
annual cost increase of about  5r.    This trend is expected to continue.
Due to the geography of the country and the concentration of the building
industry in the central Santiago  area, construction costs vary consider-
ably within the country, being, e.g., 40% above Santiago prices both in
Antofagasta in the north and in Valdivia in the south. Space standards,
applied to the construction of classrooms, laboratories, workshops, etc.
are appropriate; construction methods are economical and finishes would
be austere. Estimates of furniture and equipment costs assure satis-
factory provision of these items at realistic costs.
Estimated unit costs at the new project schools are as follows (in US$):
Teacher Training         Agricultural

1/  Apart from higher space requirements in agricultural training, the
difference in building costs is due to the fact that the teacher
training institute is located in the central Santiago-Valparaiso
area, where construction costs are generally lower than in the more
distant parts of the country, where most of the agricultural schools
are located.
2/  Standards for boarding facilities are higher in teacher training
institutes (post-secondary level) than in the agricultural schools
(secondary level).

C. Execution of the Project
5.20      Building industry.   The country's building industry is highly
developed and construction capacity is sufficient to cope with a large
expansion program in school building.  There are about 170 firmLs which
have been prequalified for schoo'l construction work; all are Chilean and
almost all are located in the Santiago area. Capacity for local
manufacture of low-cost school furniture is also sufficient.
5.21      Building materials.   M      bst building materials employed in
school construction are produced in Chile, but some of these require
imported raw materials, such as asbestos, vinyl, paint pigments, etc.
Some electrical fixtures are also imported.
5.22      School planning.  Design and supervision of execution of all
public school buildings are the responsibility of the Sociedad Constructora
de Establecimientos Educacionales, S.A. (SCEE), which would also be
responsible for the supervision, construction and extension of schools
included in the proposed project. This is a semi-governmental autonomous
organization which is linked with the Education Ministry through the
Comision Tecnica de Construcciones Escolares. The commission establishes
school planning criteria and approves designs and acts, on behalf of
the Minister of Education, as client towards the SCEE.
5.23      From funds obtained from government (90%) and the private
sector (10%), SCEE normally finances land acquisition and construction
work and rents completed school buildings (of which it normally retains
ownership) to the government.  Lhe sanle procedure will be follow1ed in
res^pect of tihe nroject.  Consequently, all schools included in the
proposed project rill be ow-ned by SCEE.
5.24      Instructional equipment is procured and owned by the Ministry of
Education, and school furniture is either purchased by SCEE or the
Ministry. The professional staff of SCEE is competent and experienced;
they have prepared model plans for primary and secondary schools, both
as reinforced concrete and steel structures. Construction methods of
executed school buildings are economical and finishee are austere.
5.25      Tendering of construction w,ork. Bids for school construction
work are called either by advertisement in local newspapers or by
invitation. Only prequalified contractors are allowed to bid and the
award is normally given to the lowest bidder. Negotiated contracts are
also common.Tendering procedures are in general acceptable but will have
to be adjusted to the requirements of international competitive bidding.
Agreement on this adjustment was reached during appraisal and confirmed
dlring negotiations.  Assurances -uere also given that project items
will be grouped where feasible to facilitate international competitive
bidding but it is likely that all construction contracts will be won by
Chilean contractors.
5.26      Maintenance of school facilities, including public schools
not owned by SCEE, is the responsibility of SCEE. The yearly maintenance
budget is derived from government's income from its SCEE shares; these



- 19 -
funds are insufficient and the ssttem for preventive maintenance is
inadequate.  Even recently constricted schools were found to be in
bad repair, pointing to the need for increased funds and improved
procedures for maintenance. The government agreed that annual
allocations for school building maintenance should be increased;
assurances to that effect were obtained during negotiations.
5.27     Site Acquisition.  Satisfactory sites for the project schools
have been selected and most of them have been acquired.
5.28     Construction Period.  Technically, the proposed project schools
could be built or extended in one to two years. To enable the Ministry
of Education to build up a competent staff of administrators, supervisors
and teachers, it is proposed to spread the implementation over three
years, including a preparation period of one year. Another year should
be added as a defects and liability period (Annex 17).
5.29     Project Unit. To coordinate, administer and supervise the
execution of the project, a Project Unit would be established in the
Ministry of Education, headed by a full-time Project Director, assisted
by a full-time Project Architect, who would be responsible for archi-
tectural planning, design, contract award and supervision, and by supporting
staff for equipment procurement and accounting.
5.30     Disbursements. The proposed loan would be disbursed on the
basis of: (_a)5 1  of the cost of instructional equipment and books, of
the c.i.f. cost of imported construction materials, and of the foreign
exchange costs of technical assistance and fellowships; and (b) 40% of
the cost of construction, furniture and professional services. The total
amount of the loan would then amount to $i.0 million or 50$ of the
estimated total cost of the project and would cover part of local
expenditures. The percentage under (b) above would be adjusted so that
withdrawals would be spread during the period of execution. Undisbursed
amounts at project completion would be available for cancellation.  In
the event that expenditures would exceed the estimated cost of $14.0
million, such excess would be met by the Chilean government.

VI. RIEC0P01ENTDATIONS
6.01       The proposed project would assist the government of Chile in
improving the training of primary school teachers and middle-level agricultural
technicians.
6.02       The construction and equipment of a new and extensions to ten exisUg
primary teacher training colleges would enable the government to upgrade this
training to post-secondary level and apply modernized curricula and teaching
methods. Assistance for four new and seven existing agricultural schools
would allow rationalization and improvement of middle-level agricultural
education (paras. 4.07-4.18).
6.03       The accommodation schedules are austere and based on high utLliza-
tion, estimates of construction costs which are based on ruling local prices
are reasonable. Estimates of furniture and equipment costs assure adequate
provision at moderate cost. Architectural and construction services are well
within the capacity of the country (paras. 5.17-5.19).
6.04       Contracts for civil works and for furniture and equipment would
be awarded in accordance with procedures of international competitive bidding
with provision for grouping of items where feasible to facilitate these
procedures (para. 5.25).
6.05       The share of the capital cost of the project which will be borne
by the Chilean government is within the financial capacity of the country.
The recurrent cost implications of the project form only a minor part of
projected future budgets, and are within the country's means. In its totality,
however, the government's educational plan would lead to a substantial
increase in the education budget expressed as a percentage of estimated future
government budgets unless measures are taken to keep expenditures within
reasonable limits (paras. 3.09-3.13).
6.06       To assure the successful implementation of the project, government
assurances were obtained during negotiations that sufficient numbers of
qualified teachers would be trained and appointed on a full-time basis,
that agreement with the universities would be sought to ensure a balanced
output of primary school teachers, that their training would be revised and
that adequate funds would be made available for school maintenance, materials
and books.
6.07       A condition for effectiveness of the proposed loan would be the
establishment, within the MvIinistry of Education, of a project unit consisting
of a full-time project director, a full-time project architect and supporting
staff for administration, equipment procurement and accounts.
6.08       The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of $7.0 million
for 25 years including a grace period of ten years.

Notes:
1.   Realistic staffing projections are difficult since secondary teachers, who are often engaged on other
pursuits in addition to teaching, are employed on an hourly basis and no fine statistics exist regarding
the number at present in service.
2.   The Government estimates of teacher supply and demand are based on the number of hours each subject is
taught at secondary level.  The figure arrived at for the number of secondary teachers in post in 1965 has
been reduced by 25% over the period 1965-1975 to give the stock of  existing teachers likely to be in serv-
ice in the latter year.
3.   By computing the number of hours in each subject required at secondary level an estimate of the total
staff requirements for each subject has been deduced.
4.  By adding to the estimated number of teachers in service in 1975 the output from University training
department, reduced to allow for graduates who do not enter the profession, a balance sheet of secondary
school staff surplus and shortage has been arrived at, as shown above.
5.   It would appear that shortages in general subjects can be covered by increasing the number of hours class
contact in subjects where staffing is in short supply.  (Column 3, Table 2)  It is relevant to note that the
Goverrnent's declared policy Of appointing staff on X tell time basis would over a period resolve secondary
staffing problems.  (Coluan 4, Table 2)

Teachers' Salaries 1968
(in current prices)
Primary education: monthly salaries of qualified primary school teachers
range from Esc. 538 to Esc. 1043.
Secondary education: secondary school teachers are paid on an hourly
basis: for qualified teachers the monthly salary for each weekly
hour ranges from Esc. 28.14 to Esc. 30.26. A qualified teacher
with 30 class contact hours per week would be paid for 36 hours
and his basic salary would therefore be Esc. 1013 to Esc. 1089
per month.
These figures are for basic salaries only and do not include salary
supplements and allowances, which are considerable.
