SMALL ENTERPRISE APEX PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                Republic of Burundi
Beneficiaries:           Banque de la Republique du Bur.indi (BRB),
participating financial intermediaries, Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, and small enterprises.
Amount:                  SDR 5.7 million, equivalent to US$8 million.
Terms:                   Standax. .A terms.
Relending Terms:         The Borrower would pass on US$7.2 million
equivalent to BRB at 6.5 percent p.a. for 30
years, including a grace period of 10 years. BRB
would onlend the funds to qualified participating
financial intermediaries at 7.0 percent (or at the
treasury bond rate to be established following the
introduction of a treasury bonds auction) with a
flexible amortization schedule reflecting the
aggregate subloans extended by intermediaries. An
administrative fee of 0.5 percent would cover the
operating cost of a Project Unit within BRB. The
onlending rates would be reviewed annual±y.
Interest rates charged by participating
intermediaries to beneficiary SSEs would be
initially 11 percent for subloans of up to seven
years and 12 percent for subloans beyond seven
years. Following the introduction of a market-
oriented rediscount rate, int-srest rates would be
variable and market-determined. The foreign
exchange risk would be borne by the Government.
The Borrower would use the remaining US$0.8
million to (i) provide training and technical
assistance to participating intermediaries and
beneficiary SSEs and, (ii) establish an SSE
promotion unit in the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A SMALL ENTERPRISE APEX PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 5.7 million (US$8.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help support the
development of small scale enterprises in Burundi.
2.       Background.  After a period of relatively good performance and
growth, due partly to the coffee boom in the mid-1970's, Burundi faced
serious economic and financial difficulties starting in 1981. These
difficulties led to a comprehensive adjustment program of policy reform,
which was started by the Government in June 1986 in collaboration with IDA
and the IMF and which has begun to create an environment more favorable to
economic growth and efficient private investment. A new investment code
was promulgated, prices decontrolled, issuing of import licences
liberalized and, in July 1986, the exchange rate was adjusted by 152 in
terms of SDR. Since then, regular monthly adjustments have been made to
correct the appreciation in the real effective exchange rate which had
occurred over the past few years. The proposed project would complement
this structural adjustment program, and would support Government efforts to
promote financing of all productive sectors with specific emphasis on small
enterprises (SSE).
3 .      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA involvement in SSE development
would complement the policy-based lending for adjustment by supporting the
Government's efforts to stimulate economic growth and increase employment.
The package of financial resources and technical assistance -rovided by the
project would help the development of SSEs, a sector which has high
employment generation potential and is the breeding ground for developing a
Burundian entrepreneurial class. While some donors already support SSE
development in a piecemeal fashion, IDA's involvement would be particularly
important in the area of financial assistance, where procurement and other
restrictive conditions of bilateral donors limit selection options in
general.  In the technical assistance area, the proposed project would
provide support to Government in designing a country-wide SSE program
through the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The program would also be
supported and supplemented by other donors which so far have concentrated
their assistance at the artisan level.
4.       Small scale enterprises (SSEs) in Burundi are a non-homogeneous
group, varying in sophistication, size and activity. There are formal and
informal establishments. Formal SSEs are mainly active in trade, transport



-2-
and other services where they provide about 40 percent of employment. SSEs
are lese represented in productive activities where, according to a 1986
census they accounted for 9.2 percent of total production and 13 percent of
total employment. Informal SSEs, which account for a major part of the SSE
sector do not keep reliable records of their activities and were generally
unregistered until 1987, at which time the. Chamber of Commerce and Industry
started a major registration initiative, the results of which are not yet
available. Despite these information ehortcomings, all indications suggest
that the informal aector is an important generator of employment.   An IDA
employment generation study showed that the informal sector provides twice
the number of jobs as does the formal sector in the capital and the
secondary cities. Unlike large enterprises, most SSEs in Burundi are
owned, managed and operated by Burundian nationals. They are productive,
labor intensive and less dependent on Imported inputs compared to large
enterprises. There is significant development potential for SSEs in
Burundi, as th%.y are less constrained by transport difficulties and produce
basic goods accessible to low income groups. There is scope for SSE
development in such areas as food processing, agricultural tools,
carpentry, construction materials and repair and maintenance. However, the
sector faces several constraints as well. More than large enterprises,
SSEs suffer from limited training and difficult access to bank credit.
Building on the lessons learned from past efforts towards industrial
development by the Bank Group and other donors, this project will address
the issues constraining the growth of the SSE sector by cnanneling
financial resources through the country's development banks but also
through the existing commercial banks with their country-wide branch
network and by concentrating efforts of various donors to deliver a more
comphrehonsive program of technical assistance to beneficiary SSEs,
including entrepreneurship development programs.
5.       Prolect Descrigtion.  The proje't would offer a packa'xe of credit,
technical assistance, and training tailored to the needs of small
enterprises in Burundi. The credit conmonent would finance (i) fixed
assets and associated permanent working capital of SSE investment projects
in all sectors of the economy and (i1) free-standing working capital for
viable existing SSEs in the productive sectors. All accredited financial
intermediaries In Burundi In good standing with the Central Bank (BRB)
would be eligible to participate, provfded they enter into a participating
agreement with BRB that would specify, inter alia, the 14nding and
repayment conditions, procurement and disbursement procedures, and the
intermediary's acceptance of responsibility for appraisal and supervision
of subprojects. A Project Management Unit (PMU) would be established at
BRB to coordinate and monitor the participation of financial institutions
involved in the project. The technical assistance component would be
provided through the Burundi Chamber of Commerce and Industry for (i)
entrepreneurship development programs; (Li) SSE project preparation and
execution, including technical matters, basic accounting and project
management; and (11i) participating intermediaries on appraisal and
supervision of investment projects.
6.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$13.0 million
equivalent, of which US$7.7 million would be in foreign exchange. A.
breakdown of cost and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disburseme3t, as well as a disbursement

schedule, appear in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Burundi are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the different regions of
the country is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7025-BU,
dated January 29, 1988, is being distributed separately.
7.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following: (i)
onlending rates and conditions and their annual review with IDA; (ii)
content of the draft Manageme.it Agreement between the Government and BRB
for the Project Management Unit.  The signing of the Management  Agreement
and of the Cooperation Agreement (between the Government and the Chamber of
Commerce for the technical assistance) would be conditions of
effectiveness; (iii) content of the Participating Agreement between
financial intermediaries and BRE. The signing of at least one
Participation Agreement would be a condition of effectiveness, the signing
of the remaining Agreements would be a condition of disbursement for each
respective remaining intermediary; (iv) appraisal and superv'sion
procedures to be followed by participating intermediaries; tv) role of the
Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the promotion of and technical
assistance to the SSE sector; (vi) content of the entrepreneurship
development program; (vii) content of a first series of courses and
seminars to be given to staf£ of financial intermediaries; (viii) start of
operations of the recently established National Guarantee Fund; and (ix)
preparation of legal arrangements to allow accreditation by BRB of savings
cooperatives as financial institutions.
8.       Benefits.  In the past, Burundi has not had a practical and
effecti. approach towards SSE development.  With the mandate recently
given to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to take the lead in SSE
promotion, the proposed froject would help nurture this development, which
is expected to generate new job opportunities at a relatively low capital
cost. It is expected that the credit component would help create 2,500 new
jobs at an average cost of US$4,000 per job. The impact of the project is
expected to be appropriately dispersed both geographically and among
various groups with benefits reaching subborrowers in the secondary cities
and microenterprises.
9.       Risks.  Being the first apex operation in Burundi, the project
involves institutional arrangements that are new to the Central Bank and to
participating intermediaries. Initial delay in subloan pro^tessing may
occur as BRB will need to familiarize itself with the system and as
participating intermediaries develop.. further their appraisal and
supervision capacity. This risk would be considerably reduced by the swift
implementation of the technical assistance component and by clese IDA
supervision during the initial project execution phase.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
