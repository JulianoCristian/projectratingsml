Project sustainability is regarded aAs likely\n            although this assessment must be qualified by three factors:\n            1) the difficulty of maintaining fiscal discipline in light\n            of the extensive social and economic needs of the country,\n            especially as new areas open up to Government control; 2)\n            upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections pose the\n            possibility of additional expenditure demands and/or the\n            emergence of elected authorities less committed to a reform\n            agenda; and 3) finally, and most importantly, the potential\n            for security setbacks, either from a slowdown or reversal of\n            the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program\n            or from cross-border destabilization, remains real. Overall\n            World Bank performance is rated satisfactory and Borrower\n            performance is assessed as highly satisfactory. The key\n            lesson learned is that short-term, post-conflict operations,\n            while not without risk, can address near-term recovery\n            needs, as well as lay the foundation for growth and\n            structural reform in the mid-term, when a) an over-arching\n            and well-conceived interim strategy is in place; b) donor\n            assistance is undertaken in a comprehensive and integrated\n            fashion within the context of that strategy; c) there is\n            close complementarity between the government's economic\n            recovery program and demobilization and reintegration\n            efforts; and d) the authorities are firmly committed to the\n            program's objectives and policies."}, "docdt": "2001-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
