restoring security.\n            The operation will be a quick disbursing credit, providing\n            the critical balance of payments, and budgetary support to\n            partly finance the foreign exchange, and budgetary costs of\n            establishing all three dimensions of security, i.e.,\n            protective, socioeconomic, and, transparent governance. The\n            proceeds will allow the import of essential commodities -\n            food, petroleum, and, raw materials - required for\n            re-launching the economy. Local currency funds will enable\n            the provision of basic services, restoration of law and\n            order, and the necessary infrastructure, required in a post\n            conflict situation, in addition to contributing to\n            transitional safety nets for ex-combatants re-entering civil\n            life. The Credit will complement the support provided by the\n            European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the\n            British Department for International Development, and will\n            be implemented parallel to the Community Reintegration and\n            Rehabilitation Project. Regardless of possible risks, -\n            deterioration of the political situation, governmental unity\n            failure, and implementation delays due to capacity\n            weaknesses - the economic recovery, envisaged to curb\n            inflation, while maintaining a macroeconomic stability, far\n            outweighs the risks."}, "docdt": "2000-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
