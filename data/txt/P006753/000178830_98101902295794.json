It includes (a) a 523\n            km, single circuit 500 kV transmission line between the\n            Central and Atlantic regions, two terminal and two\n            intermediate substations, and (b) consultant services for\n            engineering, civilworks and supervision. Once completed, the\n            interconnection line will ease projected energy deficits\n            under adverse hydrological conditions by providing thermal\n            backup to the Central system. It will also contribute to\n            substantial fuel savings (amounting to over US$1.3 billion\n            in end-1976 prices over the life of the project, or about\n            US$160 million at present value) which will result from the\n            Atlantic system's having access to hydro-electricity\n            during periods of normal hydrology. The project is subject\n            to risks normally associated with construction of high\n            voltage lines in mountainous terrain, but adequate\n            safeguards have been taken to minimize them."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
