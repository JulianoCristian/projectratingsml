500 kV INTERCONNECTION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            Republic of Colombia
Executing Agency:    Interconexion Electrica, S.A. (ISA)
Amount:               US$50.0 million equivalent
Terms:               Repayment in 17 years, including 4 years of grace;
interest at 7.5% per annum.
Project
Description:       The project would achieve the long-standing objective
of interconnecting the country's major power systems.
It includes (a) a 523 km, single circuit 500 kV trans-
mission line between the Central and Atlantic regions,
two terminal and two intermediate substations, and
(b) consultant services for engineering, civil works and
supervision. Once completed, the interconnection line
would ease projected energy deficits under adverse
hydrological conditions by providing thermal backup to
the Central system. It would also contribute to sub-
stantial fuel savings (amounting to over US$1.3 billion
in end-1976 prices over the life of the project, or about
US$1150 million at present value) which would result from
the Atlantic system's having access to hydro-electricity
during periods of normal hydrology. The project is
subjesct to risks normally associated with construction of
high voltage lines in mountainous terrain, but adequate
safeguards have been taken to minimize them.
Estimated Cost:                                  Local      Foreign       Total

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A
500 kV INTERCONNECTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of US$50.0 million to help
finance the 500 kV Interconnection Project. The loan would have a term
of 17 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7.5% per annum.
The Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) is considering a proposed US$40.0
million equivalent loan to the Government, for a term of 30 years, including
10 years of grace, at interest of 2% per annum, to finance part of the cost of
the project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The latest economic report on Colombia (1548-CO) was distributed
to the Executive Directors in May .1977. It assesses current developments and
provides a medium-term perspective of the Colombian economy. An updating
report is being prepared and is scheduled for distribution to the Executive
Directors in August 1978. Country data sheets are provided in Annex 1.
Background
3.        During the past two decades substantial structural transformation
has taken place in the Colombian economy. The country has made impressive
progress in the transition from a predominantly rural and agricultural
economy made up of largely self-contained regions to a more integrated urban
industrial economy oriented increasingly toward international trade. This
broadening of the country's productive base has been accompanied by rapid
growth of nontraditional exports and development of a modern sector which
relies to a considerable extent on imported inputs. From 1967 to 1974 GDP
rose by an average of 6.5% per annum in real terms, well above the historical
average of less than 5% (1950-67). Accelerated economic growth coupled with
a decline in population growth brought about a rapid increase in per capita
incomes. Increased investment and relaxation of the foreign exchange con-
straint were the major factors responsible for this acceleration in growth.
Merchandise exports expanded more than four-fold during this period, and,
most significantly, nontraditional exports became an increasingly important
source of foreign exchan,ge earnings, in large part compensating for the slow
growth of receipts from coffee exports. Much of this increase in non-
traditional exports was the result of both product and market diversifica-
tion attributable to the Government's export promotion program. Substantial
medium- and long-term capital inflows to the public and private sectors for
1/   Substantially unchanged from President's Report, Second Cali Water
Supply and Sewerage Project (Report No. P-2169-CO).



development projects helped sustain investment levels and enabled Colombia
to maintain the favorable structure of its external debt. However, despite
the substantial progress made during the past two decades, Colombia still
has a long way to go on the road toward modernization; it still is
essentially an underdeveloped country with a limited modern sector super-
imposed on a broad, traditional and poor base.
4.        When the present Government took office in August 1974, the country
was faced with a generally deteriorating economic situation--weakening balance
of payments, loss of self-sufficiency in petroleum production, accelerating
inflation, deterioration of the public finances, and reduced public invest-
ment. GDP growth showed signs of slowing and unemployment was increasing,
especially in the urban areas, reaching a peak of 13% in 1974. As a con-
sequence, the new administration moved rapidly to introduce an economic
stabilization program along with a set of reforms aimed at restoring the basis
for long-term economic growth. In.line with these goals, it initiated basic
reforms of the fiscal, monetary and price systems.
5.        To help strengthen the public finances, the new Government undertook
a comprehensive tax reform designed to achieve a substantial improvement in
the progressivity and elasticity of the tax system. Steps were also taken to
correct major distortions which existed in the price system. Price controls
on a number of important agricultural products were removed, thereby providing
greater stimulus for increasing farm production. Far-reaching modifications
in petroleum pricing policy aimed at regaining self-sufficiency in production
of crude petroleum by improving incentives for exploration and exploitation
were introduced. Concurrently, measures were taken to reduce the subsidy on
local consumption of petroleum products, with the dollar equivalent price of
gasoline being raised in successive steps by 150% between August 1975 to
January 1977.
6.        Economic growth slowed in 1975 and 1976, with real GDP increasing
by less than 5% in both years. This was the result of the stabilization
measures adopted at the end of 1974, the effects of the world recession,
reduced private investment, and, in 1976, a poor harvest stemming from adverse
weather conditions. The stabilization program succeeded in reducing inflation
from 27% in 1974 to 18% in 1975, but the expansionary impact of rising inter-
national reserves caused by higher coffee prices and shortages of basic food
items produced an acceleration of inflation to 26% in 1976. Private invest-
ment declined in real terms during this period as a consequence of attempts to
stabilize the economy through tighter fiscal and monetary measures. Public
sector revenues and savings were strengthened as a result of the tax reform
and of increased revenue from coffee export taxes. The balance of payments
improved substantially in 1976, mainly as a result of an increasing trade
surplus caused by higher world coffee prices. Consequently Colombia's
net international reserves rose by nearly threefold, from US$437 million
in 1974 to US$1,166 million in 1976.
Recent Economic Performance
7.        Growth and employment picked up significantly in 1977, largely
as a result of increased internal demand generated by the income effects of



- 3 -
exceptionally high export receipts from coffee. GDP is estimated to have
increased by 5.4%. This higher level of growth was distributed evenly over
all sectors of the economy except non-coffee agriculture which was affected
by the continuation of the severe drought which began in the second half of
1976. High world coffee prices during 1977 produced a record trade surplus
and the balance of payments registered an overall surplus for the year of
US$686 million. By year end, Colombia's net international reserves stood at
US$1,852 million, equivalent to seven months' imports, the highest level in
the country's history. Increased export receipts from coffee contributed to
a further strengthening of public finances over that which had occurred in
1975-76. Increased receipits from taxes on coffee exports caused a substantial
increase in the current su,rplus of the Central Government, more than off-
setting unexpected slower growth in some of the country's other major taxes.
8.        Expansion of coffee earnings combined with the shortages of basic
food items led to an unprecedented-acceleration of inflation during the
first half of 1977. For tlhe twelve month period ending in June 1977 infla-
tion reached 45%. In an attempt to reduce inflationary pressure the Govern-
ment introduced a number of fiscal and monetary measures aimed at curbing
growth of coffee producers disposable income, at further strengthening public
finances and at slowing the growth of the monetary aggregates. Legal reserve
requirements were increased, limits were placed on external borrowing, and
Central Bank rediscounts were reduced. The coffee retention tax rate was
doubled from 23% to 46%, and the system of delayed payments to coffee pro-
ducers was used to further limit growth of coffee producers' disposable in-
come. In order to increase aggregate supply and stem the rapid accumulation
of foreign exchange reserves, import duties were reduced and the import
licensing system was liberalized. In an effort to curb upward pressure on
prices, the authorities temporarily discontinued the policy of periodic
adjustments in the foreign exchange rate and in prices of petroleum products.
The last two measures were only a temporary expedient to break the infla-
tionary spiral. From July 1977, the Government has resumed periodic exchange
rate adjustments and in January 1978 increased the price of gasoline by 20%.
The Government intends to continue to pursue policies that maintain Colombia's
international competitiven,ess and that help regain petroleum self-sufficiency
(paragraph 25).
9.        Another conflict between short-term and long-term objectives exists
in the Government's interest rate policies. To avoid cost push effects,
nominal interest rates were frozen during the period of accelerating inflation
and real interest rates declined rapidly and became sharply negative. As a
consequence there was a growing unwillingness on the part of the public to
hold medium- and long-term financial assets, and investment funds had to be
increasingly allocated by cumbersome administrative controls. The problem
has become less serious as inflation has abated, but will require further
attention by the Government.
10.       The stabilization measures taken earlier in the year, the gradual
decline of world coffee prices from June 1977 on, and the availability of
more ample agricultural supplies on the domestic market resulting from both
improved weather and increased imports, produced a dramatic slowdown in



-4-
inflation in the second half of 1977. For the full year 1977, inflation was
reduced to 29%. Further declines in the rate of inflation are expected
this year as the Government maintains tight fiscal and monetary policies.
Additionally, declines in international coffee prices and rapid increases
in imports are expected to further reduce inflationary pressures from the
external sector.  Prospects for this year's agricultural output appear good,
and the Government is prepared to increase food imports substantially if
needed.
Development Strategy and Prospects
11.       The Government's development strategy, embodied in the 1975-78
development plan, aims at creating the conditions necessary for substantially
increasing employment opportunities, particularly for the poorest segments of
the population. It provides incentives for private sector investment in the
least developed areas of the country and for the use of more labor intensive
production techniques. Public sector investment specified in the Plan concen-
trates on expanding and improving infrastructure and on socially oriented
projects designed to alleviate rural and urban poverty. This includes compre-
hensive integrated rural development and nutrition programs which directly
benefit the lowest income groups of the population. Because of the importance
of commercial agriculture in generating employment and expanding exports,
Colombia's development plan assigns a high priority to providing farmers
with credit and technical services required to increase output. In order
to alleviate urban poverty, the Plan places emphasis on reducing migration
to the cities by increasing employment in agriculture and through provision
of improved services in slums of Colombia's major cities. These efforts
are being complemented by policies and programs to encourage the development
of small- and medium-scale enterprises and to decentralize industry away
from the three largest cities. Special priority is given to the development
of domestic energy sources to reduce the country's growing dependence on
imported oil.
12.       In the past three years substantial progress has been made in
carrying out this strategy despite the economic dislocations occasioned by the
world recession and the need to concentrate on short-term economic management.
Most of the Government's development efforts during this period have focussed
on improving the standard of living of the poorest 50% of the population, with
a substantial share of the benefits of public sector expenditures accruing to
this segment of the population. Provision of improved social services has
been a major objective of the current administration. This is reflected in
the increase in expenditures on education, health, water and sewerage, which
rose from 33% of total expenditures in 1974 to 37% in 1976. Preliminary
estimates show an even higher share spent on such programs in 1977.
13.       Projections of Colombia's energy balance indicate an expanding
deficit which could reach significant proportions by the early 1980s. To
avoid the constraint on growth that shortages of energy would entail, the
Government is giving high priority to the development of alternative energy
sources. Major projects are being developed to expand hydroelectric power
generation and incentives are being provided private companies for accele-
rated exploration and exploitation of the country's hydrocarbon potential.



Coal and natural gas are expected to provide an increasing contribution to
the country's energy needs in the future. An energy development program,
which would nearly triple power generation by 1986, has been drawn up by
the Government, with estimated investment requirements of between US$6.0 and
US$8.0 billion in constant 1976 prices. Given the long gestation periods
of power projects, their etxecution must be initiated without delay if energy
constraints on future growth are to be avoided.
14.       The Government is making a major effort to accelerate growth of the
agricultural and industrial sectors. In the past, Colombia has been largely
self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs. However, an increasing food deficit is
projected for the years ahead in the absence of major advances in food pro-
duction. The Government is attempting to meet these needs through integrated
rural development programs directed towards small farmers, through expanded
farm credit, research, extension and marketing facilities and through improved
farm management practices, including farm investment planning. Industry has
been singled out as the leading growth sector for the future and the Government
has adopted exchange rate, fiscal incentive, credit allocation, and locational
policies intended to assure that the sector fulfills its role as a major con-
tributor to employment growth.
15.       Based on its strong resource base and its high level of international
reserves, Colombia should be able to sustain annual real growth of no less than
6% over the period 1978-82. Private sector investment is expected to recover
as inflation subsides and fiscal and monetary policies are eased. Public
sector investment is expected to increase as restraints on such spending are
lifted and major energy projects enter the execution stage. Non-inflationary
increases in public sector investment spending depends to a large degree on
continuing government efforts to maintain high levels of public sector savings.
In this regard, timely and adequate adjustments of tariffs on public services
is especially important, and the Government has already gone a long way in
the adoption of such policies.
16.       Less buoyant terms of trade as world coffee prices decline from
the high 1977 level and rapidly increasing imports to meet the requirements
of expanding investment are expected to lead to a renewed widening of the
resource balance beginning in 1978. Assuming that economic growth accele-
rates in the industrialized countries and that appropriate incentives--
particularly continuation of periodic exchange rate adjustments--are provided,
nontraditional exports should resume the high rate of growth achieved in the
early 1970s. Colombia is projected to require gross capital inflows of about
US$3.7 billion during the five year period 1978-82, of which US$340 million
should be disbursed from commitments made through the end of 1976. This
inflow would enable Colombia to maintain an adequate level of foreign ex-
change reserves during the period. A significant increase in capital require-
ments is expected in the early 1980s when major additional projects in the
energy sector will have to be initiated. To achieve these targets, annual
gross capital inflow will have to increase from US$600 million in 1976 to
over US$1.0 billion in 1982.



-6-
While about half of Colombia's capital inflow is expected to be provided
by official multilateral and bilateral sources, financing from commercial
sources is expected to become increasingly important during the period
as Colombia gains greater access to international capital markets.
17.       Colombia's public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$3.3 billion at the end of 1976, or about US$2.4 billion
excluding undisbursed commitments. The Bank/IDA share of this external
debt was 28.5% and is expected to decline to about 25% by 1982. Although
the public debt service ratio fell during the past two years as export
growth accelerated, this ratio is projected to increase from 9.5% in
1976 to about 11% by 1982. Balance of payments prospects beyond 1980 will
depend among other factors on the timely development of domestic energy
sources and on progress made in executing several natural resource-based
export oriented projects currently under preparation. As a developing country,
it is normal to expect Colombia to be a net capital importer, i.e. to have a
deficit in its balance of payments on current account. However, to avoid an
excessive growth in this deficit over the next few years, careful management
of internal demand will be required. Given such management, it should be
possible to prevent the external sector from again becoming a constraint
on economic growth, and to maintain Colombia's present creditworthiness
for external borrowing of substantial amounts on conventional terms.
PART II: WORLD BANK OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
18.       The proposed loan, the 73rd to be made to Colombia, would bring the
total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,763.2 million (net of cancella-
tions). Of this amount, US$1,170.3 million is now held by the Bank; IDA made
one credit of US$19.5 million for highways in Colombia in 1961. Disbursements
have been completed on 46 loans and the IDA credit. IFC has made effective
investments and underwriting commitments of US$53.7 million in 24 enterprises
and now holds US$28.1 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and the IDA credit as of March 31, 1978, and IFC investments as of
March 31, 1978. The Annex also contains summaries on the execution of the
23 on-going projects.
19.       Since FY68, Bank lending in Colombia has become more diversified
and has been concentrated on production-oriented programs and activities which
carried social as well as economic benefits. Eight of the eleven agricultural
loans have been made since then, seven of the ten loans for industry, all
three loans in the education sector and all six loans for water supply and
sewerage. This compares with only seven loans since FY68 in the power and
transport sectors.
20.       Bank lending to Colombia in FY77 consisted of loans for rural devel-
opment, agricultural credit, telecommunications, highways and small-scale
industry, totalling US$281 million equivalent. In addition to the proposed
project, the FY78 program includes the recently approved loans for nutrition



- 7 -
improvement, water and sewerage and urban development, and proposed loans for
power generation (being considered simultaneously) and industry. Work is also
under way in development finance companies, further urban development, water
supply and slum improvement, transportation, mining, power, including rural
electrification, and small farm development for possible consideration by the
Executive Directors during the next two years.
21.       The proposed Bank lending conforms closely with the Government's
development strategy. To help Colombia develop domestic sources of energy, a
substantial part of the proposed lending would be for hydro-power. The Bank
would also assist the development of coal mines, which hold potential in
helping Colombia meet part of its energy requirements. Bank involvement in
the energy sector would help mobilize additional external financing as some of
the projects would require co-financing. Other future loans would finance
agriculture and industry to assist the Government in its efforts to raise
overall productivity, incomne and employment and to strengthen and diversify
exports. Closely related to these objectives would be the proposed Bank
lending for transport infriastructure in more backward areas of the country to
integrate them into the modiern economy. In this context, we are proceeding
with a project to improve domestic airports. Finally, we are preparing a
relatively large number of loans in support of the Government's efforts to
help the lowest 50% of the Colombian population.  The nutrition project, the
proposed urban development and slum improvement project, and the proposed
water supply and sewerage projects are principally designed to improve the
poor's standard of living.
22.       The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in Annex I.
While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about 75% of total external financing to
Colombia in the 1961-72 period, their share has decreased since then to
approximately 40%. Like the Bank, IDB and AID have given increased emphasis
to social projects. For instance, the IDB has assisted projects in low cost
housing, urban and rural development, agrarian reform, university education,
water supply, and land erosion control; in the future IDB proposes to assist
Colombia in its plans to develop sources of domestic energy and to expand the
activity of the productive sectors to help generate increased employment. AID
has supported programs in education, urban development and small farm develop-
ment. More recently, it has moved to small project loans aimed chiefly at
improving the distribution of income. It is expected to phase out its aid
program in Colombia in 1979 with the commitment of a US$6 million nutrition
loan.
PART III: THE ENERGY SECTOR AND POWER REQUIREMENTS
Energy Resources and Requirements
23.       Colombia is endcwed with substantial primary energy resources
(hydropower, natural gas, petroleum and coal), the most promising of which is
hydropower, estimated at aL potential 100 GW, of which only 2.3% have been
developed to date. Coal resources have been little explored, but reserves



-8-
are estimated to range from 20-40 billion metric tons, at which level they
would be the largest in Latin America. A recent discovery of natural gas in
the Guajira Peninsula, amounting to 3.5 trillion cubic feet, has brought proven
reserves to a level well above 5 trillion cubic feet. On the other hand,
because of insufficient exploration, known reserves of crude oil have fallen
and are estimated to amount to less than nine years of 1976 output. However,
only one of Colombia's nine sedimentary basins (the Magdalena River Valley)
has been explored on a systematic basis, although the state oil company,
ECOPETROL, in association with foreign oil companies, is now exploring other
basins. Additionally, investigation of nuclear, geo-thermal and solar energy
is underway.
24.       Since 1965, output of primary energy has lagged behind overall
economic growth, mainly because of declining crude oil output. By 1975,
production of crude (321 trillion Btu) had fallen to 78% of 1965 output and
72% of the 1970 level. While over 1965-75 total energy output increased by
3.6%, from 603 trillion Btu to 625 trillion Btu, energy consumption increased
by almost 80%, rising from 271 trillion Btu to 489 trillion Btu. (Exports and
losses account for the difference between production and consumption figures.)
By 1976, hydrocarbon imports exceeded exports by US$35.6 million equivalent.
Projections of Colombia's energy balance indicate an expanding deficit that
could reach significant proportions in the early 1980s and become a constraint
on economic growth (paragraph 13).
Energy Development Objectives and Strategy
25.       As stated, the Government's objective is to overcome the energy
deficit by developing domestic energy sources and by promoting rational use of
them. To this end, it has adopted several measures. First, it has recast its
hydrocarbon pricing and regulation policy to stimulate output of petroleum,
natural gas and coal. Foreign oil companies have reacted favorably to these
measures and have initiated new explorations.  Second, CARBOCOL, a Government
agency established to develop the country's coal resources, has concluded
contracts with various foreign companies to undertake exploration and develop-
ment of several coal fields, particularly the largest, El Cerrejon, in the
Guajira region. Third, considerable substitution of gas for petroleum products
in industry and thermal power generation is being carried out on the Atlantic
Coast. Fourth, a program for expansion of power generation and transmission
facilities to meet forecast demand over the 1977-84 period has been drawn up
(paragraphs 33 and 34). Fifth, the Government has concluded a contract with
the French Minatome Group to explore the country's uranium potential. Lastly,
the Government proposes to charge the full cost of energy to consumers and, in
this way, self-generate an important share of the financial resources required
for investment in the sector.
The Power Market, Service Levels and Institutional Framework
26.       Electric power is the fastest-growing form of energy in Colombia.
Its share of total energy consumption has risen from 19% in 1960 to 24% in
1976. Colombia's installed capacity at the end of 1976 was 3,300 MW, includ-
ing self production; hydro stations account for 68% of total energy generated.



-9-
Since 1967, production of electricity has been growing at an annual rate of
10.5%, i.e., one and three-fourths times as fast as than the growth rate of
GDP. Power sales have also been rising rapidly (9.2% per annum since 1972).
Annual per capita electricity consumption stands at 599 kWh. 1/ Households
(42% of the total), industry (35%) and commerce (13%) are the major electricity
users.
27.       About 60% of Colombia's 24.2 million population has electricity.
The urban population, in 1977 estimated to be about 70% of the population, has
greater access to electricity. 2/ In 1976, for example, 85% of households in
large cities (population 50,000 or more) had electrical service while in rural
towns (population between 50-2,500) the corresponding figure was 36%; in other
rural areas, 16%. With the assistance of external lenders, the Government is
carrying out programs to increase the supply of electricity to rural areas.
28.       The Ministry of Mines and Energy is charged with formulating national
policy for power generation, transmission and distribution. In defining invest-
ment priorities, it shares responsibility with the National Planning Department
(DNP). The Government cannot enforce its policies directly on the municipally-
controlled power companies, but Interconexion Electrica, S.A. (ISA), a generating
and transmission company controlled by the largest municipal power companies
and by the Government-owned national power companies provides a mechanism for
reaching agreement on ma;jor issues affecting the sector (paragraphs 29 and 51).
29.       The developmenit of Colombia's power sector has been assisted by the
gradual consolidation of isolated facilities into regional systems and the
interconnection of these systems to facilitate development of low-cost hydro
resources. Under the proposed project, the North Atlantic system will be tied
into the national grid, thus completing the interconnection of the country's
major systems. The entities which provide electricity service comprise:
(a) independent municipal companies, of which the largest are
Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas
Publicas de Medellin (EPM), and Empresas Municipales de Cali
(EMCALI);
(b) entities under the National Government, the most important
of which are Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca (CVC),
Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica (CORELCA), and
Instituto Colombiano de Energia Electrica (ICEL), all of
which have numerous local subsidiaries; and
(c) ISA, the shareholders of which are EEEB, EPM, CVC, CORELCA
and ICEL.
1/   This figure does not take account of losses.
2/   Residents of cities with 2,500 or more inhabitants.



- 10 -
30.       Public utility tariffs are regulated by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas
de Servicios Publicos (JNT) in the DNP. JNT, which was established in the late
sixties with Bank support, has the power to approve requests from the power
companies for tariff increases. The power companies, however, are free to set
rates lower than those approved by JNT and have sometimes done so.
Power Development and its Financing
31.       Colombia's power sector has developed rapidly.  Between 1950-1977
installed generating capacity increased by 3,000 MW or thirteenfold. A sub-
stantial part of this expansion was financed with internal cash generation
(in the case of the large municipal companies, about 40% of total capital
outlays) and with contributions from the National Treasury, chiefly to ICEL,
CVC and CORELCA. The Bank and IDB were the main source of foreign financing
for the power sector (US$607 million equivalent combined), although in recent
years suppliers' credits increased their participation. From 1971 onwards,
power rate adjustments lagged behind cost increases and the companies' finances
deteriorated. As a result, construction of new works was delayed and the
operating efficiency of the companies suffered. Particularly affected was the
renovation of subtransmission and distribution networks, resulting in increased
energy losses.
32.       Beginning with 1975, rate adjustments have been accelerated, with
average yearly increases through 1977 marginally exceeding average annual
inflation. Investment outlays have once again increased and in 1975 totalled
US$187.6 million equivalent, i.e., 31% over the preceding year. The Govern-
ment and the major power companies have initiated a program of tariff increases
with the aim of achieving and maintaining satisfactory rates of return on
revalued assets. This should generate an adequate portion of investment funds
for planned expansion. In line with this, average tariff levels in companies
accounting for the bulk of sales in the sector have been increased by some 37%
for 1978, with further increases of 33% already approved for 1979.
Power Requirements and Proposed Investments
33.       Over 1977-84, power requirements in the interconnected system are
projected to grow at 10.6% per annum, i.e. slightly faster than in the past.
To meet this demand, about 4,300 MW in effective generating capacity would
have to be added to the present system; of this, about 540 MW were completed
in 1977 and 1,500 MW are under construction.
34.       Investments in generation and transmission during 1977-84 are
expected to amount to about Col$250 billion in current prices (about US$5
billion in 1976 prices), some 60% of which would be foreign exchange. This
includes the start of construction of projects that will form part of the
1985-90 expansion program. To provide for an orderly expansion of the sector,
the Government and ISA have agreed under the San Carlos I Project to prepare a
Power Sector Development Master Plan covering the period 1980-90 in detail,
and 1991-2000 in more general terms.



- 11 -
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
35.       Since 1950, the Bank has made 18 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling US$350 million. Sixteen loans have assisted the expansion of
generating capacity in the systems serving Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Cartagena,
Bucaramanga, and Manizales. The most recent loan (874-CO, 1973) included
expansion of electricity distribution to low income areas. In addition, the
Bank is currently supporting rural electrification under the Integrated
Rural Development Project (1352-CO, 1977).
36.       ISA has received two Bank loans, totalling US$70.3 million. The
first (575-CO, 1968) was to interconnect the central regional systems and
was completed ahead of schbedule at lower-than-estimated cost. Remaining
funds were used to construct an additional transmission line which began
operation in 1976. The second loan (681-CO, 1970) was used to construct
ISA's first generating facility, Ghivor I, which came into operation two
years behind schedule in 1977, with a US$86 million cost overrun (for further
details see Annex II, page 3).
37.       One of the objectives of Bank assistance has been the strengthening
of power sector institutions and finances. Through the late sixties, Bank
efforts at institutional strengthening were most successful in the cases of
EEEB and EPM. The late siLxties also saw the creation of two new institutions,
ISA and JNT, in which the Bank played a critical role. The establishment of
the central interconnected system has promoted economic efficiency and, at the
same time, stimulated greater cooperation among the regional power companies.
The proposed project would complement this effort and would contribute to
more economical operation and development of the national power system.
38.       Bank attempts to strengthen sector finances have had mixed results,
chiefly because of the Government's reluctance, prior to 1975, to press
for tariff increases under inflationary conditions and the unwillingness of
local authorities to increase rates to compensate for rising costs. However,
the Government, ISA and the shareholders intend to maintain in the future
tariffs at an adequate level in order to finance an important share of
investments from internal cash generation and have already taken steps
toward this goal (paragraph 32).
39.       Past Bank lending to Colombia's power sector was reviewed in the
OED report entitled "Bank Operations in Colombia, an Evaluation" (Report
No. Z-18) of May 25, 1972. The report concluded that Bank financing was
successful in assisting t]he power companies to develop hydroelectric plants
at lower unit cost than t]hey otherwise would have been able to do. In turn,
this permitted greater urban coverage as well as cheaper and more reliable
electricity supply to industry. The report commended Bank efforts in the
establishment of JNT and the central interconnected system which facilitated
the rational development of the power sector. Among other things, the report
recommended that in the future the Bank pay increased attention to the compa-
nies' financial planning, tariff structures and energy losses.

PART IV: THE PROJECT
Background and Objectives
40.       The project, prepared by ISA with the assistance of consultants,
forms part of its 1977-82 Power Expansion Program and would link the country's
two largest power systems, the 100% thermal North Atlantic and the predomi-
nantly hydro Central systems. The project was appraised by a Bank mission
which visited Colombia in March-April 1977. Supplementary work was under-
taken by missions which visited Colombia in August and September of 1977.
Negotiations were held in Washington during the weeks of March 6 and 13, 1978,
with a Colombian delegation led by Mr. Gabriel Turbay, Director of Public
Credit.
41.       Project objectives are to:  (a) promote efficient operation and
development of the national power system, (b) permit lower cost expansion
of the national power system, and (c) support the Government's policy on
reduction of fuel subsidies.
Description
42.       The project comprises construction of a single circuit, 523 km long
500 kV transmission line with two terminal and two intermediate substations
aggregating 1,200 MVA, and a shunt-reactive compensation system.
43.       Transmission Line.  The 210 km southern section of the transmission
line between the San Carlos and Cerro Matoso substation, would cross a moun-
tainous region at elevations of up to 2,000 m over its first 130 km. Over
the 313 km northern section between Cerro Matoso and Sabanalarga the line
would follow slightly rolling terrain as far as the Chinu substation (km 342
from San Carlos), then continuing over similar terrain to a marshy area (at
Dique Canal) which it would cross for a distance of 15 km. The last part of
the line would be on solid and flat terrain.
44.       Substations.  The San Carlos substation would have a transformer
bank consisting of six 75 MVA single-phase units, with a 75 MVA reserve unit.
At Sabanalarga the transformer bank would consist of three autotransformers of
150 MVA and one reserve unit. The transformer capacity in both substations
could be doubled at a later stage, for full utilization of the transmission
capacity of the line (900 MVA). A three phase autotransformer of 150 MVA would
be installed in the Cerro Matoso and Chinu substations.
45.       Voltage Selection.  The Colombian firm of Salgado, Melendez y
Asociados (SAMEL), ISA's consultants for the 500 kV Interconnection line,
carried out the studies to determine the service voltage for the future
national interconnection network. The voltage of 500 kV was selected as the
most economic. In its comprehensive system design study, SAMEL was assisted
by Kennedy and Donkin (UK) which jointly with Westinghouse (USA) carried out
detailed transient-switching studies. ISA has also engaged SAMEL, assisted by
Kennedy and Donkin, for detailed design and supervision of the line and
substations. At the same time, ISA proposes to hire the services of Integral



- 13 -
(a Colombian consulting firm) to assist in the supervision and administration
of project works. The hiring of qualified consultants for project works would
be a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 7.01(d) of the Loan Agreement
and Section 2.02 of the P'roject Agreement).
46.       Land Acquisition.  ISA, which has not previously encountered major
problems in acquiring right-of-way for construction of its transmission lines,
has prepared a satisfactory program for obtaining permits to ensure that the
contractor can enter the various work sites at the appropriate time. ISA has
already acquired the lands on which the substations would be built and expects
to complete the land acquisition program by June 30, 1979 (Section 2.04 of
the Project Agreement).
Cost and Financing
47.       Total project cost is estimated at US$167.2 million equivalent, of
which US$100.0 million equivalent correspond to the foreign exchange component.
48.       The proposed loan of US$50.0 million equivalent would finance 30%
of total project cost, i.e., 50% of the project's foreign exchange cost. The
remaining foreign exchange costs would be financed by a proposed US$40 million
equivalent loan from KfW and suppliers' credits of US$10 million equivalent.
All local costs, US$67.2 million, would be provided by the Government. Retro-
active financing of up to US$200,000 is proposed for engineering services
paid after January 1, 1977 (Schedule 1, paragraph 4 of the Loan Agreement).
49.       The Bank loan would finance the total foreign exchange component of
the transmission line and related consulting services. KfW would finance
part of the foreign exchange component of the substations, with remaining
foreign exchange requirement covered by suppliers' credit. Satisfactory
arrangements for the balance of foreign exchange financing would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan (Section 7.01 of Loan Agree-
ment).
The Borrower and Direct Beneficiaries
50.       The borrower for the proposed Bank and KfW loans would be the
Government, and the main beneficiary would be CORELCA, which would rely on
the 500 kV line for hydro energy to replace fuel-based generation. (ISA's
other shareholders would also benefit, through reduced investments made
possible by pooling their reserve capacity with CORELCA's.) The Government
would cover all debt service under the project and, in this way, assist the
power companies in meeting the heavy financial obligations which they are
confronting in connection with required investments to meet forecast demand.
By December 31, 1981, approximately six months after completion of the works,
the ownership and operation of the transmission line and substations would be
assumed by ISA, at no cost (Section 3.02 of the Loan Agreement).



- 14 -
51.       ISA.  The entity, established in 1967, is a stock corporation
formed to interconnect the systems of its shareholders and to construct,
own and operate new generating plants required for the interconnected system.
It is governed by a Board of Directors, representing the five major share-
holders (EEEB, EPM, CVC, CORELCA and ICEL). Day to day operations are managed
by a General Manager (appointed by the Board), assisted by four departments
(Technical, Operations, Finance and Administration). ISA has competent staff
and its pay levels are satisfactory.
52.       ISA's bylaws have been recently amended to the effect that in future
the entity will:
(i) be responsible for planning expansion of the interconnected system;
(ii) construct and own all future plants in the system, except for
plants of regional interest which may be undertaken by the share-
holders after approval by ISA; and
(iii) set tariffs to achieve adequate annual returns on its revalued
assets.
As a result of these revisions, ISA will play an important role as a major
planner, coordinator and dispatch agency in the power sector.
53.       Between 1972 and mid-1977, ISA's assets comprised only a 230 kV
transmission system (financed under 575-CO). In September 1977, ISA's first
generation asset, the Chivor I power station (681-CO), entered into operation.
Thus, the company has been unable to generate a significant amount of funds
and has relied upon shareholders' contributions to finance its investments.
The shareholders, however, often were late in their contributions to ISA
because of their financial difficulties, a consequence of inadequate power
rates. Since 1975 this situation has changed and in the future the share-
holders propose to obtain a satisfactory rate of return on revalued assets.
This should allow them to make timely contributions to ISA. For its part,
ISA's objective is to earn a rate of return on its assets (other than the
proposed project) of 5.5% in 1978, 8% in 1979, 9% in 1980, 11% in 1981, and 9%
from 1982 onwards; and on the interconnection line to be constructed under the
project, 3% in 1982, 2% in 1983, 2.5% in 1984, 4% in 1985, 6% in 1986, and 9%
in 1987 (the first year of full utilization) and thereafter (Section 4.04 of
Project Agreement). Through the shareholder's contributions and internal cash
generation, ISA proposes to finance 36% of its 1978-82 investment program.
54.       CORELCA.  The entity is an autonomous corporation established in
1967, which became operational only in 1972. It is responsible for power
generation and transmission in seven departments on the Atlantic Coast and
sells bulk electricity to distributors ("electrificadoras"), which it partly
or wholly owns. CORELCA and the "electrificadoras" have an installed capacity
of 425 MW (all thermal) and serve about 184,000 consumers. CORELCA is com-
pleting construction and installation of (a 132 MW steam station). It is
administered by a seven-member Board of Directors and a Managing Director.



- 15 -
CORELCA has made a good beginning in the relatively short time it has existed;
its major weakness is thatL while the other power companies have been estab-
lished for sometime and have developed sufficient management and technical
expertise, CORELCA is in ithe midst of this process. It is expected that the
institutional strengthening program to be developed and carried out in connec-
tion with the San Carlos Project will permit CORELCA to develop its operational
capability faster.
55.       Since inception, CORELCA has experienced financial difficulties.
Its rate of return on revalued assets in 1977 was only 2.3%. The entity has
had to rely upon the National Treasury, including fuel subsidies, and borrow-
ings to finance operations and investments. The Government and CORELCA,
therefore, have decided t'hat the entity should strengthen its finances and
earn satisfactory rates of return on revalued assets. The proposed minimum
rates of return CORELCA is expected to obtain are: 4% in 1978, 5% in 1979
and 1980, 6% in 1981, 7% in 1982 and 9% thereafter. At the same time, the
Government has decided to reduce gradually the fuel subsidy to CORELCA, so
that by 1982, when the proposed project would be completed, CORELCA's fuel
cost would exceed the cost of energy purchased through the 500 kV Inter-
connection Line from the central system, which is mostly hydro-power (Section
4.03 of the Loan Agreement).
Implementation, Procurement and Disbursements
56.       ISA would be responsible for carrying out the project.  In accor-
dance with this, ISA and the Government would enter into a subsidiary agree-
ment, the finalization of which under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan
(Section 7.01(b) of the Loan Agreement).
57.       Procurement undier the proposed loan would be in accordance with
international competitive bidding consistent with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement. (Procurement under the proposed KfW financing would be through
unrestricted internationaLl competitive bidding.) Local bidders, who did not
bid on the transmission line contract, would receive a preference margin of
15% or the applicable customs duty (whichever is the lower) on the minor
equipment still to be procured. Bid documents and the bid evaluation
report for the transmissi-on line have been reviewed by the Bank and are
satisfactory. After Bank approval of the proposed loan, the contract would
be awarded, to a consortium comprising Sul Americana de Energia (Brazil),
Sociedad de Electrificaci'on (Venezuela) and Societa Anonima Electrificazone
(Italy). Project works would begin in the third quarter of 1978, and be
completed by April 1981.
58.       The loan would be disbursed over a three-year period.  Disbursements
would be made against (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures for civil works
and erection; (b) for equipment and materials, 100% of foreign expenditures or
94% of the ex-factory cost of locally-manufactured goods; and (c) for consul-
tant services, 100% of foreign expenditures or 50% of total expenditures. The
loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1982.



- 16 -
Benefits and Risks
59.       The proposed project would achieve the long-standing objective of
interconnecting the country's major power systems. Substantial fuel savings
(amounting to over US$1.3 billion in end-1976 prices over the life of the
project, or about US$160 million at present value) would be realized by
enabling the 100% thermally-based Atlantic system to substitute less expensive
hydro-based electricity from the Central system for fuel during periods of
normal hydrology. On the other hand, during dry periods the availability of
thermal capacity from the coastal system would assist in avoiding outages in
the rest of the predominantly-hydro, national system and would considerably
reduce otherwise required reserve capacity. Furthermore, the planned Cerro
Matoso nickel project (which has proven deposits of about 25 million tons of
high-grade nickel ore) would be the site of one of the line's intermediate
substations, which would provide electricity to the ferronickel smelters at
considerably lower cost than by building a separate transmission line to the
mine area.
60.       Comparison of alternative power development programs, using border
prices for construction, labor, operating and maintenance costs, including
fuel, indicate that the 500 kV interconnection line should be completed as
soon as possible. The return on investment, or the discount rate at which the
present value of the cost attributed to the project is equal to that of the
benefits over its life, is about 35%, based upon quantified: (a) costs, com-
prising the capital and operating cost of the interconnection line, together
with the cost of thermal energy transferred from the Atlantic to the Central
region; and (b) benefits, consisting of fuel cost savings and reduced reserve
capacity needed in the national system.
61.       The project is not subject to significant risks.  ISA has taken
adequate safeguards in design and would ensure the availability of sufficient
specialized staff to operate the line, the first of its kind in Colombia,
through a training program to be prepared by end-1978 (Section 3.04 of the
Project Agreement).
Ecology
62.       No environmental problems are anticipated as the line would cross
a partly mountainous rural area which has few inhabitants, little farming
activity and sparse woodlands. Compensation would be provided for any
property or crop damage and for rights-of-way. Radio and television inter-
ference will be minimized.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
63.       The Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and the Bank,
and the Project Agreement between ISA and the Bank, and the report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Bank's Articles
of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 17 -
64.       Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex
III. Additional conditions of effectiveness would be (a) the engagement of
qualified consultants for project works under satisfactory terms and condi-
tions (paragraph 45), (b) satisfactory arrangement for the balance of
foreign exchange financing for the project (paragraph 49), and (c) the execu-
tion of a satisfactory subsidiary agreement between ISA and the Government
(paragraph 56).
65.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
66.       I recommend thaLt the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
1.   Ln No. 680 Highways VI; US$32 million, June 1970.
Effective date: March 29, 197,1
Closing date:    original - November 30, 1974
current - November 30, 1978
The largest component of the project, the paving program, has
experienced considerable cost increases and delays. As of this writing, six
sections in the program are still under construction, requiring about 190 km
of paving. Project completion is now expected for end-1979. The other compon-
ents of the project were completed with much less delay. The Ministry of Public
Works is seeking ways of hastening project execution and strengthening the
performance of contractors.
2.  Ln No. 681 Chivor ELydroelectric Power; US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Effective date: September 1, 1970
Closing date:    Original - June 30, 1977
Current -  June 30, 1978
The project wcls completed and commercially operational in mid-1977,
two years behind schedu:Le, with a cost overrun of about US$86 million (65%).
The delay is mainly attcibutable to geological problems encountered during
construction of the dam and tunnel. The cost overruns resulted from these
geological problems, from higher than anticipated bids, and local and foreign
inflation.
3.   Ln No. 738 Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2 million, May 1971.
Effective date: December 29, 1971
Closing Date:    original - March 1, 1975
current - December 31, 1979
As of June 30, 1977, about 85% of the loan amount was disbursed.
Adequate tariff measures recently adopted will enable the utility to utilize
the remainder of the loan proceeds in further works, as originally contemplated.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

4.   Ln No. 741 Water Supply (Bogota II); US$88 million, May 1971.
Effective date: August 16, 1971
Closing Date:    June 30, 1980
Disbursements up to February 28, 1978, amounted to nearly 80% of this
loan. Slow progress in the construction of the vital Palacio - Rio Blanco Tunnel
is the main reason for the project's delay; the original contractor was replaced
by another firm which is performing satisfactorily.
5.   Ln No. 849 Irrigation (Atlantico II); US$5 million, June 1972.
Effective date: November 14, 1972
Closing Date:    March 31, 1978
The project is the second phase of a scheme to develop about 17,000
ha of seasonally inundated land for agricultural production. At the request
of the Government, US$2.8 million of the loan of US$5.0 million were cancelled
in February 1977. Work is continuing on additional feeder roads, tertiary
canal drains, waterfronts, land clearing, subsoiling and leveling. A second
contractor has defaulted and work on the main drainage canal has temporarily
stopped, though a new contract is expected to be signed soon. Settlement of
farmers within the project areas and the provision of technical assistance
and farm credit have been making inadequate progress. The Government is
carrying out a detailed review of the project in order to find a solution
to these problems.
6.   Ln No. 860 Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$9.1
million, October 1972.
Effective date: March 7, 1973
Closing Date:    original - September 30, 1976
current - September 30, 1978
As of February 28, 1978, about 60% of the loan amount was disbursed.
Management problems affected the initiation of the project, but progress has
since improved.
7.   Ln No. 874 Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; US$56 million,
January 1973.
Effective date: March 13, 1973
Closing Date:    December 31, 1979
The progress of the work has been generally satisfactory except for
delays in the resettlement of El Penol and Guatape villages because of the
villagers' reluctance to move into the new cities. This problem is now re-
solved and filling of the Santa Rita reservoir will be started by mid-1978,
three years behind schedule. The revised project cost is substantially above
appraisal estimate, mainly occasioned by higher cost of the works at El Penol
and Guatape. The Borrower experienced serious financial problems but recently
adopted tariff increases should allow it to overcome them.

8.   Ln No. 903 Development Finance Companies V; US$60 million, May 1973.
Effective date: November 9, 1973
Closing Date:    June 30, 1978
The loan is almost fully committed. Disbursements are expected to
be completed within the next few months.
9.  Ln No. 920 Education III; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Effective date: January 10, 1974
Closing Date:    original - June 30, 1977
current - December 30, 1979
The execution of the project had been suspended in mid-1975 pending
redefinition of sector priorities by the Government. Project execution resumed
in 1977 but suffered delays as a result of inadequate budgetary resources of
the Government. The Government is preparing a proposal to cancel a large
portion of the Loan.
10. Ln No. 926 Sixth Railway Project; US$25 million, August 1973.
Effective date: December 6, 1973
Closing Date:    original - June 30, 1976
current - June 30, 1978
Declines in freight traffic in 1975 and the first six months of
1976 (because of an economic slowdown and lower imports), combined with steep
cost increases, resulted in a deterioration of the railway's financial situa-
tion. Since then, the financial position of the railway has been improving as
a consequence of sharp increases of ton-km of freight traffic, and freight
tariff hikes of about 19% in 1976 and 50% in 1977. Improvements have been
registered in other areas although locomotive availability is severely con-
strained largely because of manufacturer defects in over 40% of 88 relatively
new locomotives. Efforts are underway to resolve this problem but early
resolution is not anticipated. Project works are progressing and a substantial
portion has been completed.
11. Ln No. 971 Preinvestment Studies Project; US$8 million, March 1974.
Effective date: June 27, 1974
Closing Date:    December 31, 1978
Commitments are proceeding at a satisfactory rate. The Bank has
approved 26 sub-projects.
12. Ln No. 1071 Small-Scale Industry; US$5.5 million, January 1975.
Effective date: May 20, 1975
Closing Date:    June 30, 1978
A change of management in Corporacion Financiera Popular (CFP),
the beneficiary institution, delayed the initiation of the project. Commit-
ments are now moving well and progress is satisfactory. The Bank agreed to
release the second tranche in view of CFP's satisfactory performance. The
loan is fully committed.

13. Ln No. 1072 Second Multi-City Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$27
million, January 1975.
Effective date: April 14, 1975
Closing Date:    June 30, 1980
There were substantial delays in making the eight subloans effective.
The last subloan (Barranquilla) was made effective on September 9, 1976.
After a slow start, project implementation is progressing satisfactorily in
most cities.
14. Ln No. 1073 Telecommunications III; US$15 million, January 1975.
Effective date: April 14, 1975
Closing Date:    December 31, 1978
Contracts for all Bank-financed goods have been awarded, and work
is proceeding satisfactorily.
15. Ln No. 1118 Caqueta Rural Settlement Project; US$19.5 million, June 1975.
Effective date: April 1, 1976
Closing Date:    October 31, 1979
The loan became effective on April 1, 1976, after a six-month delay.
Projection execution has proceeded rapidly and some of the lost time regained.
Road and bridge construction is well ahead of schedule (79 km have been
completed). School construction, however, is behind schedule, while the
credit program is lagging as a result of inadequate budgetary flaws.
16. Ln No. 1163 Cordoba 2 Agricultural Development Project; US$21 million,
September 1975.
Effective date: March 30, 1976
Closing Date:    December 31, 1980
A few months after effectiveness, the Government decided to give
responsibility for project civil works to another agency. This decision
delayed the initiation of the project. Implementation is now proceeding
satisfactorily, but still behind schedule.
17. Ln No. 1223 Sixth Development Finance Companies Project; US$80.0 million,
March 1976.
Effective date: September 1, 1976
Closing Date:    June 30, 1980
The loan is proceeding satisfactorily and is virtually fully committed.

18. Ln No. 1352 Integrated Rural Development Project; US$52.0 million,
January 1977.
Effective Date: August 26, 1977
Closing Date:    December 31, 1982
Works are now proceeding as scheduled.
19. Ln No. 1357 Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$64.0 million, February
1977.
Effective Date: September 6, 1977.
Closing Date:    December 31, 1981.
The loan is being committed faster than anticipated. Withdrawal
applications for US$3.1 million equivalent have recently been received.
20. Ln. No. 1450 Telecommtnications IV; US$60 million, July 1977.
Effective Date: October 3, 1977.
Closing Date:    June 30, 1982.
Works are proceeding as scheduled.
21. Ln. No. 1451 Second Smnall-Scale Industry Project; US$15 million,
September 1977.
Effective Date:  February 14, 1978.
Closing Date:    December 31, 1980.
22.  Ln. No. 1471 Highways VII; US$90 million, July 1977.
Effective Date:  November 28, 1977.
Closing Date:    December 31, 1982
The Rehabilitation Program is underway, about three months behind
schedule. Stabilization works are being carried out, with work totalling
US$35.4 million completed; conditions for disbursement of loan funds for
this program are expected to be fulfilled shortly. Implementation of the
maintenance program is in process, about six months behind schedule. Prepara-
tion of studies is proceeding satisfactorily.
23. Ln. No. 1487 Integralted. Nutrition Improvement Project; US$25 million,
September 1977.
Effective Date: March 9, 1978
Closing Date:    June 30, 1982
Works are proceeding rapidly and coordination among institutions
is effective.
