Highly satisfactory\n            was the Bank's performance, who gained efficiency\n            combining the preparation stage with that of two other\n            projects on the subjects of environmental technology, and\n            science/technical education, thus resulting in a clear\n            understanding of sector-related policy issues. The overall\n            borrower performance was satisfactory, with an impressive\n            performance by project institutions, erasing an early\n            \"unsatisfactory\" rating, related to a delayed\n            legal covenant compliance. It is therefore interesting to\n            note, as a lesson to be learned, that good working\n            relationships, stemming from frequent and detailed\n            supervision, combined with an efficient coordination by the\n            Ministry of Education, can lead not only to a successful\n            operation, but save a project, turning it around from an\n            unsatisfactory assessment."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
