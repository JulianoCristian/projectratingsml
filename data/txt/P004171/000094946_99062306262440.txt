IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROJECT
(Loan 3612-KO)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Environmental
Research and Education Project in Korea, for which Loan 3612-KO in the amount of
US$60 million equivalent was approved on June 3, 1993, signed on June 30, 1993, and
made effective on September 3, 1993.
The loan was closed on schedule on December 31, 1998. Final disbursement took
place on March 8, 1999. The Loan was fully disbursed with no cancellations.
The ICR was prepared by Ms. Carol Hau-Lai Ball, assisted by Ms. Ruth
Montague. The ICR was reviewed by Mr. Alan Ruby, Manager, EASHD, and Mr. Sri-
Ram Aiyer, Country Director, EACKF. The Borrower's evaluation summary is included
in an unedited form as Annex B.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's last supervision/completion
mission in October 28 to November 12, 1998, which visited the Ministry of Finance and
Economy, Ministry of Education (MOE), Supply Administration, Republic of Korea
(SAROK), Cheju National University, Colleges of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine,
Chungnam National University, Colleges of Agriculture and Life Science (CALS), and
Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University (SNU), and the National Instrumentation
Center for Environmental Management (NICEM). The information in this report is based
on materials in the Project Implementation Index File, Divisional Black Books, and
submissions from the Borrower dated February 9, 1999, and March 10, 1999, as well as
information received during the completion mission. The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by: (a) providing specific data upon request; and (b) contributing
views reflected in its own evaluation of the project's preparation and execution. No
comment (?) was provided on the draft ICR prepared by the Bank.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 3612-KO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
i.    The overall objective of the project was to assist in upgrading the capacity of
selected agricultural and veterinary colleges to undertake research into key environmental
problems, reinforce the environmental aspects of basic science programs in the colleges in
order to strengthen the training of environmental professionals and establish appropriate
arrangements for improving environment-related research and teaching programs.
Implementation Experience
ii.    Overall implementation was satisfactory. The Loan closed on schedule and was
fully disbursed with no cancellations and no cost overruns. Disbursements conformed to all
Bank procedures and included the use of Special Accounts. The allocation of the Loan
among disbursement categories was similar to the original estimates (Table 8A). The small
savings from the visiting expert category were spent on equipment and overseas training
and caused no deviations from the original project objectives. There were no overdue audit
reports at Loan Closing, and all other covenants were in full compliance.
iii.   All equipment and library materials and software were purchased in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Procurement of most of the specialized equipment was undertaken
by the Government of Korea's (GOK) experienced central procurement agency, the Supply
Administration, Republic of Korea (SAROK), using international competitive bidding
(ICB) procedures.
iv.   The only significant implementation problem  was the unforeseen freeze on
organizational changes in the GOK during the initial implementation stage which resulted
in a shortage of funds for the central research facility created under the project -- the
National Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management (NICEM). As a result, the
Bank's supervision mission of 1994 rated the project "unsatisfactory" (Table 13). By 1996,
however, NICEM had been established legally under Seoul National University (SNU) and
adequate budgets were being, and continue to be, provided. No shortages of funds were
experienced by the agricultural and veterinary colleges.
Results
v.    All project objectives were fully met or exceeded. The project has enhanced
research capabilities and teaching programs at the selected agricultural and veterinary
colleges, especially concerning issues affecting the rural environment (para. 7). Research



v
activities and publication of findings increased steadily over the project years and the results
are being used by relevant private enterprises (para. 10).
vi.   NICEM was successfully established at the Suwon campus of SNU and is now in
full operation (para. 8). Its laboratories are equipped with highly specialized research
equipment, and relevant written and computer materials are available at SNU's central
library. The Center is being used for research by the agricultural and veterinary colleges
and various small and medium private enterprises. It currently has a staff of 26 plus 10
graduate student assistants (para. 21). NICEM organizes relevant workshops and symposia
throughout the year.
vii.  In addition, two environmental review and advisory committees were established in
1993 under the Ministry of Education (MOE) - the Environmental Education Review
Committee (EERC) and the Environmental Research Advisory Committee (ERAC). They
ensure the continued relevance of environmental research and teaching in Korea. Two
research projects and a resulting book were completed by the committees during the project
years which provide useful guidelines for development of environmental research and
teaching programs (para.1 1).
Sustainabiity
viii.  The GOK's continuous support for this project and for the Environmental
Technology Development Project (Loan 3694-KO) indicate its clear awareness of Korea's
environmental problems and the importance of maintaining a balance of attention toward its
rural and urban environments.
ix.   Over the years, the GOK has enacted several wide-ranging laws to help protect
Korea's environment and conserve its national resources and has provided policy and
planning guidance on environmental issues by upgrading the Environmental Agency (EA)
to a Cabinet-level ministry. It also prosecutes environmnental offenders and enforces the
principle of "polluter pays" (para. 4). The GOK has thus made a long-term commitment to
solving Korea's environmental problems (para. 19).
x.    The research equipment financed by the project is well-maintained and managed
and is highly utilized, especially at NICEM where utilization rates are very high. The
national budget for 1999 provides funds for the operation and maintenance of this
equipment and for the purchase of new equipment for all higher education institutions in
Korea (para. 20).
xi.   The institutional development under the project of NICEM, EERC and ERAC was
successful and all are expected to continue their operations into the future. NICEM's
annual operating budgets from the GOK continue to increase, and it raises additional funds
from competitive grants, user fees and its own income generating activities. Both EERC
and ERAC are expected to continue to review and advise both the NICEM and the



vi
agricultural and veterinary colleges on their environment-related research activities and
teaching programs (paras. 21 and 22).
Bank Group Performance
xii.   Overall Bank performance was highly satisfactory. Efficiency and economies of
scale were gained through combining the preparation of two environment-related projects
with an education project (para. 24), and, as always in the education sector, by fielding a
single mission to supervise all the on-going education projects in Korea at the same time
(para. 25).
Borrower Performance
xiii. Overall Borrower performance was also satisfactory despite an unfavorable rating
during the initial stage of project implementation caused by the unforeseen freeze on
organizational changes in the GOK  (para. iv).  The impressive highly-satisfactory
performance by the institutions, especially NICEM, during the later years of
implementation made up for the time lost, and the Loan was 100% disbursed with no cost
or time overruns.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
xiv.  Overall project development objectives were successfully achieved. Performance
indicators (Table 6) were identified and monitored by the Bank during the 18 months
prior to Loan Closing. Most of the targets were met or exceeded. The research
capabilities of the project colleges of agriculture and veterinary sciences have been
enhanced, and research activities and publication of their findings have increased steadily
over the project years and are being used by related private enterprises (para. 10). A
centrally located common research facility, NICEM, was established and is in full
operation with adequate budgetary and financial support (paras. 9, 20 and 21).
Committees for review of research activities and teaching programs related to the
environment, EERC and ERAC, were established and continue to function (paras. 11 and
22).
xv.   Korea graduated from borrower status in June 1995; however, due to the recent
financial crisis in the East Asia region, the GOK has asked for some structural adjustment
and technical assistance loans.
xvi.  The lesson to be learned from this project is that frequent and detailed supervision
as well as good working relationships with the Borrower can save a project and even turn
around an "unsatisfactory" rating.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROJECT
(Loan 3612-KO)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    The broad aim of the project was to strengthen Korea's capacity to address rural environmental
issues, improved the teaching of its environmental programs and strengthen its environmental
research. The specific objectives of the project were to assist in upgrading the capacity of selected
agricultural and veterinary colleges to undertake research into key enviromnental problems; reinforce
the environmental aspects of basic science programs in the colleges in order to strengthen the training
of environmental professionals and establish appropriate arrangements for improving environment-
related research and teaching programs, the latter through the establishments of the National
Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management (NICEM), the Enviromnental Education
Review Committee (EERC), and the Environmental Research Advisory Committee (ERAC). The
Loan financed research and teaching equipment, library materials, and technical assistance including
visiting experts and overseas training.
Sectoral Development Objectives
2.    Korea's spectacular economic development over the last 30 years has had an environmental
cost. Rapid urbanization and industrialization and a restructuring of the agriculture sector has resulted
in rising levels of air, soil and water pollution, and a need to conserve cultivable land, forests and
fisheries.
3.    This project was developed along with another environment-related project financed by the
Bank -- the Environmental Technology Development Project (Loan 3694-KO), which tackled urban
environmental problems. This project focused on the problems of the rural environment, and therefore
helped to balance Korea's environmental efforts. Rural environment problems were caused mainly by
the pollution of soil and water from household and livestock waste and the increased use of
agrochemicals. The GOK realized the importance of alleviating enviroinental degradation through:
(i) the conservation of the soil and watershed of Korea's scarce cultivable land (21% of its total land
area), (ii) the effective management of its extensive forests (66%) through efficient harvesting and
replanting, reduction of pest damage and improved tree health, and (iii) protection of its fisheries.
Policy Issues
4.   In response to the increasing complexity of environmental issues and the need to alleviate
environmental degradation and manage waste disposal, the GOK over the years has created an
appropriate legal and institutional framework. The first major step was taken in 1977 with the
establishment of the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) under the Ministry of Health and
Social Affairs, and in 1978, the first major environmental statute in Korea -- the Enviromnent



2
Preservation Law -- was enacted. This law introduced a number of important regulatory devices such
as the promulgation of environmental standards, environmental monitoring and impact assessments
for new projects, and emission standards and control. To strengthen implementation of the law, the
EMB was upgraded in 1980 to the Environmental Administration (EA) with six regional
environmnental monitoring offices. In 1983, the GOK began prosecuting environmental offenders and
enforcing the principle of "polluter pays". EA was further upgraded to a Cabinet-level Ministry of
Environment (MOEN) in 1990 and the Basic Environmental Policy Law was enacted. This was
supported by separate laws dealing with specific problems such as air and water preservation, noise
control, hazardous substance control, solid waste management, and marine pollution.
5.    The GOK then realized there was a need to leam more about the impact of polluting and
depleting agents on the rural environment and looked to the colleges and departments of agriculture
and veterinary sciences in the universities to expand their research efforts in these areas and to provide
better professional training in rural environmental fields. In addition, the need to coordinate these
research efforts was recognized by the GOK, and a central research organization was planned to
provide common facilities for scientists from these institutions to pursue research programs and to
allow a rational and efficient use of highly specialized research equipment. The GOK also established
two committees to review and advise on the appropriateness of environment-related research and
teaching programs at the institutions (para. 1 1).
Evaluation of Objectives
6.    The GOK's objectives for this project were highly relevant to the rural environmental
problems caused by three decades of rapid growth (paras. 2 and 3). The project has helped bring
balance to Korea's environmental efforts which had had a strong urban focus. Research and teaching
capabilities of rural environrnental professionals have been enhanced and rural environmental
problems have been properly addressed.  The central research facility has been successfully
established at SNU (para. 8). The results of the project's research activities and technology are being
used by related private enterprises and some have received patent awards (para. 10).
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
7.    All of the project objectives were fully met or exceeded. The project has facilitated and
enhanced research capabilities and teaching programs, especially in environmental areas at 12 national
agricultural colleges, 4 national universities with agriculture departments', and 9 national veterinary
colleges. Their research outputs have been impressive (para. 10). The selected project colleges have
moved their research focus increasingly away from the traditional concentration on food production
and animal health toward issues affecting the rural environment such as measuring and controlling
pollution, managing waste disposal, and improving the conservation of natural resources such as
cultivable land, forests and fisheries.
8.    One of the project institutional development targets was achieved through the establishment of
NICEM, which plays an important role in facilitating collaborative research activities among scientists
as well as providing them with a common well-equipped facility in a convenient central location -- the
Suwon campus of SNU. NICEM is now a research organization affiliated legally with SNU's College
They are Gangnung, Gongju, Mokpo and Andong Universities.



3
of Agriculture and Life Science (CALS). To ensure its institutional sustainability, NICEM has not
only secured annual national operational budgets through SNU but has also generated funds from
other financial programs (para. 21).
9.     Research capability and teaching programs at tne colleges of agriculture and veterinary
sciences were enhanced and strengthened through the provision of highly specialized equipment,
overseas training and library materials as well as through visits of foreign experts. More than 5,000
pieces of equipment were provided under the project and a total of 150 staff received training
overseas. The numbers of trainees exceeded the original plan by more than 100% (Table 5), due to
the efficient management by NICEM of the fellowship program. In addition to 112 professors and
teachers from the colleges and 19 staff members of MOE and SNU, 19 laboratory technicians and
graduate students (who are the key staff for maintaining, operating and handling the highly
specialized research equipment) were also selected for training. Upon their return, all trainees were
required to share their newly acquired knowledge by participating in presentations and lectures at
annual symposia organized by NICEM. Relevant library materials were also purchased by NICEM
and made available to researchers at the CALS/SNU central library. For example, CD-ROMs and
micro-fiches of environmental sciences literatures and databases were installed in the library's
computer. A total of 45 foreign experts from 11 countries also participated in the research activities
and conducted seminars and workshops at the various agricultural and veterinary colleges (para.
17).
10.   Research activities conducted by the agricultural and veterinary colleges and NICEM
increased an average of 33% annually over the project years. A total of 8,114 research activities were
conducted during this time, about 80% over appraisal estimates. The results of 97% of these activities
were published either domestically or internationally, 23% were related to the environment, 15% have
been used by related industries, and 2% have been awarded patents (Table 7).
11.   Another project institutional development target was achieved in 1993 when the two
environmental committees to review and advise on the appropriateness and relevance of the research
and teaching programs at the project institutions were established -- the Environmental Education
Review Committee (EERC)2 and the Environmental Research Advisory Committee (ERAC)3. These
committees continue to function with most of their input being made through NICEM. Both
committees have reviewed the operations of NICEM itself and have made sound suggestions for its
operation.  They have also conducted two important research activities -- "development of
environmental education programs in the agricultural college for the 21t century" and "strategies for
improving the status of agricultural environment with special emphasis on livestock waste
management", respectively. EERC's research project resulted in a published book "Environmental
Education Programs in the Agricultural College for the 21' Century and the Improvement of
Agricultural Environment in Korea". The book provides guidelines for developing these programs
and was useful when CALS/SNU recently developed its long-term programs.
2 The main purpose of the EERC is to ensure that environment-related teaching programs in the agricultural and veterinary colleges
are relevant to the major environmental issues being faced in Korea and lead to the production of better-trained environmental
professionals.
3 The main purpose of the ERAC is to ensure that the environmental research programs of the agricultural and veterinary colleges
are consistent with the overall environmental policies and priorities of Korea, with special emphasis on rural environmental
issues.

C.  IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
Implementation Record
12.   Overall implementation was satisfactory. The Loan was closed on schedule and was fully
disbursed with no cancellations and no cost overruns. Efficient implementation during the later
years made up for the slow start at the beginning of the project.
13.   This was especially true for NICEM. NICEM's institutional development was one of the
main project objectives, and the project was rated "unsatisfactory" in 1994 when a freeze by the
GOK's Cabinet on all organizational changes in Government entities meant that NICEM could not
be legally established under the SNU. Without legal status, NICEM was faced with implementation
problems such as a shortage of operational budgets and staff and a lack of facilities to house the
project equipment as required by a Loan covenant. As a result, NICEM's procurement and research
activities came to a halt. After NICEM was legally established at SNU in March 1996 its
procurement and research activities moved forward.
14.   Procurement activities were completed on time despite a slow start due to loan allocation
disagreements among the project colleges. These were eventually solved and the resulting
equipment lists were approved by MOE with the help of relevant technical committees.
Procurement was handled by the GOK's experienced central procurement agency, SAROK, and
nearly all items were purchased through ICB. All procurement procedures were in compliance with
Bank procurement guidelines including the purchasing of library materials for NICEM. No
irregularities have been found.
15.   Audit reports were submitted on schedule throughout the implementation period. After
NICEM's legal status was established in 1996, and it became fully operational, all four legal
covenants were in full compliance.
Major Factors Affecting the Project
16.   There were no major problems affecting the project other than the initial problems
encountered by NICEM (para. 13).
Consulting Services
17.   A total of 45 short-term foreign experts from 1 1 countries were hired through NICEM. This
number was higher than originally planned although the total staff months experts actually spent in
Korea was about the same as planned (Table 5). The experts conducted relevant workshops and
seminars and lectured at the various agricultural and veterinary colleges. Some of the foreign
experts contributed to NICEM's research activities. Both the visiting expert program and the
overseas training provided excellent opportunities for scientists in Korea to establish international
collaboration in their research activities.



5
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
18.   The GOK has a very clear understanding of the environment problems in both rural and urban
areas that have resulted from Korea's three decades of rapid growth. The GOK's continuous support
for this project and for the Environmental Technology Development Project (Loan 3694-KO) are
obvious indications of its awareness in these areas.
19.   Over the years the GOK has enacted several wide-ranging laws to help protect Korea's
environment and conserve its natural resources and has provided policy and planning guidance on
environmental issues by upgrading the EA to a Cabinet-level ministry, MOEN (para. 4). The GOK
has thus made a long-term commitment to solving Korea's environmental problems.
20.   The research equipment financed by this project is well-maintained and managed and is highly
utilized. Proposals for future management of the equipment have been requested by the MOE and
these are under preparation by the project institutions. The national budget for 1999 provides funds
for the operation and maintenance of this equipment. Continued support for equipment will also be
given in 1999 to all higher education institutions in Korea for their research and education programs,
and such budgets will be continued in future for all the institutions.
21.   NICEM has become a success. Its staff has expanded from 7 in 1993 to 26 (21 professionals
and 5 administrative staff) plus 10 graduate student assistants at the end of 1998. Its operations are
highly regarded among the agricultural and veterinary colleges and the small and medium private
enterprises it serves, and it has also achieved a satisfactory national reputation as a research support
institute. In addition to its increased budget, NICEM has secured financing from other sources such as
competitive grants from the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, the SNU, the MOE and
various private companies, as well as from user fees and from its symposia and workshops. A new
space for the Center is planned for construction at SNU's Seoul campus and will be completed in 2003
allowing the Center to be consolidated from its current four locations.
22.   EERC and ERAC are also expected to continue to review and advise both the NICEM and the
agricultural and veterinary colleges on their environment-related research activities and teaching
programs.
23.   All of these factors assure project sustainability.
E. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
24.   Overall Bank performance was highly satisfactory. Efficiency was gained during the
preparation stage by combining the preparation of this project with preparation of both the
Enviromnental Technology Development Project (Loan 3694-KO) and the Science and Technical
Education Project (Loan 3693-KO). As a result, a clear understanding of sector-related policy
issues, relating especially to the environment was developed from the beginning of the projects.



6
25.   Economies of scale were achieved during implementation by fielding a single Bank mission
to supervise all on-going education projects in Korea at the same time. Supervision work was well-
coordinated, detailed and cost-effective. An early project launch workshop to smooth project
execution, conducted by an experienced implementation consultant, was money well-spent.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
26.   Overall Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The impressive performance by the
project institutions, especially by NICEM during the later years of implementation, has totally
erased the image of a very early "unsatisfactory" rating due to delayed compliance with one legal
covenant (para. 13). The Borrower's subsequent performance has to be called highly satisfactory as
the project achieved its objectives and the Loan was fully disbursed with no cancellations and no
shortages of counterpart funds.
27.   This is the first education loan to Korea that has reached full disbursement. Good working
relationships between the Bank and the Borrower, efficient coordination by MOE and the efforts
made by the project colleges and NICEM were all important factors in the successful
implementation as was the trouble-free equipment procurement undertaken by SAROK.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
28.   Overall project development objectives were successfilly achieved. Performance indicators
(Table 6) were identified and monitored by the Bank during the 18 months prior to Loan Closing.
Most of the targets were met or exceeded. The research capabilities of the project colleges of
agriculture and veterinary sciences have been enhanced, and research activities and publication of their
findings have increased steadily over the projects years and are being used by related private
enterprises (para. 10). A centrally located common research facility, NICEM, was established and is
in full operation with adequate budgetary and financial support (paras. 8, 20 and 21). Committees for
review of research activities and teaching programs related to the environment, EERC and ERAC,
were established and have been functioning since 1993 (paras. 11 and 22).
H. FUTURE OPERATION
29.   Korea graduated from borrower status in June 1995; however, due to the recent financial crisis
in the East Asia region, the GOK has asked for some structural adjustment and technical assistance
loans.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
30.   The lesson to be learned from this project is that frequent and detailed supervision as well as
good working relationships with the Borrower can save a project and even turn around an
"unsatisfactory" rating.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
IBRD Progress Review Mission for
Environmental Research and Education Project - Loan 3612-KO
Aide Memoire I/
1.   The IBRD Mission 2/ visited Korea from October 28 to November 12, 1998, to
review the implementation progress of two World Bank financed projects (Lns. 3612-KO
and 3693-KO), and to follow up on the status of special accounts and evaluation
summaries of a recently completed project (Ln. 3694-KO). This Aide Memoire will only
address Loan 3612-KO, because the final Aide Memoire has to be included in its
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). A separate Aide Memoire is being prepared
for Ln. 3693-KO.
2.   During the course of its review for this project, the mission visited the Ministry of
Finance and Economy (MOFE), Ministry of Education (MOE), the Supply
Administration, Republic of Korea (SAROK), the College of Agriculture, Cheju National
University, Colleges of Agriculture, and Veterinary Medicine, Chungnam National
University, Colleges of Agriculture and Life Science (CALS), and Veterinary Medicine,
Seoul National University, and the National Instrumentation Center for Environmental
Management (NICEM). The mission would like to take this opportunity to express its
appreciation for the kind hospitality and assistance extended to the mission especially
from the Director of NICEM, Dr. Eunwoo Park.
Summary of Procurement and Disbursement
3.   The mission received two status reports, one from Ministry of Education (MOE)
and one from NICEM. The Overall progress was generally satisfactory. The status of
procurement and disbursements planned and achieved are summarized in Attachment 1.
Based on data collected as of September 30, 1998, which is three months before the
Closing Date (December 31, 1998), procurement has reached 96% and disbursements has
reached 86% of the total loan amount. The low disbursement rate (as of September 30,
1998) is because several large contracts are still in the process of being disbursed. An
updated version of procurement and disbursement will be provided to the Bank shortly.
Field Visits Findings
4.   NICEM.. The mission found operations in NICEM very impressive. Not only
adequate spaces have been added to house the additional project equipment, but proper
locations for highly sensitive equipment are being taken into consideration during the
planning. The Director has secured annual national budget from the government as well
' This Aide Memoire is subject to the review and modification by Bank Management.
2 / The mission comprised Ms. Carol H.L. Ball (Task Team Leader, EASED).

as other grants to fund the operations of NICEM. So far, there is no shortage of staff,
laboratory consumer materials, and operations and maintenance costs. NICEM has
established a network of equipment repairing and maintenance team with the suppliers.
The utilization rate of NICEM's equipment is very high. Some of their own research
projects will have to be conducted after hours, due not only to the high equipment
utilization rate but also to the frequent demand for their services by other institutions,
including the private sector. Their environmental research publications has been
increasing annually.
5.   The implementation of overseas training and visiting experts programs has been
completed. There is a saving of US$.3 million, which has been used to procure needed
equipment.
6.   Colleges of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine. Colleges visited by the
mission show no indication of shortage of counterpart funds for operations and
maintenance. All equipment items procurement under the project are well managed and
properly housed. The equipment utilization rate varies depending on the specialization of
the equipment. Generally, they are all being used either by the research faculties or their
graduate students. At times, the general public also come and use the equipment, and a
small user's fee is charged for consumable materials. The number of research topics has
increased yearly and most of them are environment related. Research findings have been
published in both national and international journals.
Unused Loan Proceeds by Closing Date
7.  MOE informed the mission that there would not be any significant amount of
unused loan proceeds by the time of the Closing Date. The mission pointed out that there
will be no need for an extension of the Closing Date.
8.  NICEM would like to use any leftover funds by other project institutions to buy
some more library materials using the international shopping procedures. The Bank
normally would have no objection to any transfer of a small percentage of loan funds
between project institutions and between categories of expenditures at a time near a
loan's closing date, as long as the project's development objectives are not adversely
affected and the relevant contracts signed and payments due prior to the closing date.
Matters Related to Implementation Activities at the Time Near the Closing Date
9.  At a late stage of project implementation, ICB and NCB procurement procedures
are not suitable, because the lead time is too long. More suitable procurement procedures
are prudent shopping for equipment, and direct negotiations with suppliers for library
materials. The lead time for either is short.
10. In order to be "eligible for disbursement", it is crucial to note that all payment due
dates including expiry dates of L/Cs have to be before the Closing Date. A suitable
disbursement procedure to be used at a late stage of project implementation is "Direct
Payment to Suppliers" for which Form 1903 should be used. This would obviate two
difficulties: (i) the use of Special Commitment would involve the issuance of a Letter of
-2-



Annex A
Page 3 of 14
Credit (L/C), for which the expiry date may be after the Closing Date, the Bank would
not hohor such L/Cs; and (ii) the Special Account (SA) used may not have a balance
great enough for the transaction during the SA recovering period near the Closing Date.
11. Sometimes payments on eligible expenditures could not be paid on time before the
Closing Date. The Bank, however, could grant a grace period of four months after the
Closing Date to facilitate such payments. The Bank would usually agree to this request,
if asked for and recommended by the mission. MOE has submitted such request to the
mission. The mission will seek the approval of Bank management upon return to
headquarters.
12. In order to be eligible for reimbursement, all contracts payment due dates and
L/Cs' expiry dates have to be before the Closing Date. Any payment due within the
Grace Period is NOT eligible for reimbursement by the loan account. The Grace-Period,
which the loan account will remain open for another "four months" after the Closing
Date, is only for the purpose of processing disbursement paperwork.
Review of Bid Evaluation Reports and Contract Awards
13. During the visit to SAROK, which has recently moved to a new government office
complex in Taejon, the mission reviewed all bid evaluation reports and contract awards
under this review period, totaling about 115 bids. No irregularities were found. All
awards were made to the lowest evaluated bids. SAROK's performance is highly
satisfactory.
14. The mission would like to call the attention of SAROK regarding the Closing Date
matters stated in the above paras. 9 to 12.
Review of Statement of Expenditures and the Supporting Vouchers
15. The mission's review covered about 10% of MOE's entries in their 6 Applications
for Withdrawal (AFWs), totaling about 58 items. All the supporting vouchers matched
with the entries of the SOEs. The review indicated satisfactory project administration of
MOE.
Covenant Compliance
16. All covenants in the Loan Agreement were in full compliance. The final audit
report covering the period of January 1 to December 31, 1998, should be submitted to the
Bank as soon as possible but no later than June 30, 1999.
Settlement of the Special Account
17. Either AFWs or the refund of the balance of the Special Account should be done in
order to settle the Special Account with our Disbursement Division. Refund should be
sent to the following World Bank account:
Federal Reserve Bank of New York

Reference: IBRD Loan 3612-KO, SA Refund
Preparation of ICR
18. It is the Bank's policy to prepare the ICR for each project after its Closing Date.
The purpose is to evaluate the success or failure of the project. Whether the development
objectives had been achieved as anticipated. Is there a cost- or time- overrun? What is
the performance of the Borrower and of the Bank during the implementation of the
project? Is the project sustainable after its completion? What are the measures taken by
the Borrower to make it sustainable? What are the lessons learned for the Borrower and
the Bank? For example, is it worth replicating in other developing countries?
19. For achieving the above tasks, efforts from both the Bank and the Borrower are
needed. An ICR preparation document (Attachment 2) was prepared by the mission, and
presented to MOE and NICEM.   Extensive discussions were conducted and the draft
was approved during these meetings. An ICR preparation timetable was also agreed
upon and attached to the above document.
Y2K Problem
20. Due to the approach of the year 2000. All electronic computer equipment and
software using the two digits in the year field are in serious jeopardy. Any work or
services linked to the time system using the two digit system could be disrupted. The
mission has alerted MOFE, MOE, NICEM and project institutions visited by the mission
the Y2K problem. They are well aware of the situation and the seriousness of the Y2K
problem. The mission was informed by MOE, that the Ministry of Information and
Coommunication under the direction of the Prime Minister is looking into the Y2K
problem. Seoul National University is also looking into this problem, but waiting for the
Government's recommendation. MOFE informed the mission that there is a budget of
Won 4,000 billion set aside by the Government of Korea for the Y2K problem. The
mission observed that everybody including the project institutions is well aware of this
problem, but still there are no concrete solutions. Attachment 3 is attached to this Aide
Memoire to help all concerned parties, including SAROK, to understand the nature of the
Y2K problem. Further information could be obtained from the World-Wide Web:
http://vvww.year2000.com/cgi-bin/y2k/year2000.cgi.
21. Next Mission. There will be no more progress review missions from the Bank for
this project, as the Closing Date is December 31, 1998.

The Preparation of Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
Closing Date: December 31, 1998
1. What is an ICR?
The ICR is a milestone in the project cycle, marking the transition from
implementation to the project's future operation. It assesses primarily (a) the
degree of achievement of project objectives; (b) prospects for the project's
sustainability; (c) Bank and borrower performance; (d) project outcome; and (e) the
plan for the project's future operation.
2. Who wants an ICR?
The policy of the Bank is to evaluate completed projects, and it requires borrowers
also to do so. The Bank requires an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for
each lending operation it finances.
3. Why is an ICR needed?
An ICR is needed for a number of reasons as follows:
Transparency -  The Bank wants every project that it finances to be fully
transparent to all interested parties.
Accountability - All the loan proceeds must be accountable, i.e. we must show
that they were disbursed in accordance with the objectives of the
project and in line with the requirements of the Loan Agreement.
Benefits -     Each project's designed benefits, achieved, partly achieved or
not achieved, need to be explained.
Lessons Learned -For future operations, the Bank tries to avoid/diminish mistakes
and replicate successes.
Evaluation -    Only through an impartial evaluation, can we determine the
extent to which project objectives have been achieved.
Sustainability -  It is important for the Bank and borrower to assess whether
objectives are sustainable, based on good reasons and a future
plan.
4. What is in the ICR?
An ICR Table of Contents sample (Annex 1) is attached for your reference.
5. Who is responsible for preparing the ICR?
Both the Bank and the borrower are responsible for preparing the ICR:
(a) The ICR is prepared by a completion mission of the Bank. The mission's Aide
Memoire is included in the ICR as its Appendix A; and



Annex A
Page 8 of 14
(b) The borrower prepares and makes available to the Bank its own evaluation
report on the project's execution and initial operation, cost and benefits, the Bank's
and borrower's performance of their respective obligations under the Loan
Agreement, and the extent to which the purposes of the loan were achieved. A
summary of this report (or the full report if it is ten pages or less) is annexed
unedited to the ICR. The borrower also (i) adopts a plan acceptable to the Bank for
the operational phase of the project, and (ii) assists the Bank in ICR preparation. A
questionnaire for the preparation of ICR and required financial tables (Annex 2) are
attached to be submitted to the Bank according to the ICR time schedule.
6. When is the ICR due?
The ICR is normally distributed to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors not
later than six months after the Project's Closing Date. A time schedule (Annex 3)
is attached for your reference.
Matters Related to a Project Near its Closing Date
7. What is eligible for disbursements ?
All goods and services, whose payments including letters of credit (L/Cs) with
expiry date before the Closing Date are eligible for reimbursement.
8. What is Grace Period?
In accordance with the present practices in the Bank, and with the concurrence of
the Bank's sector manager, the loan account could remain open for another four
months after the Closing Date. It is only for the purpose of processing
disbursement paperwork. This four-month period is called the "Grace Period".
Any procurement payment made or due within this Grace Period is not eligible for
reimbursement.
9. What other procurement methods could be used in order to procure goods
quickly before the Closing Date?
Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement allows prudent shopping procedure to be used
for contracts costing less than $300,000 or less per contract with three price
quotations from at least three suppliers. Library materials could use the direct
contracting procedures without competition (single source).
10. Why use the direct payment or reimbursement procedures when Closing Date is
near?
Our disbursements department already starts to recover the funds in the special
account, so direct payment procedure should be used when Loan is near its closing.
Or if GOK could advance its own fund to make payments on eligible expenditures,
reimbursement could be made during the Grace Period from the Bank to GOK
(limited, however, by the total Loan amount).

YEAR 2000 (Y2K) Problem                        Page 14 6f 14
ATTACHMENT 3
Nature of the Problem
1.   The Millennium Software bug or "Y2K problem" is a serious business problem
affecting all world economies that is due to strike no later than January 1, 2000. I/ It
stems from potential erroneous operation of computer software due to date calculation
errors related to the year 2000. It can compromise government and infrastructure services,
operation of the financial markets, worldwide communications, and business continuity
across the economy. Since infected systems can disrupt healthy ones, all institutions must
obtain expensive health certificates for their software lest they be excluded from business
networks. Even for isolated systems presumed error-free, escalating standards of civil
liability force expensive inspection and testing work.
2.   Unfortunately, risks are not confined to software systems. In many hardware
components ranging from securing devices in buildings to processing control devices and
medical equipment there are embedded computer chips with software carrying (often
unsuspectedly) Year 2000 problems.
3.   Examples of potentially affected systems include telecommunications systems,
transportation systems (air, rail, road and shipping), electric power generation and
distribution, water and waste treatment, hospital and medical facilities, manufacturing and
distribution systems, insurance industry, financial institutions, tax collection, international
trade, criminal justice and court systems, civil policy systems, social services, state
investment systems and emergency response systems.
3.   Given the broad impact of the Y2K problem, the laborious nature of remediation
and testing work, and the short time available before the problem strikes, it is
indispensable for institutions and countries to focus corrective efforts and resources on the
areas of highest risk. Thus in most cases remediation plans must start with an assessment
of priorities and include contingency plans for dealing with potential crises.
4.   Not all is bleak. The Y2K problem offers a unique opportunity for govenmlents to
come to terms with the crucial role of strategic information systems in the economy, thus
facilitating rational management of those systems. The Internet is in place to facilitate
knowledge sharing on an unprecedented scale. The global nature of the problem is
revitalizing altruistic behavior and cooperative solution schemes. National informatics
service industries stand to gain a boost from well-designed remediation programs.
l / The error arises from decisions by computer programmers and system designers to use two instead of
four digits to represent the year in a data field. Thus, "1965" becomes "65". Much software written before
1995 uses this convention and thus implicitly assumes that dates of the form xx/xx/00 precede dates of the
form xx/xxJ99 causing wrong answers when comparing dates in the 21St century with those in the 20 '. If
such a comparison is to test the validity of a credit card, then the credit card may be rejected; if the
comparison is to calculate a pay check, then an erroneous check may be issued. A related problem stems
from the fact that dates such as 9/9/99 or 12/31/99 were sometimnes used in programs or wired into hardware
to represent date limits; as we reach the millennium, real dates may indeed be later than these assumed date
limits, leading to still more errors. In addition, a leap year occurs in a year ending in 99 only once in 400
years, but the year 2000 is such a leap year; some software will miss February 29, 2000.

Evaluation Summary of the IBRD Environmental Research and
Education Project, Loan No. 3612-KO
1. Foreword
1.1    Over the past decade, the Korean Government has begun to address the
environmental problems that have emerged from three decades of rapid growth.
Wide-ranging legislation has been enacted and agencies have been established to
implement this legislation and to provide policy and planning guidance on
environmental issues. To reinforce these activities, environmental education has been
introduced into primary and secondary schools' curricula and into teacher training.
College-level science courses are focusing increasingly on environmental issues and
university research programs are also moving in this direction. However, in addressing
environmental problems, the focus has been mainly on such problems as they relate to
urban areas. Most attention has been given to alleviating air and noise pollution in the
cities and towns and to inland water pollution as it affects urban water supply.
1.2   Increasingly, however, rural environmental problems are receiving attention in a
densely-populated country with scarce cultivable land and abundant forests at 21% and
66% of total land area respectively. Cultivable land is becoming increasingly polluted
through household, industrial and animal waste, and agrochemicals; inland and coastal
waters are being polluted in a sirnilar manner. Korea's forests, although extensive,
need to be better managed to ensure effective conservation of soils and watersheds,
efficient harvesting and replanting, reduction of pest damage and improved tree health,
etc. This requires better trained professionals to measure and control pollution, manage
forests and fisheries and operate the regulatory system. There is also a priority need
to improve and expand research into key environmental problems related to land, water
and forests. The agricultural and veterinary colleges have an important role to play in
addressing these problems through research and teaching.
1.3    The project has provided the opportunity for the Bank to support Korea's
policies for environmental irnprovement by strengthening environmental research and
teaching in selected agricultural and veterinary colleges. The project has helped push
the colleges more firmly towards addressing environmental concems and in
accelerating the pace of such involvement. It has also helped bring balance to Korea's
environmental efforts, which had a strong urban focus, by strengthening the country's
capacity to address rural environmental problems.
1.4    The objectives of the project were to assist selected colleges of agriculture and
veterinary science to: (a) upgrade their capacity to undertake research into -key
environmental problems; (b) establish facilities for effective common research activities;
(c) reinforce the environmental aspects of basic science programs in the colleges, in
order to strengthen professional training in environmental fields; and (d) establish
appropriate arrangements for the review of environment-related research and teaching

programs.
2. Introduction of the project
2.1 The Ministry of Education decided to support environment-related programs at
college-level institutions for solving the environmental pollution problems, prepared a
loan project and requested to the Ministry of Finance and Economy at that time to
introduce a loan from IBRD for such purpose. The Ministry of Finance and Economy,
after getting the agreement of the national assembly on the proposed loan, asked for
the loan to IBRD.   IBRD  sent an identification mission consisted of experts
professional in the related fields to check the contents of the proposed loan, and
another for its appraisal.
Appropriateness of the loan proposal was recognized and the loan agreement was
signed on June 30, 1993 for the loan of US$ 60,000,000 or less after negotiations on
the agreement conditions in Washington, D. C. The Korean Government sent to the
Bank papers required for the loan such as legal comments on the agreement, etc., and
the Bank notified the Korean Government the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement on
September 3, 1993.
2.2 With this notice, the plan of the loan project was actually put into implementation,
beginning with establishing the Ministry of Education Special Account from the loan
proceeds of US$60,000,000 or less. The project contents were as follows in general:
(a) Provision of equipment and training to enhance NICEM's capacity to undertake
environment-related researches - US$ 12,300,000.
(b) Provision of equipment for improving in the quality of environment -related
research and teaching in national agricultural and veterinary colleges - US$ 47,700,000.
(c) Organization of Environmental Education Review Committee (EERC) and
Environmental Research  Advisory  Committee  (ERAC)  for recommendation  on
environmental education and researches.
3. Implementation of the Project
A. Selection of Participating Institutions and Establishment of NICEM
3.1 Selection of Participating Institutions
For realizing the prospect described in Chapter 1. Foreword, the 14 national agricultural
and veterinary colleges of the project were selected as project institutions from the
designing stage of the project aiming at an early achievement of project purposes and
considering the estimated fund limit. The special meaning of the project in addition to
supporting the related 14 institutions in education and research activities is to have



Annex B
Page 4 of 10
established NICEM to help other national, public, and private institutions other than the
project ones at the same time by rendering the sophisticated high cost
environment-related equipment in NICEM for their researches and joint use. This part
of the project seems to have a high value-added achievement.
3.2 Establishment of NICEM
The National Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management (NICEM) was
established on the Suwon campus of Seoul National University (SNU) by the project
to achieve value added in the form of creating an efficient mechanism for centralizing
common research activities, which would be of particular benefit to smaller institutions.
Based on the Presidential Decree dated March 1, 1996, NICEM has been legally
established in the SNU Organization Act as a research support institution affiliated to
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), SNU. NICEM is now recognized as
a nationwide research support institution whose operation budget is mainly
appropriated by MOE. CALS, SNU also takes responsibility for the NICEM operation.
During the last five years, the space for NICEM has expanded to 1,845m2 in four
different buildings to house research equipment procured by the project. Currently, 26
staff members and 10 graduate student helpers are actively involved in the NICEM
operation. Of 25 staff members, there are five joint-appointed professors, four
administration staff, 7 post-doctoral research associates, five research assistants, four
lab technicians, etc. The graduate student helpers are working for NICEM on a
part-time basis, and help maintain laboratories of NICEM.
B. Equipment Procurement
3.3    General procedures of equipment procurement.
The bulk of the work in equipment procurement was undertaken by the Supply
Administration, Republic of Korea (SAROK), which is highly experienced in procuring
equipment under the Bank's international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. In
1994, the first year of the project implementation, equipment lists and specifications
provided by the project institutions were submitted to SAROK after evaluation for
their appropriateness by the Equipment Specification Review Committee (ESRC) of
MOE. However, the evaluation procedure by ESRC of MOE was abolished from 1996
in order to expedite the procedure of equipment procurement. On the basis of
equipment lists and specifications submitted by project institutions, SAROK prepared
bidding documents, invited bids, evaluated them in conjunction with the institutions,
and made contract awards with their agreement. In most cases the supplier was
responsible for installation, initial testing and operation of the equipment as specified in
the contract. It has usually taken three to eight months between the procurement
request to SAROK and the equipment installation. Most of equipment were under one
or two year warranty.
3.4    Equipment procurement by NICEM
NICEM has made every effort to accommodate general opinions on selection of
equipment that needed to be procured by NICEM as a common research facility. At
the same time, NICEM has tried to procure equipment which was so expensive that



Annex B
Page 5 of 10
any individuals or small institutions could not afford. The equipment lists and
specifications were prepared by the Laboratory Operation Committees (LOC) of
NICEM, which consisted of faculty members from various universities. The operation
committees called for requests of equipment that needed to be procured by NICEM.
The requests from faculty of both public and private agricultural and veterinary
colleges were evaluated by LOC, and the final equipment lists and specifications to be
procured in each year were determined. The equipment lists and specifications were
reviewed by the Equipment Specification Review Committee (ESRC) of CALS, SNU,
and modified if necessary, before submitting to SAROK. Contract prices for most of
equipment procured by NICEM were approximately more than US$25,000. The most
expensive equipment was Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometers (600MHz liquid
and 400MHz solid), whose contract price was approximately US$1,300,000. As of 30
December, 1998, the equipment procurement was completed. A total of 249 sets of
equipment of approximately US$11,830,000 equivalent have been procured. During the
last five years, NICEM has expended W940,000,000 (circa US$783,000 in case the
conversion rate of US$ 1 is 1,2000 Won) for repairing and furnishing the laboratories
to house research equipment.
3.5    Equipment procurement by agricultural and veterinary colleges.
The Loan Project was an excellent opportunity for the participating agricultural and
veterinary colleges to procure research equipment for not only laboratories of individual
faculty members but also their campus-wide common research facilities. During the
last few years, they have made a great deal of efforts to establish their own
campus-wide common research facilities and MOE has encouraged and supported
financially to build independent buildings to centralize expensive research equipment in
the campus. Among the participating colleges, most of them have brand-new buildings
to house equipment, of which a substantial portion was procured through the project.
Selections of equipment to be procured for the common research facilities were made
by special commnittees which consisted of faculty members of the schools representing
individual departments or various fields of sciences. Laboratories of individual faculty
members have been greatly improved by the project. Depending upon schools,
approximately US$10,000-50,000 was allocated to individual faculty members for their
own laboratories.
C. Library Material Procurement
3.6    Library  materials were procured on the basis of direct purchase after
negotiating for discounts with distributors authorized by respective publishers. NICEM
has completed the library material procurement in 1997 by purchasing CD-ROM's and
micro-fiches of literatures and databases for environmental sciences. The CD-ROM's
were installed in the computer system of the Agriculture and Life Science Research
Information Center located at the Agricultural Library of CALS, SNU. The
rmicro-fiches were also installed at the library. All of them are easily available to
anyone.

D. Overseas Training and Visiting Expert Program
3.7    Since 1994, a total of 150 overseas trainees and 45 foreign experts have
participated in the overseas training and visiting expert program. The overseas trainees
included 112 professors and 19 equipment operators from 23 agricultural and veterinary
colleges, and 19 staff members of MOE and SNU. The overseas trainees have
presented lectures in the yearly symposia which were held by NICEM to propagate
their achievement and experiences during the training periods. The foreign experts
were from 11 countries. They have given seminars and workshops at various
agricultural and veterinary colleges. The overseas training and visiting expert program
provided excellent opportunities for Korean scientists to establish international
collaborations for their research. Some of the foreign experts have made good
contributions for operation of NICEM.
E. EERC and ERAC Activities
3.8    Since 1993 when EERC and ERAC were established in MOE, both committees
had their meetings in principle once or twice a year. Members of both committees
represented agricultural and veterinary colleges, and relevant authorities in the Korean
Government such as Ministries of Education, Environment, Science and Technology,
Health and Welfare and Rural Development Administration. At the annual meetings,
both committees have reviewed activities of NICEM and made suggestions on the
NICEM operation. The major achievement of ERAC and EERC was conducting
researches on 'Strategies for improving the status of agricultural environment with
special emphasis on livestock waste management' and 'Development of environmental
education programs in agricultural colleges for the 21st century', respectively. The
research fund was provided through NICEM by MOE in 1995-1996. EERC has
published results of their research in a book entitled 'Environmental Education
Programs in the Agricultural College for the 21st Century and the Improvement of
Agricultural Environment in Korea'. The authors have reviewed related literatures and
college curricula extensively, and made suggestions on ideal curricula for environmental
education at the college-level.
4. Evaluation of the Project Implementation
41    Equipment procurement.
By procuring equipment of US$58,600,000 equivalent, the project institutions were able
to enhance greatly their capacity to undertake basic and applied research into key
environmental problems. Especially, NICEM has become pivotal in facilitating and
supporting the collaborated agricultural and veterinary medical research that is
indispensable for tackling complicated environmental issues on the national and
international scale. Since the inception of the equipment service by NICEM in 1996, the
number of users has increased rapidly. Approximately 700 researchers from 51 public
or private institutions have used the NICEM equipment. There have been no serious
problems in the process of equipment procurement except for the first year of the

project. In 1994, very little loan was disbursed for the equipment procurement because
of disagreement in the loan allocations between the project institutions. Also, NICEM
was not legally stabilized and did not have operation budget and personnel enough to
carry out the project implementation in 1994. However, most of problems were solved
before the end of 1994, and the equipment procurement by all project institutions went
well from 1995.
4.2    Overseas training and visiting expert program.
This program has provided excellent opportunity for agricultural and veterinary
colleges to fortify their teaching and research in environmental sciences. This program
was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 1996. However, only 42% of
US$1,500,000 was disbursed by the program until 1996. The program was extended
until 1998 with some changes to open the program for not only professors but also lab
technicians and graduate students who were in charge of operation and maintenance of
expensive research equipment procured through the loan project. This program has
made infrastructural contributions for the success of the loan project by enhancing
trainees' ability to operate sophisticated research equipment, and to establish
international collaborations for research and teaching in environmental aspects of
agricultural and veterinary sciences.
4.3    ERAC and EERC activities
Although ERAC and EERC have been maintained during the project period, activities
of both committees have not been as effective as was expected originally when the
project was developed. The most significant achievement was the publication of a book
by EERC, entitled 'Environmental Education Programs in the Agricultural College for
the 21st Century and the Improvement of Agricultural Environment in Korea'. The
book is a good guideline for developing teaching programs for environmental sciences
in agricultural colleges in Korea. For example, the book was very useful when CALS,
SNU developed a long-term program for its research and education in environmental
and ecological sciences. ERAC and EERC have also made contributions for
emphasizing environmental aspects in the NICEM operation by reviewing its activities
and making suggestions.
5. Conclusion
5.1  The loan project was very successful and timely implemented for Korean
agricultural and veterinary colleges, which needed to strongly address environmental
aspects in agricultural and veterinary sciences, and to drastically improve their
research equipment for solving environmental problems.
5.2   NICEM  would be quite sustainable in the future. On the basis of a strong
commitment by MOE, NICEM has established various programs to generate funds for
its institutional sustainability. Considering the leading position and the equipment
procurement of NICEM, NICEM has become pivotal in facilitating and supporting the
collaborative agricultural and veterinary research that is indispensable for tackling

complicated environmental issues in Korea.
5.3    Requests by Project Institutions
During implementation of this project, project institutions made following requests.
These will be considered and reflected as much as possible in the annual process of
budgetary appropriation for proper operation and maintenance of the equipment
provided from the loan, and for necessary replacement of them when required under
technical development. Operational technicians might be increased in future, and other
costs incidental to operation and maintenance of the equipment might also be increased
at certain rate of the related equipment cost. The request to the World Bank from
NICEM is cordially transferred to the Bank by the following paragraph of 5.3.2.
5.3.1 Request to MOE by NICEM
NICEM has procured many research equipment which are state of art. From now on,
success of NICEM depends on active use and proper maintenance of equipment. MOE
was requested to provide sufficient budget for operation and maintenance of equipment,
and for staffing and upgrading obsolete equipment.
5.3.2 Request to IBRD by NICEM
The role of IBRD is very important to promote NICEM as an international institute for
environmental research and education. In cooperation with SNU, NICEM has strong
capacity to operate education programs in environmental sciences and technology for
trainees from developing countries. With the successful experience, NICEM has great
potential to be a regional center in East and Southeast Asia and Pacific Regions for
environmental education and research projects that the Bank would develop in the
future. In this respect, guidance by IBRD is much required.
5.3.3   NICEM  and project institutions of agricultural and veterinary colleges are
requesting to make the period of procurement shorter for them to adequately cope with
the rapid change in their research and educational equipment. Project institutions also
request placing professional technicians and appropriation of enough budget for
operation and maintenance, and for other costs incidental to operation of the equipment
as the research equipment is becoming more and more complicated, their sizes larger,
and their operational technique more sophisticated along with the very rapid
development in the recently advanced sciences and technology.
