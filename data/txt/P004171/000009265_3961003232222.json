environmental problems, reinforce the environmental aspects\n            of basic science programs in the colleges in order to\n            strengthen the training of environmental professionals and\n            to establish appropriate arrangements for improving\n            environment-related research and teaching programs.  The\n            project will include specialized equipment to be financed by\n            the Bank to support:  (a) the National Instrumentation\n            Center for Environmental Management; (b) selected\n            agricultural colleges; and (c) selected veterinary colleges.\n            The government will finance complementary inputs related to\n            making the equipment operational and maintaining it\n            thereafter, namely, local transportation and installation\n            costs, operation and maintenance and consumables.  The\n            project will also include overseas training, experts and\n            library materials."}, "docdt": "1993-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
