Ratings\n            for Santa Catarina Natural Resources Management Project for\n            Brazil were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some of the key lessons learned\n            from two projects include: (i) where projects seek\n            improvements in incomes and living conditions of the poor, a\n            multidimensional approach will help to better define\n            objectives and monitor achievements; (ii) a community-driven\n            development (CDD) project may not be the best option to\n            provide access to last mile public services, such as\n            electricity; (iii) reaching the rural poor through a\n            community driven development approach requires clear\n            participation criteria underpinned by accurate welfare\n            knowledge or data and a system of aid allocation that is\n            transparent and accounted for by beneficiaries; (iv)\n            although productive subproject approaches may have a more\n            direct and visible impact on incomes, the provision of\n            complementary basic services within or outside of the\n            project framework is also key to ensuring sustainability;\n            and (v) integrating poverty reduction and natural resource\n            management (as in the Santa Catarina project) may be a\n            better option than addressing these objectives in a separate project"}, "docdt": "2016-06-28T04:04:01Z"}
