F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

 The project aims to assist the State of Ceará to reduce currently high levels of rural poverty by:
(a) improving well-being and incomes of the rural poor through better access to basic social and
economic infrastructure and services and support for productive activities, using proven

                                                   ii
community-driven development (CDD) techniques; (b) increasing the social capital of rural
communities to organize collectively to meet own needs; (c) enhancing local governance by
greater citizen participation and transparency in decision-making, through creation and
strengthening of community associations and Municipal Councils; and (d) fostering closer
integration of development policies, programs and projects at the local level, by assisting
Municipal Councils to extend their role in seeking funding, priority-setting and decision-making
over resource allocation.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

 (a) Project Development Objectives were not revised; and (b) The project was comprised of two
stages - an original project and an Additional Financing. Data and information presented in the
PDO and IO sections below show achievements under the former and incremental achievements
under the latter, with an overall total, in each case.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) describes the experiences, achievements
and lessons of the Rural Poverty Reduction Project in the Brazilian State of Ceará implemented
in two stages: the original project (Loan 4626­BR) from January 29, 2002 to June 30, 2006 and
an Additional Financing (AF) loan (7387-BR) of equal value with the same project development
objectives, design and implementation arrangements, approved June 6, 2006 and closed June 30,
2009. The AF was designed to scale up project activities/investments in small scale socio-
economic infrastructure and services to enhance the impact of a well-performing, first-stage,
community-driven development project. For purposes of this ICR, the project is treated as one
operation but any notable changes in strategy, approach and/or results from the first to the
second stage are mentioned where relevant.

1.1.2 The Northeast State of Ceará is about 33% rural (some 2.3 million people) and at
appraisal in 2001, about 78% of all rural families were living in poverty. Official data showed
massive rural deficits in basic socio-economic services ­ 88% of households without piped
drinking water, 66% without sanitation, 46% without electricity - compared to urban areas of
Ceará and to national averages. Some 90% of the state territory is semi-arid. Other, previous
Bank-supported Rural Poverty Reduction Projects in the Northeast region, including Ceará, had
helped to alleviate these conditions using a promising participatory, demand-driven approach to
addressing persistent poverty, but the sheer scale of poverty in rural areas of Ceará remained a
major challenge.1

1.1.3 Government's Strategy and Actions Taken. At the time of project preparation, the
Federal Government had just launched its Projeto Alvorada framework for poverty reduction
efforts in municipalities nationwide with lowest Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-
M). The Bank-supported CDD projects in the Northeast region were seen as having piloted
important delivery mechanisms which fit well with the Alvorada strategy of local empowerment
and community self-help, and the projects themselves were regarded as key components for its
implementation. The State Government of Ceará had, in addition to previous projects in the
CDD series, also piloted and expanded other programs to improve socio-economic wellbeing of
rural populations including the Bank-supported Land Reform and Poverty Alleviation Pilot
Project (4147-BR) and its scale-up, the Land-based Poverty Alleviation Project (7037-BR), both
of which utilized a similar community-driven methodology. 2

1.1.4 Bank Involvement: The Bank has had a long association with the Northeast Region
and the State of Ceará entailing regular dialogue on the overall lending program, state sector
strategies and specific operations. Ceará has consistently supported the community-driven Rural
Poverty Reduction Projects (known locally in Ceará as Projeto São José) since their inception in
1993, and the state was/is notable for its willingness to test innovations, e.g., market based land
reform, fair trade initiatives, and integration. The Bank's CDD investments in Northeast Brazil
are well-documented in other ICRs as well as evaluation studies suggesting the impact and cost-
effectiveness of the approach. Bank support at the time for a new Rural Poverty Reduction


1
    Reformulated Northeast Rural Development Projects (1993-1997); and Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects (1995-2004).

2
 The Rural Poverty Alleviation Project in Ceará was the vehicle through which market-based, demand-driven agrarian reform in
Brazil was first piloted and evaluated, then scaled up to the five-state Land Reform and Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project and its
successor, the 14-state Land-based Poverty Reduction Project.



                                                                 1
Project in Ceará paired its knowledge of a tested and robust new mechanism with the State's
own policies, experiences and commitment.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 As stated in the PAD, and reiterated in the Project Paper for the Additional Financing,
the project sought to reduce high levels of rural poverty by: (a) improving wellbeing and
incomes of the rural poor through better access to basic social and economic infrastructure and
services and by support for productive activities, using proven community-driven development
(CDD) techniques; (b) increasing the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively
to meet own needs; (c) enhancing local governance by greater citizen participation and
transparency in decision-making through the creation and strengthening of community
associations and Municipal Councils; and (d) fostering closer integration of development
policies, programs and policies at the local level, by assisting Municipal Councils to extend
their role in seeking funding, priority-setting and decision-making over resource allocation.

1.2.2    Key performance indicators as cited in the PAD were:

- # of families benefited from subproject investments
- Incremental employment generated from subproject investments
- Increase in wellbeing and incomes of project beneficiaries
- Increase in social welfare of rural communities
- Increase in social capital index (CPI) of project Municipal Councils
- # of Municipal Councils participating in priority-setting and decision-making on resource
allocation of project and non-project financing allocated through the Municipal Council
mechanism
- # of communities graduated from the program

1.3 Revised PDO

1.3.1 Neither the PDO nor key indicators were changed under the original project or for the
Additional Financing.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary target population was the same for both projects. The original project
targeted 120,000 poor rural families living mostly in remote, low density areas with scarce
infrastructure and services, deriving their main income from farming and/or agricultural wage
labor as small-holders, tenants, share-croppers and landless laborers. The Additional Financing
targeted an incremental 68,000 families with the same profile. The project area covered 177
municipalities (excluding metropolitan Fortaleza) divided into three Areas with differentiated
allocation of resources based on relative poverty as indicated by Municipal Human
Development Index (HDI-M) in the case of the original project, and by the Social Development
Index (SDI) for the Additional Financing.3 Both projects sought the inclusion of indigenous and
Afro-descendent peoples but the Additional Financing was more explicit.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 Both stages of the project had the same type/configuration of components summarized
below with details in Annex 2:

3
  The shift to the State's Social Development Index under the Additional Financing resulted from the fact that it was
measured bi-annually as opposed to every 10 years in the case of the HDI-M. Using the SDI did not materially affect
the identity and configuration of Area 1-3 municipalities or targeting performance per se.



                                                         2
Component 1: Community Subprojects (OP US$45.00 million, AF US$44.50 million, 90%
and 89% of total estimated cost, respectively) financed matching grants to organized rural
community associations for respectively, about 2,000 and 1,300 small-scale investment
subprojects categorized as infrastructure, productive and social. New types of investments
specified in the Additional Financing included health, education, environment and culture.

Component 2: Institutional Development (OP US$3.50 million, AF US$3.24 million, 7%
and 6.5% of total estimated cost, respectively) financed technical assistance and training to
build capacity in implementing entities including the community associations, municipal
councils and the State Technical Unit (STU). Modest funding was also included under the
original project to support state institutional modernization related to poverty reduction
programs and policies.

Component 3: Evaluation, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (OP US$1.50 million,
AF US$2.16 million, 3% and 4.3% of total estimated project cost, respectively) financed the
costs (excluding salaries) of project administration and coordination including supervision,
monitoring and impact evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1     Components were not revised under either stage of the project.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 Reallocation of Funds: Under the original project, US$3.857 million was reallocated
to Category 1(a) FUMAC Grants (US$1.940 million) and Category 1(c) PAC Grants. Under
the Additional Financing: (i) US$8.0 million was reallocated to Category 1(b) Area 2 Grants
(US$3.0 million), and Category 1(c) Area 3 Grants (US$5.0 million); and (ii) US$388,084 was
reallocated to Category 1(c) Area 3 Grants.

1.7.2 Extension of Closing Date: The original project had one extension of the Closing Date
from June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2006 (dated May 24, 2005) to permit full disbursement of the
Loan and provide a "bridge" to the Board presentation of the planned Additional Financing. The
Additional Financing closed at the end of its allotted three years.

1.7.3 Amendments to the Loan Agreement: The original project was amended in regard to
the Closing Date extension and reallocations mentioned above, and to reflect the transfer of the
State Technical Unit from the Secretariat for Rural Development (SDR) to Secretariat for Local
and Regional Development (SDLR). The Additional Financing was amended to reflect
provision for retroactive financing up to an aggregate US$5.4 million,4 transfer of the STU from
SDLR to the Secretariat for Agrarian Development (SDA), and two reallocations of funds.

1.7.4 Targets: Following the Mid-term Review analysis of the original project in 2004, total
targeted subprojects were reduced from 2,000 to 1,550, and beneficiaries from 120,000 to
109,000 due primarily to the large number of water supply investments and their higher average
cost than estimated at appraisal (resulting from water connection to households and from geo-
physical/other issues). The change was effected through the Operational Manual, not the Loan
Agreement.


4
  To continue addressing community demand between phases 1 and 2, the State used resources from its Anti-Poverty Fund to
finance 152 subprojects valued at US$5.5 m benefiting about 5,330 families. While Retroactive Financing (RF) was not included in
the Loan Agreement, the State asked the Bank to consider such expenditures for RF.



                                                               3
1.7.5 Additional Financing: The Ceará Additional Financing loan was designed to scale up
financing, activities and beneficiary coverage to strengthen the impact of the successful original
project, without changing its basic design, methodology or implementation arrangements. 5
Loan size was identical (US$37.5 million), and the allocation of resources between components
was similar for Components 1 and 2, but higher for Component 3 (see 1.5.1). The Board
approved the AF on June 6, 2006 and the new Closing Date was June 30, 2009. As noted above,
the AF planned to finance an additional 1,300 community subprojects for 68,000 families.6

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis:

2.1.1 The reduction of poverty and inequality were benchmarks of the Bank's country
assistance efforts, and the Northeast region was a primary focus area for well-targeted anti-
poverty programs to improve human and physical capital. The analytical basis and justification
rested on the documented successes and lessons of similar operations across the Northeast
region, including Ceará, since 1993. Further, the Bank had financed studies, analytical work,
and state economic memoranda to identify the dimensions, characteristics and causes of rural
poverty and to develop strategic options for policy and programmatic actions.7 The project was
seen as an instrument for intensifying the economically-viable small farm sector in the
Northeast region, as a factor in stimulating growth of the rural non-farm sector and, through the
provision of basic infrastructure, as a safety net for poor rural communities in drought-prone
areas and with natural resource problems.

2.1.2 The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 22116-BR, dated May 24, 2001, FY 01-
03) identified the reduction of poverty and inequality as central to the Bank's assistance efforts,
and the Northeast region as a primary focus area, stressing well-targeted anti-poverty programs,
human and physical capital formation, decentralization of expenditure and implementation
responsibilities to the states and municipalities, and better integration of poverty policies and
programs to increase impact and efficiency. The original project was consistent with these
higher-level CAS objectives. The Additional Financing in turn, accorded with the CAS 27043-
BR, dated November 10, 2003 (FY04-07), which called for successive projects under the
Northeast CDD program to finance basic infrastructure for the rural poor, support income-
generation activities, and promote closer integration of State and Federal rural initiatives in
participating municipalities.8

Assessment of project design:

2.1.3 Objectives: Project objectives were rational given conditions on the ground in Ceará,
were aligned with country and sector strategies, and remained consistent with the Borrower's
rural priorities through two changes of Government and adjustments to those strategies. The
higher level DO - not expected to be measured within the life of the project - sought a direct
5
 The Federal Government approved borrowing by the State of Ceará for a Rural Poverty Reduction Project with subsequent
authorization to scale up, provided project performance was satisfactory. Given strong progress under the original project, the State
sought the scale-up in the full, Federally-authorized amount of US$37.5 m. for the AF.

6
  The reduced targets but same-sized loan came from a planned increased focus on productive investments - which tend to cost more
than basic infrastructure albeit benefiting fewer families - and experience with higher than expected subproject costs under phase I.

7
    Most notably, "Rural Poverty Reduction in Brazil: Towards an Integrated Strategy" (April 2001). See Annex 9.

8
 The Bank insisted that all investment resources secured from these complementary programs be targeted and approved using the
project's established institutional mechanisms (community associations and Municipal Councils), thereby leveraging the project
methodology within a wider set of rural policies and programs. In practice, integration was a broader process.

                                                                 4
impact on rural poverty through four objectives for which the project could reasonably be held
accountable. A decade of piloting, scaling up and evaluation of the Northeast community driven
development projects provided assurance that the PDO was achievable, albeit ambitious. The
integration objective was innovative and challenging to implement and measure, reflecting the
Borrower's interest in leveraging support for the target population using the project's established
institutional mechanisms. Objectives were considered measurable, although income results were
understood to require a longer maturation and at end-project were expected to be
preliminary/indicative. Overall, project objectives were consistent with the Borrower's known
technical and institutional capacity at appraisal of both operations.

2.1.4 Indicators: Key Project Indicators (KPI) and intermediate outcome indicators however,
were deficient: (a) both were too numerous (a common failing of the period), and in some cases
were confusing and inconsistent with project design; (b) the KPI lacked any targets, even under
the Additional Financing when this shortcoming might have been detected/remedied, and most
were stated as an "increase" without citing a baseline; 9 (c) graduation was characterized as
"communities" moved out of the "program" when design called for associations with productive
subprojects to be graduated from further productive;10 (d) wellbeing and income were combined
in one indicator, and welfare was also to be measured in a separate KPI; (e) the PDO focused on
community social capital but the related KPI called for an increase in the social capital index
(SCI) of the Municipal Councils, for which there was no baseline (and no SCI); 11and (f) the KPI
on graduation was only loosely/indirectly aligned with the PDO, presumably through the
Councils' resource allocation role under PDO (d).

2.1.5 Components and organization: Project components were few, clearly-formulated and
appropriate for achieving project objectives importantly due to their internal flexibility,
permitting innovations and additional activities within the broad outline and methodology. The
established State Technical Unit, experienced and embedded in its parent secretariat, retained its
coordination role. The organizational structure remained simple, linking relevant specialist
agencies (environment, water supply, energy and training) to the STU/project via partnership
agreements, without the complications inherent in their direct, daily involvement in project
implementation and consequent need for an inter-agency coordinating body. Geographic
coverage was state-wide, supported (at the time of appraisal) by a network of 71 field offices of
the State Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Agency (EMATERCE). Funding was
adequate for implementation and based on experience (but became an issue when the US Dollar
devalued, subproject costs rose, and the subproject "mix" differed from appraisal estimates).

2.1.6 Strategic choices: The project sought to address social welfare and local economic
activity through several strategic choices: (a) investments supporting the diversification of
agriculture and employment opportunities; (b) maintaining the cost-effective and responsive
community-based approach; (c) boosting the capacity of the Municipal Councils to engage in
broader local planning, leveraging complementary resources through integration with other
programs/agencies; (d) a more precise poverty targeting framework; (e) introduction of a
graduation or exit strategy for the beneficiaries of productive investments; and, (f) rigorous


9
 Baselines were not obligatory in 2001 (appraisal). However, the project worked hard to get baseline data from evaluation and this
should have been included during preparation of the Additional Financing. As a Quality at Entry issue, it is noted that IEG judges
same according to current standards.

10
  A community can have more than one association and an association can comprise just part of a community. The association
owns the subproject, not the community. The PAD required that an association with one grant-financed productive subproject be
graduated to other financing for productive activities, but that association retained eligibility for other types of project investments.

11
  A Social Capital Index was developed by Costa (Van Zyl et al, 2000) to measure the evolution of community social capital under
the Northeast CDD program but it was not formally updated for this project and did not, in any case, contain variables to measure
similar evolution in the Municipal Councils.



                                                                   5
monitoring and evaluation. Modern information technology facilities were also to be piloted,
increasing transparency by permitting communities to access project information in real time.

2.1.7 Graduation: Graduation was a new design element arising from internal Bank
concerns about using grant financing for productive activities. The team argued that grants were
a justifiable mechanism for jump-starting income generating activities given the obstacles
normally encountered by small, poor rural borrowers seeking formal credit. The Bank and STU
consulted during appraisal with the Bank of the Northeast and Bank of Brazil to try and link
graduating communities to such entities through information sharing and coordination related to
group credit candidates, participation of banks' representatives at Municipal Council meetings,
and feedback to the STU by these banks on successful initial experiences with such borrowers.
The MIS was to monitor the share of rural poor that had received grant financing for productive
investments and subsequently graduated to commercial credit.

2.1.8     All associations with a productive investment were graduated and important lessons
were learned. Municipal Councils also detected and de-listed communities with sufficient
infrastructure/assets and organizational capacity to access mainstream financing and other
services, i.e., informal graduation. However, the framework of "bridging" activities intended to
transition communities to formal credit markets - including MIS-based tracking of graduating
communities - was not launched, being subsumed by other project concerns including those
associated with several changes of government. With the likely intensification of productive
activities under a potential follow-up operation, "facilitated graduation" merits greater focus
including from project monitoring and evaluation.

2.1.9 Integration: Local level integration of programs and policies through the Municipal
Councils proved to be a more complex and dynamic process than originally conceived at the
design stage, extending operationally well beyond the Municipal Councils which turned out to
be just one institutional element among several with potential to support the project's target
population, under project auspices. Project design envisaged the Councils as quasi exclusive
agents for resource leveraging/integration activities and they were trained accordingly. However,
the institutional and financial impact of a proactive SDA/STU leadership driven by state
strategy favoring rapid and complete coverage of basic services for poor rural families
inevitably widened the definition of integration, generating its own very positive outcomes and
lessons. Some US$91.3 million were leveraged through these combined approaches, for the
project-eligible population.

Adequacy of Government's commitment:

2.1.10 Government was fully-committed to project objectives and methodology under both
stages and maintained that level of commitment, underscored by exceptional counterpart
funding performance. Ceará has traditionally maintained a high degree of support for its CDD
projects and as noted, pioneered market-based, community-driven land reform as a pilot activity
midway through implementation of the RPAP project. Commitment of the Borrower agency to
preparing the original project was firm, but the new agency which took over soon after
effectiveness (SDLR) needed intensive coaching by the Bank team to take ownership of CDD
and the rural space, conceptually and operationally. This is not surprising, given that its mandate
was more urban. However, SDLR's support escalated and its unequivocal support for the
appraisal and negotiation of the Additional Financing in 2005 showed how far it had evolved.

Risk Assessment:

2.1.11 Risks were correctly projected by the PAD based on previous experiences with similar
projects in Ceará and other Northeast states, but there were some omissions both in the types of
risks suggested, and planned risk minimization measures:


                                                6
           Political risk merited inclusion. State Government change-over was known to be
           disruptive in Brazil and the Northeast, and effective mitigation measures were known
           from previous experience;
           Mitigation measures to ensure that the STU gave the Municipal Councils an annual
           indicative budget to support realistic investment planning could have been stronger
           given that it was an important requirement of the Operational Manual;
           Technical assistance availability was a project risk. Mitigating that risk by appointing a
           salaried Technical Advisor to each Municipal Council was sound but not implemented,
           and was in any case only a partial solution for the pervasive issue of technical support in
           the rural Northeast;
           Risks associated with project targeting should have reflected the fact that the poorest
           rural communities are often the least-organized and informed, with consequent project
           access issues. Mitigation should have called for intensive consultation, mobilization and
           organization of vulnerable populations from preparation onwards; and,
           There was no explicit risk assessment/mitigation of financial management consistent
           with the project's community-based nature and decentralized financial arrangements.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 Overview: The original Project experienced rapid start-up and disbursement due to the
experience and dense network of the State Technical Unit and large stock of pending water
supply proposals approved under the previous project. A change of government in late 2002 was
disruptive, abolishing SDR and transferring the STU to a new, untried agency. The pace of
project execution slowed as the state's fiscal situation deteriorated and counterpart funding was
reduced, obliging the state to seek alternative, compensatory resources from other programs.
Such leveraging was anticipated at appraisal, but evolved faster than expected.12 Partnerships
with key agencies and programs became key features of this project and galvanized execution,
with disbursements exceeding 80% by end-2004. The Additional Financing encountered similar
conditions, with its action plan modified just months after project effectiveness and adapted to
the rural strategy of another new, incoming State Government elected in late 2006. The project
was divided into three stages which influenced its impact quantitatively and qualitatively due to
the new government's public policy and institutional strategy for rural areas.13 While the general
design and objectives of the original and AF projects were the same, implementation showed
distinct differences including in the use of the subproject targeting/approval mechanisms (see
Annex 2). The AF also introduced a territorial dimension to project implementation, focusing
initially on training communities to understand core elements of its territorial strategy.
Maximizing community coverage and improving access in the poorest Area 1 was also
supported by the State's (informal) injection of substantial additional counterpart/other
resources and proactive support for program/policy integration. Both projects disbursed fully
and in aggregate exceeded all key targets.

Major factors affecting implementation and their resolution/outcome

2.2.3 Government turnover: As noted above, the STU's transfer to the new Secretariat of
Local and Regional Development (SDLR) reduced its staffing, operational capacity and
extensive field network. Headquarters staff became grossly over-burdened, since the STU also

12
  The Project Paper for the AF estimated this leveraging under the original project at 1:4 (another US$4.00 for each US$1.00 of
Loan funds under Component 1). No data is available.

13
  Three phases: last six months of the outgoing government which signed the Loan Agreement; transition period in which the PCU
was restructured and the project's role debated due to its transfer from SDLR to SDA and insertion in the SRDP; and, execution of
the project according to four distinct segments: Sao José Infrastructure ­ actions supporting the Living with Drought Program and
investments in water cisterns; Sao José Productive to strengthen local productive activities; Sao José Agrarian to develop on-farm
actions supporting land reform settlements; and Sao Jose Social Inclusion, to support the most vulnerable groups.



                                                                7
coordinated the Bank-supported Land-based Poverty Reduction Project. Senior managers in
SDLR initially under-valued rural areas and the CDD approach per se, favoring the urban sector.
The Bank team rapidly overcame this bias by effectively demonstrating the project's positive
experiences/results to SDLR leadership, and surmounted many obstacles to guarantee the
STU/project a minimum working infrastructure, technical team and field presence.

2.2.4 The Additional Financing encountered similar conditions soon after effectiveness, with
the STU transferred to the Secretariat for Agrarian Development (SDA), but able to
maintain/strengthen its field supervision teams and organizational structure. Positive operational
impacts included: more formal collaboration between the project and State/Federal agencies;
adoption/initiation of a territorial approach and specific focus on human and social capital
development as its foundation; shift from the IDH-M to the Social Development Index (SDI) as
the basis for poverty targeting; more intensive activities in the 40 poorest (Area 1)
municipalities; maximization of project investments/beneficiaries through the State's provision
of counterpart funding well in excess of appraisal estimates; and, intense focus on integration
with other programs to leverage benefits/resources. Moves by the state to restructure the
project's field operations late in the project were countered by strong Bank guidance designed to
minimize disruption, preserve field oversight capacity and boost the physical working
conditions of the STU team.

2.2.5 Institutional management of community demand: Demand for drinking water and
electricity greatly exceeded appraisal estimates. The strong institutional concurrence between
the STU/State, Municipal Councils and community associations that this demand reflected
legitimate community need ensured that the project attended this demand, including through
intense resource leveraging activities (described elsewhere) to increase aggregate investments
and families attended. In a large, profoundly dry state with 88% and 46% of all poor rural
families lacking drinking water and electricity, respectively, this was a rational policy. Further,
the State and municipalities were trucking water to remote communities at high cost, while
about one thousand water supply subproject proposals were approved and waiting for financing
at closing of the previous project in 2001. The casualty was productive investments, demand for
which was clearly over-estimated at appraisal (of both stages) given major deficits of basic
infrastructure in Ceará and known tendency region-wide for communities to demand water and
energy before anything else. This situation created a certain tension between Bank
expectations/recommendations and observed community demand on the ground, but with semi-
arid conditions affecting 90% of the State, government had important programs in place and
thus SDA/STU's partnerships with these programs/agencies made operational and social sense.
Demand was influenced by information campaigns stressing Government's priority lines of
action and the advantages of water supply and electricity. 14 While the State played a greater role
than customary under the Northeast CDD rubric, the rationale was correct, the established
institutional setting functioned in concert and as expected, and outcomes were positive. 15

2.2.6 Quality Mid-term Reviews (MTR): Timely MTRs (2004 and 2007) with well-planned
follow-up were influential elements in keeping the project on track in operational, technical and
fiduciary terms. Under MTR I, a survey-based Physical Performance Study (SDLR 2004),
clearly-defined recommendations and astute follow-up resulted in restructuring of the STU,
additional technicians contracted, and the strengthening/reinstatement of Regional Offices in
eight new micro-regions of the state. Consultants were contracted to improve field operations,

14
  By end-2007, the project was no longer financing rural electrification and by EOP, about 98% of the State's rural areas had
electricity coverage, a high proportion of which derived directly/indirectly from the Project.

15
  Discussions with State officials showed unequivocally that universal access to water supply was a top priority especially in the
poorest (Area 1) municipalities; by 2007, 60% of poor rural families in Ceará still lacked secure water supply. Project partnerships
with FUNASA and other agencies, and through the project's insertion in the "Living with Drought" (Convivência com a Seca)
program under its "water security" segment, were fundamental.



                                                                 8
monitor, train and/or re-structure the Municipal Councils, and facilitate direct communication
with beneficiaries including on procurement rules and procedures. MTR II was equally
influential, but its timing coincided with another electoral turnover, leaving MTR II without a
Physical Performance Study (PPS). 16 Financial management supervision, a procurement post
review, and safeguards performance analyses were conducted, and recommendations of the
recently-conducted Bank Quality at Entry Assessment (see 5.1.2) were reviewed with the STU.
Importantly, MTR II galvanized the evaluation program, supported by an M&E specialist
contracted by the STU and close supervision by Bank team evaluation specialists (see Section
2.3 and Annex 5).

2.2.7 Municipal Councils: While some 40 Municipal Councils were comparatively advanced
models of what this mechanism can potentially become, and played key roles in project
integration and resource leveraging activities described, others were more modest entities of
varying size, composition and capacity. Many Councils lacked their own operating funds 17
remaining dependent on the mayors for logistical and other help, and many - even late in the AF
­ were still waiting to receive an annual indicative budget as a planning, targeting and priority-
setting guide. Bank-recommended restructuring focused the Councils' activities on re-
establishing subproject approval and prioritization rules, strengthening linkages between poor
communities and diverse public programs, and exercising social control over the
implementation of those programs/policies. Restructuring of Councils also created "space" for
greater participation by women, youth, indigenous and Afro-descendent groups (Quilombolas)
and improved overall targeting which showed some concentration of lending in Area 3
municipalities (see Section 3.5).

2.2.8 Partnerships and Integration: The STU under both phases made effective use of
partnership arrangements to leverage financial and technical support for the project, noted in the
Borrower's Letter (December 4, 2009) as fundamental for the sound execution and management
of subprojects. The STU contracted technicians and consultants through the Inter-American
Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture (IICA), Technical Cooperation Plan. Partners and co-
participants were garnered for specific tasks.18 Bank supervision in 2006 questioned the extent
to which partner agencies had become co-executors, diluting the identity of the project, and its
association in the minds of beneficiaries with certain institutional mechanisms, procedures and
standards considered vital for social capital formation and sustainability. The State's plan to
restructure the project's field presence and consequent dismantling of the STU's field
supervision team without an immediate substitute arrangement was the primary reason,
prompting corrective guidance from the Bank to boost the STU's new decentralization strategy,
and more closely supervise partners' activities. Substantial additional resources were leveraged
through diverse project integration activities, detailed in Section 3.2 and Annex 2.

2.2.9 Productive Subprojects: Water supply and electricity demand and investments over-
shadowed productive subprojects which were about 36% and 68% of appraisal targets under the
original project and AF, respectively. The experience generated key lessons, summarized in
Section 6 and Annex 2. Agricultural mechanization (tractors and equipment) dominated
productive investments under both stages. The vast majority were rated highly by beneficiaries
­ and by the Borrower's Letter of December 4, 2009 commenting on the Bank's draft ICR - for
16
  Contracting of the Physical Performance Study and other key analyses was delayed by the change of government, transfer of the
STU to SDA, and centralization of all government procurement within the State Attorney General's office. However, all key project
studies contracted were delivered prior to closing and were essential inputs to the ICR.

     The Operational Manual permits Councils to receive up to 3% of the value of each approved subproject for operating expenses.

  Superintendency for Water Infrastructure (SOHIDRA) to supervise water systems with >50 families; Ceará Water and Sanitation
Company (CAGECE) for water systems with 50> families; and other public agencies linked to SDA such as the Ceará Technical
Assistance and Rural Extension Company (EMATERCE), Ceará Land Institute (IDACE), Agricultural Defense Agency (ADAGRI),
Service for Support to Micro and Small Business (SEBRAE) and Federal/State environmental agencies.



                                                                  9
their economic and social benefits (see Annexes 3 and 5), including ability to plant in time for
the rainy season, expansion of area planted, and job creation, but also prompted
recommendations from Bank missions regarding their technical and environmental analysis,
sustainability, and suitability for CDD/grant financing. Apart from tractors, there were many
emblematic examples of successful small-scale enterprises in fruit production and processing,
cashew nut, honey, masonry, small-scale irrigated agriculture and other activities, providing
important lessons for wider replication. Several of these enterprises won important awards, most
notably the Pingo D'Agua Project in the Forquilha Valley of Quixeramobim Municipality,
where the Project helped poverty stricken communities build sustainable, small-scale irrigated
farming with multiple benefits. Prizes were awarded respectively by the Ford, Bank of Brazil,
and Getúlio Vargas Foundations.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Management Information System: Project data collection and analysis depended on a
Management Information System (MIS), upgraded for the original project and operated and
maintained by the STU supported by contracted specialists. New features included: online
connection of the field offices to STU headquarters to strengthen decentralized data collection
and real time field data entry; quantitative variables to support impact evaluation; launching of
the MIS on the internet for public access and transparency; inclusion of community profile
variables; and, integrated financial management system and reporting capability. With some
exceptions, the MIS generally functioned well. One notable shortcoming was the failure to
establish the planned MIS-based framework for monitoring the share of rural poor receiving
grant financing for productive activities and graduating to commercial credit.

2.3.2 Evaluation studies: Evaluation performance was exceptional by most project standards,
exceeded appraisal goals and compensated for issues affecting the monitoring portion. The
STU's contracting of an evaluation specialist to conduct the process was an important catalyst.
The Project financed: a baseline study (FECAMP 2005); two Physical Performance Studies
(SDLR 2004, Tecno Metrica 2009); the Ceará portion of the Binswanger (2006) quasi-
experimental evaluation study which adopted a cost-effective approach by leveraging funding
for the study over several states; a final Evaluation Report (ACEG, 2009) updating FECAMP
(2005); several rounds of survey-based case studies and a Borrower Completion Report
(SDA/COPPE, 2009). All these products were good quality, survey-based, methodologically
mainstream and all the evaluations used control groups. The only deficiency in evaluation -
cited by the Bank Quality at Entry Assessment of the Additional Financing (QAE 2007) - is that
earlier execution of the FECAMP baseline study might have enabled investigation of income
potential/rates of return prior to engaging in the Additional Financing. See Annex 5.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards. The project was a Category B with an Environmental Management Plan
(EMP) and an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF). Subproject proposals were
systematically and routinely analyzed for consistency with the Operational Manual. Potential
environmental impacts and procedures were further tightened over time due to the exceptionally
strong/dominant ongoing demand for water supply. The STU retained in-house environmental
specialists for the duration - operating as the Environmental Safeguards Unit - and supervision
missions were vigilant regarding potential cumulative environmental impacts of multiple water
supply investments. The STU had access to State and Federal environmental agencies/expertise
as needed and the project Municipal Councils received training in environmental awareness.
Both MTR missions (2004/2007) proposed measures for boosting safeguards performance to the
STU, which was diligent in adopting key elements.19
19
  For example, extending the project's environmental "reach" to the subproject post-construction period; focusing on environmental
education and systematic institutionalization of the EMP; creating synergies between environmental initiatives involving the same
locales and beneficiaries; and developing typologies of environmental subprojects and eco-systems management.

                                                               10
2.4.2 Environmental subprojects: The Additional Financing contemplated the inclusion of
subprojects to conserve and/or recuperate the environment. Nine proposals were approved in
2008 and under implementation at closing, including recovery of mata ciliar, agro-ecological
fruit production/processing and algae cultivation. This experience highlighted the importance of
activities to educate communities about the importance and potential of such subprojects.
Demand-driven projects cannot assume that communities will spontaneously demand such
investments which are quite different to a manioc mill or water supply system which produces
rapid results. Communities need to see/understand how environmental deterioration impacts
their livelihoods and wellbeing. Incentives are needed to promote communities' interest in
improving their environment as a long-term investment in better productivity and incomes.20

2.4.3 Indigenous Peoples Participation Plan: Implementation of the IPPP was found by
MTR 2007 to be modest but accelerating. Linkages were established with other governmental
and non-governmental organizations with agreements reached regarding actions to complement
basic sanitation and housing improvement already being implemented by the National Health
Foundation (FUNASA). Multiple field seminars, workshops and consultations had already
defined areas for special focus - mostly among indigenous groups still awaiting formal
recognition by the National Indigenous Foundation (FUNAI) - explained project objectives and
rules, and surveyed indigenous communities' initial subproject demands and concerns. No
subprojects had been financed for indigenous groups by end-project but appropriate foundations
were laid for rapid progress under potential follow-up programs.

2.4.4 Financial Management. Financial management performance was generally satisfactory
throughout. The same financial management system was used by both stages of the project, with
key improvements introduced under the first. Financial Management Supervision missions rated
the project Satisfactory with the exception of a downgrade to Moderately Satisfactory by the
last mission in late 2008. The Borrower's subsequent compliance with an action plan restored
the rating to Satisfactory by closing. Risk was rated moderate due to the CDD nature of the
project and need for tight internal controls, and more training was recommended for the
community associations especially in regard to the submission of statements of expenditure.

2.4.5 Audit. Audit performance was generally satisfactory. With few exceptions, auditors'
opinions were unqualified for Financial Statements and Special Opinions. Management Letters
(Carta Gerencial) found the project's internal control systems satisfactory for project activities.
The Bank team followed up closely with the Borrower on auditors' recommendations and there
were no audit issues pending at closing.

2.4.6 Procurement. Procurement Post-Review (PPR) missions generally rated procurement
risk as average and overall procurement performance as Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory.
The main, unresolved issue was the STU's lack of technical and administrative capacity in the
selection and procurement of consultants. Detailed recommendations were made by the Bank
including the contracting of a procurement specialist well-versed in Bank procedures to speed
up processing and train the STU's procurement team, and greater use of the project MIS as a
procurement aid. These issues are being addressed in advance of possible follow-up programs.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase



20
  The ICR sees potential in promoting specific environmental training in the curriculum of primary schools, as has been done in
several Bank-supported sustainable rural development projects in the South/Southeastern states.




                                                             11
2.5.1 Transition arrangements to regular operations in the context of the Northeast CDD
projects mean execution of a subproject, its formal release to the beneficiary community
association - which, with some exceptions such as rural electrification systems, legally owns the
investment - and its operation under pre-established rules and procedures for this phase.

2.5.2 Operation and Maintenance: O&M performance was very good and the sustainability
outlook is positive. O&M procedures were mandatory in subproject proposals and criteria for
approval. Technical assistance for O&M was generally available. Several project studies
suggest that the importance of O&M is well-understood by communities. Norms and
procedures are in place for productive subprojects including payment of user fees and building
of maintenance funds for replacement of equipment and parts. In the case of tractors, users
universally pay hourly or daily fees, with non-association members paying higher amounts.
Substantial association reserves are commonly established (see Annex 5). In the case of electric
power investments, O&M is handled by the local power agency/concession firm with users
paying customary fees for service. For household water supply, beneficiaries typically pay
about 93% of all O&M fees, with the mayors contributing the balance. Arrears are <5%, rates of
satisfaction with water supply services/quality are around 96%, and beneficiaries express strong
motivation to not disrupt access. Water is, in most cases, piped directly to residences and
measured via hydrometer. One person per community is trained to read the meters and each
household is billed. 21 A model, possibly replicable, case is the modern water supply
management regime established by the Association of Pingo D'Agua in the Municipality of
Quixeramobim under which the association collects data, processes water payment accounts and
oversees O&M for project-financed water supply systems in 10 neighboring communities,
charging a fixed tariff of R$45.00 per 10,000 liters and R$0.70 for each additional 1,000 liters
(see Annex 2).

2.5.4 Next Phase: The State is already mainstreaming the project mechanisms, procedures
and standards into its regular rural poverty reduction programs and will continue to finance
similar activities with own funds. A new, potentially larger and quite different rural program
stressing competitiveness and innovation, better use of existing water resources, regional
development and public/private partnerships is under consideration by the State.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High overall relevance

3.1.1 Project development objectives remain relevant and are consistent with the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS 42667-BR, 2008-2011, discussed by the Board on May 1st. 2008),
explicitly via the challenge of reducing endemic poverty in the Northeast region through
economic inclusion which strengthens communities' productive potential and activities and their
economic integration. Basic infrastructure delivered cost-effectively to poor rural communities
is essential for productive activity, as is the social capital formation promoted by the project's
participatory institutions, i.e. community associations and Municipal Councils, and by the
design of the subproject cycle itself whereby communities prepare, implement, operate and
maintain their own investments. The integration objective has high potential to boost impact and
be a key element in regional/territorial approaches to scaling-up productive activities. Project


21
  In the case of water supply from cisterns, chafariz and other simpler facilities, O&M is problematic in some cases and community
satisfaction levels lower, due to technical and physical problems with the drilling/location of wells, and poor water quality. Water
usage via chafariz is generally controlled by an electronic ticket of R$0.10, entitling the user to an average 20 liters.




                                                                12
design remains relevant and appropriate to these objectives, and demonstrated flexibility to
incorporate innovative new elements.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Evaluation results show that project objectives were achieved or have high potential for
achievement, and that outcomes were positive. The impact on family wellbeing and incomes is
demonstrated in project-funded evaluation and case studies conducted under both phases of the
project using survey-based methodologies with control groups. Results of key project-financed
studies are summarized in Annexes 3 and 5.

Objective 1: Improving wellbeing and incomes of the rural poor through better access to basic
social and economic infrastructure and services and support for productive activities, using
proven community-driven development techniques.

3.2.2   This objective was achieved:

        In aggregate, using established community-driven demand and allocation mechanisms,
        the project financed 2,932 community subprojects of which 81.5% were basic socio-
        economic infrastructure/services (water supply 63.4%, electricity 18.1%) and
        productive (18.0%) benefiting 185,461 families or around 927,300 people.
        Some 86% of beneficiary families surveyed by FECAMP for the 2005 baseline reported
        improved wellbeing, citing: family health/hygiene benefits, material living conditions
        (housing quality, sanitation access, and durable goods ownership/use), and food access
        and quality. These results were confirmed by all evaluations cited in Annex 3 and 5.
        Importantly, benefits were being delivered to the project's targeted cohort of very poor
        rural families with exceptionally low average family incomes and educational
        attainment, high levels of adult illiteracy and a major presence of minifundistas and
        under-capitalized land reform settlements with few labor opportunities.
        Preliminary income results showed average annual household income rising 40% in the
        period from August 2003 - July 2004 with income from agricultural production up 29%,
        from consumption of own production up 53%, and from work off-farm up 27%. Some
        38% of respondents with infrastructure and productive investments reported better
        household subsistence conditions, rising to 56% for productive investments alone.
        Evaluation in 2009 confirmed earlier indications for income: average total income of
        rural electrification beneficiaries grew 66%; and productive activities generated an
        average income increase of 13%. As would be expected, for beneficiaries of (primarily)
        drinking water, income improvement was negligible.

Objective 2: Increasing the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively to meet
own needs.

3.2.3   This objective was achieved:

        Some 93% of interviewees surveyed agreed that their subproject was good for the
        community, and 82% confirmed that the investment was the community's top priority.
        Many associations were still meeting monthly, motivated by their initial subproject to
        present new demands: 83.3% in 2004 and 66.7% in 2009. Overall community
        participation in associations, and collective decision-making/activities had grown.
        Some 43% of association members interviewed had established links with other
        associations and 35% regularly conducted some form of joint activity with them,
        important indicators of sustainability.
        A high percentage of community leaders interviewed valued the project for the
        organizational stimulus it provided, and these leaders themselves were cited by


                                              13
           community members in 65% of cases as the main catalyst to forming an association,
           with union leaders, local elected officials and the mayors also described as influential.
           Results ranging from 83% to as high as 98% were obtained from interviews with
           municipal and community leaders regarding growth in institutional capacity of
           community associations since 2002, sustainability of community subprojects, and better
           results than purely "supply-driven" development, at lower cost.
           Community associations (and Municipal Councils) were viewed as inclusive,
           participatory and democratic institutions. Associations' institutional capacity to
           represent the community and resolve its problems was rated highly in 91% of cases,
           with associations seen as influential in community life, and selected democratically.
           Associations' growing strength and role in the Municipal Councils had markedly
           changed relations between rural communities and State authorities as measured by the
           rise in municipal authorities' responsiveness to community demands.

Objective 3: Enhancing local governance by greater citizen participation and transparency in
decision-making, through creation and strengthening of community associations and Municipal
Councils.

3.2.4      This objective was achieved:

           The project established and trained an additional 1,354 community associations (over
           baseline), all of which are by definition, members of the 177 participatory Municipal
           Councils. All associations with approved subprojects (2,470) received training in
           diverse subjects designed to promote participation, transparent decision-making and
           effective subproject management (see Table 2.20.1, Annex 2).
           All 177 Councils were strengthened and/or restructured to improve representation,
           overall function, targeting and decision-making.
           While Councils' level of sophistication and maturity varied, an increasing number were
           routinely discussing a range of public programs and issues affecting rural life, e.g.,
           employment, youth migration, and natural resource issues. About 20% of Councils were
           actively seeking resource leveraging opportunities for member associations under the
           project's integration goals.
           Ceará has been at the forefront of moves by the Northeast states to mold these Councils
           into multi-sector arenas for a much broader discussion of state policies and programs
           and the project outcomes suggest such efforts are paying off.
           Surveys showed that associations saw their Councils as their link to the State
           Government and as sources of information, highlighting the need for Councils to be
           well-informed about project rules, objectives and responsibilities, and especially about
           criteria for the selection and priority ranking of community demands.

Objective 4: Fostering closer integration of development policies, programs and projects at
the local level, by assisting Municipal Councils to extend their role in seeking funding, priority-
setting and decision-making over resource allocation.

3.2.5      This objective was achieved:

           The project leveraged a total US$91.3 million equivalent under its integration objective,
           a ratio of US$2.70 for each US$1.00 of Loan funds under Component 1. 22 Of this
           amount, US$13.6 million represented additional State counterpart funds processed on
           behalf of project beneficiaries through the Municipal Councils as envisaged at appraisal.
           Another US$77.7 million represented resources leveraged through high-level, formal
           partnerships established by SDA/STU on behalf of project-eligible communities with

22
  The Project Paper for the Additional Financing cites a ratio of 1:4 already achieved under the original project and a goal of 1:7 for
the Additional Financing. Evidence for the former is unavailable and the latter target was unrealistic.

                                                                 14
           Federal and State water supply and electricity programs/agencies, but not processed
           through the Municipal Councils23 (see Annex 2, Table 2.16.1).
           Councils were trained to understand and initiate integration activities and at closing,
           about 40 of the state's more advanced Municipal Councils were actively deliberating the
           resources of other programs, a burgeoning trend noted by Binswanger et al (2006).
           An agreement between the Federal Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA) and SDA
           saw all 177 project Municipal Councils receive extensive training for membership of 13
           Territorial Development Councils (TDC), tasked inter alia, with drawing up annual
           Territorial Development Plans (TDP) setting priorities and allocating resources from a
           range of Federal, State and Municipal programs.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 An economic and financial analysis was performed based on data and information
provided by a case study (SDA, 2009) of 20 productive, water supply and rural electrification
subprojects collectively representing close to 100% of all subprojects financed by end-2007.24
The methodology is detailed in Annex 3. Results are as follows:

Benefit/cost ratio: 1.42 for water supply and 1.23 for electricity subprojects. Range of 0.68 to
6.05 for productive investments studied.
IRRs: 13% for rural electrification and 18% for water supply. Range of <1% to >50% for
productive subprojects studied.
Years to recover investment: 6.2 for water supply and 8.4 for electricity. Range of <1 to 10
years for productive.25
Project IRR: Taking the total financed subprojects and assuming costs are 10% higher and
benefits 10% lower, the benefit cost ratio is around 1.16 and IRR about 11%.
Fiscal impact: The analysis relied on three sources: sales tax on home appliances purchased by
electricity beneficiaries; savings from community (vs. public) management of water supply
systems; and, net benefit of water supply and rural electrification subprojects, net of the cost of
all subprojects. Over ten years, income and savings may reach as much as 94% of the total
amount invested in financing all subprojects (R$223.3 m.).26 See Annex 3 for a more detailed
presentation including assumptions.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1      The overall outcome rating of Satisfactory is justified based on:

           Original and continuing relevance of project objectives and design to the needs of the
           rural sector in Ceará and the wider Northeast region;
           Satisfactory outcomes for all project development objectives substantiated by several
           full-scale evaluations/other studies of beneficiary wellbeing, employment, incomes and
           social capital formation;
           Preliminary indications of economic and financial efficiency and sustainability and of
           positive fiscal impact;
           Evidence of substantial institutional development in STU, Councils and associations;

23
   These included the Ceará Water and Sanitation Company (CAGECE), State Secretariat of Infrastructure (SEINFRA), Federal Luz
para Todos rural electrification and Million Cisterns programs, targeting project-eligible rural communities in Ceará.
24
   Data collection occurred at end-2007, but results were not published until June 2009.
25
   Productive subprojects were less efficient because the prior analysis of their economic and financial feasibility was insufficiently
rigorous, a project lesson.
26
   The final Evaluation (ACEG 2009) also estimated fiscal impact utilizing different assumptions. Based on current net income of
the State of Ceará in the 12 months to April 2009 (about R$8.0 billion), the study assumes that the project's impact (i.e., from water
supply, electricity and productive investments) will be small. Further assuming: (i) that beneficiaries spend what they earn
(additional annual income is estimated at R$17.47 m.); (ii) about 80% of purchases are taxed; and (iii) aggregate taxes on
consumption sum to 48%, the minimum fiscal impact would be R$1.61 m./year from additional, project-generated consumption.

                                                                 15
          Strong evidence of physical sustainability of financed investments through completion,
          operation and O&M rates and practices;
          Successful integration experience, leveraging an additional US$91.3 million; and,
          Results exceeding/meeting targets in the vast majority of project indicators.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty impact: The potential impact on poverty reduction is suggested by the results
of the economic and financial analysis outlined in 3.3 and detailed in Annex 3, as well as a
series of specific measures of improved family income and wellbeing shown in project
evaluation studies. The dominance of water supply and electricity investments has positioned a
large number of poor rural families for more complex productive activities, both farm and non-
farm. Social capital formation has also prepared beneficiaries to demand access to a range of
Federal and State programs. Their organizational levels and membership of the Municipal
Councils - which now, in turn, participate in Territorial Development Councils - increase their
potential to receive and benefit from other services, programs and policies.

3.5.2 Targeting: Poverty targeting deviated from expectations but was generally satisfactory
and stronger under the AF. Better-off Area 3 municipalities (the term "better-off" being relative
given that targeted populations in all three designated Areas qualified on income/other grounds
as poor) obtained more subprojects than the very poorest Area 1 municipalities under both
phases (see Annex 2). 27 The main reasons were: (a) many municipalities showing a
concentration of subprojects housed large numbers of agrarian reform settlements covered by
partnership agreements between the Federal Government's National Institute for Colonization
and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and the State Government, designed to intensify project
investments in those areas; (b) targeted mobilization and organization (including information
dissemination) are crucial to the ability of vulnerable communities to access project benefits
under CDD projects and such activities were not sufficiently intensive prior to 2006; and, (c)
capacity problems in some Councils and their imprecise understanding of project rules,
including correct criteria for subproject selection and approval, may have contributed. The
Additional Financing showed marked improvement due to the STU's intensive efforts to
address/reverse this trend through strategic mobilization, training and awareness-building,
especially of Councils and vulnerable cohorts in the 40 poorest municipalities, e.g., ethnic
groups, rustic fishing communities, women and youth.

3.5.3 Gender and Youth: Women's direct involvement in association leadership gained
traction over time and especially under the AF due to the STU's vigorous mobilization strategy.
Under the original project, 21% of all beneficiary families belonged to female-headed
associations, remaining stable under the AF. By end-project, 20% of all associations were led
by women and about 20% of Municipal Councils had women in leadership roles. About 10% of
all productive subprojects were proposed, fully-managed and staffed by women. Project actions
supporting youth included regional seminars, definition of municipalities with low Social
Development Indices, and a partnership between the project and the National Land Reform
Program (Programa Nacional de Crédito Fundiário - PNCF) to mobilize young settler families
and identify land reform associations with interest in/potential to benefit from project-sponsored
subprojects. Groups were identified, proposals presented and subprojects were recently started.




27
  Targeting of Areas 1-3 was based on the Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-M) under the original project and the State's
Social Development Index under the AF. Use of HDI-M was common in poverty targeting but its measurement every 10 years was
inconvenient for State data collection and the bi-annually-measured SDI was preferred for the AF.



                                                             16
3.5.4 Ethnic Groups: Quilombola (Afro-descendent) communities benefited from project
investments but the MIS did not track them as a distinct cohort and no specific data is available.
Quilombola groups are also benefiting from additional resources provided by a grant of
US$375,589 (now effective) from the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) to Ceará and
two other Northeast states (Bahia and Pernambuco). For indigenous peoples, see 2.4.3.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.5 The project financed a massive amount of training, most of which was conducted under
the Additional Financing. Its impact on the Municipal Councils and community associations
was largely positive and is summarized in Annex 5. The STU is an experienced body with a
highly professional, stable technical and administrative core team. Evidence of its institutional
development can be seen in its ability to surmount the difficulties associated with government
turnover, navigate shifting rural strategies, embrace innovation, coordinate a complex series of
institutional partnerships on behalf of the project, fully disburse two loans in a timely manner,
proactively support leveraging of additional resources, and exceed all key project targets.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.6 As with its predecessor (RPAP), the project became a vehicle for important innovations
including the Comércio Justo (Fair Trade) program promoting sales of small-farm products to
national and international markets; initial implementation of a territorial development strategy;
engagement with Quilombola (Afro-descendent communities) through educational/cultural
consultation and outreach programs; and the "arranjos produtivos" program in selected regions
of the State.28

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 The project financed a baseline and impact evaluations, two Physical Performance
Studies (PPS), several sets of case studies and a Borrower Completion Report, all of which were
survey-based. The following briefly summarizes key findings of the three evaluations with a
more detailed presentation in Annex 5 and appendix to Annex 3.

3.6.2 FECAMP (2005):29 This baseline/evaluation covered three Northeast States - Ceará,
Pernambuco and Bahia - and in Ceará sampled 629 beneficiaries and a control group of 420
families. The baseline portion confirmed that 70% of the rural population was below the poverty
line, with a profile showing extreme poverty and deprivation. Access to basic services was low,
adult illiteracy was high, average family income was about R$499/month or just over
US$1.00/day with a high concentration of families in the lowest ranges. This study had a
galvanizing effect on the project by showing that the poorest segments of the rural population,
those with lowest IDH-M, were being reached. Case studies included in this evaluation showed
that 86% of beneficiaries had significantly improved living conditions from 2000 (pre-project)
to 2002/2003. Income results were promising and a range of variables was very positive for
social capital gains.
28
   The arranjos produtivos strategy was adopted in 2003 to revitalize the demand for and processing of productive subprojects.
SDLR/STU and other secretariats and partner agencies re-evaluated productive proposals to determine which would fit the new
strategy. Conditions were established to evaluate productive proposals to ensure their viability/sustainability: technical assistance
and management plan; source of recurrent financing; training plan; and, marketing plan and economic, financial and social analysis.
In response to producers' perennial calls for access to credit, the State Secretariat for Labor and Business (SETE) created a
R$500,000 fund which was expected by participating banks to leverage ten times this value. SETE also created the "Compra da
Gente" program to promote the direct sale of local products to large and medium firms. The Bank recommended linking these
activities with the Comércio Ético e Solidário program to avoid duplication and dispersion of resources.

29
  The study is in two parts: (i) Evolução do Perfil Socioeconômico dos Beneficiários e Efeitos Imediatos dos Projetos - Relatório
de Consultoria Técnica. Federal University of Campinas, São Paulo (FECAMP), March 2005; and (ii) Perfil Socioeconômico da
População Beneficiaria Fase II - Relatório de Consultoria Técnica, FECAMP, March 2005. For part (i) data was collected for the
period 12 months immediately before receipt of the subproject, then for the period August 2003 to July 2004.


                                                                17
3.6.3 Binswanger et al. (2006): Research covered 864 households in 108 communities and
90 municipalities in the Northeast States of Ceará, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte, sampling.
18 treatment (beneficiaries) and 18 control communities (waiting groups) in each state. The
study assessed the accumulation of per capita household assets and found positive effects for all
models in Ceará. Further, access to water supply rose markedly, housing conditions improved,
and electricity access increased. Health improved significantly: infant mortality fell by 38% and
the incidence of diarrhea fell by 70%. Chagas disease, asthma, hepatitis and dengue all declined
sharply among beneficiaries in the period. All results indicated strong impacts on social capital
formation, derived from the creation of associations and execution of subprojects.

3.6.4 ACEG 2009): The Associação Científica de Estudos Agrários (ACEG) of the Federal
University of Ceará returned to the same cohorts (treatment and control) surveyed by FECAMP
(2005), focusing on impact of water supply, electricity and productive investments. Case studies
were also conducted. The project was found to be achieving the results expected for income
generation, with positive signals for income derived from productive subprojects. Project
beneficiaries obtained an average income of R$980.60 more than the control group. Projected
income growth (monetary) attributable directly to the project averaged R$1,205/family from
productive, and R$1,790/family from electricity connection. Other improvements included
physical capital, access to consumer goods, residential conditions, and levels of social capital.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.0.1   Sustainability: Factors likely to promote sustainability include:

        Extensive evidence that community O&M practices are satisfactory and appropriate for
        the types of subprojects financed, and that the importance of O&M is well-understood;
        Evidence of social capital formation which can be leveraged for more complex and
        diverse investment activities, e.g., productive;
        The Borrower Letter (December 4, 2009) stresses the fundamental importance of
        technical assistance and training delivered to the Councils, associations and the STU
        itself, in developing social capital as a key element of project sustainability;
        Municipal Councils/CMDS restructured, trained and operational in all 177 rural
        municipalities, and now instrumental in the planning and deliberations of State
        Territorial Development Councils; and,
        Mainstreaming of the project mechanisms and institutions through own-financing.

 4.0.2 Environmental management: The environmental integrity of subprojects was
supported by the following:

        Environmental screening processes, established for all proposals, with access through
        co-participation arrangements, to environmental expertise in specific cases;
        Standard subproject designs for all commonly-demanded subprojects, with design
        features for potential environmental issues, e.g., waste disposal for manioc mills;
        In-house environmental professionals in the STU;
        Environmental awareness built into training programs for associations and Councils;
        Close attention to environmental compliance during Bank supervision missions
        including physical inspection of subprojects in the field; and,
        Introduction of/training for a new category of environmental/ecological subprojects.
        The Borrower's Letter reflects institutional internalization of environmental
        conservation noting the obligation of all subprojects, based on their type/nature, to
        respect the rules governing the use/preservation of the environment.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1.    The Moderately Satisfactory rating is based on the following:

Positive elements:
    Close collaboration between the Bank and Borrower during the preparation phase of
        both operations, i.e. client orientation;
    Calibration of project design to the lessons of previous similar projects in Ceará and
        other Northeast states and relevance to the Borrower's rural priorities/strategy;
    Incorporation of innovative elements designed to strengthen impact, improve targeting,
        promote integration and resource leveraging, and respond to Bank concerns about the
        appropriate use of grant financing; and,
    Satisfactory QAE rating for the Additional Financing operation
Negative elements:
    Inadequate design of PDO performance and intermediate impact indicators;
    Large number of impact indicators; and
    Lack of baseline data for the original project, not remedied during preparation of the
        Additional Financing even with evaluations and data available.

5.1.2 Quality at Entry Assessment (QAE):30 A QAE (2007) on the Additional Financing
segment rated the overall project as Satisfactory. Primary results were as follows: (a) strategic
relevance and approach, poverty, gender and social development, and policy/institutional
arrangements rated Highly Satisfactory; (b) all other dimensions rated Satisfactory, and
fiduciary aspects Moderately Satisfactory. Bank inputs and processes were rated Satisfactory.
Project strengths were cited as: objectives fully consistent with country and sector strategies;
exemplary partnership arrangements with other domestic donors; PDO clear, of broad scope but
realistic; outstanding level of country and sector knowledge; clearly defined roles of
implementation agencies and proven capacity; and, very good monitoring arrangements. The
primary area needing improvement was the lack of explicit risk assessment of financial
management given the community-based nature of the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3     The rating is based on the following:

          Supervision missions were timely, more frequent at critical periods, well-prepared and
          documented. The project absorbed 129 staff weeks of supervision, on par with country
          norms for the type of project and length. Missions always included randomized field
          visits to communities, Municipal Councils and subprojects;
          Aide Memoires were focused on key elements of project design and objectives,
          including fiduciary and safeguards performance. Time-bound actions expected of the
          Borrower were followed up and outcomes reported.;

30
   The Datasheet, Section C3, shows that no QAE was conducted. The Bank system enters such information automatically and
treats the original project as the overriding entity. The QAE assessment was done for the Additional Financing only, and does not
therefore appear in the system.



                                                              19
           Consistent pressure was put on the STU to advance the evaluation agenda with regular
           guidance provided to the STU by the Team's evaluation specialist. Evaluation
           performance was outstanding as a direct result;
           Mid-term reviews were timely, comprehensive and all findings/recommendations were
           discussed with the STU team, with documented follow-up;
           Team members worked with both outgoing and incoming administrations to facilitate
           smooth transitions with minimum disruption to the project;
           Consistent focus on Financial Management and Procurement supervision/follow-up;
           and,
           Forceful approach to obtaining intervention from the State Governor in 2003 to alleviate
           opposition to the project from the new Borrower secretariat. The Bank team also
           stepped in rapidly in the latter stages to provide corrective guidance involving the STU
           accelerating its new decentralization strategy and more closely supervising partners'
           activities when issues of field oversight arose.

5.1.4 The main caveats applying to supervision quality - not seen as affecting the overall
supervision rating - include the need for a stronger response to continued STU resistance on the
matter of annual indicative budgets for Councils, and ensuring Councils accessed available
funds for operating expenses, as per the Operational Manual. Further, graduation - the longer-
term, structured aspects envisaged in the PAD - merited more sustained attention.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.5 Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the Appendix A of
the ICR Guidelines (OPCS, August 2006, and updated June 05, 2007) 31 . Therefore, in
consideration of the ratings for preparation and supervision (above), the overall rating is
considered moderately satisfactory. Further, although the project Team's supervision
performance was very strong, it was not sufficient to balance out the over-estimated indicators
for productive investments, vis-à-vis the reality of acute water scarcity affecting 90% of the
State territory and consequently, the productive capacity of poor, rural communities.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 The Borrower's performance during preparation and implementation is rated
satisfactory based on the following:
      Successive State Governments were committed to the project and its objectives as an
         integral element of their respective Multi-year Development Plans and rural strategies;
      Government under-scored its commitment by injecting some US$13.6 million of
         additional counterpart resources and leveraging another US$77.7 million from diverse
         programs/agencies to further expand project coverage and intensify the focus on the
         most vulnerable groups;
      Despite government turnover, the fundamental thrust of the state's rural strategy and
         pro-poor orientation did not change; and,


31
   When the rating for one dimension is in the satisfactory range while the rating for the other dimension is in the unsatisfactory
range, the rating for overall Bank Performance normally depends on the Outcome rating. Thus, overall Bank Performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory IF Outcome is rated in the satisfactory range or Moderately Unsatisfactory IF Outcome is rated in the
unsatisfactory range, except when Bank performance did not significantly affect the particular outcome.




                                                                 20
        Government aggressively pursued preparation and negotiation of the Additional
        Financing and in a similar vein, is actively developing a new and larger follow-on
        program with progressive objectives.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2 As noted earlier, three separate state secretariats were responsible for the project over its
lifespan and this had both positive and negative institutional, operational and strategic impacts
on project implementation. The satisfactory rating reflects performance whereby the STU:

        Prevailed, due to technical and operational experience, over disruptive effects of
        government turnover and shifting rural strategy;
        Managed to ensure full and timely disbursement of both Loans, and achieved and/or
        exceeded all project objectives and targets;
        Aggressively pursued and successfully utilized partnerships to leverage technical,
        operational and financial support for the project;
        Explored and expanded approaches to productive investments under the Fair Trade
        initiative, Comércio Ético e Solidário, and arranjos produtivos, consistent with its
        longstanding track record of supporting innovation;
        Initiated a territorial development strategy and institutions with participation of project
        Municipal Councils;
        Ensured that Municipal Councils were established/trained in all 177 project-eligible
        municipalities;
        Engaged with Quilombola (Afro-descendent) and ethnic communities through
        awareness-building, educational and cultural programs; and,
        Maintained a cooperative and committed relationship with the Bank throughout.

5.2.3 These major achievements are held to outweigh several negative aspects including:
resistance to providing the Municipal Councils with an indicative annual budget or advising
Councils on their right to operating funds under the Operational Manual; and slow, bureaucratic
handling of consultant contracts which delayed project M&E exercises, although all expected
evaluation studies were delivered and are generally of high quality. On balance the rating is
Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.4 The overall Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory on balance, based on very
strong and at times exceptional performance in key project actions/situations noted in 5.2.1 and
5.2.2. Weaknesses described are not considered of sufficient weight to reduce the overall rating.

6. Lessons Learned

Targeting of benefits to the poorest requires an operational strategy. Targeting of the
poorest goes well beyond the technical, data-based definition of where the poorest groups are
located based on poverty indices and differentiated allocation of resources. An operational
strategy is needed to reach them through mobilization and organization which enables them to
access the project on a more equal footing from the outset. Systematic consultation and
information dissemination should be initiated well before project effectiveness.

Successful integration needs an aggressive, multi-pronged approach. The project showed
that decentralized integration of development programs and policies transparently and cost-
effectively through the Municipal Council mechanism is one of several potential approaches to

                                                21
leveraging additional resources and expertise for a poverty-targeted population. Concentrated
efforts to maximize the benefits of integration call for pro-activity in establishing a diverse
network of partnerships, anchored within a consistent, pro-poor sector strategy which maintains
focus on the ultimate beneficiaries. Integration merits greater Bank support for its longer-term
institutional and operational evolution, and to monitoring and evaluating its implementation,
outcomes and impact.

Preparation and analysis of small-scale productive ventures needs equal rigor. Small scale
productive ventures, grant-financed, require a business plan, technical and financial analysis,
up-front marketing arrangements and formal training for the operational phase exactly as with
larger ventures. Training and technical assistance for productive subprojects are crucial inputs.
Beneficiaries need to get it right the first time under a one-time grant financing opportunity to
jump-start employment and income generation, in addition to using the experience to qualify for
mainstream credit. To avoid "reinventing the wheel", successful productive subprojects should
be studied carefully to determine critical features, replicated where feasible and appropriate, and
monitored over time to assess evolution and lessons. A databank (case studies) of such
experiences can leverage their benefits longer-term and with wide geographic application
(Annex 2).

Environmental investments need up-front attention to awareness-building. Demand-driven
projects cannot assume that communities will spontaneously seek environmental investments
which are quite different to a manioc mill or water supply system which produces rapid,
tangible results. Communities need to see/understand how environmental deterioration impacts
their livelihoods and wellbeing and the types of investments which can potentially mitigate such
damage, in addition to investments which use green technologies or provide environmental
services while creating jobs and income. Incentives might include financial where appropriate,
to promote community interest in improving the environment as a long-term investment in
better productivity and incomes.32

Monitoring and maintenance of investments. While the project demonstrated generally
strong performance on operation and maintenance, especially in the willingness of communities
to pay appropriate user fees, demand driven projects need to ensure that all community
associations have the same/adequate levels of organization to successfully conduct maintenance
activities, especially of water supply subprojects. In Ceará, the Borrower has created a GPS
database with photographs of all subprojects and follow-up supervision of such subprojects is
planned through State agencies including EMATERCE, SOHIDRA and CAGECE.

In summary, the overall experience, its lessons and evaluations demonstrate unequivocally that
poor rural communities have the capacity to decide their priorities, and prepare, execute, operate
and maintain their investments with funds transferred directly to the association bank account.
Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making and implementation to states and
localities including community organizations, improves efficiency and accountability, builds
social capital and achieves better overall results. CDD requires a longer-term commitment to
reap its full social and economic benefits, especially from productive investments.




32
  The ICR sees potential in promoting environmental training in the curriculum of local schools, and/or financial incentives to
induce environmental recovery activities and tide producers through the suspension of their normal agricultural activities until such
adaptations/changes become effective, as per Bank-supported sustainable rural development projects in the Southern states.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1     The following shows physical outputs by component with separate discussions on
productive subprojects and targeting performance.

2.2     Component 1: Community Subprojects: (OP US$45.00 million, AF US$44.50
million, 90% and 89% of total estimated cost, respectively) was to finance matching grants to
organized rural community associations for respectively, about 2,000 and 1,300 small-scale
investment subprojects (under original project and Additional Financing respectively)
categorized as infrastructure, productive and social. New types of investments specified in the
Additional Financing included health, education, environment and culture. Subprojects were
financed under three subprograms - PAC (State Community Schemes), FUMAC (Municipal
Community Schemes) and FUMAC-P (Pilot Municipal Community Funds - of varying degrees
of decentralization and autonomy. PAC was expected to absorb about 10% of all subprojects
(up to US$4.5 m.) of total Component 1 costs, FUMAC about 80% (US$36.0 m.) and FUMAC-
P about 10% (US$4.5 m.). PAC was the least decentralized and already being phased out in
most Northeast states including Ceará, while FUMAC-P was the most advanced in giving each
Council its own annual budget to manage.33

2.3      The project financed a total 2,932 subprojects, including 317 additional investments
using State counterpart resources exclusively, benefiting a total 185,461 families, including
21,355 families benefiting from the State's own-financing. Total cost of Component 1 was about
US$45.08 m. under the original project (105.3% of appraisal estimate) and US$59.46 m. (about
144% of appraisal estimate) under the Additional Financing, including the State's additional
counterpart contributions of US$13.6 m. under the second phase and beneficiaries' 10% cost-
share. Utilization of the Loan for Component 1 was US$33.38 million, 99% of the appraisal
allocation under the original project, and US$33.88 million, 110% of the original appraisal
allocation under the Additional Financing. See Annex 1. The original project utilized all three
funding mechanisms (see ff. 30), while 100% of subprojects were channeled through the
FUMAC Municipal Councils in the case of the Additional Financing. Table 2.1 below shows

Types of subprojects:

33
  Under FUMAC, community associations participate in representative Municipal Councils with 80% majority membership of
beneficiaries and civil society, and 20% of municipal authorities and other entities. The Councils meet regularly to debate
community subproject proposals and set priorities, based on an indicative annual budget determined by the STU. Approved
subprojects are sent to the STU for final technical and environmental analysis and approval. Funds are transferred directly to the
beneficiary association. In Ceará, many pre-existing Municipal Sustainable Development Councils (CMDS) were adapted to project
rules for representation (80/20 etc.) and became FUMAC Councils. FUMAC-P Councils were established as a pilot to determine
the utility and feasibility of allocating a number of more advanced Councils an annual budget to manage - based on an Annual
Operating Plan (POA). As with the other NE states, FUMAC-P did not function as expected and all were eventually devolved to the
original FUMAC design. The main reason was that the NE State Governments never felt comfortable with the decentralization of
actual funds management to these Councils. Further, some FUMAC-P tended to finance very small subprojects designed to reach
the maximum number of communities, resulting in low and localized impact. Finally, under PAC, community associations submit
subproject proposals directly to the State Technical Unit which transfers funds directly to the associations for approved subproject.
There is no representative Municipal Council. This mechanism was a holdover from an earlier period, and utilized by communities
in municipalities which had difficulty - for political/other reasons - in forming a Municipal Council. It is the least decentralized and
studies have shown, has the least impact on social capital formation.

2.4      Infrastructure: Community demand was skewed heavily towards water supply
(primarily drinking water) and electricity which greatly exceeded appraisal estimates under both
phases. This was consistent with the well-established pattern throughout the Northeast of rural
communities satisfying urgent needs for basic services before seeking productive investments,
and with the strategy of the State of Ceará under three successive administrations for meeting
such demand by maximizing coverage in rural areas. The institutional setting - community
associations, the Municipal Councils and State authorities/policies agreed that drinking water
and energy were top priorities and ensured that demands were met. The average cost of
infrastructure subprojects over the two project phases was US$34,430, well below the
US$50,000 limit. Each water supply subproject benefited an average 77 families and
electrification, 42 families. Key indicators are shown below:

Productive Subprojects:

2.5      The effort to maximize coverage of both water supply and electricity tended to over-
shadow productive subprojects which reached about 52% and 80% respectively of appraisal
targets under the OP and AF. Average cost of productive investments was US$36,613 and they
benefited an average 37 families each. The experience generated many lessons, explained
candidly by Physical Performance Studies, case studies, the final Evaluation and the Borrower
Completion Report. The following highlights key findings. Additional information on
productive subprojects can be found in the appendix to Annex 3.

2.6     Tractors: The project financed 531 productive subprojects of which 371 or 70% were
agricultural mechanization (tractors and equipment), the vast majority of which were rated
highly by beneficiaries for their economic and social benefits which included: ability to prepare
land in time for rains; job creation capacity (average 29 new jobs/tractor); increase in area
planted (net gain of 23.0 ha per subproject); and, capacity to generate substantial community
savings from rental fees charged for tractor operation and maintenance, examples of which are
noted in several project studies including the Physical Performance Study (Tecno Metrica 2009).
Such savings are frequently applied by communities to new investments. The average rate of
return on tractors studied is 18%. In general, all studies found that beneficiary communities (and
non-community users) were using a pay-for-service scheme (plan required for subproject
approval) and that O&M performance and thus sustainability, were strong.

2.7      Such subprojects also prompted specific recommendations from Bank missions and
case/performance studies regarding their technical and environmental analysis/sustainability.
There are also some concerns voiced in the Bank about whether tractors should be financed by
grant funds under a CDD project. Field observation showed that a community's acquisition of a
tractor/equipment should be seen as an opportunity to diversify cropping systems and introduce
changes to traditional farming methods, implying beneficiaries' access to follow-up technical
assistance as an integral part of the mechanization "package". Special care is also needed to
ensure environmental sustainability of tractors in semi-arid areas with fragile soils and
topographic issues. Further, tractor subprojects require careful analysis to avoid certain pitfalls

                                                27
such as low utilization levels due to climatic conditions and/or maintenance costs, and careful
assessment of demand validity. Priority for tractors ought to be - to the extent possible - linked
to other productive subprojects with guaranteed markets and environmental sustainability.

2.8       Success stories: There were many emblematic examples of successful small-scale
enterprises in fruit production and processing, cashew nut, honey, masonry, small-scale irrigated
agriculture and other activities, providing important lessons for wider replication. Several of
these experiences won important awards, most notably the Pingo D'Agua Project in the
Forquilha Valley of Quixeramobim Municipality, where the Project helped poverty stricken
communities build sustainable, small-scale irrigated farming with multiple benefits, and
winning prizes awarded by the Ford, Bank of Brazil, and Getúlio Vargas Foundations. Other
successful productive ventures in honey and cashew financed under the previous project were
still fully operational and in the case of Barreira and Pacajus Municipalities, marketing product
domestically and exporting to the United States and Europe. Local crafts of high quality and
diversity also have high potential and some have already established domestic and export buyers.
Employment and income creation potential is also seen in fruits, fish farming, goats and sheep,
irrigated agriculture, and flowers.

2.9     Guidelines for productive subprojects: Evidence suggests that productive subprojects
represented special analytical, technical and operational challenges for the STU and this alone,
may have suppressed their higher representation in the subproject portfolio regardless of the
high demand for basic infrastructure. Any follow-on operation would need to address these
elements. The following are practical guidelines emerging from the project:

        Small scale, grant financed productive ventures require a business plan, up-front
        marketing arrangements and formal training for the operational phase in the same way
        as larger ventures.

        The group to be financed should be well-organized and already have accumulated
        experience/familiarity with the product in question, a business "vision" and adequate
        knowledge of potential markets;

        Financing can cover all or part of the subproject, including infrastructure. In this
        manner, members of the group can seek complementary financing from commercial
        banks, especially via the National Family Agriculture Program (PRONAF), to make a
        productive venture viable;

        Productive subprojects can be agricultural and non-agricultural, and should preferably
        be of the "mixed" type involving individual production but joint processing and
        marketing, the latter to build the scale needed to sell in larger markets. The question of
        markets needs special focus with analysis of the alternatives - local, regional, national
        and external.

        Productive ventures in poor rural areas should boost production diversification, multiple
        activities and a degree of independence from external inputs, and build productive
        chains/linkages. Criteria for establishing subproject priority should take into account
        technological choices for sustainable farming, as opposed to financing crops or animals
        in isolation and which do not observe/exploit the interface between productive systems.

        The STU needs a team of specialists dedicated to analyzing productive subprojects and
        needs to strengthen strategic partnerships for joint action to find business solutions and
        reduce risk;




                                               28
       Technical assistance needs to be assured for the total phase of implementation,
       operation and consolidation. Further, both Bank and Borrower have important follow-
       up responsibilities to ensure that a training plan is included at the proposal phase of
       productive subprojects and that it is rigorously implemented. Tecno Metrica (2009)
       found examples of completed productive facilities either lying idle or under-utilized due
       to a lack of training and technical assistance to beneficiaries for the operational phase.
       This has implications given that beneficiaries of one-time, grant-financed productive
       ventures need to get it right, not only to jump-start employment and income generation,
       but to leverage this experience and track record to qualify for mainstream credit.

       To avoid "reinventing the wheel", successful productive subprojects should be studied
       carefully to determine their critical features, replicated where feasible and appropriate,
       and monitored over time to assess their evolution and lessons. A databank of case
       studies of such experiences can have longer-term benefits and potentially wide
       geographic application.

Box 1: Pingo D'Agua ­ Social Inclusion in the Dry-Lands of Quixeramobim

The Forquilha Valley, 250 km from the State capital of Fortaleza, is populated with small-scale rural
producers living in villages and depending traditionally on rain-fed, subsistence-agriculture. Without
income, many valley residents had migrated to larger centers with little hope of real change. There was
a desperate need for alternatives to sustain families on the land. In the early 1990s, the economy of the
Quixeramobim area had stagnated following the golden years of the cotton/dairy boom affecting the
entire state. Family income fell, exacerbated by long periods of drought. Despite its beauty and natural
resources, the Valley had major difficulties and was seen as a "prison" by rural residents. Under the
leadership of Antonio Martins de Franca, small producer, an association was formed in 1987 to
overcome hunger and misery. Various specialists ­ geologists, anthropologists and academics ­ were
brought in to provide support and a vision for the region's future, and cooperation agreements were
signed. Meetings were held between residents and partners, innovative ideas flowed, and local people
felt free to voice their demands. The idea of prospecting for water and starting irrigated fruit production
rapidly gained traction. In 1998, Pingo D'Agua was formally initiated, financed by the World Bank-
supported Sao José Project (Ceará Rural Poverty Alleviation Project) with technical assistance from the
Inter-American Institute for Agricultural Cooperation (IICA). Water was located, farmers commenced
production and incomes improved.

To combat drought, the project demonstrated how, with cooperation, technology, participatory
management, resources, and partnership networks, a historic problem such as lack of water can be
resolved in the dry-lands (sertão) of Northeast Brazil. A new technique for drilling wells changed the
life of Sertão families in Quixeramobim. Well placement was marked using aerial photographs. With
tube-well technology, it was possible to drill down over 10 meters, with flow varying from 25,000 to
92,000 liters/hour. The explanation for such abundant flow in the sub-soils of dry riverbeds is as
follows: during the rainy season, most of the water flows through river channels where the subsoil is
formed from layers of clay and coarse sand ­ alluvial soils ­ which are permeable, permitting the run-
off to form large underground repositories known in the Sertão as cacimbas (water-holes). The method
normally used by local people meant they often did not find the principal "vein" and thus many wells
had only scant flow. Outside these areas, the problem was even more serious. Farmers spent months of
frustration trying to locate such zones in crystalline rock formations.

It was a revelation to everyone that horticultural products such as papaya, banana, watermelon, passion-
fruit, peppers and tomatoes could thrive in arid soil with the adoption of an untried technology using
subterranean water - at low cost and easy access ­ through the manual drilling of artisanal tube-wells in
alluvial areas. Pingo D'Agua started with 27 pioneering small farmers distributed in 17 villages, who
were able to develop subsistence plots, improve family food supply/diet and ensure income and
subsistence from increasing area farmed and land productivity. Farmers provided their own labor.
Drilling equipment was home-made of simple design and of steel, and technologically appropriate.
Good maintenance ensured that each piece of equipment could dig hundreds of wells. Besides
providing the technology, project partners provided technical oversight and training. Production was
transported to processing enterprises in Quixeramobim, to markets, and to storage areas for school


                                                   29
 feeding programs. The valley became an oasis in the middle of the caatinga and a model for similar
 areas. The change in community wellbeing was radical.

 Project financing was basically for technical personnel representing expenditures of about
 R$10,000/month, about R$20,000 for equipment, and a unit cost per well of R$200 per producer.
 Communities developed sustainable irrigation projects using drip and micro-aspersion (hence the name
 Pingo D'Agua). Average income per hectare/family in 2008 was R$700. Families were surprised to see
 first-hand that their land could produce with "drops of water". Helano Nogueira now produces several
 melon crops per year, sells them all and has markedly improved resources available to support his
 family. "Everything before was hunger and misery, nothing worked for us". He was one of the
 pioneers in planting fruits. Part of the water supplies household needs while the rest irrigates his
 subsistence plot and fruit trees. His well flows at 28,000 liters/hour, and has enabled him to triple area
 under production and add new crops.

 The president of the Forquilha Producers Association, Deusimar Candido, confirmed that the water
 supply at any given time is sufficient for at least two years and is renovated during the rainy season. He
 is selling his produce locally and in markets in the state capital of Fortaleza. He is one of the local
 small farmers who had abandoned his property and was living in Sao Paulo, but returned after 14 years
 to plant fruit and change his life once he heard about the Pingo D'Agua Project. His property is
 generating employment and income. Papaya, sweet potato and tomatoes are generating R$1,000/week
 with regular water supply. Household water supply for domestic use is described as regular and clean.

 The Pingo D'Agua Project has been awarded prizes for innovation: Merit Honor for Fruit Culture from
 the Ceará Fruit Institute (FRUTAL); certified for its Social Technology by the Bank of Brazil
 Foundation; and, was a finalist in the Public Management and Citizenship Program of the Getúlio
 Vargas Foundation which placed it in the top 50 of some 756 projects selected Brazil-wide.

Targeting:

2.10     Project targeting followed a somewhat different path than planned at appraisal with
Area 3 municipalities obtaining three times as many subprojects as the poorest municipalities in
Area 1 under the first phase, and just under double those of Area 1 under the Additional
Financing. The concept of "better-off" is relative given that eligible rural populations in all three
areas qualified as "poor" under project income, wellbeing and asset parameters. A key factor in
this outcome was that many municipalities with a concentration of subprojects housed
significant numbers of agrarian reform settlements which came within the scope of partnership
agreements between the Federal Government/National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian
Reform (INCRA) and State Government designed to intensify project investments in those areas.
Other factors included the obstacle to access in Area 1 represented by very poor communities'
lack of organization and asymmetric access to information, the likelihood of some targeting
laxness among weaker Municipal Councils, and pressures felt by some Councils prior to two
elections to approve larger numbers of subprojects than would normally be processed in a
certain period.

2.11     Data for the AF stage show improvement based on the Bank Mid-term Review's call for
greater effort by the STU to bring Area 1 municipalities into the project, and the strong strategic
focus of STU training events on the poorest cohorts from 2006 onwards. Intensive mobilization
and training were recommended with priority for Area 1 municipalities, for associations which
had yet to participate, and for priority poor groups, e.g., ethnic, rustic fishing communities,
women and youth. Even so, in the case of women and youth for example, the 2007 Mid-term
Review for the Additional Financing found that actions implemented were quite limited and
mostly pilots, but had considerable potential. Project actions supporting youth began in 2005
and involved regional seminars, definition of municipalities with low Social Development
Indices, and a partnership between the project and the National Land Reform Program (PNCF)
to mobilize young people and identify land reform associations linked to the PNCF which could
possibly have their existing investment funds (SICs) increased through project-sponsored
subprojects. At closing, complications had arisen in regard to melding project resources with

                                                    30
resources from other (land reform) projects already held by these groups in special funds for on-
farm/settlement investments. Actions on behalf of ethnic groups were focused heavily on laying
the groundwork for their inclusion in socially and culturally appropriate ways. Subsequently,
groups were identified, proposals were presented and approved and implementation started prior
to project closing and is ongoing, largely with State's own funds.

Integration:

2.13    The Additional Financing project successfully leveraged a total of US$91.3 million
under its integration objective, a ratio of US$2.70 for each US$1.00 of Loan funds under
Component 1, well short of the projected (and quite unrealistic) ratio of 1:7 but a striking
achievement nonetheless. 34 Of this amount, US$13.6 million represent additional State
counterpart funds processed on behalf of project beneficiaries through the Municipal Councils
as envisaged at appraisal, while US$77.7 million represent resources leveraged through
partnerships established by SDA/STU with Federal and State water supply and electricity
programs/agencies (see Table 2.14.1 below), targeting project-eligible rural communities state-
wide but not processed through the Municipal Councils. High level partnerships/agreements
were established between SDA/STU and agencies such as the Ceará Water and Sanitation
Company (CAGECE) and the State Secretariat of Infrastructure (SEINFRA), as well as the
Federal Luz para Todos and Million Cisterns programs, to benefit project-eligible communities
under the State's strategic goals for water and energy coverage.

2.14    Integration was also strengthened through an agreement between the Federal Ministry
of Agrarian Development (MDA) and SDA under which all 177 project Municipal Councils
now belong to one or other of 13 Territorial Development Councils (TDC), tasked inter alia,
with drawing up annual Territorial Development Plans (TDP) setting priorities and allocating
resources from a range of federal, state and municipal programs. Quite independently of the
State's new territorial strategy, about 40 more advanced Municipal Councils were actively

34
  Evidence was not strong at appraisal of either the original project or the Additional Financing that this was already
happening to any degree or that the Councils in Ceará had the capacity to handle integration as envisaged. The
Project Paper for the Additional Financing cites a ratio of 1:4 already achieved under the original project.

deliberating the resources of other programs at closing, an emerging trend noted by Binswanger
et al (2006) and which can be exploited under any follow-on operation.

2.15    Local level integration of programs and policies through the Councils was more
complex technically and operationally than it seemed at appraisal of either stage of the project.
In practice, integration also proved to be a richer and more dynamic process extending
operationally well beyond the Councils which turned out to be one institutional element among
several with potential to support the project's target population, under the project "umbrella".
The Secretariat of Agrarian Development and its affiliate STU proactively sought ways to
promote the project and needs of its target population, and to achieve the State's strategic goals
for poor rural areas. The actual process, its success in integrating policies and programs,
whether it improved the allocation and impact of public expenditures on rural poverty and the

2.17 Component 2: Institutional Development (OP US$3.50 million, AF US$3.24 million,
7% and 6.5% of total estimated cost, respectively) financed technical assistance and training to
build capacity in implementing entities including the community associations, municipal
councils and the State Technical Unit (STU). Modest funding was also included under the
original project to support state institutional modernization related to poverty reduction
programs and policies following a similar, successful activity under the previous project as part
of the wider Bank/State dialogue. Activities were mainly training and information technology
and equipment.

2.18      This    component     financed     about   600      diverse  training   events   for
associations/beneficiaries, consultants, partner agencies, the Municipal Councils and the STU
itself, of which about 500 events were conducted during the Additional Financing phase.

2.19    Total cost of the component was US$3.50 million under the original project (106% of
appraisal estimate) and US$3.16 million under the Additional Financing (75% of appraisal).

2.20     Greater pro-activity in designing and delivering training was an important product of
the state's restructuring of the project framework following the State Government's changeover
in 2006. Renewed focus was put on the São José Agrário portion of the State's rural strategy
which concentrated activities on land reform settlements in partnership with NGOs/other groups,
and on Sao José Social focusing on indigenous and Quilombola groups, artisanal fishing

of project-financed studies and important adjustments were made to project implementation as a
direct result. Studies by the University of Ben Gurion (Israel) and by the Federal University of
Ceará were designed specifically to foster the STU's understanding of project norms, strategies
and targets under each phase, and including Bank safeguards. 39 See table below.

2.22    Component 3: Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (OP
US$1.50 million, AF US$2.16 million, 3% and 4.3% of total estimated project cost,
respectively) financed the costs (excluding salaries) of project administration and coordination
including supervision, monitoring and impact evaluation.

2.23     This component financed the incremental costs of project administration, supervision,
monitoring and evaluation. Total component cost under both phases of the project was
significantly less than estimated at appraisal: 70% of estimate for the original project and 41%
of the Additional Financing estimate. Performance results are shown in Table below:

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

3.1     This analysis is based on data and information provided by a study conducted by the
Project's State Technical Unit (COPPE), Projeto de Desenvolvimento Rural Sustentável ­
Estudo de Casos (Fortaleza, June 2009) utilizing data collected at end-2007.41 Main findings of
the study are attached as an appendix.

3.2      From 2002 to end-2007, the Project financed 2,477 community subprojects, benefitting
151,634 families, distributed over 177 municipalities. Some 65.6% and 23.7% respectively of
the total number of financed subprojects at that time were drinking water supply and rural
electrification which, in aggregate, accounted for 89.3% of the total subprojects and 89.1% of
all beneficiary families. At that time, some 10.7% were productive subprojects and 0.04% social.
For this reason, data and information for this exercise were collected from a sample of water
supply, rural electrification and productive subprojects.

3.3      The main aggregate performance indicators, for water supply and rural electrification
subprojects, are summarized in Table 1. The methodology applied for economic and financial
analyses was the traditional estimation of the investment and benefit net present value, from
which the benefit/cost ratio was calculated. From the streams of investment and benefits,
Internal Rates of Return were calculated, along with the number of years needed to recover the
investments. The cost data were obtained directly from the Project MIS, on an annual basis and
expressed in Reais. Benefits were identified for each type of subproject (see below) and
data/information collected from field visits and some from previous studies and expert
validation. The main results are shown in Table 2. Details on data collected from field visits and
additional features/results of the surveyed subprojects are shown in the Appendix to this
analysis.

3.4      The economic and financial estimates (IRR, NPV, B/C ratio) were based on streams
generated from the samples and expanded to the total number of water supply and rural
electrification subprojects, applying some sensitivity analyses to partially compensate for the
non-statistical representativeness of the samples. On the other hand, for the four types of
productive subprojects no expansion was sought in view of the diversity and small number of
such type of subprojects in the universe. These are to be seen as demonstrative cases of
potentially successful productive investments (see Table 2 and Annex).

3.5      The field visits covered 20 sites for the selected subprojects (not all considered fully
satisfactory) but the sample cannot be considered statistically representative. There were no
control groups, which implies that the basic assumption is that if it were not for project
financing, communities interviewed would have had no access at all (i.e., using other sources)
to water and electricity 42 . In spite of these deficiencies, data and information used were
considered acceptable and "typical" in many aspects, in the judgment of specialists with
extensive knowledge of the field and these subprojects in Ceará. In order to compensate for
these deficiencies, very conservative (i.e. lower) estimates were used instead of those obtained
from field interviews. Even after using the lower estimates, a sensitivity analysis was done,


41
   This economic-financial analysis covers 2002-2007 because the relevant field data collection occurred in November 2007.
Implementation continued through end-June 2009. The additional subprojects financed, from January 2008 to June 2009, did not
significantly change the relative distribution of types of subprojects: water supply and rural electricity remained the most frequently
financed subprojects.

42
  This is a reasonable assumption given the relatively large span of years between the foundation of the community associations and
the date the financing of subprojects was obtained. For details, see appendix.



                                                                 39
assuming the actual costs were 10% higher and, simultaneously, benefits were 10% lower. An
additional analysis consisted of estimating economic and financial returns from the investment
stream for all types of subprojects against the return stream for water supply plus rural
electrification alone (see Table 2).

3.6     The time horizon used was 10 years, which was estimated to be consistent with the
expected useful life of the investments. For the calculation of net present value of the streams of
costs and benefits a discount rate of 10% was used.

3.7    Cost figures used in the analysis were obtained from the Project's MIS include
investment costs financed by the World Bank, counterpart funding provided by the State of
Ceará plus contribution from beneficiaries43. These costs were distributed according to annual
payments made by the Project Technical Unit to the beneficiary associations.

3.8     The identified benefits from the water supply subprojects were: (i) savings on time for
water collection; (ii) savings derived from reduction of waterborne diseases; and (iii)
willingness to pay, which is a proxy for the value families attribute to the availability of water.
As such it incorporates the effect of missing or unmeasured benefits such as comfort, wellbeing
and others. It was measured using the average payment made by families for the water they
receive from the project.

3.9     For the electricity subprojects, the identified benefits were: (i) additional employment
opportunities generated by new industrial and commercial initiatives; and (ii) income generated
by adults who benefitted from night schooling made possible by electricity availability.

3.10     For the productive subprojects, benefits were measured based on the net revenue of the
resulting production. Details of the measurement of all these identified benefits are presented in
Table 2 below.

3.11     The results shown in Table 2 are encouraging: the benefit cost/ratio is 1.42 for water
supply and 1.23 for electricity subprojects even considering the limited number of measured
benefits for both types of subproject. The associated IRRs vary, from 13% for rural
electrification to 18% for water supply. The number of years to recover the investment for these
types of investments is in the range of 6.2 to 8.4 years, therefore lower than the 10-year horizon
used in the analyses.

3.12     In regard to the productive subprojects, the results are clearly mixed: while stone
grinding and cashew nut production are economically and financially sustainable, the same
cannot be said with respect to hammock production, which is clearly unsustainable as currently
conducted, while small irrigation schemes barely reach an IRR of 10%. Both, however, have
room for improvement by means of adoption of better production and business plans (including
insertion in market opportunities).

3.13     The most interesting results are obtained when calculations are made for the whole
project, i.e. when the total number of financed subprojects are taken into account. Four
alternative estimates were done (see footnotes Table 2), the most restrictive one being
alternative 4, whereas the total investment costs (i.e, for all types of subprojects funded by the
Project) are charged and, on the other side, only benefits from water supply and rural electricity
are considered with an additional reduction of 10% in these benefits. Even under such restrictive
assumptions, the IRR is positive and equal to 10%, which compares with the current alternative
market rate (SELIC) of 11.25%. Sensitivity analyses performed, by assuming costs that are 10%

43
  The inclusion of beneficiary contribution increases the total investments therefore contributing to more
conservative estimates of economic and financial returns.



                                                   40
higher and benefits 10% lower, demonstrate what could be considered the most likely result: the
benefit/cost ratio is around 1.16 and the rate of return approximately 11%.

3.14     For the single types of subprojects, the number of years to fully recover the investment
in all cases is lower than 10 years, except as observed in the case of hammock production.

3.15     Fiscal Impact: Some limited evidence of fiscal impact can be estimated on the basis of
the collected data and come from three sources: (i) sales tax collected by the State on home
appliances bought by beneficiaries as electricity became available; (ii) savings derived from
management of the water supply systems by beneficiaries instead of municipality and/or state;
and (iii) the net benefit of water supply plus rural electrification subprojects, net of the cost of
all subprojects. These sources provide, in a period of 10 years, income and savings which may
reach as high as 94% of the total amount invested in the financing of all subprojects (R$223.3
million).

3.16    The conclusion that can be drawn from the simulations, even under very strict
assumptions, is that community investment subprojects pay off given current conditions in
Brazil, except in some cases of productive subprojects but even here, the solutions to better
performance are known and need to be applied.

Appendix 1: Background to Economic Analysis

1.1     The São José II project, during its operational period from 2002 to June 2009, has been a
fundamental instrument for further consolidating the participatory decision-making process for
access to basic investments in infrastructure ­ notably rural electrification and water supply.

1.2      Up to end-2007, the São José II project financed 2,477 community subprojects benefiting
151,634 families (about 622,000 people), distributed in 177 municipalities. Of these, 586 were
rural electrification benefiting directly some 18,453 families, and 1,624 water supply subprojects
benefiting 116,716 families (about 479,000 people). The remaining 267 subprojects were 264
productive investments benefiting 16,266 families (67,000 people) and 3 social subprojects (not
included in the sample).

1.3      The case study approach was adopted, taking into account the main types of subprojects
and the communities and associations making the demands, executing and operating the
investments financed. This analysis opted for a sample of subprojects compatible with the
distribution profile of subprojects financed and representative of the universe of project activities.
Three reasons are valid for expanding the application of results obtained from the study to a more
representative universe: (i) apparent homogeneity of the units comprising the universe by type of
subproject; (ii) the intentional decision by the Project State Technical Unit (STU) to include in
the samples cases of subprojects considered moderately successful and "typical"; and (iii)
communities with subprojects comprising the samples should be relatively dispersed
geographically.

1.4    Based on these directives, the STU selected 20 subprojects/communities for analysis
whose relationship is presented in Annex 2 and distributed as follows:

A technical team from the STU conducted the field survey/research from November 1-20, 2007,
interviewing beneficiaries, leaders of community associations, and people who knew about the
subprojects, and their histories. Questionnaires were used, one for each type of subproject
studied, with questions permitting variously, open or closed responses. To complement this
information, some researchers returned to the field in December.

Rural Electrification:

1.5     The communities analyzed average 35.6 families residing in an average 36.6 house-holds.
The communities are located on average 24 km from the municipal capital, and are considered
poor with an average IDH-M of about 0.622, ranging from 0.597 to 0.668. According to the
survey conducted, whose percentage incidence is shown below, communities vary considerably
in terms of the availability of and/or free access to, social and economic equipment/facilities.



44
Availability of basic social investments such as schools, health posts and water supply is still
seriously deficient.

                Social and Economic

           Churches                                  75.0%
           Health Post                               12.5%

The study showed that 62.5% of communities also had other subprojects financed by the Project.
However, data revealed that the majority of these associations demonstrated pro-activity in
seeking benefits for their communities.

1.6      Among the associations studied, 75% were founded prior to obtaining the financing for
their electricity subproject. Foundation dates ranged from 1996 to 2006 while their subprojects
were financed between 1996 and 2007. The average "wait", measured by the difference in years
between foundation of the association, and date of first financing of a rural electrification
subproject for 75% of the associations which already existed before the project, was about 7.6
years. Once again, evidence does not corroborate the frequent comment that the associations are
formed exclusively to access/receive project financing. Even if they were, Brazilian law requires
such organization prior to accessing the benefits of any public program, not just the Bank-
supported project.

1.7     The associations have an average cohort of 41.9 active members varying from 15-90, an
average superior to the number of families (35.6), showing that there are families with more than
one member being part of the association.

Factors contributing to obtaining a rural electrification subproject:

1.8     There were various factors understood by those interviewed as having contributed
positively to the project: (i) active leadership from the community combined with the influence of
local political figures (75%); (ii) in 50% of cases studied there was strong mobilization of the
community once they became aware that they could access financing; and (iii) Municipal
Councils prioritized certain kinds of investments (37.5%).

Characteristics of subprojects:

1.9      Main characteristics of subprojects are summarized as follows:

      Average extension of the high tension lines                     2.1 km

              (There were cases where the association did
              not consider the project to be operating
              normally because demand for energy for
              industrial use had not yet been attended to).

     Social capital of communities benefited with electrification subprojects:

1.10    Communities and their respective associations, even before the execution of subprojects,
were already maintaining a relatively high level of interaction between members through
participation in meetings. In 67.5% of cases analyzed, meetings were still being held with the
same regularity as previously. In 25% of cases, members actually started to meet even more
regularly, once a month; in only 7.5% of cases, members met regularly every three months, or
whenever necessary.

1.11    Those interviewed judged, in 50% of communities, that their members became more
active at meetings after subproject installation, although the actual level of participation did not
increase in 37.5% of cases studied. For 12.5% of cases, participation diminished after their
objective was achieved. The active participation of beneficiaries, even prior to the
implementation of their subproject, was evident in that 62.5% of associations analyzed had
obtained financing for some other form of investment (infrastructure, productive and/or social).

1.12    In terms of the degree of confidence in the community, it was detected that after
implementation of their subproject: (i) 50% of interviewees showed the conviction that residents
degree of confidence had increased in relation to their association and their leaders; 37.5%
maintained the same degree of confidence and of the remaining 12.5% showed a decline in
confidence; (ii) 50% of communities considered that it had become easier to get the support of
fellow members to resolve community problems, while 25% affirmed that they were always

46
present; only 12.5% said that their fellow members never contributed and the remaining 12.5%
considered that it had become more difficult to get the support/contribution of members once the
target of getting electricity was achieved.

Economic and financial analysis:

1.13    Considering that each rural electrification subproject generated on average 3.4 new jobs
and there were 586 implemented, there were an estimated 1,992 new jobs created. Also, taking
into account that the growth in income was about R$150.00 monthly per new job, it can be
concluded that there was an annual increase in income valued at about R$3.6 million.

1.14     In 50% of cases, community schools began to offer night school with literacy courses
benefiting an average 20 adults per class or, that 10 per community benefited with a projected
total of 5,900 adult students. Supposing that this skill implied adding 20% to the minimum salary
governing a person's income, total income gains were an estimated R$5.38 million.

Water Supply Systems:

1.15    Characteristics of the communities: The communities benefited demonstrated that they
were effectively among the municipalities with relatively low IDH-M (2000): 0.660 on average,
varying between 0.607 a 0.721. It should be noted that in the municipalities with higher IDH,
communities are located at distances of 40 to 67 km from the center/capital. The population of the
communities ranges from 17-110 families with an average of about 62. The tendency is, for the
most part, to have one family per household. There are cases, as in the Community of Poço da
Pedra, where more than one family lives in a house (1.2 families/home). The communities studied
were situated at a distance averaging 44 km from the municipal center, with extremes ranging
from 15 to 125 km, without access to municipal water supply systems.

1.16     Eleven communities were in the process of organization and were represented by their
respective association. The water supply subproject results from an effort launched a long time
ago. In 50% of cases analyzed the institutionalization of the associations preceded by more than
10 years, their obtaining the water supply subproject. However, in 12.5% of cases, the association
was established to obtain the water supply investment. This is not to say that other
communities/associations had not obtained other benefits/investments from other sources, and
from the project itself, before the project-supported water supply. In 37.5% of cases, the project
itself had financed other subprojects, 25% of which were electrification and 12.5% were reservoir
recuperation, before the water supply investments.

1.17    Analysis of the organizational and participatory life of the communities revealed that the
numbers of active association members represented a significant fraction of the population,
averaging 61% and ranging from 21% to 129% (possible when more than one member of a
family is a member). The percentage participation does not correlate with the community
population size or with municipal IDH-M, suggesting that it depends on other factors such as the
degree of commitment of local leaders, and level of information available.

1.18     The precedence of electricity over water supply is worth noting. In 100% of cases
analyzed, the communities had electricity before the water supply subproject. This might reflect:
(i) greater priority from communities for the benefits of electricity; and/or (ii) energy is
recognized as a pre-condition for making water supply systems effective (pumps etc); and/or (iii)
greater ease in obtaining financing electricity than water supply.


47
1.19    Communities studied did not possess much economic and social infrastructure, besides
water supply. There was still a lack of fundamental social facilities such as schools and health
posts. Only 62.5% had a school and none had health facilities.

1.20    According to beneficiaries interviewed, the factors which contributed most to obtaining a
subproject were quite diverse: initial guidance from political local leaders; knowledge acquired
from implementation of similar subprojects in other communities; and, commitment of the
Municipal Councils to community development. Detailed factors contributing to obtaining a
subproject are tabled below:

 Commitment of the Municipal Council to developing our community                 62.5

1.21    Accumulated social capital in the communities can be seen in two other instances: (i) in
100% of cases, the decision to choose the particular subproject occurred at an assembly, with
ample participation of beneficiaries; and (ii) within the Municipal Councils, the decision was
taken by vote of the Council members.

Characteristics of the subprojects

1.22    In all cases analyzed, water supply systems were classified as complete, that is, with
household connection. Water capture from ground water sources predominated (75%) with
capture being mostly through the drilling of wells. In 62.5% of communities the subproject did
not benefit all residences. An average 44.5% of households per community were connected,
leaving an average 10.3 households to be connected. On average, 1.3 houses were built after
implementation of the subproject. In only 12.5% of communities was the use of the water
intended for commercial purposes.

Beneficiaries

1.23    Water supply subprojects benefited directly, on average, about 72 families per
community. In total, 1,624 such subprojects were implemented, benefiting about 116,716 families.
In 100% of cases, the communities benefited participated in the financing of systems, basically in
the form of manual labor, although in some cases, the mayor also shared the cost. In 100% of
cases the associations relied on technical assistance for subproject preparation, whether through
consultants contracted by the association (50% of cases), or through the mayor's office (37.5%).
In 12.5% of cases, the associations were unable to respond.

Execution, Operation and Maintenance of Subprojects

1.24    In 100% of cases, associations opted to contract firms to execute their subprojects. This
number is not surprising, bearing in mind the need for specialized services such as drilling of
wells and construction of elevated reservoirs.


48
1.25    The cases analyzed confirm that the water supply systems financed by the project are
operated and maintained by the beneficiaries. In 87.5% of cases, beneficiary families were
paying a user fee which varied from R$6.00 to R$11.50 per month/family. In terms of arrears,
only one community reached 10%.

1.26    Completed systems tend to be an employment alternative for some members of the
community. The research showed that 67.5% of the communities operated their own systems.
Each community has one member occupied in each system. Assuming an error of 10% from the
average, it is estimated that between 960 and 1,160 persons are occupied with operation and
maintenance of all systems financed by the project, administered directly by the associations.
Besides those administered by associations, there are other systems administered directly by
SISAR, which also maintains people to operate the applicable systems in such a way that the
numbers above are probably under-estimated.

Principal Results of Subprojects

Water quality:

1.27    Systems studied are providing water of high quality in 100% of cases. Among these,
12.5% of the water is considered of good quality naturally, unpolluted and without need for
treatment. In 50% of communities the water is treated and in the other 37.5%, the community
intends to implement treatment via a fee-for-service arrangement.

Coverage and capacity of the systems:

1.28     In 25% of communities, the system is reaching all residences. In general, 83.6% of
households are connected to the networks, 14.6% are not connected, and 1.9% were constructed
after the project was implemented. In 100% of cases, interviewees confirmed that the systems
implemented have capacity to attend/benefit all households in the communities.

Interdependence of investments:

1.29     In all cases analyzed, water supply systems were installed after the installation of
electricity. Data confirm that, except in exceptional conditions, water supply systems depend on
the availability of electrical energy.

Water usage:

1.30    The water is destined principally for human and domestic consumption. In a majority of
cases (87.5%), the water is also being used for animal consumption and 12.5% to attend to the
needs of commercial installations. Some cases were identified in which the water provided by the
systems is used for the irrigated production of fruits and vegetables on an individual basis.

Transformations and changes brought by water supply subprojects:

1.31     Before the subproject, communities relied on precarious sources for water: public dams,
private reservoirs, mines, public water trucks, rivers, and streams. Data on such usage is shown
below:



49
                            Water Source              Frequency %
                            Public dam                    37.5
                            Private dams                  37.5
                            Mines                         12.5
                            Water trucks                  12.5
                            River, stream                 12.5
                            Other                         37.5

Distance of fixed water sources:

1.32     Fixed sources can be at a distance of up to 2.4 km from the location of residences,
demanding time and costs to obtain the water. However, the majority of fixed sources are
situated at a distance of around 500 m.

Quality of water sources:

1.33    Quality of water from distinct alternative sources was considered good in 62.5% of cases
(mines, rivers and reservoirs), regular in 25% (private dams) and the remaining 22.5% were
considered unsatisfactory.

Time savings:

1.34    Another important transformation from water supply installation has been the time
savings and improved wellbeing of families who no longer have to walk long distances carrying
large volumes of water. Some 35 members of the community, on average, carry water for an
average of 3.5 hours per day. This is time taken away from other activities: domestic duties,
agricultural activities and rest; for young people, school tasks and play. With an error of about
10%, it is estimated that between 50,000 and 60,000 persons were dedicating 3.5 hours daily to
finding water in all communities subsequently benefited with water. Considering only the adults
(40%) and estimating only 50% working, there was an estimated economy of 2.2 million
equivalent work days per year. At the current daily work rate of a rural laborer (R$7) and that this
50% would have been working if they had not been collecting water, the time savings in
employment terms would be equivalent to something like R$15.4 million per year.

Capacity of installed systems:

1.35    According to beneficiaries interviewed, water systems in drought periods were sufficient
in 87.5% of cases to attend at least the water supply needs of humans and animals. Some 12.5%
required supplementary water via public water truck during the dry season (four months per year).
Even with these systems, 25% were considered sufficient to attend to small individual irrigation
schemes.

Impact on the reduction of water-borne illness:

1.36     Evidence from beneficiaries indicates that some of the most common illnesses
experienced before the subproject were diarrhea, parasites and dengue fever. Interviews revealed
a reduction of 35% in the incidence of these illnesses, mainly in children. It should be noted that
dengue is not a disease transmitted directly by water and thus its incidence would not be
significantly impacted by water supply subprojects.



50
Impact on commercial and industrial initiatives:

1.37     Due to the relatively short period between the conclusion of the subprojects studied and
the actual study itself (average 6 months), only a modest increase was noted in
productive/entrepreneurial ventures. In only one-quarter of cases studied (electricity/water), were
luncheon stalls, milk chilling facilities and small-scale irrigated agriculture operations detected
as a direct result.

Social capital development:

        Interviews revealed that the subprojects resulted in communities' greater sense of
        ownership/belonging, expanding their sense of confidence among their neighbors:

        Association members, following implementation of the subproject, in 87.5% of cases
        started to meet more regularly and 12.5% maintained the same regularity as before. This
        suggests the liveliness of associative activity following the conclusion of subprojects.

        The level of engagement of members in actions promoted by the associations reveals a
        positive trend. After installation of the subproject, members were more active in 87.5%
        of cases and about the same in 12.5%.

        Some associations did not limit their activities just to the Project. Even before subproject
        installation, 37.5% of associations had already conducted actions benefiting the
        community including with non-project resources. Such activities included: housing
        renovation; construction of cisterns, acquisition of tractors; rural electrification and
        community telephone services.

        After execution of the subproject, 37.5% obtained financing for other community
        investments among which were housing improvements and planting of fruit trees. This
        suggests that the subprojects promote new community initiatives.

        In 87.5% of cases, the participation of members in solving community problems became
        easier. In 12.5% the situation remained the same but members always contributed to
        finding solutions.

        All communities surveyed revealed that they had stated to act with more confidence in
        their efforts to present new demands to public agencies and resulting negotiations with
        those bodies.

Economic and financial analysis:

1.38     Completed systems have become direct (albeit limited) sources of employment and
income for community members: research revealed that 67.5% of communities operate their own
systems, each subproject occupying one person full-time. With an error of 10% it is estimated
that in total, between 960 and 1,160 persons are occupied with the O&M of all completed systems
financed. If each person receives one-half a minimum salary, there will be an aggregate gain in
income of R$2.874 million. However, since these resources come from the communities
themselves through O&M user fees, the impact is canceled out in terms of income generation.




51
1.39   There was a reduction in water-borne sickness, potentially increasing the productivity of
workers. Some 35 persons per community on average, were benefited by reduced disease. If just
one useful day is gained per month per beneficiary, with the daily wage rate at R$7.00, there
would be an annual incremental gain of R$4.77 m.

Productive subprojects

1.40     The project financed a relatively small number of productive subprojects but with
significant and sustainable capacity to generate income and productive employment. The first
productive experiences demonstrated potential viability including honey, irrigated agriculture,
cashew processing, craftwork and specific cases such as stone grinding (masonry).

1.41    The project financed 264 productive investments of which four were studied for this
appendix: hammock-making in the Community of Mocotó in Várzea Alegre Municipality;
cashew processing in Barreira Municipality; irrigated agriculture in Quixeramobim (Vale do
Forquilha community); and stone grinding (masonry) in the Várzea da Onça community, in
Quixadá Municipality. All communities studied have a school, 50% have a health post and 50% a
community center. The average IDH of these municipalities is 0.641, ranging from 0.619 to 0.673.

1.42     In all cases, the subprojects comprise the purchase of equipment. Half included building
of infrastructure. In only one of the four examples was training provided to beneficiaries and in
three cases, beneficiaries received support for the purchase of materials.

1.43    In only one case was a business plan prepared for the subproject, and it was prepared by
the community itself. All cases received help from outside entities, mainly SEBRAE, SDA and
for two cases, the Bank of Northeast Brazil.

1.44    Beneficiary associations grouped together persons with common interests, averaging 70
beneficiaries per community, generating an average 157 additional jobs. In all cases the
community association preceded the financing of the subproject. The average age of the
associations at the time subproject resources were released was about 13 years.

1.45     The motivation driving associations to seek financing stemmed from experiences with
activities they were already developing. All associations had already developed the activity in
question, considered a local tradition and vocation of association participants. These
characteristics contributed to the success of these activities even though only one association had
done a market study.

1.46    A brief economic/financial analysis of these productive subprojects is presented below.

(a) Stone-grinding (stone masonry):
Beneficiary Association: Associação Comunitária dos Exploradores de Pedras da Várzea da
Onça.
Community: Várzea da Onça
Municipality: Quixadá
Date of Agreement: 06/12/2006
Investment Value: R$ 119,460
Value Financed: R$ 107,514

       The community of Várzea da Onça, about 18 km from the municipal center of Quixadá
comprises 302 families which traditionally produced pebbles/flint stone manually and with low

52
returns. The subproject aimed to improve production through technological innovation and
expansion of local markets taking into account existing markets, the quantity of raw material
available in the region and the accumulated experience of the community. The Community
association has 17 members, direct beneficiaries of the initial investments. The investment of
R$119,460 generated 412 additional jobs, for community members. The investment was used to
acquire a grinder, drive belt, a vibrating screen and various other pieces of equipment.

        Gross returns in 2006 were about R$400,000, expenses for inputs that year totaled
R$200,000 resulting in a gross annual return of R$200,000. With a real increase in invoicing of
R$80,000 and of R$20,000 in inputs, the projected increase in gross income is R$60,000. Using
the hypothesis that the project life will be 10 years, the Internal Rate of Return is about 49.31%,
superior to the SELIC Rate which is currently 11.25%. The subproject payback period is a little
over two years. Considering a margin of security of 10% for gross receipts adjusted to R$72,000,
and expenditures adjusted to R$22,000, the gross result is equivalent to R$50,000 for 10 years,
and a new IRR of about 40.45% p.a., still superior to the SELIC Rate.

(b) Irrigated Agriculture

Beneficiary Association: Associação dos Produtores do Vale do São Bento
Community: Vale do São Bento
Municipality: Quixeramobim
Date of Agreement: 11/29/2006
Investment Value: R$ 109,872
Value Financed: R$ 98,885

         The subproject was prepared with the intention of recuperating damage caused by the
flooding of the Forquilha/São Bento Valley in January 2004. The community was already
practicing irrigated agriculture but the floods damaged their system, compromising production.
The community is located 43 km from the municipal center and has 22 families. The association
has 26 active members, 22 of which are occupied directly by the subproject. Initial investments
financed by the project were around R$ 109,872 and utilized to recuperate the irrigation system
and purchase plastic boxes to support marketing in regard to the delivery/transport of product.
The subproject benefited directly about 66 families with a tradition of irrigated fruit and vegetable
production. The subproject strengthened the unity and organization of producers, improved
quality of life and food. It generated employment and income because the community did not
have access to conventional credit lines. Due to this business, the community established a
confectionary plant and markets the products door to door.

        The investment was used to acquire drip irrigation tubing, micro aspersion equipment,
pipes and plastic boxes.

      Gross receipts in 2006 were around R$200,000. Expenses on inputs in the year totaled
R$25,000 producing an annual gross return of R$175,000. The increase in gross receipts was R$
50.000 and expenses on inputs was R$ 25,000 producing additional income of R$ 25.000.
Working with the hypothesis that the duration of the subproject is 6 years due to the nature of the
investments, the Internal Rate of Return is 10% p.a. and the payback period is over 4 years.




53
(c) Processing and Marketing of Cashew Nut

Beneficiary Association: Associação Comunitária de Barreira
Community: PA Rural Olaria
Municipality: Barreira
Date of Agreement: 06/12/2006
Investment Value: R$ 98,276
Value Financed: R$ 88,448

           The cashew processing subproject and expansion of physical structures of the old plant
was designed to respond to a long-standing complaint of the community which had worked for
over 16 years on the primary processing of the product, a low return activity. The objective of the
proposal was to market the cashew including for export and expand opportunities for employment
and income. The community is located 1 km from the municipal center and comprises 100
families. The subproject aimed to benefit 220 people and generate 10 additional jobs. Initial,
project-financed investments were about R$98,276 and used to renovate the building structure,
for the oven (estufa) and for packaging.

           Gross receipts in 2006 were about R$792,000. Expenditures on inputs and labor
totaled R$648,000 producing an annual return of R$144,000. Hypothesizing that the subproject
has a 5-year life, it shows an elevated IRR of about 145% p.a. The subproject payback period is
less than one year. Taking into account a reduction of 20% in gross returns as a margin of
security, the new IRR would be 115%, revealing that the investments made are relatively modest
when compared to the volumes transacted annually by the subproject.

(d) Marketing of Hammocks

Associação Beneficiada: Associação Comunitária de Mocotó
Community: Sítio do Mocotó
Municipality: Várzea Alegre
Date of Agreement: 06/12/2006
Investment Value: R$ 49,233
Value Financed: R$ 44,310

        The community of Mocotó is located 12km from the center of Várzea Alegre
Municipality, comprises 48 families and was first benefited with a hammock plant in 1989,
followed by a rural electrification subproject in 1998, tractor/equipment subproject in 2000 and
water supply investment in 2004. The subproject studied sought to increase the marketing of
hammocks by expanding the number of installations, and involves 36 members from four
communities in Várzea Alegre. Initial investments financed by the project were about R$ 49,234
and used to construct a factory building (shed, bathroom and storage depository) and purchase
seven electric machines.

        For the community, the subproject increased factory income by 20%, generated jobs for a
greater number of women and strengthened group cohesion.

        Gross receipts in 2007 were R$ 64,167. Expenses on inputs totaled R$ 59,197, providing
an annual gross result of just R$ 4,970. Monthly production of hammocks went from 50 to 150
following expansion of facilities, and the facility has most of its female workers participating in
various training courses in management, rural entrepreneurship, cooperative production and
marketing, seeking to make the enterprise ultimately more profitable.

54
        This production facility is a major advance in social terms and demonstrably sustainable
but the return on investment is very small. Its results so far - at least in the interim pending
practical results from training received - need to be evaluated from the standpoint of impact on
community organization, gender focus and the inclusion of persons with locomotion difficulties.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1      The project financed a comprehensive evaluation program combining baseline and final
impact evaluations, case/other studies, Physical Performance Studies and a final Borrower
Completion Report. Ceará was also included among the three Northeast states studied for the
quasi-experimental evaluation (Binswanger 2006). Beneficiary/stakeholder surveys using
standard, accepted methodologies were the basis for all evaluations/studies and control groups
were used in most cases (see below). The following summarizes findings of FECAMP (2005) and
ACEG (2009), as well as the quasi-experimental study coordinated by Binswanger et al. (2006).
A synthesis of case studies conducted in 2007 (SDA 2009) is included as background to the
economic analysis and appended to Annex 3. The Borrower Completion Report has been used as
a basic reference throughout the ICR. All documents listed in Annex 9 are held in Project files.

A. Baseline Evaluation (FECAMP 2005)

Methodology

5.2      The FECAMP (2005) baseline study in Ceará (the study also covered Pernambuco and
Bahia) covered 629 beneficiaries and a control group of 420 families (non-participants), using
smaller sub-samples for specific lines of enquiry. Total subprojects financed accounted for 44%
of the total volume of resources expended at the time, benefiting 40% of total families attended
by the project from 2002-2003. Interviews were conducted with representatives of Municipal
Councils, at least one representative of the association benefited by the subproject and at least two
beneficiary families/subprojects (total 629) and non-beneficiary families (420).

Results

5.3     The study confirmed that the project was reaching its intended beneficiaries. Analysis of
the conditions of beneficiary communities, where the majority lacked basic services such as water
and energy, and the socio-economic profile of beneficiaries, confirmed that the project was
reaching poor communities and extremely poor families. Adult education levels were low with
77% lacking any instruction. Average monthly income was R$499 with a high concentration of
families in the lowest income ranks. Even families with slightly higher incomes and who could
be considered outside poverty on income alone, remained poor based on unattended needs. The
study also noted the large number of minifundistas and under-capitalized settlements with few job
opportunities, and scant insertion in labor markets either rural or urban. Analysis of families'
food status also indicated that the subprojects studied were reaching poor families. In 2000 about
35% of beneficiaries were food-insecure and 27% were also suffering hunger.

5.4     The study also estimated the project's reach in terms of total rural poor, concluding that
on average, 60% of the poor population of each municipality was directly attended by the 1st and
2nd Rural Poverty Reduction Projects up to end-2003. 46 Not only in relative terms but also
absolute, this reach is high, since 70% of the state rural population is below the poverty line.




46
  This means the Rural Poverty Alleviation Project and follow-on Rural Poverty Reduction Project (subject of this
ICR).



57
Family Wellbeing

5.5     Case studies consistently indicated that the living conditions and family wellbeing of
beneficiaries improved markedly compared to control groups. Also, in general terms, the study
was able to capture the perception of interviewees in regard to the project's impact on quality of
life and their families in the period from 2000 (before implementation of their subprojects) and
2003. About 86% of beneficiaries stated that the project had improved their quality of life,
stating in order of importance: (i) impact on family health; (ii) impacts on material living
standards (house, sanitation, durable goods); and (iii) impacts on food conditions. Among the
impacts on living conditions of beneficiaries of the main subprojects was the expansion of houses
with piped water supply (18% to 50%), electricity (62% to 90%), and septic tanks (42% to 51%).

5.6      Water supply. In regard to water supply (piped and cisterns), a sector in which the
project was strongly represented, analysis using PNAD data showed that significant progress had
been made in Ceará, an exceptionally dry state. Ceará was notable among the three states studied
for evolving rapidly from a precarious water situation to the best among the three. Improvements
from water supply and cisterns (representing 87% of all beneficiaries in Ceará at the time of
FECAMP's field surveys) frequently cited included: (i) better quality of water consumed (60%);
(ii) regularization of water supply (88%); (iii) reduced health problems in 88% of cases from not
having to carry heavy loads of water over distance; (iv) greater physical comfort of family
members (78%); (v) more time for leisure/other activities; (vi) reduced incidence of disease
(30%); and (vi) increased variety of foodstuffs (28%). About 20% of interviewees mentioned
improved production conditions. In the case of small scale dam subprojects, there was an
increase in agricultural production and herds, indicated by 21% and 36% of beneficiaries
respectively.

5.7      Electricity. In regard to electricity specifically, it should be noted that the previous
project (Rural Poverty Alleviation Project) had a strong impact on state indices of households
connected to electricity, contributing significantly to increasing the percentage of rural
households with electricity from 25% in 1995 (IBGE) to 63% in 2000 and 79% in 2003 (an
incremental 16% potentially attributable to the original project in its early stages). Some
examples of improvements brought by electricity were: (i) use of domestic appliances in 84% of
households sampled/surveyed permitting greater comfort, access to information and
diversification of food due to conservation options; (ii) use of kerosene lamps has been replaced
by public lighting with health benefits; (iii) increased real estate value of residences in 96% of
homes surveyed; (iv) the possibility of attending adult literacy classes at night, as 58% of
interviewees stated that their community had established a night school.

Income

5.8      Income results in FECAMP (2005) were positive but preliminary due to the relatively
short time elapsed since subproject implementation. Total average income grew faster in Ceará
than the other states, even though Ceará's state average was lowest at the outset. Average annual
nominal household income increased 40% from R$4,268 pre-project to R$5,999 (August 2003 -
July 2004). Average real household income rose 7% in the period. Average nominal income per
capita rose almost 40% and real per capita income 6%. Income from agricultural production rose
29%; from consumption of own production 53%; and from work off-farm 27%, in the period
Some 38% of respondents with infrastructure and productive investments reported better
household subsistence conditions. Considering just productive investments (primarily agricultural

58
mechanization), that figure rose to 56%, attributed to better incomes resulting from subproject
implementation.

5.9     The results of productive subprojects surveyed were also mostly positive and pertain to
medium-term impacts because the sample selected for this part of the analysis was of subprojects
implemented under the previous, Rural Poverty Alleviation Project. In the case of agricultural
mechanization subprojects, agricultural production increased for 57% of interviewees and 44%
indicated that the subproject promoted the creation of other productive activities. Such
subprojects showed increased income in 40% of households surveyed.

Social Capital

5.10    Besides the direct effects on living conditions, beneficiaries also cited various factors
which indicated a positive impact on social capital. Some 93% of interviewees agreed that the
project was good for the community and 82% indicated that the subproject was what the
community needed, demonstrating consistency between desires and the decision about the
subproject. In addition, 70% of beneficiaries agreed that their community was now meeting to try
and get additional improvements, and 70% and 60% respectively indicated that the project
prompted the participation of residents at association meetings during and after subproject
implementation.

5.11    The positive influence of the project on the associations was noted by the study, which
indicated that 60% of them were created via the influence of the project which served as a
stimulus for community organization, as cited by 60% of community leaders which indicated that
an additional motivation to form the association was to organize the community. Community
leaders were cited in 65% of cases as the main figures in association formation, and in second
place were cited union leaders, municipal representatives and mayors.

5.12     Certain data revealed important characteristics about associations such as the fact that
65% of them had their own center/premises, and that 28% of these used their own resources to
construct it. Besides this, 64% of associations which received subprojects requiring maintenance
collect fees from members for this purpose. Another interesting aspect is the formation of
associative networks: about 43% of the associations interviewed declared that they had
links/relationships with other associations and 35% were conducting a joint activity in recent
years. These results indicated a very positive aspect related to sustainability and the good
functioning of these associations, especially due to the high cost for these communities in having
to travel in rural areas (to participate in meetings), as well as to capture resources.

5.13    Municipal Councils. Over 50% of communities said that the Councils were an advance
in representing community interests and 44% said that these functioned as a source of information
about subprojects. The Councils contributed to better information dissemination between
communities, thereby reducing the bias provoked by the asymmetry of information and
"privileged" access to relevant information. However, the results demonstrated that this work of
the Councils was already being done, even though the study showed that Councils could further
improve in this area. In addition, the study revealed that criteria used by the Councils to approve
subprojects were compatible with project objectives, indicating that the three main priorities for
approval were, that the community be among the neediest, that the subproject benefit the greatest
number of people possible, and the overall level of poverty in the community.

5.14    In regard to the general functioning of the project, the study concluded that: (i) its
principal rules - transparency, participation, and governance - were being followed; (ii)

participants knew the rules and contributed to ensuring they were followed; and (iii) attempts to
deviate from those rules were easily identified and repelled, by the community itself.

B. Quasi-experimental Impact Study (Binswanger, 2009)

Methodology

5.15     Research covered 864 households in 108 communities and 90 municipalities, with half
comprising project beneficiaries and half a group of control communities in the Northeast States
of Ceará, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte. The sample in each state was 18 treatment and 18
control communities. The study was based on data on the current situation in 2005 (when field
research was done) compared to 2002, the latter using recall, i.e., questions asked in 2005 on
subjects' previous situation. 47 The control group was selected from communities which had
requested and been awarded subprojects but where the subprojects had either not yet been
implemented or had been implemented only a short time before the field research. The treatment
group consisted of communities with subprojects approved in the first year of the original project,
i.e., 2002. Various methods were used to reduce selection bias.

5.16     Analysis showed that the treatment groups were a little better off than the control group
in the period before project execution in 2002. Level of education of household heads, access to
electricity, home ownership, and total value of electrical appliances, agricultural tools and
animals, were higher for the treatment group. Since the control group was selected from among
then-recent project beneficiaries, it was concluded that the program, already reaching poor
communities in 2002, was constantly improving its focus on poor communities over time.
Communities receiving subprojects later were worse off in terms of infrastructure, education,
access to health clinics, and certain kinds of household assets.

Household assets

5.17     The study assessed the accumulation of per capita household assets and found positive
effects for all models estimated, although none of the coefficients associated with the treatment
group were statistically significant. Several reasons were suggested: a rise in income of families
living in poverty is probably consumed rather than invested, so measuring only the impact on
assets would not reflect the project's real effect on income; the sample size was relatively small
for measuring small increases in capital; and, measuring recall data can generate errors and wide
variations. Further study was recommended utilizing the FECAMP (2005) sample since sufficient
time would have passed for income and capital effects to emerge from subprojects financed in
2004. For electrical appliances and agricultural equipment, a statistically significant impact was
found in Ceará. Although most subprojects involved water supply, there was a larger variation in
those assets for households benefiting from the project.




47
  The option of returning to the FECAMP (2005) treatment and control groups was rejected because FECAMP included only
subprojects implemented between the end of 2003 and 2004 so that the period between implementation and impact assessment was
too short to provide results on medium- and long-term impact.



60
Family wellbeing

5.18     Results were as follows:

(a) The evaluation reported access to water supply rising from 31% to 43% from 2002-2005
among its surveyed cohorts, improved housing conditions, electricity access increasing from 80%
to 89%, and household assets up substantially.

(b) Results showed that in communities with access to the project, a greater proportion of
families had access to water compared to the control group. Further, in Ceará, the absolute
number of water supply subprojects was highest.

(c) There was significant improvement in health: infant mortality fell by 38% and the incidence
of diarrhea fell by 70%. Other diseases ­ Chagas disease, asthma, hepatitis and dengue - all
declined sharply among beneficiaries in the period. 48

(d) In communities with access to the project, a greater portion of beneficiary communities had
access to electricity than the control group.

Social capital

5.19     Binswanger et al. interviewed municipal, community and household subjects to assess the
project's social capital formation capacity, with important results, as presented below:

Associations:

(a) Results ranging from 83% to as high as 98% were obtained for indicators such as the growth
in institutional capacity of community associations since 2002, sustainability of community
subprojects, and better results than purely "supply-driven" development, at lower cost.

(b) Stakeholders interviewed pointed to the sustainability of most community subprojects and
strong social impact on strengthening community associations, improving quality of life, and
increasing rural family income.

(c) Levels of community participation in associations, collective decision-making and collective
activities had grown. Community associations (and Municipal Councils) were viewed as
inclusive, participatory and democratic institutions where decisions were made by the majority.

(d) Associations' institutional capacity to represent the community and resolve its problems was
rated highly, and the associations were seen as influential in community life, and selected
democratically (91% of respondents).

(e) Importantly, associations' growing strength and role in the Municipal Councils had markedly
changed relations between rural communities and State authorities as measured by the rise in
municipal authorities' responsiveness to community demands.

 See Rural Poverty Reduction in Northeast Brazil - An Evaluation of Community-driven Development. Binswanger, Amazonas,
Barbosa, Costa, Menezes, Pazello and Romano, World Bank, 2009.



61
(f) Households surveyed expressed respect for their association which is linked among most
interviewed with a growth in trust, solidarity, cooperation and participation in collective activities.

(g) At the household level, levels of formal and genuine participation of beneficiaries in
identifying local priorities and selecting the appropriate community action are high. Consistent
with this, rates of satisfaction with the actual demand of respective communities and the actual
investment implemented, are equally high.

(h) Ratings above 80% were recorded for items such as associations' capacity to bring
subprojects that benefit the community, represent community's interests, promoting collaboration
between communities, strengthening ties of friendship between residents, and participation in the
meeting to select the investment.

5.20    In summary, Binswanger et al. (2006) view the scale of measured changes in social
capital as signaling a process of intensive growth in the stock of social capital and that the
Northeast projects are having a massive influence on this. After implementation of subprojects,
social capital continues to grow but at a slower pace. The effects of setting the process in motion
are long-lasting. The projects' influence is through the use of new, specific forms of institutional
arrangements to help communities become more active, to engage them in inter-community
collaboration networks, and to transform their relations with the State from dependency to
partnership.

Municipalities:

5.21    Results are as follows:

(a) In 79% of municipalities, based on interviews with members of Municipal Councils, it was
felt that organization of communities had had positive effects on municipal administration, and in
81% it was believed that establishing the Councils had had the same effect.

(b) Even so, the use of the Councils as channels for providing information on the actions of the
municipal administration had not grown and remained around 12%.

(c) While a significant portion of Councils have become forums for discussing public policy and
other issues of community interest, most deliberation is restricted to the project itself and
PRONAF. In 35%, 36% and 45% of municipalities, Councils discuss other federal, state and
municipal programs, respectively. But in only 28%, 20% and 28% respectively, are Councils
forums for deliberation on those programs and their resources.

(d) The conclusion is that the Councils are still evolving as instruments for implementing public
policy and public accounting. However, the Councils have a critical role in representing poor
rural communities traditionally excluded from established channels for political representation.

5.22    All results indicate, with statistical significance and a high degree of confidence, that the
Northeast projects have a strong impact on social capital formation, derived from the creation of
associations and execution of subprojects.




62
C. Impact Evaluation (ACEG, 2009)

Methodology

5.23    The Associação Científica de Estudos Agrários (ACEG) of the Federal University of
Ceará sought to identify and measure impacts stemming from the subprojects, to determine their
impact on income and a range of other elements. The study also sought to determine the evolution
of income of beneficiaries originally studied by FECAMP in its Socio-economic Profile
(baseline) study of 2004. ACEG (2009) applied questionnaires divided proportionally between
the project's three focus Areas, in 34 municipalities, and analyzed two populations: a Treatment
Group comprising 98 subprojects (concluded August 2006 to June 2008), and a Control Group
representing 66 subprojects (approved August 2006 to December 2008) but either without
agreements signed, or with funds released but works not implemented. The study focused on
water supply, electricity and productive investments. 49 Case studies were also conducted of six
associations. Main results are summarized below.

Results:

5.24     The project was judged to be achieving the results expected for income generation, with
positive signals for income derived from crop and vegetable production, a variable affected
directly by productive subprojects. Project beneficiaries obtained an average annual income of
R$980.60 more than the Control Group. The study warns that results for productive subprojects
are only estimates.

5.25    Other improvements included physical capital, access to consumer goods, residential
conditions, and levels of social capital. Negligible values for health and services (education and
health) were seen to reflect the reality of rural areas - lack of efficient, effective social policies -
despite the massive investment in water supply. Also, as noted by the report, the health and
services variables utilized for the study involved activities extending well beyond those proposed
by the project. The report stresses the preliminary nature of these results.

5.26     Among the variables analyzed, positive and significant impacts were identified for
productive subprojects in the variables Income from Permanent Work and Income Obtained from
Crop and Vegetable Production, permitting conclusions about their economic importance to
beneficiaries. In regard to other variables, while impacts (ATT) were not as significant, they did
attribute favorable impacts to the project.

5.27     Water supply. Results show that owning land increased the probability that a family
would be a beneficiary of a water supply investment. Most variables showed positive for water
supply impact. While their effect per se on income is small (although they do contribute), there is
a tendency for consumption of own production to increase, which may indicate a better use of the
time released by not having to search for water and with positive signals for food security.
Results also show a substitution of temporary for permanent work and an increase in income from
crafts, also possibly the result of women having more time due to not having to fetch water.


49
  A series of indices were constructed and propensity score matching combined with qualitative observation used to
compare impact between groups, and the ATT (average treatment effect on treated) used to determine the effect of the
project on its beneficiaries.



63
5.28    These results prompt the conclusion that support given to these communities needs to be
complemented by policies which generate employment and income because the final goal of
water supply is essentially to improve access to water and thereby improve quality of life, i.e.,
their primary objective is not job creation/income. The statistically most significant changes
brought by water supply were on Consumer Goods and Social Capital.

5.29     Electricity. In a majority of variables, electricity was found to generate positive impacts.
Impact data for rural electrification show that access favors the acquisition of consumer goods -
especially domestic appliances - and has significant impact on income from crafts, income from
commercial activities and non-agricultural production, which are increased through the use of
electrical equipment providing productive alternatives.50 The ability to store food in refrigerators
has potential to change the eating habits of beneficiaries.

Total Income:

5.30      Looking at the three main types of investments, ACEG (2009) notes:

(a) While the greater impact on income in absolute terms was shown to be from rural
electrification, these income levels were even after the subproject the lowest of all three types.
While the average total income of beneficiaries of rural electrification grew from R$2,685 to
R$4,478, average incomes of water supply beneficiaries went from R$5,203 to R$5,209 and
average income from productive subprojects went from R$7,160 to R$8,070.

(b) Productive subprojects have impacts of greater magnitude than the others on income obtained
from the sale of crop and vegetable production, but the overall conclusion was that income from
other productive subprojects remained modest. The project alone is not sufficient to promote
structural change in the levels of employment and income.

(c) Electrification subprojects promote greater impact on total income and their impact is
extended to other variables.

(d) Water supply subprojects are not mechanisms for income generation. Their effects are more
notable on social variables (access to services, social capital, and access to consumer goods).

Conclusion:

5.31     Results are described as preliminary and do not yet show dramatic change. The reasons
cited are as follows:

(a) The period considered by the study was short and included a change of government (2006)
which split the context into two phases: a short phase with an intense concentration of subprojects
released in the period immediately pre- and post-election, which may have introduced a certain
flexibility in criteria for the selection of subprojects to be supported; and a second phase, which
followed the assumption of office by the new government and resulted in a slowing of the project,
re-definition of basic criteria, and priorities reflected most strongly after the period considered;


50
  This result contrasts with finding of the 2009 Physical Performance Review (Tecno Metrica) case studies that despite access to
energy, virtually no beneficiary interviewed owned electric equipment with potential for income generation, e.g., power tools and
sewing machines.



64
(b) All the communities studied were located in semi-arid areas, in municipalities which
historically have co-existed with population exodus, mostly male and young, heading for larger
urban centers. If these subprojects contribute to creating conditions which reduce the intensity of
this exodus or even reverse it, this is considered a positive impact because it would guarantee the
critical mass of many locales. If the project creates minimum conditions allowing people to stay
and/or return, it will have created conditions for alternative economic activities.




65
Results of ACEG Case Studies

5.32    ACEG (2009) also studied 18 agricultural mechanization (tractor and equipment)
subprojects financed by the project from 2002-2004. Results are summarized below.

5.33     Social capital: Results were broadly consistent with other studies. Surveys showed that
in 2009, communities already had many years of participating in community activities and most
were organized into associations. Most had experience of collective activities, social movements
and organization of community events. Most had not participated in any project prior to the
Bank-financed project. However, participation in associative bodies was not solely due to the
project. In regard to participation in choosing their subproject, they expressed a high degree of
participation: 75% in 2004 with 61% still actively engaged in 2009. There was a high incidence
of monthly meetings of associations: 83.3% in 2004 and 66.7% still meeting monthly by 2009.
High ratings were given to associations for promoting advances for communities, boosting them
politically in their efforts to secure benefits, improving communities' level of information about
their main problems, and facilitating their access to project benefits. In terms of communities'
insertion in their associations, interviewees mentioned participation in meetings and courses,
especially courses in leadership formation, association management and preparation and
management of subprojects.

5.34 Impact of Investment in Tractors: Beneficiaries in the six communities studied cited as
impacts of their tractor acquisition:

        access to plowing at an acceptable price, creation of employment and income for the
        community, and availability of the tractor at convenient times;

        timely planting of crops with less risk of crop failure;

        increased community participation in the association but some erosion in certain cases
        when members learned that they would be charged for tractor usage;

        increased productivity, area farmed, availability of transport for crops and water, i.e.,
        alternative uses for tractor, and reduced costs of soil preparation; and,

        increased monetary income of household from sale of increased production.

5.35     Despite these benefits, many families reported that the tractor did not change their
traditional farming methods and types of crops but did improve their production conditions,
comfort, and quality of life. Communities still noted an extensive list of deficiencies not affected
by the tractor and requiring resolution, e.g., access to credit and technical assistance.

5.36     Operation and Maintenance: Associations invariably charge community users a fee
ranging from R$40 to R$60 per hour and a higher fee of R$50 to R$70 per hour for non-members.
Some families felt these fees were too high. Resources are used to maintain the equipment, pay
the tractor operator (generally about 10-20% of the income from tractor rental), and to acquire
other community benefits such as wells. Communities commonly build quite substantial funds
from tractor rental.




66
D. Physical Performance Study (Tecno Metrica, 2009)

5.37     Tecno Metrica (2009) included a survey of 30 productive subprojects including manioc
mills, tractors, community processing facilities, fish farming, education and technical training.
Results included the following:

        Manioc mills registered comparatively low satisfaction indices averaging 37.8% due
        mainly to a lack of meaningful change in beneficiaries' incomes, job situation and hence
        community conditions. It should be noted that manioc mills are commonly regarded by
        project technicians as more a social investment than productive, designed to improve
        family/community subsistence.

        Tractor acquisition was evaluated positively, permitting timely planting, increasing area
        planted, creating employment and generating income, while also enabling communities to
        build quite substantial O&M funds from tractor rental fees (including from use by
        neighboring communities), often permitting them to make new investments.

        Satisfaction levels were positive for all other types of productive ventures surveyed.

        Tractor subprojects surveyed showed distinct variations in utilization based on the extent
        to which a community was able to develop collective production. In most cases,
        communities were well-organized, planting both individually and collectively, the latter
        including corn, sunflower and castor bean (mamona), the latter two with government crop
        purchase incentives for bio-diesel production. In some cases, the community was unable
        to organize collective activities or a regime for collective use of the equipment, indicating
        a need for technical support.

        While 70% of families considered their productive subproject was attending to the
        community's needs, under-utilization was observed, due variously, to lack of technical
        assistance, training, monitoring and/or strategic planning for the operational stage . This
        affected to varying degrees tractors, honey production facilities, and fish farming, and is a
        key lesson on the factors limiting a productive subproject's potential to create jobs and
        income.

        A separate survey by Tecno Metrica to define the main socio-economic characteristics of
        sampled families found that among the high proportion with electricity, most lacked any
        form of electrical equipment associated with income generation, e.g., sewing machine or
        electric tools, suggesting the need for a massive push to support professional training and
        capacity-building to exploit the accumulating infrastructure endowments of poor, rural
        communities.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

           A. Executive Summary: Borrower Completion Report (SDA/COPPE, 2009)

The Rural Poverty Reduction Project in the State of Ceará ­ PCPR ­ known as Projeto São José
(PSJ) was conceived as an instrument for implementing the State's local, sustainable
development activities with the active participation of communities, designed to increase the
access of the poorest rural populations to employment and income generating activities as well as
infrastructure, notably rural electrification and water supply, and basic social services, as a way of
reducing rural poverty.

Under its first phase, PSJ II operated through three general lines of action (PAC, FUMAC and
FUMAC-P), based on the level of organization of the Representative Entities. These lines also
represented the greater or lesser level of decentralization of project decision-making, with PAC
the least decentralized and the FUMAC-P the most. The PSJ under this first phase financed
1,423 subprojects, of which 1,250 were infrastructure, 218 productive and 2 were social,
benefiting a total of 1,170 communities and 90,146 families in 170 municipalities of the state.

PSJ II, since its preparation by the old SDR, passed through two institutional changes which had
an impact on its operations, mainly in regard to the development vision and structure of each
secretariat, and the project suffered from the effects of these changes.

The principal objective of SDLR was regional development through the strengthening of non-
agricultural activities in rural areas, especially around cities designated as development "polos".
This change by SDLR distanced the project from EMATERCE, which without doubt made the
development of productive subprojects more difficult because they were not a priority in this
period when efforts were directed towards infrastructure, mainly universal access to electricity
and water supply, a priority already foreshadowed in the Loan Agreement.

With the change of government at the beginning of 2007, the project came to be managed by the
Secretariat for Agrarian Development which took the path of greater attention to productive
initiatives following the strategy of the new government and aligning itself with the Sustainable
Rural Development Plan (PDRS).51 Greater priority was given to productive subprojects through
agreements with social movements and activities destined to promote pro-activity of less-assisted
communities such as Quilombolas and indigenous located in municipalities with lower IDS
(Social Development Index), and with less structured Councils, principally through training both
for the communities and for possible preparers of subprojects and including civil society, the
objective being to broaden the base of the Councils. Also, training for the STU provided by the
Bank, IICA and others, contracted to resolve specific needs, helped the STU to speed up the
process of assessing the feasibility of productive subprojects in the final stages of the project.

As a cross-cutting theme, environment was also prominent, in order to guarantee the compliance
of all technical and normative elements necessary to identify environmental impacts of
community subprojects and measures or actions needed to eliminate, control or minimize
undesirable or adverse impacts.

69
The second phase of the project ­ PSJ II phase II ­ initiated in June 2006 operated with just one
line of action, FUMAC. Under this phase, 1,192 subprojects were financed, of which 1,036 were
infrastructure, 155 were productive and one was social in 160 State municipalities. These
investments benefited 73,960 families in 989 communities.

Under this second phase, the PSJ also had additional financial resources of the State Treasury
which permitted the financing of an additional 317 subprojects of which 152 were infrastructure,
158 were productive and 7 were social benefiting another 295 communities and 21,355 families
in 107 municipalities. In this way, the PSJ II second phase benefited 95,315 families and 1,197
communities in 169 municipalities with 1,509 subprojects.

Leveraging

Within this context, the PSJ II attended 176 municipalities of the State of Ceará by financing
2,932 community subprojects, benefiting 185,461 families with total resources on the order of
US$105.0 million over the seven years of the project. Considering activities of other projects,
leveraged by the PSJ, such as Luz para Todos, an agreement with the Cisterns program and other
CAGECE actions, additional resources equivalent to 92% over and above the resources of the
Loan Agreement benefited the same target population.

Lessons Learned and Vivid Experiences

In a State which, despite advances, is still poor, with communities dispersed in locations difficult
to access, the project confirmed that prior activities of mobilization, support for organization and
training are conditions for these populations to have access to public policies such as the Sao Jose
Project, for example. In this manner, the inclusion of the poorest municipalities will only happen
with stronger institutional development activities. These activities are also important for the
communities to have a more precise idea of the type of support they should be requesting so that
actual investments are suitable for their real needs and potential. The possibility of linkages to
other sources of financing can deepen the potential impact of project results, such as those
verified under the agreement with FUNASA which integrated activities where previously actions
were parallel or at times, over-lapping.

Once the most basic infrastructure needs are overcome, and only after this, it is fundamental to
support subprojects which support local development by generating employment and income.
Productive subprojects are much more effective in their purpose/effectiveness if linked to a
logical development path. In this manner, interaction with social movements tends to improve
results. From the viewpoint of market access, priority should be given to subprojects which are
inserted in productive chains which are already consolidated.

Through experiences towards the end of the project, it was verified that, without interfering in the
autonomy of associations, it is possible to conduct procurement in a more efficient form with
support from modern procurement instruments available to the State, reducing the risks of
external interference. It is also important to advance in modern ways with greater affinity with
the characteristics of the proposed new operation to accelerate processes, as much by the STU as
by Bank technicians. Finally, project Monitoring and Evaluation needs to be internalized in such
a way that it can be a more effective instrument to correct and alter project management practices.
